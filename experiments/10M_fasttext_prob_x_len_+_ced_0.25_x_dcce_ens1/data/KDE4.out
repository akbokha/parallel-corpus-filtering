package &amp; package ; contains various modules for &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; . despite its small size they offer some extra functions and simplify the use of some functions by &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making this easier available .
more information about using &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual to &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
&quot; to load these modules in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; select settings extensions .... Open the card map tools and select the desired modules . &quot;
&quot; this is a list of default settings from the package k@@ de ; add @-@ ons . please note that maybe more modules are installed on your system , if you have installed additional software . &quot;
&quot; you should install the package k@@ de@@ base , the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; includes before you comp@@ ile this package . &quot;
&quot; to use the crash module , click in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; on extr@@ as . then you can view the page , the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; for crash , or the list of stor@@ my , if available . &quot;
&quot; the module is referred to as folder filter ( also folder filter ) in the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under extr@@ as filter , with the module you can filter &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s current working directory in different types . &quot;
&quot; to use the DO@@ M construction service in the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; then , choose extr@@ as DO@@ M @-@ tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M series . as default , the display starts with the root notes of the document , example : docum@@ ent@@ an element , all other knot@@ s are sub@@ elements of this root . &quot;
&quot; the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides a further view of objects with the M@@ IME @-@ type I@@ node / directory in local files . it can be used as an alternative for different symbols and text messages , in order to make the content of your local files@@ ystem . &quot;
&quot; the special feature of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists of it , w@@ asted folders with the help of a so @-@ called Tree @-@ Map graph@@ ically . tree @-@ maps allows the size of the size of objects in ag@@ ile structures . each object is portra@@ yed by a rect@@ angle of its size . this size has to possess the characteristic that the sum of sizes of the sub@@ ordin@@ ate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object . &quot;
&quot; at &amp; FS@@ View ; reflects the size of a file or folder , whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries . therefore , the size of the size of the entries is determined . accordingly , the size of the size of the file is determined . therefore , &amp; FS@@ View ; as a graphic and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command you can be viewed . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; FS@@ View ; it is an entry in the tre@@ ad representation , which represents a file or folder in your files@@ ystem . to easily navig@@ ate navigation have the right @-@ to @-@ use and validation settings . &quot;
&quot; the color of a rect@@ angle which is swit@@ ched over view colour mode , can either be depth of light detection of the sc@@ ach@@ ute or figure of a different file name as name , owner , group or M@@ IME @-@ type . &quot;
&quot; a rect@@ angle can be displayed with the various characteristics of the appropriate file or folder . for each property you can define whether they are displayed at all , only when enough space to display is present or if the surface of sub@@ ordin@@ ate rect@@ angles may occur . furthermore , you can define the relative position of the label in the rect@@ angle . &quot;
&quot; with Dar@@ stell@@ ations algorith@@ ms for tre@@ em@@ aps , the surface should not always be kept . it will not always be maintained to determine the cas@@ ing of the entries , and this frame need space , which if the sub@@ ordin@@ ate entries are no longer available . note that less space is lost for the frame when the rect@@ angle quad@@ r@@ atic . &quot;
&quot; as al@@ location of the area of a entry for the sub@@ ordin@@ ate entries will remain to the implementation . here , it is designed for the label and to prevent plac@@ em@@ ing the areas which are as square as possible . the best methods of this are lines , columns , or recur@@ sive tax @-@ healing . &quot;
&quot; you can specify the minimum area for an entry on the menu item , keeping with floor area . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the surface of the higher agreement , to indicate that this area is actually occupied by an under@@ stated entry . &quot;
&quot; originally , &amp; FS@@ View ; as a small test application and introduction into the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets that was developed for the application of K@@ C@@ ach@@ egr@@ ind . &quot;

&amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; contains a quick image processing with basic imaging tools . you can use this to review your photos , comment and correct . the processing skills can be easily expanded with KDE Image plugins interface ( manual ) modules . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted , it &apos;s easy to use , it provides easy access to professional skills . it works fully in the 16 @-@ bit color@@ fully and all the available modules support the raw materials , using li@@ bra@@ w , DNG export and ICC @-@ color work@@ flow . &quot;
&quot; improved database with significantly more met@@ ad@@ ata , such as &amp; eg ; about the camera or the lens , which can be sought . &quot;
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs also &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; an open source project . that means it depends on the support of the end users . you should therefore report problems and improvement .
&quot; &amp; di@@ gi@@ an ; tries to make the mil@@ king of problems or suggestions as easily as possible for them . this opens a dialogue with a under@@ lined link . if you are using this short@@ list , your web browser open a page in error messages . follow the instructions to send your message here . &quot;
&amp; di@@ gi@@ an ; is a project supported by a community . that means users and developers came together each other . if you answer a regular users of &amp; di@@ gi@@ an ; then we would like to answer any questions to other users of &amp; di@@ gi@@ d ; however we would like to answer you questions of other users here . in this mail@@ ing list , you should be more powerful about this language . &quot;
you can also visit the di@@ gi@@ fted home page to learn news about shared versions and other information about &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; to learn .
the best start to get to &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; participate is the registration in the developer @-@ mail@@ ing@@ list . instructions for the log in the developer @-@ mail list of &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; .
&quot; if you want to start with your pictures , you will be asked where you want to save your pictures and your database . simply enter a local , remote or remote folder . simply enter the folder , click on the folder icon to select a folder . &quot;
&quot; in the second panel , you have to specify a local folder on your computer . here the data will be saved . this path remains the same for all the picture folder . &quot;
later you can add so@@ many folders as you would like to add . &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; you will additionally use as Al@@ ben@@ bibliothek . settings di@@ gi@@ K@@ am set up .
&quot; if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top folder , the images , as the base folder . &quot;
&amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; dur@@ is cur@@ vy the libr@@ arian path in its whole depth . you can not add any sub@@ folder to it unless it is in a hidden folder . this allows you to insert an extraordinary folder and add a point in front of the name of the sub@@ folder .
&quot; if you take an existing folder with photos as basic folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ list do not have photos as symbols . you can change the album by using a popular photo from the album and this will be used as an album symbol . further details can be found in the section albums . &quot;
&quot; once you have configured the bas@@ ins folder , you can set up in &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted , you can learn how to use My albums and My keywords , to manage your photos in the albums . &quot;
&quot; if you use the raw mode of your camera so you can handle the raw mode of your camera , so it may also deal with it . the support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out whether a special camera is supported , then you will find a list of supported resources cameras in the menu Help Roh@@ k@@ amer@@ a@@ suppor@@ tive . &quot;
how to set it up and work with raw files is described in the sections of Ro@@ h Dec@@ o@@ der@@ Settings and Ro@@ h desktop .
&quot; a simple to use camera plan will be made available to you with your digital camera and you can download your photos directly in &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted , -@@ albums . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , each medium and any dealer can be supported by your operating system , using &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted , will work together . &quot;
modern digital cameras are applied by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory Cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IEE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) . the camera can also be realized as a record drive . the camera can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras can also use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&quot; &amp; nbsp ; uses the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 for communication with digital cameras , which was a constantly increasing number of more than 800 cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 is also supported the Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely spread protocol which was developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need for additional drivers . &quot;
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the machine . as photos in general are large files and transm@@ is@@ sions about the serial port slowly is now out@@ dated . &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; supports this cameras and results the transfer of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 through . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 has to be created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support is to be read by using di@@ gi@@ K@@ am reli@@ ably . the Exif &apos;s support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 . if the Exif &apos;s support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 . if the Exif is not able to see anything or the production could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things in &amp; di@@ gi@@ an ; is how easy it can extend its functionality by modules :
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I modules : the KDE Image Plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is a approach to develop a common mod@@ ulation structure for &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; , K@@ Photo@@ album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . goal is to provide the modules with all graphic programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section . &quot;
&quot; modules can manip@@ ulate images in virtually any way , as it is also a user . your advantage is that it &apos;s considerably easier , &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; by writing a small module to complement one function than the changes in &amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; to perform . &quot;
&quot; to simplify the window , you can either remove the page with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or change in full @-@ mode mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F . &quot;
&quot; moving and ref@@ ill from pictures everywhere : you can create an image in another part of the alarm system , via horizontal cut @-@ line or into another application window . the only limitation is that one image is not in keywords , dat@@ um@@ sli@@ ce or sub@@ cut@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; - a file selection allows you to lift the most common : JPEG , PNG , TIFF , Ro@@ h , movies and audio &quot;
&quot; the text filter is used only for the fields which are currently displayed in the tool@@ bar , only if this ind it is displayed on the fil@@ en@@ ame only if this ind it will display tool@@ bar . which fields can be shown in the dialog of the alarm settings . &quot;
&quot; the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view of your photo@@ box . all photos , which were stored by &amp; di@@ gi@@ aum . these albums can be saved according to the folders , where the album was first created in the Al@@ ben@@ ds or after the date , on which the album was first created , and the date can be changed in the properties of the album . &quot;
&quot; if you set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album , you can also select a screenshot directly to an album . select the album Imp@@ or@@ den screens . &quot;

&quot; an album includes a collection of photos and the album Properties to provide you with information about this collection . to access the album characteristics , you must click on the album with the right mouse button and select in the context menu of the album tab . &quot;
&quot; Alb@@ um@@ - Coll@@ ections : are a method to mark your records , so you can choose among a common name , if you want to add or delete records from the tool@@ bar or view albums by collection . if you want to add new collections , you can make this in the settings for collections . &quot;
the Alb@@ um@@ - Date : is used when you sort your albums on date with view albums by date .
&quot; the buttons el@@ der Elder , average , new : this set the date on the one of the oldest , the latest image or the cut @-@ cut of the album . first , first attempts to calculate the pictures of the pictures from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder . &quot;
&quot; if you first came to record an album in &amp; di@@ gi@@ an , the first picture is selected as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative , and you might want to choose another photo as a symbol . &quot;

&quot; another mode is better suited to display quickly from a picture series , then the two first pictures are automatically loaded into the areas to the compar@@ isons . then use the right mouse button in the areas to display . this is easier to click on the right side . this makes it easier to go through a number of similar pictures . &quot;
&quot; of course , normal wages are also working directly from the lumin@@ aire as e.g. F@@ 4 file editing .... &quot;
all images from the right side bar of the main window are available for both screen@@ shots of the lumin@@ aire . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
&quot; in the lower end of each area you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ vel function , which you can climb to the crossed arrows . in order to swing this click and the &amp; L@@ MB . in the mode , you will see both images of the same picture . &quot;
the zo@@ omas works just as in other views . simply use the zoom controller under the pictures or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel in the picture and out to zo@@ omes . this happens in both pictures if you are in the mode of preview .
what is a digital survey - away from the fashion word ? digital invent@@ ories considers every part of the process follows after the image has been made up to the fin@@ alist output and the permanent storage . each of the photos take up sc@@ ans or digital photos saves a form of digital invent@@ ories . but most of us do this not in a systematic and efficient way .
&quot; we will give you a tool to secure a plan and practical tips on how to secure your pictures . we look at the procedure for digital phot@@ ograph@@ ers the &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted , use . we consider the download , ren@@ aming , secure , evaluate , archi@@ ving , stor@@ ing , stor@@ ing , stor@@ ing , stor@@ ing , stor@@ ing , stor@@ ing , stor@@ ing , stor@@ ing , stor@@ ing , stor@@ ing , stor@@ ing , archi@@ ving , stor@@ ing , stor@@ ing , stor@@ ing , stor@@ ing , archi@@ ving , stor@@ ing , stor@@ ing , stor@@ ing , archi@@ ving , stor@@ ing , stor@@ ing , stor@@ ing , archi@@ ving , stor@@ ing , stor@@ ing , stor@@ ing , archi@@ ving , stor@@ ing , stor@@ ing , stor@@ ing , archi@@ ving , stor@@ ing , stor@@ ing , stor@@ ing , archi@@ ving , stor@@ ing , stor@@ ing , stor@@ ing , archi@@ ving , stor@@ ing , stor@@ ing , stor@@ ing , archi@@ ving , stor@@ ing , stor@@ ing , stor@@ ing , archi@@ ving , stor@@ ing , stor@@ ing , stor@@ ing , archi@@ ving , stor@@ ing , stor@@ ing , stor@@ ing , archi@@ ving , stor@@ ing , stor@@ ing , stor@@ ing , archi@@ ving , stor@@ ing , stor@@ ing , stor@@ ing , archi@@ ving , stor@@ ing , stor@@ ing ,
&quot; digital invent@@ ories takes on , indi@@ ces , categor@@ ized , addiction , searches , transform@@ er@@ ected and exports content that have a mon@@ eti@@ zed or cultural value . &quot;
met@@ ad@@ ata data is defined as data via data . met@@ ad@@ ata data are defined according to your definition data that provide information about or a documentation of other data collected by an application or environment .
&quot; I dare to claim if you want to find out more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you do not even know how many photos you have , then use the met@@ ad@@ ata and a secure archi@@ ving to which you can access with other programs , platforms and formats . &quot;
&quot; the first thing you need to do and know before you need anything into your system , the structure of the information structure can somehow be organized in contrast to the data structure . you have to decide whether others want to save them to your computer or on a network drive , etc . note that you will eventually need to change a bigger drive . &quot;
&quot; maybe you will be happy with this structure . holiday images can be found quickly via your memory location . the remaining photos will be found on the same place . the remaining photos will be on the basis of your data . you &apos;ll be able to use sub @-@ folder like &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . export is a folder for pictures that you print or publish on a website . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have different requirements such as ver@@ sion@@ ing of photos , archi@@ ving , work@@ flows , constant flow of images on different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years you will have 95 % Archive and 5 % desktop files and then you will not want to organise your structure for this content . &quot;
which types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes for@@ kli@@ fts simpler . separate new from old files .
the separation of original and work@@ files will be simpli@@ fied a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a deriv@@ ative image .
&quot; we also recommend the Ad@@ met@@ ad@@ ata option in the Settings side of the met@@ ad@@ ata in &amp; di@@ gi@@ an ; to activate . this ensures that Ex@@ if@@ - and IP@@ TC data will be written in the file . if you forget it , then you can choose the met@@ ad@@ ata from the database in the files by selecting the corresponding item in the menu . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens when you want to change ? this is a met@@ ad@@ ata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones . &quot;
&quot; now begins the real work , as you now choose any photo keywords , lab@@ elling and an assessment . of course , you can select all the images that you need the same attribute and start the value . they start the best with the rating or the ranking . this makes sense , as you can focus on the best photos . &quot;
&quot; let us now continue with keywords , keywords as you are going to other programs frequently , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot;
if you import kat@@ alo@@ gu@@ ized images from another source of built @-@ in keywords then &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; automatically add the tree to the right place . the sort of hier@@ archy within the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by using a sub@@ tree on another . the changed keywords are being pursued by &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; updated while it is the Under @-@ trees .
the graphic shows how different met@@ ad@@ ata can be cut off . this is a very rough representation since each block of met@@ ad@@ ata in truth comes from many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data can be found in all images .
&quot; enough of the keywords , the next section refers to lab@@ eling or comments , the third important tool to cat@@ alog@@ ise your met@@ ad@@ ata . &quot;
&quot; you want most of anybody to just see your photos just watching , you want to share it with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies . &quot;
&quot; look at this panorama . from the distance it is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it closer , then start to see some details , people , the place . &quot;
&quot; and now I say to you this is the landing place of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y , 60 years after landing is . Wow ! it starts to dream , memories , the historical time span is again present , you might even hear the silence . the label has completely changed your perception of this panoramic view . &quot;
&quot; for others who consider your photos may be more important than the image itself to create an interest in yourself . if you show pictures , you should tell a story . remember the key it is the meaning to ob@@ server to help Him to understand what you understand what you understand . &quot;
it is fine when an image is not perfect if the strength has only work with a lab@@ eling for itself alone .
&quot; with &amp; di@@ gi@@ an ; you can export as much text , in an internation@@ alised alphab@@ et ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) , then you can even download it for a selection of pictures at the same time . you can even tell your pictures in the label and / or the title of the web @-@ gallery no second time . &quot;
&quot; remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find in another city without navigation system ? was it not a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gl@@ e@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures drives the train of spatial presentation now with light speed . &quot;
&quot; the possibilities for Ge@@ ol@@ ok@@ alisation are already un@@ coun@@ table and will be able to repeat the future by using Goo@@ gl@@ e@@ Earth , you can also export your trips with Goo@@ gl@@ e@@ Earth . you can also export your trips with Goo@@ gl@@ e@@ Earth . you can also export your trips to Galler@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flick@@ r &amp; etc ; with the Goo@@ gl@@ e@@ Maps viewer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Copy@@ left is a p@@ act with copyright and design@@ ates the practice of copy@@ rights to remove limitations on the distribution and change of copies . the same freedoms also applies in all changed versions , i.e. also for the work of others . &quot;
the following description tells you which information in the setup page of &amp; di@@ gi@@ a was to be depos@@ ited as information :
&quot; author ( Syn@@ onym for Er@@ ers and Writ@@ er ) : this field should add your name , or the name of the person who has created the photo . if it is not desired to use the name of the photographer , then it cannot be changed anymore . this field does not support Kom@@ ma nor sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as divi@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; this field contains the author . this field contains the words of the photographer . examples for this can be titles as : employee photographer , fre@@ el@@ ance photographer or independence . since this is a reference to the car field , it has to be filled with . &quot;
&quot; publisher ( syn@@ onym for vend@@ ors ) : use the provider to identify who the photo offers . this is not necessarily the author . if the photograph is provided for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , the group / Agency will be listed here . if the picture is offering the picture here . &quot;
&quot; it is very important to fill in the author and copyright sections , although this is no protection against mis@@ use . each of which has a little bit more than basic knowledge in working with calcul@@ ators . each of the solution for this problem is digital water@@ marks . for individuals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important to the majority of your photos . &quot;
the digital water@@ mark is unique per image . &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; will make such a module available in the near future .
&quot; themes : PLA@@ TE FLA@@ CO@@ T@@ LER , plate , black@@ ness , EC@@ C , transfer of storage media , recovery , red@@ und@@ ancy , life @-@ time , temperature , data size , widespread super@@ st@@ ition &quot;
&quot; of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that are lost on the street or a fire . this type of losses are the same that can happen to you with traditional paper pictures or neg@@ atives . in this section it is about problems with the so called new media . &quot;
&quot; K@@ roll On@@ track , the biggest data recovery company in the world , has some interesting statistics which reasons to have a data loss . &quot;
&quot; to fight the problem on CDs / DVDs must be careful and you can no longer keep CDs and DVDs in arch@@ ival quality . of course , you can also keep CDs and DVDs in arch@@ ival quality . of course , you can claim CDs and DVDs in arch@@ ival quality . of course , you can claim more than gold time . there are offers on gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years for itself . whether you believe it is in your discretion . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ read@@ able , but you can use this risk in which you can store good disc@@ s and good reception . the best DVD capture are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write much reliable . so it is about choosing the right . &quot;
&quot; CDs and DVDs are very sus@@ cep@@ tible to mistakes , even if you just have just written . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for form@@ att@@ ing and control . despite this massive protection they are required by chemical aging , Ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; for def@@ ective CDs and DVDs there is a favorable program called I@@ so@@ B@@ uster , which appears wonder at CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; it is also not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read damaged data of damaged dis@@ ks , hard drives , Flash@@ media , USB drives , etc . &quot;
optical Media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to win the For@@ mat@@ krieg against HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six@@ pack@@ et the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . everything that has been said to CDs and DVDs was of course also true for Blu @-@ ray disc .
&quot; slowly burn slow with a good acceptance rate on high quality media in an un@@ propri@@ etary format . read about the media using a description , date &amp; author . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read the latest piece of hardware or software . &quot;
disc@@ ard keep your statistics for themselves . your manufacturing erg@@ ar@@ ers include a new disk but not the data . Google is on this issue a large field @-@ study about the error mechanisms of hard drives : dis@@ inf@@ alli@@ ble
&quot; soon : dis@@ ks hold the longest in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C . with lower temper@@ art@@ ed errors , the most common trou@@ bles are increased dramatically . &quot;
&quot; this is only the complete losses due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also have data loss due to a black@@ out before you have secured files , but these losses normally do not produce any major problems . &quot;
&quot; while most electric devices can not do much , this can take serious damage on devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed key@@ boards , complete data loss , hardware age , destroyed motherboards , and other def@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; the most widespread protection against power heads is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that includes a portion of the energy @-@ heat . however , it is usually available in the form of a socket bar . however , do not think any connector bar also contains an over@@ voltage protection . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should pay attention to the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also pay attention to protect the protection against flash . &quot;
&quot; as an over@@ load each cable can use to your computer , you should also watch out that all Peri@@ ph@@ eri@@ als can also be connected to your system . some manufacturers cl@@ add@@ ings can also provide a phone access for your mo@@ dem . others offer connectors for the co@@ ax@@ ial cable and the TV map . &quot;
&quot; if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially developed for not@@ ebooks and therefore contain very small and you also contain the protection for the mo@@ dem . &quot;
&quot; while an over@@ voltage protection of your system protects your system against smaller fluctu@@ ations in the power pipes , it will not really help you to loss of unwanted data . it can therefore be sensible to the loss of unwanted data . it can therefore be useful to invest in a resp@@ ecting @-@ free power supply . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the protection against over@@ thr@@ illing , these devices can automatically collect battery energy when a black@@ out falls . this gives you the opportunity to store your data and continue to run the system . some models allow them to continue using the current quality requirements such as an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the surrounding software is interesting . &quot;
&quot; raise the potential risk that is exposed to your computer system and compare its security when you get rid of these . a high quality over@@ voltage protection can be up to &amp; euro ; 20 . this is just a small price difference . this is only a small price difference . this is only a small price difference . at the end , you should always think about all the cable before you go to the holidays . &quot;
&quot; Amazon Web @-@ Service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration you can use it as drive on &amp; Linux , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as a backup destination for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is a further popular offer with which you can save any amounts of data . &quot;
they are at home compared to the hard@@ disk but very expensive - 40 GB cost per dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 500 . furthermore you have to send the data about the compar@@ atively slow internet .
the solutions are therefore suitable only as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution but it is not a general backup solution . it is too slow .
&quot; Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flick@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo @-@ community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are available on photos . your free memory is available to 1 GB . the professional variant provides you with more available , in case of Flick@@ r dramatically more . for 25 $ per year you get unlimited memory which should be checked in reality . &quot;
&quot; from the point of view of the backup data , the web solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically adjusted to the TCP @-@ protocol and the large companies is included in the offer a backup and a distributed memory . thus they are des@@ ast@@ er@@ ved . &quot;
the diagram illustr@@ ates the elements of the transmission system in the machine . all transfers are sus@@ cep@@ tible to transmission errors . the files@@ ystem is at least the data integ@@ rates between operating system and hard drive safely .
&quot; worst thing is that nobody ever happened when an transfer@@ ring mistake occurred , not when this is in your hardware . all these distur@@ b@@ ances remain un@@ discovered until you have no protection to your computer . no one seems to have thought of it . no one seems to have thought of it . no one seems to have thought of it . the Internet with its TCP @-@ protocol is a much safer use than that of your computer . &quot;
&quot; un@@ reliable power parts are another source of transmission losses , as they generate interference in the data flow . in normal files@@ ystems , these errors remain un@@ noticed . &quot;
&quot; even if you are not currently affected by transfer@@ ring problems , you should look into the future . already , you will see thousands of errors per year . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ FS from Sun Mic@@ ros@@ ystems seems to be one of two candidates who are able to handle turn@@ table on lower level and can be highly scal@@ able . it is open source , with many pat@@ ents and is available under one to the GPL in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it will be available soon for &amp; Linux ; and Windows . read this article in English . &quot;
&quot; Oracle has started its own initiative with its b@@ anners file system . it is still used in alpha status . it is still used in alpha status , but it is also not part of the kernel . it is not part of the kernel . &quot;
&quot; these two factors are not responsible for 86 % of the data losses in the not@@ ebook , and 46 % in the job systems . at not@@ ebooks , the share of theft is 50 % . &quot;
&quot; data loss due to viruses is less common than the Mei@@ est think . it leads to a lower damage , such as theft or rest@@ art . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple user know only very few viruses and under &amp; Linux , has been no longer sight@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; open source file systems are less sus@@ cep@@ tible to data loss as propri@@ etary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS , to find the common files@@ ystems . a very good English article can be found here . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent cor@@ rupt data and data loss : wrong , just the speed of the examination process during a sudden inter@@ ruption during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status will be avoided . however , a file has not been saved , it is lost . &quot;
&quot; viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : false , theft and human fail@@ ures are the main causes of data loss . &quot;
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 Bl@@ ending settings of fundamental physical boundaries . it is that while the technology developed further there is a natural border for that progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics are no longer far away from this border .
today &apos;s cameras will go towards the 10 meg@@ api@@ x@@ el sensors . even if this resolution has already been too high for comp@@ actors and the end result . a sensor size of 6 meg@@ api@@ x@@ el and a high quality optics are the optim@@ ism for comp@@ actors . even DSLR cameras require your limit at 10 @-@ 12 Meg@@ api@@ x@@ el . for higher resolution you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
&quot; thus , a 750@@ GB hard drive will get you today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not make anyone any other for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are often affected by any data loss . so secure your data frequently after a plan and test this backup before you make any risk of your operating system , the exchange of plates or the size of hard drives . &quot;
&quot; suppose you are taking daily your backup on an external SATA Drive . if , then one day , a lightning strikes , you are lucky when the drive in the moment was not connected . &quot;
&quot; a disaster suggests locally and destroyed a lot . forget aircraft : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough . they usually affect a whole room or the complete house . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Des@@ ast@@ er@@ sion does not always mean local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stairs into the neighboring house , in your office or similar . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above is a frequent cause of data loss despite sec@@ uring the panic . if you have a backup , that is not immediately available , then you can save this one day . &quot;
complete backup : a complete backup of all files are to be secured . it is a snapshot without history and constitutes a complete copy at a time of time .
differentiation : a backup of the files have been changed since the last Compl@@ ete protection . creates a complete snapshot of two time @-@ points : that of the complete protection and the latest differ@@ ential insurance .
&quot; incre@@ mental sec@@ uring : a backup of the files have been changed since the last backup . produced several snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time . this backup comes from a reference system at the next one , except that it is only ab@@ sent and not ongoing . &quot;
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . as opposed to script controlled FTP meetings or other types of file @-@ controlled FTP meetings or other types of file @-@ controlled pages copied r@@ sync only the difference of files that really have been changed . this happens un@@ compressed and if you want to increase security via ssh .
secure important pictures right after you stored it on your computer on a DVD or another optical medium .
&quot; this approach gives you enough time to detect losses and restore again . at the same time you come for a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month . any further dil@@ ution should be done manually , after which you have made a complete review . &quot;
&quot; topics : met@@ ad@@ ata , associated with IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , original store , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ find images and met@@ ad@@ ata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , view , ... , use of the internet . &quot;
&quot; with this valuable pictures to survive the next 40 year , that is about the time @-@ span in which you are really interested in you because they will remember your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be respected : &quot;
&quot; because the future is un@@ predic@@ table due to your nature . unfortunately , there is no other possibility to let us know how the current system is backward compatible . the less variants you have used in the past and so it is easier to evaluate the questions of the future . &quot;
this question should actually be answered by the statements in this document . use or switching to open standards that are supported by many applications .
&quot; virtualization is currently available for everyone . so if you have an old system that you are important to reading your images , then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every@@ time you change your computer architecture , your memory and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard . remain at open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the professional pressure for the possibility to change a system in its size . this is actually always bigger .
let &apos;s take a look at the scal@@ ability and set the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition . at * nix systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and shift to a new disk :
&quot; check with the command d@@ warf if your new record is recognized by the system , but do not hang them out . &quot;
&quot; / dev / s@@ db , the new record is / dev / s@@ db , the new record is / dev / sd@@ c &amp; dollar ; part@@ ed re@@ size / dev / sd@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the plate in MB@@ F ; # work with ext@@ 2,3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and reis@@ er@@ fs &amp; dollar ; resi@@ ze@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of reis@@ er@@ fs if necessary &quot;
&quot; open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day no software can read more , then you can create this itself . this task is easier by year to year . &quot;
&quot; GIF is a propri@@ etary , pat@@ ented format which slowly dis@@ appears from the market . you should therefore no longer use it . &quot;
&quot; PNG has been used as an open source standard to replace GIF , but it can store a lot more . it is los@@ s@@ free , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC met@@ ad@@ ata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . &quot;
&quot; TIFF has been widely used as a image format . TIFF can be saved in un@@ compressed shape or in a container with a los@@ s@@ free com@@ pres@@ sion@@ s@@ algorith@@ m ( de@@ fl@@ ate ) . one problem is however , that this format has been adapted for many people . there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types . &quot;
&quot; the Digital Neg@@ ative File format is a licence @-@ free and open pipe format , developed by Adobe Systems . it is based on the TIFF / EP format and is committed to the use of met@@ ad@@ ata . a hand@@ ful of camera created is now available and we hope to use the competitors for Canon and Nikon . &quot;
&quot; this may be one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Metad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . the file information is stored for XML / R@@ DF . &quot;
&quot; many photographers put it in front of an original of your recording , mostly in the raw format , to archi@@ ving . X@@ MP matches the met@@ ad@@ ata separately from the image file . therefore , you should consider the raw material separately from the image file . therefore , you should think about whether you are using the container as container and put it all there . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata initiative is an open organisation that supports the work of completely compatible online met@@ ad@@ ata standards , providing a large range of operations and business models . among the activities of D@@ CM@@ I activities , y@@ early conferences and workshops , standard connections and enlight@@ ening efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of met@@ ad@@ ata standards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import images from the camera , the card@@ les@@ er or the scanner . so long the pictures on the camera lists are , you can use this as temporary backup . &quot;
convert raw files to DNG and save it in your raw archive . this feature is not yet implemented .
&quot; for a multi @-@ lay@@ ered processing you can use external programs . if you edit the images again with &amp; di@@ gi@@ d , then you should add the met@@ ad@@ ata back . these have been cut under certain circumstances of the other programs . &quot;
&quot; use the processed pictures for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export it only in Web@@ gal@@ eries , co@@ ding in MPEG , use in contact , print &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos into &amp; di@@ gi@@ an ; you will find a description of how you can add photos to your hard disk . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for import images on your album database . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted , connect them with the computer , turn on the camera on the sco@@ oter and turn it . another description of this can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; if you start the camera interface , this is trying to connect with your camera . if the connection is made , a pre @-@ indicator will appear at the lower end and the pre @-@ depic@@ tion of all photos on the camera will appear . some cameras do not appear any screen@@ shots for each file , photos , movies , music etc. on the camera . &quot;
&quot; before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information to each entry . with the side@@ d@@ ations and met@@ ad@@ ata from the camera interface you can see the characteristics of a entry or met@@ ad@@ ata . &quot;
&quot; this dialog displays file properties and the photographic information that are saved intern@@ ally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the picture has not been downloaded to your computer . note that in some digital cameras will not be available all information . &quot;
&quot; the rider met@@ ad@@ ata shows the internal met@@ ad@@ ata as well as Exif , manufacturing , GPS etc. of the image . this information is the same as in the met@@ ad@@ ata side@@ bar , from the main window of &amp; di@@ gi@@ an ; or the image processing . note that these met@@ ad@@ ata does not provide some digital cameras . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to download photos on their computer download , the click on the button download and then the selection of all download . this invites all photos of her camera to record a single album in &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; . during download the photos will not be deleted and we recommend you to delete the photos from the camera . &quot;
&quot; if you do not want to download all photos , you can only select the desired ones with the standard selection of &amp; k@@ de ; select the button download and then download@@ able . the button selected is selected as long as you selected some photos . &quot;
if your camera supports this is an option new download@@ able . these images were still not marked by &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; in this case the new pictures are marked with a star in the show@@ case . if you select this option of course only the new pictures are downloaded .
&quot; when you download the buttons , a dialog appears , with which you can choose the target album in which the photos can be stored in which the photos of the existing albums will be sorted . details on the folder can be read in the section My albums . then select the target album from the list and press OK . &quot;
&quot; after that you have selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; di@@ gi@@ an ; invites photos of the camera to the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete it from the camera . you can delete all at once , delete the button Clear View all , so you must select this first and delete it later . &quot;
&quot; please note that there are no possibility to re @-@ restore you from the camera . the photos will not be er@@ ased . you should be sure to delete it from the camera . if you want to delete it from the camera . if you want to delete it from the camera , as this is much faster . &quot;
&quot; the fil@@ en@@ ame is usually not used as a fil@@ en@@ ame for the photos . this can be deleted to double fil@@ en@@ ame , in case you can download photos of different diam@@ et@@ ries into the same album . therefore , it can be useful to integrate the date and time when the image was taken into the fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
&quot; in the next section you will find options to rot@@ ate and mir@@ rors of the image and for data @-@ based under@@ ne@@ ars . if you use this latter option , you will automatically create a folder per day . &quot;
&quot; the options Dur@@ ing the transmission opens three other options that are performed before the photos are stored on the record . the first two relate to the author in the section standard author@@ ization . when you select this , the corresponding entries will be copied to the text information in the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for any downloaded images . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use a different file format than the default format , you can download the pre@@ fix Fot@@ o- % Y@@ - % M@@ - % d % H : % M : % S . click on this option to read the help of the command str@@ f@@ time . &quot;
&quot; if you use the camera fil@@ en@@ ame , you will have the opportunity to download the fil@@ en@@ ame in inf@@ users . or in large bookings when you prefer this . &quot;
&quot; the new fil@@ en@@ ame , the &amp; di@@ gi@@ an ; used for a photo will be shown below the name displayed , which the camera will be stored in the preview . your settings to ren@@ aming is stored and automatically be used when you open the camera window . &quot;
&quot; I can use all the information on the orientation of the camera to perform at the time of recording . not all cameras provide this information . in the section side@@ bar Metad@@ ata you can read more details about the information that your camera will be embedded in the photo . &quot;
&quot; the automatic rot@@ ation is normally turned on , and if your camera does not provide this information ; the photo was in the original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic turning , use the button Advanced and select the automatic rotation in the lower section of the window . &quot;
&quot; if your camera is provided information about the date , where the photo was made , can be found &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted , this sub@@ missions are based on the image data . all images with the same date are loaded into the same album . all images with the same date are loaded into the same album . all images with the same date will be available to the same album . in the section side@@ bar Meta @-@ Data , you can read what information your camera could be embedded in the photos . &quot;
&quot; this option is usually swit@@ ched off , and in this case saves , the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this option . use the button Advanced and select the file @-@ based shelter at the bottom of the window . &quot;
the easiest way photos from your computer to load your camera is free download . select the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appear in which you can select the files that are up@@ loaded . you can also select more than one file using the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
&quot; after the selection is done , asks &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; you where the images will be loaded up . a folder selection dialog for the camera will appear . select the desired folder and press OK to start the up@@ loading . the pictures are not deleted from your computer . &quot;
GPS ( Global Pos@@ iti@@ oning System ) is used as a general concept in this document . it is a position meant that can be displayed in long@@ itu@@ d@@ inal and lat@@ itudes and which can be displayed on a card . identi@@ fying the data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European Galil@@ eo or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional phot@@ ograph@@ ers , it may be interesting to link an image with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses an air@@ plane to card an area through automatic recording of GPS data . environ@@ ment@@ ans , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability . &quot;
&quot; if you have forgotten later , where exactly the photo was done , you can locate the area by clicking on another &amp; di@@ gi@@ d ; users want to locate the place of the photo to locate , or just want to document the location of the photo , it is good to share the control data of a photo . &quot;
&quot; the question is how do the GPS data do in the image ? first you should know that ex@@ iv@@ 2 many GPS data fields are supported . there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , to achieve a post @-@ processing of GPS data and images with the K@@ IP@@ I module for the geographical assignment of known places . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there are currently no camera integrated with GPS receiver . but there are a few that work with GPS receiver , either as a card module or by transfer@@ ring data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;
cameras with GPS @-@ Interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Kodak D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR Ric@@ oh Pro G3 Sony
&quot; downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ p@@ sman or g@@ p@@ sb@@ abel . you must save this data in g@@ px format , since this is the only format that is supported by the module to the geographical assignment . &quot;
there are different programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract the data of images and from GPS . on the following page you can make the same under &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
&quot; if you know the long@@ itu@@ d@@ inal and lat@@ itudes or other data , then you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ if@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the sign @-@ up coordinates that are provided for example from map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle . &quot;
&quot; here are not European sites . here are a number of European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which will show all navigation details for Europe . &quot;
&quot; &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted , try to give you so much control over their working process as possible . there are many settings that came to the behavior of &amp; di@@ gi@@ an ; to set up in the menu settings ; you have to switch to these settings by clicking on these settings by clicking on the symbols of the left side . &quot;
&quot; to select action can be displayed on built @-@ in preview or image processing . you place the default behavior of &amp; di@@ gi@@ d , fixed , if you click on an entry in the main window . &quot;
&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the stand@@ ardi@@ zation and copy@@ right@@ ed data . these data will be automatically selected to the appropriate IP@@ TC data fields . also in a database synchron@@ ization , these data is written in the IP@@ TC fields . &quot;
&quot; auto@@ graph titles is a syn@@ onym for panel head@@ line : this field should be the occupational design@@ ation of the photographer . this can be design@@ ations like an employee photographer , fre@@ el@@ ance or independent , commercial photographer . as this is a detailed description about the car field , this also has to be filled . &quot;
&quot; publisher is a syn@@ onym for vend@@ ors : use this field to specify the photo . this does not need to be the author , if this is the picture of the other &amp; quot ; suppliers &amp; Associ@@ ated Press , then the group or agency should be available here . &quot;
&quot; the IP@@ TC promotions store the data in the appropriate IP@@ TC Fel@@ der@@ . thereby , the met@@ ad@@ ata are permanently stored in the picture and not only in the database of &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; these met@@ ad@@ ata are also available for other programs and can be imported into &amp; di@@ gi@@ d ; can be imported without being lost . &quot;
&quot; images can store in JPEG pictures : these synchron@@ izes the comments that you can add to your photos , with the pictures embedded in the pictures . caution : in pictures that already exist in pictures , these are passed by the by &amp; di@@ gi@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; the page settings contains all the options for the information that appear , if the mouse c@@ ursor in the main window of a file rests . depending on the selected option this information is displayed or not . &quot;
&amp; # 160 ; di@@ gi@@ fted ; supports a number of different formats and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; di@@ gi@@ d ; indicate which file can be added and remove any file in one &amp; di@@ gi@@ d ; Alb@@ um@@ folders which has no such extensions ; ignored by &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; ignored .
&quot; default settings can be trac@@ ed back , by pressing the button Update to the right of each category . &quot;
&quot; the settings of the lumin@@ osity of &amp; di@@ gi@@ an ; can be set on this page on default values . every@@ time you can then use the lumin@@ ous mode . some pictures have different sizes and the syn@@ chr@@ oni@@ ous mode is then not available . the option &amp; quot ; In the whole image size of Lad@@ y@@ quot ; if you have one , then you can get better results . &quot;
&quot; by default , the image processing a black background behind the photographs shown photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select this here . you can use the tool@@ bar if you use the image processing in full screen mode . &quot;
over@@ - and under@@ coated areas of an image can be marked with dar@@ ker or bri@@ ghter color in the image . these colors will be set here . in the image processing this Pic@@ .@@ smo@@ dus can be swit@@ ched off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
&quot; with Chro@@ ma sub@@ sam@@ pling is meant that the images can be co@@ ded in a higher resolution of lumin@@ ance than in the bul@@ b information , please read this article in Wikipedia to the near@@ er explanation . &quot;
&quot; with the setting PNG com@@ pressing you can reduce the size of PNG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality , since you put a quick algorith@@ m . the only effect is that the image data can put more time for tender and un@@ packing . if you have a quick calcul@@ ator , you can put this value on a high compression . thereby , 1 : a low and 9 a high compression . &quot;
&quot; using the option TIFF files , you can switch to the De@@ fl@@ ate -@@ Com@@ pres@@ sion@@ sal@@ g@@ algorith@@ m for TIFF images . this reduces the size of the TIFF images . it has no effect on the image quality , since the de@@ fl@@ ate algorith@@ m fails . &quot;
&quot; even if you choose the loss of loss JPEG @-@ 2000 files , you can choose the relationship between quality loss and file size , the relation between quality loss and file size was written far better than in normal JPEG . as this paragraph were met@@ ad@@ ata not supported , but was in the planning . &quot;
&quot; in the earlier versions of &amp; di@@ gi@@ an , the image processing was only a cap@@ tion for photos . currently , it develops very fast to a tool for manip@@ ulation of your photos . with this dialog , you can change the settings of the image processing . &quot;
&quot; the default is that all green pixels are equal in the output . if you use this option with a minimum loss of details . this option features the picture a little soft , elimin@@ ates this problem with a minimum loss of details . this option features the picture a little soft , eliminated with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD method . &quot;
&quot; if this option is set , the whit@@ ish is used in the camera . otherwise , when set , the automatic color @-@ balance is used . &quot;
&quot; this option is only used if the white @-@ car is not set . standard is it a fixed colour balance , which was photograp@@ hed on a white card that is photograp@@ hed in the sunlight . &quot;
this setting will only be supported for Fu@@ ji Super C@@ CD SL@@ R cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ lining pictures in four steps more details in the nickname . for other cameras this option will be ignored .
&quot; the default is to catch the top lights , so the parts of your pictures show the burned lights , because it shows the setting of your camera to catch the lights . finally , you can try to re@@ build some parts of the missing information from the nickname . &quot;
this is possible because blue pixels in general does not try to re@@ build green and red . &amp; d@@ cra@@ b try to re@@ build the missing green and red rop@@ es from the still not satur@@ ated blue pixels . of course this is a question how much colour or white you want .
&quot; if you choose the option , you will get the possibility to set a level . here is a value of three a compromise and can / be adapted for each picture individually . &quot;
&quot; Set the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably have to set him a bit higher than standard 1 . however , this can also be small in the picture options of the &amp; di@@ gi@@ an ; image processing . in order to keep the time for the Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing ; you should be conservative . &quot;
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorith@@ m is an digital image process to calculate a complete picture of the sub @-@ based image sensor which provides a lot of cameras and that is a matrix colored pix@@ el . this algorith@@ m is also known as C@@ FA @-@ inter@@ pol@@ ation or colour construction .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ an ; and D@@ cra@@ w put you three alternatives to your disposal : Bil@@ in@@ ear , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation . however , as if A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dient ) was the first algorith@@ m of the edges . Bil@@ in@@ ear is interesting if you are looking for a quick fix with an acceptable result . &quot;
&quot; if you know the colour de@@ viation of your lenses , you can set the Rot@@ - and blue pro@@ o@@ fre@@ ading values here . this is certainly the best method for a color manifest@@ ations , as you are carried out during the raw meeting . &quot;
a profile translated the color information and gives instructions how to be given again . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; information such as the color information from a color can be translated into the other so that colors are as accurate as possible .
&quot; behaviour questions , if a picture is opened in the image processing / color module , with raw files . &quot;
&quot; profile folders can be used here , such as / usr / share / color / ICC / color / ICC / .@@ color / ICC , in which you can save all your profiles . &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted , exam@@ inations this folder during the start . &quot;
settings of the ICC @-@ Profile You have the opportunity &amp; quot ; default squ@@ ot ; for your profiles . everything can be changed during opening the raw file later .
the colour@@ ing view is an alternative opposite X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ g@@ yl@@ l . here are only your pictures colored not the entire screen .
&quot; the input profiles should be applied to the camera manufacturer and model you are using . not all profiles are placed in the same type . there are some , such as Canon , which do not have a color mapping or Gam@@ mak@@ or@@ correct@@ ness . currently , d@@ cra@@ w Gamma is not required for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means you need to perform the color mapping itself . &quot;
&quot; there are other options like the soft @-@ of @-@ profile , with which you can em@@ ulate as your image has to print a smaller color , as your printer can print a smaller color area as your camera and some colors can therefore be very satur@@ ated . this could be manually correct instead of leaving on the bl@@ in@@ m algorith@@ m of your printer . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras , it is quite obvious that color profile for them is provided . unfortunately , not with the models of Canon . therefore , there is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is of course in@@ official : &quot;
&quot; the Canon profiles makes it possible to recognize the style : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for Neutr@@ al , P for portraits and S for standard style . &quot;
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; image Plugin Interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; imaging and image processing ; many modules support that were written to collabor@@ ate with every program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
&quot; if your distribution installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the modules you want to use , and these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition , you will also find some also in the context menu of the fores@@ kin . &quot;
&quot; setup for tasks , which can be performed by modules , can set up in the menu under settings . &quot;
&quot; for more information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules , you can get on the K@@ IP@@ I project at http : / / www.@@ k@@ ip@@ i @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manu@@ als of the K@@ IP@@ I modules . &quot;
&quot; the settings of the Sli@@ deshow should be easy to understand . the upper regul@@ ator increases the time between the image @-@ outputs , normally 4 @-@ 5 seconds well . the other cros@@ sw@@ ings turn off the met@@ ad@@ ata or off at the lower end of the pictures during the display . &quot;
&quot; the camera properties show on the left side a list of all over time supported cameras . on the right side above there is a button Autom@@ atic detection , which is trying to identify the camera correctly , enabled and here are the port@@ settings . currently , there are cookies , US@@ B@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the end , you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wi@@ re@@ - ( IEE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) cells of the camera box . you need to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / Rem@@ ov@@ able , state your camera . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted , you must connect the camera with your computer to switch them into the advertis@@ ers and switch . &quot;
&quot; pro@@ claim you out if &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted , the camera automatically recognis@@ es . if not , you can set the camera and port manually . after you set up your camera , your camera will appear in the menu camera . &quot;
&quot; you can select any name for your camera . this is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window . if you own more than one camera , you can insert all here . &quot;
&quot; with the option confirmation @-@ dialog for the moving of &gt; pictures in the gar@@ bage p@@ ile , you can set the talk of &amp; di@@ gi@@ an ; when delet@@ ing a photos in an album . check out a photos and delet@@ ing an album you can find more details . &quot;
&quot; the editorial changes made by the right side bar can be imp@@ lied by &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted , if you use the option to use changes in the right side bar without any queries . otherwise , you have to apply the changes to the button changes . &quot;
you can also bind the display of the greeting screen of &amp; di@@ gi@@ d ; while starting with the starter . this acceler@@ ates in circumstances the start of &amp; di@@ gi@@ a ; .
&quot; the setting up to new photos search for new photos , which came to search for new or deleted albums / photographs . this extends the start @-@ up of new or deleted albums / photos . if something comes from the base folder , ask &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted , you should delete it from the database . &quot;
different color schem@@ as can be used in &amp; di@@ gi@@ d ; used to adjust the main window to your taste . these settings can be selected under settings design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of the available designs are listed below :
&quot; these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; di@@ gi@@ d , you will find more information about it in this tutorial . &quot;
&amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; contains a quick image processing with some basic tools . you can use this to view your photos and to correction and improvement . the image processing can be started by clicking on the preview of an image or through the context menu of preview and selection of the entry ads / editing .
image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; di@@ gi@@ d ; therefore you are not part of your distribution . for more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules can be found in the section imaging .
&quot; status header at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current file number , enlar@@ ging actors and the current image size . &quot;
a menu bar at the top and below the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most frequently needed functions .
&quot; the processing functions of the image processing change your photos . none of the functions will change the original photo before you file storage or the button stor@@ ing from the tool@@ bar . note that you can no longer restore the original photo as soon as you have saved the image . &quot;
you should therefore create a copy of your image before you change it . this can save you with file stor@@ ing .
&quot; as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original picture by selecting the image file or restore the button to re@@ produce the image processing in the tool@@ bar . you then lose every change that you have carried out in the photo since the last storage . &quot;
&quot; virtually any action of the image processing can be und@@ oc@@ ative or re@@ produced , the last action you can undo , by selecting or re@@ produce reco@@ vering from the menu . &quot;
&quot; if you frequently use this , you should make the keyboard short@@ ened , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ z to get back @-@ cat@@ chy and mem@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the &amp; L@@ MB ; on the back or re @-@ button in the tool@@ bar a moment to press , you will get a context menu . if you select one of the menu items , all actions in between also undo or re @-@ established . &quot;
&quot; once you have started the image processing , you can choose between the photos in the same album or the same keyword , using the navig@@ ational buttons in the tool@@ bar , picture high , image r@@ under or the entries in the menu file , you will be asked if you want to save it . &quot;
you can log into the photo and out zo@@ omes in which you use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse bike or the symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the saf@@ est menu .
&quot; to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : enlar@@ ging actor will be automatically selected
&quot; view full@@ screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode . you come to the normal view , where you can use the Es@@ c button . usually , you can call this in the settings dialog by &amp; di@@ gi@@ us ; you can see this from the &amp; di@@ gi@@ d ; main window . see this section for the setup of the image processing . &quot;
&quot; if you want to print the current picture , you can print the picture File image and get the standard &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can adjust the settings before you print your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the main menu , you can print individual images or whole sentences . all images can be printed out of your selection . you just need to select the pictures with the standard method and select from the menu Album Ex@@ por@@ tray print assistant . if you follow the wiz@@ ard , you only need to make your choice . &quot;
&quot; the window , the window , has a side bar at the right edge , which is provided important information and actions for the selected images , even in the image processing . it is displayed when one of the five rider is cli@@ cked on : &quot;
multi @-@ cre@@ ek click on the same tab shows the side@@ bar or disappear into the edge .
&quot; in the marking , you can enter lab@@ eling with unlimited size or insert . note the text below . the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are permitted in the EX@@ IF@@ N and IP@@ TC@@ - fields , so that you can use other programs . &quot;
&quot; the IP@@ TC data support only ASCII character and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut off after 2000 characters and want to switch off . if you want to use the IP@@ TC proc@@ ess@@ ation field in other applications , you should note these restrictions . &quot;
&quot; after that you have commented , use either the button users or switching to the next picture , the lab@@ elling will then be saved . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the user button there is a button More . with this you can read other met@@ ad@@ ata from the selected file or database . however , you can also write the met@@ ad@@ ata into the files . this will always be accomplished if you have chosen a met@@ ad@@ ata position always written in the images . &quot;
&quot; the section review shows an evaluation scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in Su@@ chen and Sor@@ uses . it can be used either with a single click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar , or with the keyboard short@@ age C@@ tr@@ l + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images simultaneously , select this and use the context menu . &quot;
the review is written in the IP@@ TC @-@ field ur@@ gency . the code follows the sch@@ ema in the following table :
&quot; the keywords shows a search box for filter@@ ing the keywords , the keywords wor@@ e and a selection box with the previously mentioned in this &amp; di@@ gi@@ gi@@ as ; session of the keywords . &quot;
the keyword @-@ tree is dynam@@ ically adjusted to the given search engine . you can restri@@ ct the number of possibilities when searching for a keyword . this ability is particularly useful if you have many keywords .
&quot; the input field at the bottom of the end is another relief in the input of keywords at a picture series . if you have given different keywords , these are stored for quick access . &quot;
keywords can also be placed in the tree by mark@@ ers of the corresponding cros@@ sover fields . all tags of an image are stored in the IP@@ TC @-@ field keyword .
&quot; when multiple images are selected in the main window and select a keyword in the keywords , this is only applied to the highlighted image and not to the entire selection , if you want to read a selection with a keyword , please read the section keyword . &quot;
&quot; the side@@ bar sam@@ e@@ filter is used to change the selection of the images shown in the main window . usually , the left side bar is used with their album , - dat@@ um@@ - , sam@@ pling and search insights , only the intersection of these two are displayed . all created keywords are available . &quot;
&quot; you can also drag and take it . suppose you have selected several pictures in the main view . if the keyword already exists , you can simply drag it from the right side bar and put on the selection . a dialogue , you will ask if you want to set the keyword . &quot;
&quot; in the upper example shows the main window , the images on a calendar tag . the keywords is set up on three images . they were selected with Str@@ g + a , and then a keyword from the right keyword was set to the selection and put aside there . a dialogue will ask if this keyword was set . &quot;
this search for changes takes place at each start of the program . it can also be swit@@ ched off in settings .
&quot; if you have a rule and created and find that it would be one or its , you can easily change it with a double @-@ click on the text and in control . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : the entry after which is sought in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , keywords , etc . &quot;
&quot; 3 ) : the argument for the Oper@@ ator , which is a name or string , which is already set in the database . &quot;
you can include an extension search for all elements of the database with the following options :
&quot; if you want to group options , you only need to cross the cross @-@ box at the end of the rule and then use the button group@@ ing . the options can be seen as follows : &quot;
why were Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Flick@@ r not listed ? free memory place is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to store the pictures in full resolution .
this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly adapted to &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; s specifically adapted implementation .
the reason why you use a colour@@ ing work@@ flow that suits the colors that have a predic@@ table de@@ viation from the actually photograp@@ hed or sc@@ anned colors . with a colour@@ ing work@@ flow you can reach that the colors on your monitor which are from your camera or scanner and that the colors will print you or on the web publish them from your digital dark@@ room .
&quot; if the topic comes in color administration , everybody wants to know which buttons , he has to press for the results that he wants . unfortunately , the meaning of this tutorial is to give you sufficient background information about color management . &quot;
&quot; if your photo flow will be filled with all six below criteria , then you do not have to worry about color management . &quot;
you are working on a monitor which is available on the s@@ R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum . ( further information can be found below )
your only other pictures are sent by e @-@ mail or the web where s@@ R@@ GB of de @-@ fac@@ to standard .
&quot; so if s@@ R@@ GB is so good working and life for all so easy , why should one use another color room and have to make thoughts about color @-@ wo@@ unds ? &quot;
&quot; a visual example of limitation of s@@ R@@ GB compared to the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colours we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ es region , and the colors in the s@@ R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum , the tri@@ angular region . &quot;
&quot; if you would like to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ R@@ GB with some larger farms , so visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms excell@@ ente page and then click on information and then to information About R@@ GB Working Sp@@ aces . &quot;
do I have to put my monitor c@@ alli@@ graphy when I decided to work with a s@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum ?
&quot; yes ! whether you are working in the s@@ R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum or not , you must start your monitor c@@ alli@@ graphy , since s@@ R@@ GB is that you start your monitor on s@@ R@@ GB k@@ alli@@ g@@ ert . if you are working as in the Far@@ br@@ aum of s@@ R@@ GB , you have to use either your monitor on the s@@ R@@ GB standard , use a pass@@ able monitor profile or both . &quot;

&quot; this tool provides five automatic cor@@ rec@@ tions , which can improve a picture in most cases . use it , before you try further brake processing . &quot;
&quot; the functions normal@@ ise the same , automation and contrast from the menu Cor@@ rig@@ ate Autom@@ atic correction will try to make the best of your colors the best . you will have experim@@ enting with these effects , to see which is best in your photo . &quot;
&quot; normal@@ ization : this method is scal@@ ding the lumin@@ osity values via the entire picture , so the dark@@ est point is black and the bright@@ est point is as bright as possible . this feature is often a magical correction for pictures that are dark or balanced . &quot;
&quot; the same : this method don@@ ated the lumin@@ aires of the colors of the selected image , so that the history of the int@@ ens@@ or range is the same number of pixels . sometimes it is a very powerful surgery , which means either wonder at one image or destroyed it . &quot;
&quot; automation : this method maxim@@ izes the color range in the red , green and blu@@ epr@@ int . you find the dark and bright mar@@ sh@@ ones and adjust the red , green and blu@@ epr@@ int on the entire hist@@ o@@ gram@@ m@@ range . &quot;
contrast : this method improves the contrast and the lumin@@ osity of the R@@ GB values of an image by move the lowest and highest values on the highest possible area and a new c@@ ist@@ ement of all values in between . this is only visible when chosen pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos .
&quot; the Weiß@@ ab@@ by &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted , is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white @-@ off of a photo . &quot;
&quot; the white @-@ off correction is somewhat limited because of a color @-@ room with 8 @-@ bit per suit . in case you can do so far from the original image , in case you can perform the whit@@ eboard in the raw mode , which will allow you to better decline in the 16 @-@ bit mode . &quot;
this tool is based on a Weiß@@ ab@@ equ@@ ation algorith@@ m by copyright of Paw@@ el T. Jo@@ ch@@ ym . you will start with the menu item white @-@ out of the image processing .
&quot; the show@@ case can be adjusted in size . on the left side , the original picture can be adapted to the original image and the preview of the tool . &quot;
the preview of the Target has a red mar@@ ker . the L@@ umin@@ ous of the Pix@@ els is shown as vertical line in the history .
&quot; on the right above , a Hist@@ ogra@@ m is shown that dynam@@ ically is changed once you have a parameter . this Hist@@ ogra@@ m is very helpful since you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is shown . the sum is called l@@ umin@@ ous . &quot;
the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and Gamma . the shadow adjustment lets you improve the attend@@ ance of your photos or also desc@@ end di@@ mming . &quot;
&quot; using the above controls , you should use the color temperature @-@ pi@@ p@@ ette . press on this kno@@ b and then anywhere in the image in order to use the color temperature of the white cover . in this way the temperature and green value are automatically set . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can set the white @-@ off with the list of pres@@ ets . the following settings are available : &quot;
the Trans@@ itional Indi@@ k@@ ator increases the colours if more than a color @-@ channel of the Pix@@ els is over@@ exposed .. you will see the combined result in the white indicator . this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final picture .
the buttons made as well and charging exactly this . each setting of the whit@@ ish you have put you can save in a text file and re@@ load later .
&quot; the button pres@@ ets apply all the filter values back to their default values and the corresponding neutral country . note that also neutral settings will be a different photo than your original . if you store it , your original image will change . &quot;
&quot; you can set up the Kodi@@ er@@ un@@ sti@@ ef@@ e per suit @-@ channel of the be@@ et image . 8 @-@ bit code is the widely used JPEG @-@ format , 16 @-@ bit co@@ ding is better for high @-@ quality images . this co@@ ding requires even more record size , PN@@ M , TIFF and DNG to the formats PNG , PN@@ M , TIFF and DNG . &quot;
this tool opens the same dialog as the processing of raw materials . it uses the change and instruction from color @-@ filters . colour mapping can be performed by the sub@@ window for the use of colour models . a detailed guide for the use of colour @-@ fil@@ s can draw the chapter color administration .
&quot; another important tool is available in the menu under colors sound cor@@ rec@@ tions . this tool provides an integrated path to adjust to multiple colour can@@ als at the same time . this is helpful if your camera or your scanner always do the same error , and you can always need the same correction . in the manual on the sound cor@@ rec@@ tions you will find more information . &quot;
a very powerful way to correct vis@@ ing problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
&quot; the &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted , tool colour effects provides you with four color effects , a solar cell effect , a vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a cant@@ onal filter . &quot;
&quot; in times of the chemical processing was Solar@@ isation , also known as Sab@@ ati@@ er , the effect of the picture was completed , the colored , dar@@ ker areas shel@@ tered , and then the color of the picture was completed . the result was a shared neg@@ atively of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine . &quot;
the intensity controls the solar isation . at about 50 % intensity shows the image which is chem@@ ically possible . another will finally creates a negative picture that is not to create phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier .
this is an example of the solar system . the original image is the ( 1 ) and which is processed ( 2 ) . the standard intensity is 30 % .
&quot; the VI@@ V@@ ID filters were simul@@ ated the so called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it is different from a satur@@ ation , that he makes a stronger contradiction , that makes the colors brilliant and glow . try it easy , he em@@ bell@@ ished many photos . &quot;
&quot; the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for his smooth picture structure . Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for his smooth images . Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for his smooth picture structure . Vel@@ vi@@ as strongly satur@@ ated colors are also some photographs , especially those of the barely landscapes ab@@ stain@@ ed too much . &quot;
the neo @-@ filter simul@@ ated ne@@ on@@ light to the contra@@ sts . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the sli@@ der re@@ ps the strength of the Ne@@ on@@ light . at large images the filter can turn the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often want to correct problems with light conditions and it is therefore not un@@ common that you can change the color con@@ tours and the lumin@@ osity of the photo . you can experiment with the different color effects of your photo with the tools in the menu . once you are satisfied with the result you can use the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
&quot; if you can make a photo with bad light conditions , you can get the reverse problem : one too much sati@@ ation . even in this case the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation will be able to reduce the reduction . all changes you can perform in the preview . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k . &quot;
&quot; between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ osity / contrast / Gamma is the tool ton@@ ed correction to improve the exposure . even if the dialog to this tool seems to be very complicated , you need for the sli@@ der only in the section of the sli@@ der . specifically the three sli@@ ders below the Hist@@ o@@ program . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graph of the intensity values , a Hist@@ ogra@@ m , the active channel or the selected area . under the graph@@ s are three sli@@ der into the image and to change the left side , the dark side represents the dark and the right side to the bright areas . &quot;
the easiest way to learn the operation is to move the regul@@ ator and pay attention to it as the image changes .
&quot; on the right side , the original and preview of the picture can be viewed . preview is dynamic , based on the settings of the image , updated . on the left hand , the following options are available . &quot;
sc@@ aling : with this drop@@ down box can be adjusted whether the hist@@ am@@ os is shown with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y @-@ axis . for pictures of a digital camera is often domin@@ ates the linear history of a single pillar . in this case the logical hist@@ ories is dominated by a single pillar . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic division will be useful .
&quot; three Reg@@ ulators : the top for the dark sounds , the middle of the bright sounds and the lowest for medium tones , often gam@@ ble values . &quot;
&quot; the three color @-@ p@@ aves can be used in the preview of the original photo , to adjust the input values of the shade , middle and bright sounds automatically . in addition , there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment . &quot;
output levels : the output levels allow the output values to change the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controllers to change the output levels . the compression of the output values can be used as a background to create something else in the background .
&quot; automatically : with this button , the image values will be automatically set depending on the terms of the image values . &quot;
&quot; save as and shop : with these buttons , the values stored in the files@@ ystem is stored and later loaded . &quot;
&quot; when you use this mode and the three color pi@@ p@@ ettes , the input values will be automatically re@@ read@@ ed for all shades , means and Sundays and click on the preview of the original rating of the hist@@ o@@ program for red , green , blue , and the lumin@@ aire channels . &quot;
&quot; option Over@@ se@@ ated Indi@@ c@@ ator controls all color channels to display over@@ coated pix@@ el and you can display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , that means you get the effect only in the preview and it is not a effect in the final result . &quot;
below you can see an example of the adjustment of the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and Alpha channel , as well as the output levels are unchanged . the original picture is marked ( 1 ) and the correct@@ ed image with ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left side , half of the origin@@ als and the target image is displayed . the preview is dynam@@ ically updated depending on your settings . on the right hand , the following options are available : &quot;
modifications : this drop@@ down box allows to specify the channel which is modified by the module :
&quot; apart from this box , there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for pictures with large areas of a constant color , the linear mode creates a wide beams . in this case the logical mode will help the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you move to the right , e.g. the bright sounds , then you can see that these bright sounds can correspond to a dar@@ ker for@@ ks and that correspond to the pix@@ el pix@@ el . &quot;
&quot; on the preview of the original pictures is a red mark@@ ings to see . if you want to change this marking onto the area you want to change the original line . create a point on this line and move it up and down , until the value is adjusted to your taste . &quot;
save as and shop : with these buttons you can do exactly this . each curve you can make this can be saved to the files@@ ystem and later be loaded . the file format is the Gimp Kur@@ ven@@ format .
&quot; if you create this method and the three color pi@@ p@@ ettes automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of sh@@ adows , central and sun @-@ tones . &quot;
&quot; in more than one channel over@@ switch pixels , you can view the combined pix@@ el . if you are shown in more than one channel , you get the combined result only in the preview and it is not a effect in the final result . &quot;
below you can see a black / white photo which was correct@@ ed in the lumin@@ aire channel . sch@@ ad@@ - and sun @-@ tints has been set with the color @-@ pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves ( 1 ) and the original one ( 2 ) .
the canal @-@ Mixer of &amp; di@@ gi@@ an ; imaging is a tool to improve the colour @-@ channels or change the shade of the photos .
the channel @-@ Mixer is another high @-@ developed tool to mix the colour @-@ tones of images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel bl@@ ender of imaging .
&quot; with the can@@ op@@ tionally box , you can select the color for the Hist@@ ogra@@ m : this gives you a first notice how you can correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash . the left section of the window shows you a preview . the original one can refer to the comparison of your own rider . &quot;
the preview of the destination has a red mar@@ ker . if you position this in the picture a vertical line appears in the hist@@ ogra@@ m to show you the appropriate colour .
&quot; the controls for the module are right down : regul@@ ator for red , green and construction allow you to change these channels . if you also activate the corresponding color components . this is especially convenient if you also use the appropriate color components . this is especially convenient if you can also reduce the appropriate color components . this is especially convenient if you can also reduce the appropriate color components . this is especially convenient if you can also reduce the appropriate color @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green canal for black and white portraits . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially if you mix Mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a color comes to a visible noise , which does not appear in the same place in the color channel . fern@@ s is not at the same place in the color channel . color , which is the case you can reduce your mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion in which you can reduce the color . &quot;
the stor@@ ing and charging buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any bl@@ ender setup can save you for later and then download . using the file format is the Gimp channel bl@@ ender format .
&quot; option Over@@ se@@ ated Indi@@ c@@ ator controls all color channels to display over@@ coated pix@@ el and you can display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , that means you get the effect only in the preview and it is not a effect in the final result . &quot;
below you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been re @-@ read@@ ed . the original version is enabled ( 1 ) and the original picture is under ( 2 ) .
&quot; black / white photography has always been intrigu@@ ing because of your abstr@@ action capability . with the development of digital photography is black / white , as well as color pictures can be converted simply on the computer . also with a set of film files . &quot;
&quot; Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3200 , Il@@ ford F@@ P4 Plus , Il@@ ford Pan@@ F Plus , Il@@ ford XP@@ 2 Super &quot;
&quot; green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white cast coating with a green lens filter . this looks good , with all sets of scene and fits in particular well with portraits against the sky . &quot;
&quot; Oran@@ ge@@ il@@ ter : simul@@ ates a black / white cast coating with a orange lin@@ ens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and air @-@ pics . thus similar to the 002 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) Oran@@ ge@@ il@@ ter . &quot;
rot@@ filter : simul@@ ated a black / white cast coating with a red lens filter . this creates dram@@ ati@@ cal effects and can simul@@ ate Moon ts@@ p . thus similar to the 003 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) Rot@@ filter .
yel@@ low@@ case : simul@@ ates a black / white cast coating with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color cor@@ rec@@ tions and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) .
Sep@@ i@@ aton : generates warm bright and medium tones while he adds a bit of cold in the shadow of a pressure and the re @-@ development in a Sep@@ iat@@ ric . this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and with it similar to the 005 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
using the &amp; di@@ gi@@ d ; tool texture you can use decorative textures on an image .
&quot; through the addition of a texture to your image , whether there is a color image or not , you can look like an oil painting , a pop@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or just like a wall @-@ image on a wall . the menu of image image use of imaging can be used for this purpose . &quot;
relief : move this parameter to the right increases the depth of the depth or tri@@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the picture .
a paper texture is applied at the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) . the parameter relief is set to 200 .
with the &amp; di@@ gi@@ a ; tool frame can add a decorative frame to add a picture .
to keep the eye of an ob@@ server in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . a way to keep his attention is to put the image a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the ambitious eye . under the frame the module can be started out of the image processing .
&quot; type : with this parameter you set the desired Rah@@ ment@@ yp for your picture . continuously embr@@ aced the image with a large line and a wide frame ( ideal for black / white pictures ) , f@@ avo@@ ids it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame that is ideal for a stic@@ ker and decorative frame with designs . &quot;
width : returns the width of the frame in percent . the value for width is from 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; it is bigger than the original , but the original aspect ratio is greater than the original , but the same side aspect ratio . this is important for printing of images , especially if you have used the tool after side ratio before . &quot;
&quot; with this practical tool , you can easily insert a large @-@ format text into an image at any time . this also goes to several places if you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to user . simply type the text and place it with the mouse . use texture , orientation , color from the color size and the character set . you &apos;ll simply select a frame around the text and / or a half @-@ sight@@ ed background . already the image is ready . &quot;
&quot; each setting that you have chosen for your text may change until you press the button &quot; OK . &quot; once the image has been saved , the text is part of the picture . it cannot be changed . &quot;
&quot; with the &amp; di@@ gi@@ d , tool sten@@ cil , you can create a sch@@ ema on a picture . &quot;
the menu picture sten@@ cil can be used in the image processing can be used to put sten@@ cils over a picture .
&quot; for the sch@@ ema , there are no restrictions on the size and orientation . you need to add the PNG file format and should be used with maximum compression ( 9 ) to the reduction of the file size of the model ; please send you an e @-@ mail in English to the &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; mail@@ ing list di@@ gi@@ fted @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .. &quot;
if you use this tool to first use your template folder with the button bas@@ eboard in the dialog . select the folder in which you are copied to the template folder . these settings will be required for the next start .
&quot; after the throw @-@ folder for the sten@@ cils , it appears a building view which reflects the folder structure of the template &apos;s folder . the selection of an folder updates automatically . &quot;
&quot; under the preview , three buttons with which you can change the enlar@@ ging actor and the position of your image . &quot;
enlarge : this kno@@ b magni@@ fies the following picture . it is c@@ entered to the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
&quot; to be reduced : this kno@@ b shr@@ ink the same picture . in case you want to apply the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the sch@@ ema on the whole picture , you must im@@ press the image according to the left mouse button . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
move : use this button to move the picture below to drag the picture . take the picture and place it at the desired position .
use OK if you want to use the sch@@ ema on your image . the image will then be adapted to the spect@@ ators .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; provides three different tools to the edge . each one of you has benefits in other fields .
&quot; shar@@ pen@@ ing is a traditional tool to the edge . it is very fast and simple , but produces especially in dark areas , gran@@ ular images . &quot;
&quot; un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing mask works on the contrast of the edges to look like a picture . indeed it is not a bit , it works rather psych@@ otherap@@ ist . you can use it to remove atmosph@@ eric ha@@ ste and it makes a really good job . the algorith@@ m was taken from Gimp and it is copy@@ right@@ ed by W@@ inst@@ on Chang . &quot;
&quot; refer@@ r@@ ussi@@ onist is possibly the best of the three , since it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little complicated in its application and has different parameters to adapt . &quot;
photos without focus as well as most digit@@ ised pictures need a correction of sharp@@ ness . this is because of the dig@@ itiz@@ ation process needs to be combined with only minimal differences . the same phenomenon can be observed if suit @-@ points are printed on paper . SL@@ R cameras require more down@@ rig@@ ation than normal cameras for the private application .
at JPEG @-@ images often have been applied to an camera internal sharp@@ ness . images in the pipe @-@ format however must always be shar@@ pen@@ ed during processing .
&quot; some scanner apply an archipelago during the entry of the picture . if you activate this de@@ activation , you get control of your image . &quot;
&quot; in some situations you can get usable results by pressing a photo with the shar@@ pen@@ ing tool . you can call with the menu item Kor@@ rig@@ ate sharp@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; however , you should deal with careful as the results do not seem very natural : the sharp@@ ness increases the edge of the edges , but also rein@@ car@@ es the noise . in general , the most suitable technique for shar@@ pen@@ ing a picture . you can find out more information and a comparison of all techniques to the sharp@@ ness . &quot;
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ ack . the solution to draw a little soft and experiment with the menu item cor@@ rig@@ ate soft@@ ener and experiment some with settings . the pre @-@ window on the right side of dialogue will show you the effect on your photo .
the filter un@@ sharp masculine is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and the preview can help edit the image . the show@@ case shows the output of the fil@@ ters with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius , and the amount . the default values may generate good results and should be tried first . an increase in radius or the amount will enhance the effect . if you create the bum@@ per mask , the noise and the impression of gr@@ ats in the vicinity of sharp edges . &quot;
the radius represents a like many pix@@ el to each side of a edge by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow greater radi@@ ans . you should therefore increase images of the best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the caught image which is added to the original one that becomes the strength of the sharp@@ ness .
&quot; the sw@@ ell@@ as is a break from the maximum R@@ GB value and to apply differ@@ ential difference . it can be applied to a minimum difference for a edge of the filter . in this way areas , areas with a soft change between the tones of shar@@ pen@@ ing and therefore avoid fl@@ aw in faces , cross@@ roads and water surfaces . &quot;
this is an example of the un@@ sharp masculine filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the worked picture ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp masks was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a spon@@ ge = 0.0 . &quot;
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; tool ref@@ using a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used to use the copy@@ right@@ ed un@@ folding @-@ filters algorith@@ m by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries to undo an image to &amp; quot ; re@@ foc@@ uss@@ ed ; in which there is better approach than just trying the photo . it uses better results than un@@ sharp masculine . you can start it from the menu by using colors Ref@@ ok@@ ussi@@ onist in the image processing .
&quot; in practice the circular design works much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos; sche F@@ altung . the Gau@@ ß &apos; sche F@@ altung has a very long tail , which is widely affected by the original pix@@ el pix@@ el . the FI@@ R Wiener In@@ verse the Gau@@ ß &apos; will depend on most cases even greatly from the distant pix@@ el . it causes unwanted results . &quot;
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the key parameter for the use of this module . it is the most important parameter for the use of this module . for most pictures the default value should set 1 good results . you can put a higher value when your image should be very un@@ sharp then to Heiligen@@ sch@@ a .
cor@@ relation : an increase in cor@@ relation can help reduce arti@@ facts . the cor@@ relation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and the values near 1 , &amp; eg ; 0,95 and medium . a high value for cor@@ relation reduces the sharp@@ ly effect of the module . &quot;
Rau@@ sch@@ filter : an increase in the sound filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . however , values higher than 0.1 only rarely . if the spac@@ ing filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 is the image quality very poor . a high value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value the image will be even more poll@@ uted . &quot;
&quot; Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness . use this parameter if your un@@ sharp@@ ness of Gau@@ ß is . in most cases you should use this value to 0 , to avoid annoying arti@@ facts . in most cases you should use this value to 0 , so you might need to increase the cor@@ relation and / o@@ der@@ den sound filter . &quot;
note : this value determines the size of transform@@ ation@@ sm@@ at@@ rix . an increase in the mattress size can have good results especially if you choose large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the Gau@@ ß &apos; &apos;s sharp@@ ness . note that the module is very slow if you choose large values for this parameter . in most cases you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
&quot; the stor@@ ing and charging buttons are used precisely for this purpose . any set of refer@@ r@@ ussi@@ onist parameters you have set , thus can be saved for later and can be loaded . &quot;
&quot; try to perform all the tri@@ mm@@ ers , dy@@ es and int@@ ens@@ or rec@@ tions on the picture before using the module before using the module . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , you should use the module before you change the image and change it . the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible , but the later uncomfortable arti@@ facts left . &quot;
&quot; if you can read pictures and com@@ press , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image . &quot;
generally producing un@@ sharp masks better results than sharp@@ ness . this could be caused by the un@@ sharp mas@@ king a larger neighborhood as sharp@@ ness .
&quot; theore@@ tically , the result of the FI@@ R Vienna Fil@@ ters has to show that it is the optimal lin@@ e@@ are filters . practically the result of the FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ ters can always be at least as good as the in@@ sharp@@ ness mask . the FI@@ R Wiener filter is often better at the processing of small details . &quot;
&quot; below you can see a comparison between different filters , on a small un@@ foc@@ uss@@ ed image , see : &quot;
the original un@@ sharp color picture has to be correct@@ ed . this picture has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to in@@ sufficient light for the car @-@ focus lens .
&quot; for more information about the methods of sharp@@ ness in digital images , you can read a technical comparison of English at this address . &quot;
the regul@@ ator gl@@ oss@@ ary sets the in@@ sharp@@ ness of the en@@ closure of the dr@@ unk in order to create a natural p@@ ou@@ ille .
&quot; the inks allows a customized color for the p@@ up@@ ter . in case you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can adjust this here . &quot;
the tool picture @-@ fail@@ ing is one of the most advanced tool to remove not desired arti@@ facts with un@@ preced@@ ented speed .
the in@@ cision algorith@@ m was developed by the I@@ MAGE Team of the GRE@@ C CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains various pres@@ ets as a starting point to simplify the restoration of the restoration . the available pres@@ ets are listed below :
&quot; if you want to adjust the filter@@ ing settings , you can use the rider and advanced settings . &quot;
&quot; vis@@ c@@ ue p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the maintenance of details . a small value leads to a uniform gl@@ oss@@ oms and details are sharp , please note that there should be no sharp@@ ness needed more homogen@@ eous regions . please note that no sharp@@ ness should be retro@@ spec@@ tiv@@ ely necessary . please note that no sharp@@ ness should be retro@@ spec@@ tiv@@ ely necessary . please note that no sharp@@ ness should be retro@@ spec@@ tiv@@ ely necessary . please note that the details of the details will always be sub@@ ordin@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; direc@@ tional alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es even@@ ly in all directions , while having a value close to 1 only in one direction . if you create a film gr@@ itt , or C@@ CD noise will produce a high value of cor@@ rupt patterns . JPEG Art@@ ef@@ acts will be best at a value near 1 . &quot;
&quot; &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum gl@@ ucose actor over all@@ . p then defines the relative smo@@ othing . put this value to the degree of noise in your image . &quot;
&quot; &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , as it is difficult to create the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s Tur@@ bul@@ bs effect , it must be set higher than 3 . &quot;
repet@@ itions : there is how often the algorith@@ m is running through . normally 1 or 2 is sufficient .
&quot; con@@ tra @-@ angle gradu@@ al da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic Alpha . if Alpha is selected too , you should also be selected for a long time . you should therefore choose that small corner is acceptable and acceptable to your needs . &quot;
integr@@ als step@@ width &#91; 0.1 , 10 &#93; : integr@@ als step@@ width in pixels . you should use the value small 1 to avoid sub @-@ pix@@ el smo@@ othing and never bigger than 2 . &quot;
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation use : the more quality that you get through selection of this option is only low . it dou@@ bles the duration . we recommend it to allow it to happen .
the buttons Save as and charging exactly this . each setting of images can be adjusted hereby in a text file and later be loaded again .
images correct is compar@@ atively very fast when working . it can still last very long and make a high CPU load after moving . you can therefore break the calculation using the button off .
below you can see how imaging can be correct@@ ed with little art@@ ef@@ acts . the module is applied to a photo that was applied to Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you see there is a peculi@@ ar black arti@@ fact in the journey to see and the original image is under ( 1 ) and the correct@@ ed image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ant was a very powerful tool to reduce the smok@@ er . it uses a copy@@ right@@ ed algorith@@ m by Peter Heck@@ ert .
&quot; this tool provides sel@@ ectable imaging filter available to remove patches and other arti@@ facts , which can be used e.g. by dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor people from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ es ; -@@ effects of one @-@ sc@@ anned images from books or magazines . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information on the cases of digital cameras , so you can read this in English in this tutorial . &quot;
the screenshot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gran@@ ular spac@@ er that can be successfully removed with this tool .
&quot; in most cases , you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases you only need the sub @-@ window details and the sub@@ window of advanced settings may remain in default settings . &quot;
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) which is used for the filter . large values increase the time of the filters per pix@@ el . the image of the image is moving across the image and the color in it is inserted and hence minor errors . &quot;
&quot; sharp@@ ness : this value reduces the pix@@ el levels of the filter to the front look at the front of the filter . if it is increased , you may need to change the edges . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter details can no longer be preserved and rus@@ hing or lubric@@ ate up again . &quot;
edges : controls the cant@@ een accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong cannot change the whole rus@@ hing or noise tips . put it on a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak ro@@ aring or JPEG @-@ art@@ ef@@ acts without losing the details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ osity of the image . we recommend you to change colour or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smo@@ othing process by the details of the screen .
color : controls the colour @-@ toler@@ ant of the image . we recommend you either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smo@@ othing process by the details of the screen .
&quot; Gamma : controls the gam@@ bling intoler@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase the toler@@ ances of the dar@@ ker areas , which typically consume stronger , but it also poll@@ uted the shade . &quot;
&quot; atten@@ u@@ ation : controls the adjustment of Ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter@@ d@@ amping . this value determines how fast the adap@@ tive filter radius respon@@ ds to variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is increased , the edges may occur . if he is too high it may occur and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter on the edges . he can remove noise tips and is the recommended method for it . &quot;
&quot; save and store : these buttons are used exactly for this . all parameters used to switch @-@ reduction , which you have set , can be saved into the files@@ ystem and later loaded . &quot;
this is an example of how space @-@ reduction can change your lives . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and that has been fixed with ( 2 ) and the default settings was applied with the default settings .
&quot; sometimes a picture is too cr@@ ack for your purpose . the solution to draw a little soft , is fortunately much easier than a picture . use the menu on the right side of the dialog , shows the effect of this operation on your photo . &quot;
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ an ; photo Rest@@ oration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
&quot; this filter for restoration gives you the opportunity to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts from your pictures . it is very well adapted for Gau@@ ß &apos; German smok@@ er , scrat@@ ches , com@@ pres@@ sive art@@ ef@@ acts and local mistakes that is carried out in digital , original or rep@@ lic@@ ated digit@@ ised pictures . the smo@@ othing takes place along the image con@@ tours and thus gets the content as well as the human eye . &quot;
&quot; the algorith@@ m can be used for color and tex@@ tiles , using a different tool that has been developed using a different tool that has been developed by the I@@ MAGE Team of the GRE@@ C CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ cs , and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
JPEG Art@@ ef@@ acts reduce : the compression of JPEG is not perfect in some areas . as a los@@ sy com@@ pres@@ sion@@ ing algorith@@ m he produces some compression &amp; quot ; Art@@ ef@@ ak@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that can be seen in the un@@ compressed picture . this setting should correct this problem .
the buttons made as well and charging exactly this . each setting of photo @-@ restoration can be saved to a text file and later be loaded again .
photo @-@ restoration is compar@@ atively very fast when working . it can still last very long and make a high CPU load after moving . you can therefore break the calculation using the button .
below you can be restored like a photo with par@@ ap@@ ace noise . the module is applied to a black and white photo that has been applied to a Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensor @-@ sensitivity by 3200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film gr@@ itt of the faces . the original image is under ( 1 ) and that has been fixed under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time textures was reduced to an old color photo that has been applied with a scanner that has been caused by the sc@@ ann@@ er@@ lighting and phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the correct@@ ed image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the &amp; di@@ gi@@ el ; tool Hot@@ pix@@ el allows for a pix@@ el of photos that are used with a C@@ CD camera , eight . it is using algorith@@ ms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pix@@ i project , protected by Martin Dick@@ op@@ p . &quot;
&quot; bright , tot@@ e or hot pix@@ el are particularly high with high quality raw materials photos a problem , as many cameras with JPEG compression over a built @-@ in repression for hot pix@@ el . &quot;
&quot; this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; my pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; in a photo with a dark@@ picture sub@@ contr@@ actor method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pix@@ el . &quot;
download this file in the wiz@@ ard with the button dark@@ picture . the tool will automatically identify the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the picture .
&quot; if you have an old digital camera , it is important that you can capture the dark@@ picture directly below to discover new hot or bright pixels by C@@ CD def@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should download the appropriate dark picture to the correct@@ ing picture . an automatic processing of the dark picture will notice the bad pix@@ el . note that the wiz@@ ard will notice the last dark picture and this automatically invites you to the next session . &quot;
the picture area and the preview can help you correct the result within the image . the show@@ case shows the output of the filter with the current settings . poor pixels are highlighted in all prejudi@@ ce .
select an area around the def@@ ective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then choose the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ishes these pix@@ el blocks . these are the available filters :
&quot; Dur@@ ing : it is an average of the neighboring pix@@ el . it is shown on an average of the neighboring pix@@ el . it is assigned to each def@@ ective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is done separately for horizontal and vertical line . &quot;
linear : all pixels are drawn up a distance of 1 from the Pix@@ el@@ block to calculate a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) .
square : this is the standard filter@@ ing method . all pix@@ el with a distance of 2 or less on the Pix@@ el@@ block to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of quad@@ r@@ atic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) or a group of quad@@ r@@ atic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pix@@ el in the block .
&quot; cu@@ bic : all pix@@ el pul@@ led with a distance of 3 or less , to calculate a bi @-@ Cub@@ an surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cub@@ es curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ishing the def@@ ective pixels in the block . &quot;
below you can see the Hot@@ pix@@ el correction to a color photo , from a def@@ ective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original picture has been enlarged over 300 % ( 1 ) and the correct@@ ed image is under ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; di@@ di@@ gi@@ fted ; Vig@@ net@@ work@@ di@@ er.com is a tool to correct the vig@@ or , i.e. sub@@ str@@ ated corners , an image . &quot;
&quot; fo@@ resi@@ ght objective , especially those in the middle and large camera format , can often not illumin@@ ate the entire sensor area . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ nette quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they can reduce the corners and edges of the picture by reducing the light the sensor there . Tele@@ objective show under circumstances also . &quot;
&quot; but it also has draw@@ backs . many Center @-@ filters require a factor 1.5 or 2 at Bl@@ ending filter , which should be necessary to keep the camera with the hand . fo@@ resi@@ ght object , even with center @-@ filters , an opening of f / 16 or smaller , as otherwise un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing effects arise through movement . &quot;
&quot; the effect of a Center@@ filter is applied by digital cameras and film scanner , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a Center@@ filter by using an ä@@ qui@@ val@@ ent transformation into a raw filter by using a Center@@ filter to a picture . the algorith@@ m is protected by John Walker . &quot;
&quot; with three controllers , you can control the Vig@@ net@@ tier@@ rez filter and with three further the exposure of the target audience . &quot;
&quot; dense density : this parameter controls the degree of light ampli@@ fication at the point of the largest density the filter . the default density is 2.0 , what a optical filter with a fl@@ ecting setting of 2 , un@@ lock cre@@ ases , reduce the density of a larger degree of vig@@ or , reduce it to compens@@ ate for a small degree . &quot;
&quot; lumin@@ osity , contrast , and Gamma @-@ settings : the processing of an image with the Vig@@ net@@ work@@ ism reduces the lumin@@ osity of the pixels . you need to re @-@ adjust the exposure of the target audience with these options , as you only need to increase the settings . &quot;
if you want a host@@ ile re@@ juven@@ ation of the goal of the target you let the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / Gamma for zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; di@@ gi@@ us ; image processing of the menu color gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the composition correct@@ ed to an image . the original picture ( 1 ) shows the appearance in the corners and ( 2 ) the correct@@ ed image . a leu@@ ch@@ stronger ke@@ - and contradiction structure has also been carried out in the image with this tool .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ d was a tool to correct the effect of spher@@ ical lenses in photos . it uses a copy@@ right@@ ed algorith@@ m from David Ho@@ d@@ son .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric dist@@ or@@ tions . colour dist@@ or@@ tions can not be correct@@ ed with this tool .
the co@@ efficient of the second gra@@ vation is treated the general geomet@@ ric dist@@ ortion of lens and can correct the con@@ cave or con@@ v@@ ex form of the image .
&quot; the co@@ efficient of the third gra@@ des has a similar circuit , but also on edges . this correction will not be used in the tool . &quot;
the Ko@@ efficient fourth Gra@@ des correct@@ ed the remote fac@@ ets to that of the second Gra@@ des . if you combine these two can eliminate any geomet@@ ric dist@@ ortion .
general : this value controls the strength of dist@@ ortion second gra@@ zing . with negative values can be correct@@ ed and positive values of kis@@ sing dist@@ ortion .
&quot; a corner : this value controls the strength of the dist@@ ortion fourth grades . this value appears stronger at the edges than in the middle of the image . for most lenses , the &apos; corners parameter has the &apos; corners parameter the circum@@ fer@@ y sign of the parameter . &quot;
&quot; zoom : this value is scal@@ ed the image size and thus leads to a correction of the first grades . negative values , while positive the image is reduced . &quot;
&quot; bright : this value increases the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values they increase . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best filter settings , illustr@@ ates the dialogue with a preview the dist@@ ortion correct@@ ed . the values you use for your image will be saved and used in the next start as standard values . &quot;
&quot; the tonn@@ age or ho@@ vercraft correction should be performed before all of the l@@ apping or sizes . best , you perform this correction as all the first . if you create an image and then perform a tonn@@ age correction would be the effect of apparent . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best correction to you , this tool will show you a vertical and horizontal auxiliary line . move it to an important place , such as the marine edge or a building wall , in your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this place . afterwards , you can correct the tonn@@ age / kis@@ sing dist@@ ortion with the help of the lines . &quot;
&quot; if you correct a cus@@ hion dist@@ ortion , the resul@@ t@@ ant picture will have black corners . you can remove them with the plug @-@ in tool in the menu transform@@ ers to remove from the image processing , or over the zoom regul@@ ator of this dialogue . &quot;
&quot; for most images , the Tonn@@ age ranges from the front . the next logical step for some mot@@ ives from the front , frames and painting , it is the perspective to correct any angle in the picture 90 degrees . note that if you keep the camera with the hand you will always keep an easy dist@@ ortion of perspective . &quot;
this is an example of the tonn@@ age correction to a church in Norway . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the correct@@ ed image below ( 2 ) .
the algorith@@ m is based on a method of simul@@ ate Infr@@ ar@@ ot@@ film of the G@@ imp@@ cu@@ u@@ .org Website that is available under this URL ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ i@@ ot@@ film , see this URL . this film has a sensation of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
&quot; in the left side of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse , you can see the effect on different parts of the image . &quot;
&quot; below the preview can set up two parameters , if you want to simul@@ ate the gran@@ ular texture of a highly sensitive movie . the ISO regul@@ ator changes the amount of film gr@@ itt and the domin@@ ance of colour green ( chlor@@ ophyll in nature ) in the transformation . green law@@ ns will know like snow ! &quot;
&quot; since the filter colour can@@ als to re@@ produce an infr@@ ar@@ ed feature , especially the green @-@ channel does not make sense to use the effect on black / white photos , as the bul@@ bs are missing . &quot;
this is an example of the infr@@ ar@@ ed film product in New Zealand . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the original picture under ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film has been set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a kind of aura within the re@@ pro@@ ving .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; filter film gr@@ itt is an easy to use tool to re@@ produce film gr@@ itt in your pictures . this is known from classical high @-@ speed filters such as the B / W Kodak Tri @-@ X . to raise the manufacturer of great silver @-@ grain of the photo em@@ ulsion .
&quot; the film @-@ gran@@ ular effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . the untreated picture gets a timeless atmosphere away from everyday life . if you want this specific , gallery @-@ like , rhin@@ estones , gran@@ ular sight specifically in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , so you must use this filter . &quot;
&quot; with the regul@@ ator , the ISO @-@ sensitivity can be used to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the Kör@@ ner calibr@@ ated . the default value is , although often higher values need to be adjusted to ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need more bas@@ kets , so you can use the filters several times . &quot;
this is an example of the film @-@ gran@@ ular image based on a black / W photo . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that worked the ( 2 ) . the used film @-@ sensitive corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ an ; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it is used to have a copy@@ right@@ ed algorith@@ m from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ an ; filter oil painting gives your digital images a nice appearance like an oil painting . natural pictures and style live are good for this effect .
&quot; there are two controllers to influence this effect . the top select the brush size between one and five . thicker brush are suitable for large images . smooth controlled the smooth@@ ie or , from the other side , the mal@@ ign@@ ancy . &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original picture is marked with ( 1 ) and the Ed@@ iting is marked with the ( 2 ) .
&quot; the &amp; di@@ gi@@ d ; filter coal drawing use dy@@ es and int@@ ens@@ itive gra@@ dient to produce a carbon teles@@ cope . images of their gra@@ dients are gradually changing slowly and therefore not ideal for this effect . it &apos;s helpful if you would like to have chosen the scene you would have chosen to sk@@ iz@@ zes you . this would be good pictures to start doing so . &quot;
&quot; there are two controllers with a value area of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper regul@@ ator elect the foundation size and the lower is the contrast ( smo@@ othing ) . &quot;
this is an example of the Carbon @-@ label filters . the original image ( 1 ) and the altered picture ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used . the result can be further improved by adaptation of the output value .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ an ; filter engra@@ ving character@@ izes your picture in 3 @-@ D as if it was stre@@ amed into wax . it is used by a copy@@ right@@ ed algorith@@ m from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
&quot; the gra@@ dient , filter engra@@ ving is a quick tool to give your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . he works especially well in pictures with a simple structure , where color is not the most important part of the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity , to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ oton@@ ous landscape . &quot;
&quot; the depth allows the contrast of filter@@ ing . a value of 30 , equivalent to 10 % , is the default . &quot;
this is an example of the engra@@ ving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the worked picture ( 2 ) . the depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo to a artwork by means of dist@@ err@@ isation effects . it is used by protected algorith@@ ms by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave @-@ sticks 1 : shares the image in cells and makes it look like if it is considered by glass bu@@ cks .
wave @-@ blocks 2 : analog to the wave @-@ flo@@ cks 1 becomes the picture here with a different version of glass@@ b@@ bells .
some effects need long time to calculate and create a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time with the button .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo to an art work by un@@ shar@@ per effects . it is used by protected algorith@@ ms by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
&quot; zoom Un@@ shar@@ per : caught the image along the star @-@ shaped lines that go from a center . this simul@@ ates the in@@ sharp@@ ness of a zo@@ om@@ ent camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of often in the sports photography . &quot;
radi@@ al in@@ sharp@@ ness : caught the image by rotation of the pix@@ el to a center . this is simul@@ ated the in@@ sharp@@ ness of a turning camera .
remove the removal : caught the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to come back into the background .
&quot; if the image by horizontal movements of the pix@@ el . this simul@@ ates the in@@ sharp@@ ness of a linear linear moving , z : B : from one car or train photograp@@ hed , camera . &quot;
&quot; soft@@ ener in@@ sharp@@ ness : caught the picture soft in the dark and strong in the bright tones . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle glow . &quot;
&quot; sh@@ atter @-@ sharp@@ ness : caught the image by random shift in the pix@@ el , and simul@@ ates the in@@ sharp@@ ness of a will@@ fully moving camera . &quot;
intelligent bum@@ per : finds the color @-@ bas@@ ins in the picture and know it without change the rest .
&quot; mos@@ aic : shares the photo in rectangular cells and then created it , through the col@@ t with an average pix@@ el value . &quot;
some effects need long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation using the button .
the ra@@ ind@@ ro@@ ps are a nice little tool to make ra@@ ind@@ ro@@ ps on your image . it gives natural your images a n@@ asses look . it uses a Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copy@@ right@@ ed algorith@@ m .
the dro@@ pping size allows you to change the size of the sni@@ p . since the dro@@ pping size does not automatically increase the size for small images . number changes the number and density of the drops . fisher@@ man changes the optical effect of the drops in the picture .
&quot; you can keep using the &amp; di@@ gi@@ d ; image processing a range of rain drops . use the selection tool to select the area , for example , a face which shall remain free and will remain free of ra@@ ind@@ ro@@ ps . &quot;
this is an example of the ra@@ ind@@ ro@@ ps Fil@@ ters . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the worked picture ( 2 ) points a sunset after a storm . the standard values were used for this example .
&quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , so you can bring it through mir@@ rors or rotating in the right orientation . the tools can be found in the menu transform@@ ers and trans@@ former . &quot;
photo infl@@ ates is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo in a minimal loss of image quality .
&quot; a picture to decreased is simple . the big question is , how can you find an image f@@ ade and the details p@@ ains ? how can you find the missing information again or guess ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorith@@ m that is used here is a good job . try it and you will see it yourself . &quot;
if a photo has the wrong size you can change it on the desired size with the tool size change . choose to change size in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is below to see .
&quot; the tool to change size uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method in order to adjust the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool for infl@@ ating . &quot;
many educational programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation such as spl@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorith@@ m photo was developed by the I@@ MAGE Team of the GRE@@ C CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you must say the tool like you want to change the size . these settings are available in the tab New size and are listed below :
&quot; aspect ratio of aspect ratio : when this setting is activated , the entry of the new size is the aspect ratio of the original picture . &quot;
&quot; &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , as it is difficult to create the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s Tur@@ bul@@ ins effect , it must be set higher than 3 . &quot;
the buttons made as well and charging is exactly used . each classification for photo can be saved as text @-@ file and later be loaded again .
&quot; photo infl@@ ates is very fast when it makes , but it can still last very long and draw a high CPU load after moving . you can cancel the calculation using the button . &quot;
you can see below an example of photo @-@ g@@ ases by increasing a small color image on the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged image ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard cl@@ amps .
&quot; cutting a picture is not only a common surgery , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to adjust a picture . the image processing allows you to create a picture with the mouse , pressing the mouse button and drag the rect@@ angle . you &apos;ll see this rect@@ angle then while you move the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you want to release the mouse button again , the area of the photo will be cut off . by doing so you can draw a good overview of how your photo will be cut . you can draw the size of the right away by clicking the corners of the rect@@ angle . a new rect@@ angle can simply drag it up with the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the dis@@ section , use the button of the plug @-@ button of the image processing in the tool@@ bar and the photo will be tailored ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + x ) . use the entries file to store the newly attached photo file . &quot;
&quot; in advance , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in dialogue will remain intact . &quot;
&quot; in the tool after side ratio , you can specify the orientation as high @-@ format or cross @-@ format . in the high format , the larger value of the height and width of the width is assigned to the width . &quot;
&quot; the tool after side ratio is used to cut a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same , regardless of whether you are cen@@ tim@@ eters , in@@ ch or any other physical size . you can also see below a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ers and their aspect ratio . &quot;
at the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to c@@ entered the selection automatically horizontal or vertical .
&quot; at the bottom of the dialog , you can use the Max . ratio button to cut the area to the greatest possible , depending on the chosen relationship and orientation . &quot;
&quot; the tool to cut out aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the orientation ( Horiz@@ ont@@ al or Ver@@ tical ) . if you are using the aggreg@@ ate tool the next time , these settings are stored as default settings depending on the orientation . the altered images are reflected in the EX@@ IF format so that the EX@@ IF data will be reflected in the original image and not the original picture . &quot;
&quot; the settings of the composition , help allow you to assem@@ ble your pictures better . these help are : &quot;
harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic sub@@ ventions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third @-@ reg@@ iment , harmon@@ ic triangles are a way of sharing a rect@@ angle in similar harmon@@ ic triangles . &quot;
&quot; Golden Center : the golden middle is a division of the different natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us bi@@ valve or the leaf leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful . &quot;
&quot; the golden division is the ir@@ rational number 1,6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it has been used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks used to make your temple and pyram@@ ids . artists and architects have used the golden division in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos together to give your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ acci sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; from where each number after 1 equal to the sum of its two numbers is 1 : 1,6@@ 18 the golden middle . a composition that follows this rule is regarded as visual harmon@@ ious . &quot;
the golden middle represents liquid auxiliary lines when you put a picture together . these assistance are listed below :
the Golden Spir@@ als will bring you good results for your photos closer to your goal . compared to the third @-@ party the golden spiral creates a fluid line that leads the view of the beh@@ older along the line of the spiral and creates a balanced flow .
&quot; another rule is the rect@@ angles of the golden spiral , also golden rect@@ angles . it should give something that the eye can be in the center of the composition . that can be a line or different objects . this something can be just because without the eye to guide , it will fulfil its task . &quot;
&quot; the Golden triangles are also guided by the above gold spiral stairs . their ver@@ tices are the mid@@ points of the pages of the golden rect@@ angles . note that in contrast to harmon@@ ic triangles , golden triangles are not equivalent to these lines . diag@@ onal to make these lines a static object can be dynamic . &quot;
if you use golden triangles to break up your frame and create a effect of professional phot@@ ograph@@ s dynamic symm@@ etry . try to place your image focus on one of the inter@@ sections and other visual information in the triangles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot reach any other way .
the options Horiz@@ ont@@ al reflect and Ver@@ tical are used to reflect the harmon@@ ic part .
&quot; with the button color , you can put the color of the auxiliary line . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , you can easily get the auxiliary line . in this way you can adjust the color of the lines of your current image . &quot;
the free rotation is a tool to rot@@ ate a picture to rot@@ ate any angle .
&quot; if you make a photo then it happens easy , that you don &apos;t miss the camera exactly vertical or horizontal . this creates a picture in which the things generated an angle . you can create it with the &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted , image processing and the tool @-@ free rotation , and adjust the target angle . &quot;
&quot; turn your picture with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this sli@@ der are specified in degrees , you can set the sli@@ der back to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture are shown on the top . &quot;
&quot; to your help , the Free Rot@@ ation makes a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse to position the two lines , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now , adjust the angle as described in previous section . &quot;
&quot; after having shot a picture , you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to fix it is the function transformation from the image processing . &quot;
an elegant way to cut the image is the function of automatic access . select one of the following options :
the option anti @-@ ali@@ asing is the image a bit after the rotation . please note the above warning .
all per@@ spec@@ tiv@@ an transform@@ ations will be carried out by a fix@@ point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is displayed in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares to the corners of your image . the preview will then automatically be re@@ calculated . on the right of the dialog you will find some information which will help you change the perspective :
&quot; new width : shows the width of the new image , including the empty areas arose through the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
&quot; new height : indicates the level of the new image , including the empty areas arose through the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
angle left above : shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
angle right above : shows the current angle in degrees at the top right of the transformed area .
angle left below : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle right below : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
after the adaptation of the perspective the picture becomes a bit poll@@ uted . for a single adjustment this effect is small but two adjustments create a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
&quot; after which you have adapted the perspective , you will get an un@@ happy tri@@ angular holes on the corners . a way to ber@@ some it is the image to cut off from the image processing . &quot;
&quot; the tool tool is used to move a part of the picture in one direction and move to the other part in the opposite . a horizontal sn@@ acking is turning to the upper part of the image to the right and the lower part , the image is dist@@ orted . with other words , a rect@@ angle is turning into a parall@@ el@@ ogra@@ m . you can start this module about Transform@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; sc@@ iss@@ ors your image by using the horizont@@ als angle and the vertical angle . you can push horizontal and vertical at the same time . if you are shown on preference , the angle will appear to zero and the new dimensions of the target will be displayed on the right side of the subject . &quot;
&quot; for your help , a vertical and horizontal line appears . move the mouse to an important point , like the lake , a wall from a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool tool to adjust your image . &quot;
&quot; after which you carried out the sh@@ ear , the picture becomes a bit wis@@ ely . for a single sh@@ ear this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two shots produced twice as much as bl@@ ur@@ ging and therefore you should avoid this . &quot;
after the sh@@ ear the picture has a nice tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to eliminate these is to eliminate the image with transformation from the image processing .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ an ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write . the available formats are therefore from your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries have been comp@@ ili@@ ated . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to process a large number of images with &amp; di@@ gi@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; due to this dependence on other libraries , it is impossible to give a list of all available file formats on this site . however , you will always find JPEG and TIFF below . &quot;
&amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; only displays files in formats that knows . this is shown on the extension of file extension and a comparison of this with a pre @-@ defined list . if the extension is shown in the list . you can change this list of file formats ; you can change the file in the list below . in the section configuration you will find more information about it .
almost all digital cameras will save photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras do not allow you to use the format . a detailed description of this file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; supports both formats .
imaging is the application of data com@@ pres@@ sion@@ ism on digital images . you will be red@@ und@@ ant information to store the data in a more efficient way .
&quot; JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , smooth results as JPEG at the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s version can also save los@@ s@@ freely when it is stated in the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the raw materials , you can read more about the raw image format , so you can read the raw format pictures in JPEG , or TIFF with the raw converting of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ar . in the section configuration you will find further information about the use of modules with &amp; di@@ gi@@ d ; &quot;
&amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; supports the shop of raw materials only with the program d@@ cra@@ b which is included in &amp; di@@ gi@@ d ; hereby . all of the cameras can be seen below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats that by &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; supports :
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are frequently saved in the avi@@ - or MPEG format ; it is not a film processing program and therefore does not edit a film file . &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; it is not a film file , then the &amp; k@@ de ; settings to play films are used to play the program to play . &quot;

many tools you need to take the photograph and included in &amp; di@@ gi@@ us ; your description is followed here .
&quot; all image tools such as sharp@@ ens , plast@@ er@@ als , plast@@ ering , ref@@ us@@ ability , un@@ sharp masculine , &amp; etc . . use a uniform dialog , which is applied in a preview before the filter is applied to the current picture . below you will see &amp; quot ; texture App@@ o@@ quot ; in this dialog : &quot;
( 1 ) These progress report shows the status of the filter to the current picture . to the left of it allows five buttons to change the compar@@ ing mode of the fores@@ een . these modes are :
ver@@ tically divide without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the left section shows the original and the right displays the filter applied to the right of the selected pad@@ ding .
horizontal divide without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper area shows the original and the lower shows the filter applied to the range below the selected pad@@ ding .
&quot; ver@@ tically , the left section shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter . &quot;
horizontal divide . the upper area shows the original and the lower the effect of the filter .
&quot; mouse over &apos; -@@ style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in the front area , and otherwise the original . &quot;
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can switch to over@@ flow and under@@ exposure . the used colors can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame to the selection of preview . you can catch this frame with the mouse within the image and in the part of the picture you want to see in the left part of the dialogue will be immediately updated .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to res@@ et all buttons on your default values . all settings depend on the last use of the module .
the page bar features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo properties : shows a summary of the most important parameters in the shooting of the photo . these data are from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intu@@ iti@@ vely card@@ inal tool based on the Mar@@ ble @-@ Mini@@ ature device . you can catch the mouse button or pull it out . move C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to catch a square . all pictures within this coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . it is of course ahead that your pictures of ge@@ o data included .
&amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; is an editor for pall@@ et files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and to choose and using colors .
&quot; the pall@@ ets files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de ; can be installed either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter , they are in your Personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user @-@ defined paint and appro@@ ached colours . &quot;
&quot; in a dialog range , they can choose from a list of installed pall@@ ets or search the files to the files . &quot;
the c@@ ursor is shown in the pall@@ et view as line . it can be moved by cli@@ cked on the area next to a color .
it shows the color of it . the color is described under the pall@@ et view . here the color can also be changed .
&quot; it can also be used for drop@@ outs . to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the c@@ ursor to it . afterwards , move the mouse with penet@@ rate left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if the cruci@@ fix@@ ture Bei@@ m C@@ ursor is inserted under the button color , the color will be inserted into the c@@ ursor on the c@@ ursor . the color will be inserted either or over@@ writes a different ; depending on whether the mode is selected either . this mode can you set by selecting the cross @-@ box over@@ ride under Bei@@ m c@@ ursor . &quot;
&quot; a selection , which was produced as described in the last section , can be used together with the actions of cop@@ ying , cut and paste . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; uses the following format for data in the cli@@ p@@ board : for each color , three values for the shares of red , green and blue , and an optional color name , in case of another color is followed . if there are three numer@@ ical signs in the cli@@ p@@ board , can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; &quot;
the colors in the range and the output of the colour choices can be drawn using the mouse .
choose a color somewhere on the screen and then find it in the color selection on the left side .
&quot; graph@@ s are a KDE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graph@@ s are free layout programs . graph@@ s are used in science , especially in inform@@ atics . so far , there were no modern &amp; GUI ; programs to visu@@ alize graph@@ s ; programs , are according to the program author &apos;s obsolete , X11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with just a few functions . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; project has set itself the goal to replace these programs by a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; is a KDE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graph@@ s ; graph@@ s are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graph@@ s ; -@@ programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graph@@ s ; -@@ programs are available with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; . it has the following functions :
&quot; integration in &amp; Kate ; and &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of graph@@ s in &amp; Kate ; the Grap@@ h re@@ ws , and in &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; ) &quot;
menu to open the graph@@ s in &amp; Kate ; to open or view the graph@@ s in &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; in a &amp; Kate ; -@@ component to open
download large graph@@ s ( currently there are problems from about 1000 knot@@ s and a h@@ ack to show more than this k@@ not )
&quot; other required software : &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program , which requires the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for the presentation of the graph is required : &quot;
&quot; the main window features the opened graph@@ s , each in its own sub@@ window . initially , if you open &amp; k@@ graph@@ s ; in this case the tool@@ bar is empty as the icon file and the ( empty ) list appro@@ ached files . click the first icon to show the dialog file . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected one or more &amp; dot ; files , the main window looks like in the lower screen shot : &quot;
&quot; as you can see , an overview in the corner is displayed when the graph is bigger than the string . you can select a fixed position of this overview or select this position automatically . &quot;
&quot; the maus@@ oleum use ( high and r@@ under without special scan@@ til@@ ation , left and right at penet@@ rate &amp; Alt ; -@@ key ) ; &quot;
the zo@@ omas is limited in both directions by the factor 10 . below you can see the maximum dimin@@ ution of a graph .
&quot; if the file has just been modified in &amp; k@@ graph@@ ically ; charged file from another program , the following window will be displayed : &quot;
&quot; you can choose whether the Grap@@ h is to be re@@ loaded , or if you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; can make your decision to change , so you can change your decision later , you can set the menu item no graph@@ s ; use , see also . &quot;
&quot; if you open a graph@@ ite outside of a running &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; one instance , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or at the command line , you will have the option if you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; the instance will open or to be able to add files in a sub@@ window of the current instance . &quot;
&quot; as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but also change it with the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; at the startup start , you can open all of the graph of your last session . once again , you can save your choice as well as later . &quot;
&quot; you can also specify how the Grap@@ h can be divided into several pages , the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be chosen freely . &quot;
&quot; if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph , which are shown on one side , on this page will be ignored . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled with the respective parts of the graph . &quot;
page show with one on several pages distributed graph@@ s without head@@ line and with another type of font
&quot; the site again gives the opportunity to specify the behavior when a file was modified on hard disk , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can set a standard behavior ( automatically re@@ load or ignore the changes ) or the program of each time . &quot;
the site opening gives the opportunity to set the behavior of &amp; k@@ graph@@ ically ; set up when a graph is opened out of a current session . you can set a standard behaviour for this case ( graph in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the already current session ) or to determine that every time is question@@ ed .
the site seating administration gives the possibility to set the start @-@ behavior of &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; you can specify a standard behaviour ( the files of the last session or not ) or determine if you are asked for any start afterwards .
&quot; the context menu , which is normally released by clicking on the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; offers further possibilities : &quot;
&quot; here you can choose among different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ Lay@@ ou@@ tal@@ g@@ algorith@@ ms . the entries , as described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; are : &quot;
&quot; &amp; dot ; -@@ Algorith@@ m , the standard for tri@@ mm@@ ed graph@@ s . he produces hierarch@@ ical or historical represent@@ ations of directed graphics . the algorith@@ m sets the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges and as few cant@@ ons as possible . &quot;
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; -@@ Algorith@@ m is the default for odd graphics . it is used in accordance with the Spr@@ ung@@ feder@@ ality . it is used as the Kam@@ ada @-@ Kaw@@ ai algorith@@ m that is syn@@ onymous with statistical sc@@ aling .
&quot; the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorith@@ m creates a spr@@ ing@@ spring model . it uses the Fru@@ ct@@ man @-@ Rein@@ gold He@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi@@ release sol@@ ver for the treatment of large and g@@ ec@@ lust@@ ed graph@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the Cir@@ co ; algorith@@ m orders the k@@ not circular to the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ eur and meadow , 2002 . he is useful for certain diag@@ rams of several cycli@@ c structures . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog , which allows you to specify a lay@@ out@@ command as parameters , and the calculated layout of the graph to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout , you can give ways of graph@@ s , or even the graph with a filter before it is drawn . &quot;
&quot; determines the type of graph@@ s ( directed or un@@ coated ) and uses the default algorith@@ m for the respective type ( dot ; for judi@@ cial , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for un@@ coated graph@@ s ) . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is activated , the overview is displayed , if it is necessary . otherwise it is not displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active . &quot;
displays the What is the -@@ mouse c@@ ursor . click with this mouse button on a &amp; GUI ; element to get more help to this item ( if available ) .

the K@@ IP@@ I module images can be read tools available to invite new images and to watch this review .
this module can be used to invite new images to ul@@ esen from external sources and supply chain . currently two sources can be used :
images scan : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read pictures of a scanner supported by the S@@ ane Project or another source such as Video Stre@@ ams . so that this works you have to install K@@ oo@@ ka and S@@ ane .
&quot; if you scan the menu item you will open a dialog , which allows you to select between all available sources on your computer . select the source of which you want to pick up the image . you can also put the default source for the next time . &quot;
&quot; after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears to select your image according to your image . see the preview and adapt the area to your needs before you can read the picture . the estimated file size will be displayed in the right , lower corner . in K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find more information . &quot;
make sure that the window will complete be displayed as some configuration may not be displayed .
&quot; after having pushed the button scanning , you have to wait until the scan is complete and the window to specify the options of the target audience . here you can select the compression and type of image file . you can also select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create the image stored . &quot;
displays data you can create after you can choose in the menu Imp@@ or@@ tier@@ rez &gt; screens . a window appears in which you can set the different image mf@@ ot@@ om@@ o@@ di :
select The complete work@@ space to read a single window under the mouse .
&quot; when all your own programming window is selected , the out@@ going program will disappear , so that you can read other screens and windows . otherwise , you will be selected after a short delay , the current visible workplace , only the window will be read under the mouse . &quot;
&quot; the delay determines how long screens will be waiting before it starts . if you switch to other des@@ kt@@ ops , you should choose these delay high enough to navig@@ ate the time . &quot;
&quot; after the screenshot is made , the dialogue features of the target audience is shown with the options described above . &quot;

the module export to Flick@@ r can be used to download images from your computer to a Flick@@ r server on the Internet .
&quot; if you are using the module to the first time you are running through the process of generators , it is used for your authentic@@ ation . it is therefore virtually your credit card to Flick@@ r . a browser will start to be able to register with Flick@@ r . &quot;
after the successful login the module can send photos to Flick@@ r website . you will be presented the following page after a successful login .
simply close the browser window and return to the program . after you have pushed onto Yes you get the dialog to upload photos to Flick@@ r . this will be displayed in the next section .
&quot; if the module is started to Flick@@ r for the second time , you will be greeted with the following dialog , which welcomes the current accessibility . the module does not currently need any other per@@ missions . you will need to be asked if you want to proceed with these per@@ missions . &quot;
the button add should once be pressed once you have put all other options . with this button you can select the photos you want to upload . if you like to press the O@@ k button the up@@ loading of photos to Flick@@ r server .
the keywords field can be filled with a separated list of words . these are added to the image as keywords during the high @-@ end .
&quot; with the options open , friends and Fam@@ illi@@ e you can adjust the per@@ missions to your pictures . by default , the photos are classified as private . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the option to choose the size of the photos in front of the up@@ loading , the photos will be changed before the up@@ loading of size . the size is taken from the size of maximum size . &quot;
the maximum size can be used to set the maximum height of the images . the size is changed as changed the aspect ratio .

the K@@ IP@@ I module to the geographical loc@@ alization allows GPS @-@ coordinates in the met@@ ad@@ ata of an image and to edit . the geographical data is stored in the EX@@ IF keywords and the loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module to the geographical loc@@ alization provides tools available to locate images geograph@@ ically in the spher@@ ical coordinate system , used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , long@@ itu@@ d@@ inal and lat@@ itudes are used . &quot;
to cor@@ set your images with geographical data you need a GPS track as an XML @-@ file in g@@ px @-@ For@@ mat@@ . g@@ p@@ sb@@ abel and g@@ p@@ sman can download the data for you from your GPS device and convert .
image Ge@@ ograph@@ ical loc@@ alisation . this interface can lead a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
&quot; choose the pictures you want to get cor@@ related to the main window and call the menu on . the above @-@ looking dialog appears then . to load a possible cor@@ relation of time and loc@@ alisation through , you need to load a flush file with GP@@ X file , such as the pictures of your camera . &quot;
if the file is loaded into a automatic cor@@ relation which displays the coordinates in red . GPS Sp@@ ur@@ data will be recorded in GMT @-@ time and therefore the camera will be reck@@ oned with the GMT . this can be performed with the time zone . Set your camera zone .
the de@@ viation for the maximum amount of time is an upper de@@ viation for the GPS period and camera . the de@@ viation below are the data mer@@ ged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you do not have any gap of a place for pictures you can edit the g@@ px file manually and add the pictures . the time difference between 2000 seconds then all images will be cor@@ related in this field .
&quot; the options inter@@ pol@@ ishing and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have appropriate data . if you know that in reality a loc@@ ating difference between camera and GPS is , you can put this limits here and then press the button cor@@ related to inter@@ pol@@ ishing . &quot;
&quot; the coordinates can be manually set with this dialog . this is useful if you have taken a number of photos at the same place . as the dialog expects a call to the next , you only need to use the button OK to put the data in the current photo . &quot;
location can also be found by the map and set up and set them . select the area and enri@@ ching this . the height must always be selected manually . the card can always be selected between card mode , satellite screen and a mixed mode . &quot;
&quot; completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are possibilities to hang on the pictures . here is a small script that the exi@@ b@@ ool is used to provide a stack of images with GPS data . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML page .
&quot; this module can export your albums in a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4@@ .01 . you can select the albums that can be exported to HTML sites , and indicate the parameters for the HTML pages . &quot;
the module has four riders in which the settings can be adapted . the rider selection allows you to select all albums . you need to select these albums only . the albums will not be hierarch@@ ically displayed . you can quickly select a large number of albums on the right . you will quickly appear a large number of albums . in the area you will see the Al@@ ben@@ ign and the text that will appear in the head of the HTML page .
&quot; the tab is defined by the general appearance and layout for each page . this rider is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . the option for each picture is created a page in which each picture is displayed on each image . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your default , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show , displayed &quot;
&quot; the rider album defines the settings , where and how the gallery will be saved with all your associated images . select a folder containing the name K@@ I@@ PI@@ E@@ Export which contains everything there will be created . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the JPEG @-@ file format , the EX@@ IF @-@ Information of your original images are also stored in the new pictures . &quot;
with other color depth you can change the default colour . it naturally also influences the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
&quot; the rider lect@@ urer will allow you to adjust some of the settings from the album tab for the spect@@ ators , these are small pictures that are displayed in the gallery . &quot;
a progress window shows the user at how far the action is . push @-@ ups to break the process .
&quot; when the module has created the pages , the window will not automatically be closed . you can therefore read the pro@@ mm@@ ings to determine whether errors will start at the end . the web browser will start automatically in the end to display the preview of the gallery . click Cl@@ osing the module to close . &quot;

&quot; this function does not work in all formats . you can copy from anywhere , but do not write in any target format . JPEG is supported by writing . please take a look at ex@@ iv@@ 2 to see which formats are supported . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG codi@@ erer module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a di@@ ash@@ au .
&quot; the module enco@@ der can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG @-@ Video , with a defined length to convert . this module can also add the packages M@@ j@@ peg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick . you can also add an audio file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the Sli@@ deshow . &quot;
all images will be added automatically to the correct size for the chosen video format . additionally you can create a background colour for the Sli@@ deshow format . using this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ VCD / SV@@ CD / VCD for your DVD player . to burn the medium to use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you must first select the images to get to the MPEG di@@ asch@@ au . after that you can create via extr@@ as MPEG di@@ asch@@ au .
the images of you selected images can then be found in your portfolio in the portfolio . there you can also change s@@ orting pictures or the contents of the list .
&quot; after you are satisfied with your list , you should be selected the other settings . the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ VCD , SV@@ CD and VCD . &quot;
&quot; in the next step you should indicate the time in seconds , the speed of the image will be shown below . a low value creates a sudden , a high contrast very smooth @-@ change . &quot;
&quot; in doubt , the background colour can be set next . in doubt you should let them black . the name and path of the created file can be set under the name of the MPEG @-@ output file . keep the end of the file . &quot;
&quot; if you specify a audio file in the name of the audio source file , this will be integrated into the film . after you have adapted all settings of your computer . depending on the speed of your computer , you can go with the button . depending on the speed of your computer . depending on the speed of your computer you can go back quickly or in all peace and enjoy the di@@ asch@@ au if you are back again . &quot;
&quot; if a note appears that co@@ ats or tools are missing , so you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ peg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick packages on the button settings . &quot;
the rac@@ ist allows you to print multiple images on a piece of paper in standard Photo@@ sizes . the combined images can also be opened automatically with the processing Gimp . this is e.@@ g : convenient to improve it or print using the Gimp module for direct expression .
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import it into one of three formats JPEG , TIFF or P@@ PM . &quot;
&quot; the conversion is based on the command line @-@ tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original form of Him is : do not expect the same results , as the software is generated by your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w better results ! &quot;
&quot; first , select the RAW file which is to be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w @-@ Display window will appear in the mode for a single image . you can preview the effect of your current settings on the picture . &quot;
&quot; you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option decides if the camera settings are to be used for the white , brightness and red / blue amplifier . if the result is not optimal , you can continue to edit the picture later . &quot;
&quot; a four @-@ color R@@ GB@@ G Con@@ version can be selected , so you can use the contra@@ sting information . if your camera works in R@@ GB mode the R@@ GB@@ G switches has no effect . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the fil@@ en@@ ame is equal and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JPEG use a lost algorith@@ m and produces the smallest file sizes . &quot;
&quot; the tagged image format , TIFF , ret@@ ains all the information of your image and uses the los@@ s@@ free L@@ Z@@ W com@@ pressing . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to edit your pictures frequently or later , you should not choose to use the JPEG format , as there is only a limited number of operations before allowing the image quality . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot;
&quot; if you choose JPEG as storage format , the met@@ ad@@ ata will be stored in the RAW file , are stored in the JPEG file into the Exif information . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted your settings , you can start running the conversion button . if you want to break this process again , so you can break down this process . &quot;
&quot; the st@@ ack@@ able mode allows you to convert different pictures at once . use this mode , so if you are sure , for example by testing on a single image that are the best settings . &quot;
&quot; however , the available settings are almost identical with the version for individual images . however , you have the option to re@@ write this file automatically . this is useful if these are produced in an earlier attempt . a preview is however not available . the progress report is not available as far the conversion . &quot;
&quot; this module can be used to convert all pictures in an album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following picture formats are supported : &quot;
&quot; this module can be used for ren@@ aming of all images of an album , you can set the pre@@ fix , the start @-@ speed and the tim@@ est@@ amps . &quot;
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a picture collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can make the image reduced or enlarge .
propor@@ tional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is automatically selected to be selected depending on the image orientation .
propor@@ tional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : Siz@@ ing in two dimensions . this option remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adjust your image of the screen format .
not propor@@ tional : not propor@@ tional size in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed at this option .
&quot; preparing : prepare the image for the photo print . the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the phot@@ op@@ ap@@ iers . the target , includes background size , random size and background colour , is adjusted accordingly . &quot;
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can send selected images with your favorite e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the additional pictures before . additional pictures can go to the list of the ra@@ vel pictures and take place there . &quot;
&quot; after which you start the module , the pictures will be displayed when you selected images . over the button images you can add more pictures with a file selection dialog . for the last recorded picture , a preview can be displayed on the right . &quot;
you can also drag pictures on the picture list and add it to the list of fun pictures .
with the button images remove the selected images from the list of the most impressive pictures .
&quot; after you have selected all the pictures you can open up with the button OK , the new message window of your e @-@ mail clients . you just need to add the addresses and the subject . &quot;
don &apos;t pay attention to many pictures at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations for the size of dis@@ connecting e @-@ mails . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window will be used to change the settings for sending the pictures . your configuration will be saved and every@@ time will change until you change it .
&quot; select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you have to specify the correct path for your installation in the input field . &quot;
&quot; if you use the Google Mail service , you have to install the G@@ mail agent on your computer before . you can download this here . &quot;
after the selection of comments in a attached file the comments will be added to the pictures in a text file and attached to the mail .
&quot; the PNG format under the menu images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of camera files , but it is best adapted to using the los@@ s@@ free formats such as TIFF . you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the camera quality should not be changed . otherwise , we recommend the JPEG format . &quot;
if you select JPEG under photos file format and add the original files in JPEG format then the original Ex@@ if@@ data are added to the tra@@ den@@ ds pictures .
&quot; when the process is done , the window will not automatically shut you with the status of the status , you can search for errors , however . your e @-@ mail programme will automatically start at the end . with the button , you can drag this window to this window . &quot;
after starting the module Fort@@ ash@@ au Di@@ ash@@ au will appear a window with questions about how you want to choose your Di@@ ash@@ au . you can choose between you selected and all the pictures of the album .
&quot; the option OpenGL transitions in the presentation is using very elegant image transitions by using OpenGL . you need to have a suitable graphics card , since otherwise the di@@ asch@@ au will be very slow . &quot;
the option fil@@ en@@ ame shows that the fil@@ en@@ ame of the images can be displayed in the lower left corner of the presentation .
the option loop is designed to see the presentation in a final loop . you can manually break up with Es@@ c ;
the option pictures are chosen by chance that the images is displayed in a random order . so it will not be used in order of the pictures in the album .
&quot; among delay between the pictures can be placed at the time interval between each images . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard . the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . so you should be sure before you show your friends ! &quot;
there are more than a dozen transition between which you can choose . acci@@ dentally choosing a different effect from each transition between the pictures .
during the Sli@@ deshow you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn off .
&quot; with this tool@@ bar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and next picture and stop the sli@@ des@@ au . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the screen you can see the current fil@@ en@@ ame , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation . &quot;
&quot; currently , the K@@ IP@@ I module is still no documentation . if you are interested in writing , please contact the mail@@ ing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de.@@ org. At@@ tention : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module background is a tool to set a picture as a background image for the work@@ bench .
&quot; this module sets the currently selected picture , depending on the selected option of sub@@ menus , as the background for your KDE work@@ bench . &quot;
&quot; once you have provided your pictures and videos with comments , you can see with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; through these brow@@ sing , see picture . as you can see by a comparison with the image , are now available in each group , so in persons , places and in the group keywords entries are available . &quot;
&quot; in the browser window you can see the categories , for which you have entered information as you may have access to EX@@ IF @-@ based information , to view the folder structure on your hard disk and of course the current prot@@ otypes . in the following each one is described for itself . &quot;
&quot; if you press with the mouse to the entry , the view of the browser is changing . see picture . &quot;
if you select a further person only the images are displayed on which both persons are to be seen . through this sel@@ ectable method you can restri@@ ct the number of images of a few thousand pictures on a few single pictures .
&quot; if you have selected all the persons , places and other settings you can view images , to view the images of your efficiency . &quot;
&quot; in the picture , each person has the same symbol in front of their name . you can save with &amp; k@@ photo album ; however , for each person &apos;s own image image , this also applies to places , keywords , and other categories you have defined themselves . see the picture . &quot;
&quot; to view images next to the name , choose the button that you want to use the right outside on the tool@@ bar . please note that you can view the view for each category separately . this has the advantage that you can see for example symbols with images of people and at the same time a list of keywords can &apos;t have suitable pictures . &quot;
&quot; however , you will have to set yourself what image for each individual is to be displayed . now you can select the image @-@ to @-@ see window ( in closer ) and select in the context menu to select the corresponding person . in the c@@ rescent @-@ window , you can adjust the image @-@ button to your wishes and select which part of the image will be displayed or cut . &quot;
&quot; if you call on the main window in the main window , you will see a dialog which is very similar to the dialog for the establishment of the picture properties very similar . these dialogue can be seen on the picture again . &quot;
&quot; if you enter a string to the field lab@@ eling or description , the lab@@ eling or descriptions of the images are going to be sear@@ ched ; the date may be either part of the total data , for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use an area of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options in the lower part of the window , you can browse all pictures after certain names , as you can see in the picture . here is according to pictures , on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are pic@@ tured . &quot;
&quot; this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if you don &apos;t like to read manu@@ als , but would like to try out the following functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
&quot; go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and take a look at the quick , the screen shot and the intro@@ duc@@ tory videos . &quot;
&quot; start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and choose in the first dialog to start the demo , if you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select the menu Help menu . then you will try some example images and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a connected HTML document to download . &quot;
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this glue you see here : . as the name suggests , this glue shows you data statistics on the pictures in your database . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can show you several different periods of time . each glue shows a different unit . you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by the ly@@ re only 10 @-@ minute sections . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can also be used on the following ways : you can select the display View of the database ( if you select a date , the first image will display this date in the preview ( show ) , when you navig@@ ate in the preview view . &quot;
&quot; you can also select an area of the tim@@ eline by pressing the mouse button and select the mouse over the ruler of the time line , so if you select an area , you can select a selection , by clicking on a beams in the time bar . &quot;
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; offers you two options available to create HTML websites with your images . one is integrated into &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated into &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version is described in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version that you can create via the menu file format .
&quot; before HTML pages , you need to be created some settings . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and finish . in the following each area is described more accurately . &quot;
&quot; first enter the title of the remains and a description that is to contain the HTML file later . on the photo album , HTML @-@ example pages you will see an example of these settings . &quot;
&quot; next , you choose whether a &amp; k@@ photo album ; export file should be created on the site page . &quot;
&quot; finally , you can choose what information is to be displayed on the HTML pages . so you can avoid that information from a party . note that all images are exported from a party . note that all images can be exported from a party . note that all images can be exported from a party . you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain pictures from particular spect@@ ro@@ wers . &quot;
&quot; in this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are clear , which is why this is not specifically made . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the page you can set up different resol@@ utions for the pictures . thus , those who have to view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no images can download the resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the viewer &apos;s viewer may change the resolution at any time you have set . he can then search your images with low resolution , leading to a lower tak@@ eover time . if he wants to display a picture bigger , he changes to a higher resolution . &quot;
&quot; in this setup , you place the various folder and the URL to where your website is stored . &quot;
you can select a basic folder for all your HTML files and for each subsequent set of a new sub @-@ folder .
&quot; first , you have to select the main folder in which all your images will be saved . this folder will be saved and set the next time . here you can either select a folder or one of KDE suppor@@ tive protocol for example : &quot;
&quot; once you have created your pictures , you can check whether these really all for ob@@ server is visible . if you have created a URL for the bas@@ ins . if you have created the URL you define here , this folder should be in the wrong folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; if the HTML files are not yet in the final target folder , you have to manually copy it to the final target feature , see correctly you need to specify the final target of the files , but the basic folder in which all sub@@ folder are . &quot;
the precisely described settings options are referred to all three on basic folders and UR@@ Ls . in these will set up a sub@@ folder whose name you set in output folders .
&quot; if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can of course have a HTML page for viewing the pictures . you can of course have a HTML page for viewing the pictures , then you have to go with &amp; k@@ photo album ; this work is not yet once again . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . you can import it into your database . the image characteristics are covered with ex@@ - and imported . &quot;
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . you are different in the file , whether the images are stored in the file or whether in the file is just a link to pictures . the advantage of all images can be stored together and this file is so independent . the obvious advantage is however the file size . &quot;
&quot; you can either create an .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the menu file , or along with HTML pages , see , create . if you create an .@@ k@@ im file with a HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; an external .@@ k@@ im file is looking for pictures in two ways . first , it searches the images that you have indicated in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . this is not only possible , if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file via the HTML export file . &quot;
&quot; in the following , the dialogue will be described for export@@ ing pictures that you can access the menu File Ex@@ por@@ t ... &quot;
the most important option of this dialog is whether it is to be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . there are the following three choices :
when selecting Manu@@ ally near the .@@ k@@ im file you need to copy the images in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the option Autom@@ atic near the .@@ k@@ im file copy copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the pictures will automatically copy for you .
&quot; since most pictures have been compressed with JPEG , since most pictures are already compressed with JPEG , and the XML @-@ file itself is usually not worth the files to be compressed . if you do not want this to simply select the option export settings . &quot;
&quot; the last option of this page is Maximum image size limit . if you want to send your friends images , because the .@@ k@@ im file might not be very large . here you can limit the size by using , for example , that each picture is to be at most 800 pixels high and broad . &quot;
&quot; when you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu file Imp@@ or@@ den ... select , becomes &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database is described as described in . &quot;
&quot; the assistant for import consists of four steps . first you have to select which pictures you want to import , afterwards , in which folder the import images are to be copied . &quot;
&quot; it may be that you person@@ alize the category individuals of the imported file person@@ er ( if you are a Danish ) , while this category is called for your database persons . therefore , you will be imported in the third dialog &apos;s window , which are imported to the categories that are imported to the imported file and which categories these categories are in your database . &quot;
in the fourth step you can complete the categories of the imported file with the categories of your current database . an example of this you can see on the picture .
&quot; it must be simple to browse pictures and look at : if you look at pictures , you would like to view pictures of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend , you might want to see all pictures , on which this friend is pic@@ tured . &quot;
&quot; in this manual you will take the different steps from ( 1 ) finding the information about your pictures , over ( 2 ) to search and look , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and adaptation options . &quot;
K@@ Photo@@ album was started as a program for the manag@@ erial of your pictures . it has been extended and today is also taking care of your videos . in many places in this manual is talked about pictures but often close this videos with one .
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; stores all his information in the file index@@ .x@@ ml in the top folder of their images . it is a simple XML @-@ file , which you can secure on a disk or re@@ visions in CVS , you can secure where they want . &quot;
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; notice the folder in which your pictures are stored and used this at future launch . if you want to start a different folder in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can use a different folder tree ; with the option -@@ c . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / index@@ .x@@ ml .
&quot; you can set up a window , with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . in the following section of the user logs , you will discuss the various settings . &quot;
&quot; to the left you will see six different symbols , with which you can call setup options and options for viewing the viewer . for each setting is a detailed help you can access the F1 button and click on the desired option . &quot;
&quot; in case you are described , as you can specify for each picture of various properties , e.g. individuals , places and tags . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums . &quot;
&quot; on seeing the dialog , which is used to edit already existing groups . for each existing group you can select a label and a symbol . &quot;
&quot; in the section sub@@ categories already mentioned . in the dialog options you can set complete members groups , i.e. , for example , all members of a group set up in a group instead of all groups of a medi@@ oc@@ re as explained . &quot;
&quot; in view the setting options , which are available to you at the establishment of the members . you can choose the category you want to configure . in the left panel , you can choose one list with the current category and in the right a list of sub @-@ categories . &quot;
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; share his module @-@ system with other graphics applications such as di@@ gi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image Plugin Interface .
&quot; the modules can be called via the menu modules . the modules may and are not described in this manual , as they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , most modules have an help @-@ side which you can call on the modules themselves . &quot;
&quot; since the modules are used by multiple applications among each other , it may be that the modules were tested with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; therefore you should call new modules with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or via the menu Help . don &apos;t say that I would not have been warned ! &quot;
&quot; the applications that use the modules via K@@ IP@@ I , are very different , thereby it can be that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not work . this is the dis@@ advantage when one shares functions with various applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications does not support their pictures in albums : this kind of order is not supported , simul@@ ated it for some modules the order for albums , so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; here &apos;s simul@@ ated &amp; k@@ photo@@ album : the current album , which simply corresponds to the current view , so all images that show you the picture @-@ look at the moment . &quot;
&quot; beside the current album it has to pass &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , the modules also has a list of albums . this goes to the photo album , as follows : &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it shows the content of a category , for example , all persons , then each entry of this category is an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; or it will have specified the category that you have specified in the Settings dialog as a category for virtual albums , so if you would like to use the category individuals , becomes &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so , so whether you would have chosen people to view this and would like to pass this to the module . &quot;
&quot; since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the setup dialog and choose in the area modules which should be loaded . &quot;
&quot; on the picture you can see an example of a start @-@ screen , as soon as you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start your own pictures . &quot;
&quot; as you are used by any other KDE application , take a look at the top of a menu and a tool@@ bar . under the tool@@ bar you can see the window , as you do not have any information about your images , then please click on this window , then please click on this window , then click here to show you an overview with all the existing images . &quot;
&quot; one of the main features of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to see each picture with notes . this includes information about the persons appearing on the picture , where the image has been taken separately or for a larger number of pictures . if you are depic@@ ted on all pictures Jes@@ per , and all images were recorded in Copenhagen . &quot;
&quot; all of these notes can be used for the seeker and Brow@@ se , as you can read in the section . if you want to see these comments if you use the built @-@ in viewer . &quot;
&quot; you can see three lists with a text@@ box by setting people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; because you will always use them again when you enter information about your pictures . &quot;
&quot; by following the idea , the shift of the images lies within the list : if you are shown for example a family celebration , and shown on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 persons , so you can find that the names used are shi@@ fted to the top to find people faster and locate . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to list a alphab@@ e@@ tically sorted list , click on the icon for s@@ orting after date under the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected notes on each picture individually , you might want to edit all selected images and add this pictures with comments . simply click on the front and back buttons , which are located under the preview of the picture on the right side . &quot;
&quot; if you have multiple images , for example with the same person , then it can be more comfortable to mark all these pictures and use the menu item multiple entries at once with a note . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all available in the United States . furthermore , San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California . &quot;
&quot; on the picture you can see a brow@@ sing window of the USA as over @-@ group . to show you that it is a super@@ group , a special icon will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the context menu of the entry Cat@@ alogue is possible to add an entry to an existing or new head@@ - or sub@@ category . additionally , you can also take an entry into a category and get there to make this one sub@@ category of this entry . attention , this is ahead that you just sort your categories alphab@@ e@@ tically sort . see it . &quot;
&quot; you can move the individual elements of the box by clicking the glue , which form the upper edge of the frame , click on and move from a frame also by taking it out of a window . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted the look of the window , so that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the button options ... that offers you the option to save the current structure and appearance of the window . &quot;
&quot; you can also leave a frame also completely out . if you want to view this window later , use the button options ... and then click on the button below . this process can be seen in the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the entry photos in your browser , you will get an overview of the currently selected images , or all pictures if you do not have a filter here . an example of this allows you to configure a filter by simply drag the mouse with the middle mouse button . try it just times . &quot;
&quot; if you have a picture on the background of your desktop , this image will be set up as a background image for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; once you click on a picture , it will be displayed in the image above . if you haven &apos;t open a window with a picture , a new sco@@ re@@ window is created . &quot;
&quot; you can also delete images in the images , just select the corresponding pictures out of which you want to delete or select the menu Edit selection . now , you will display the window that you can see in the picture . &quot;
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; allows you to have a solution to this problem . you can also use the images anywhere you might be saved to the hard disk . in the picture you will have to see the images anywhere you can find in the database Index . in the picture you can view the view from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all necessary pictures can be loaded from the hard disk .
&quot; pictures of which the right upper corner is cut off , are not stored on the hard disk . this is available for example at the pictures 1 @-@ 9 , however , so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album you can see the preview of these images . however , you can see these pictures with the image viewer . &quot;
&quot; as you see this feature , that you want to copy files from the folders and to copy them again . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if you do not yet want to avoid the entry of the file . if you do not want to avoid any longer hard drive , please buy any larger hard disk to save all of them . &quot;
&quot; in the menu images you can find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to stay a little more privacy you want to block the pictures in the menu . alternatively , you can also Lock the pictures that you can see for other in@@ accessible and select the menu item all except current view . &quot;
&quot; in order to set out what images are to be hidden in the case of the F@@ alles , just select the menu of your little sister , then select all the pictures that you have locked . if you want to see the pictures again , click on lock . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to set a password , which must be entered into the un@@ locking of images . to set up this password , simply select password in the menu privacy . &quot;
&quot; please note that this picture protection is by no means most certainly . for one you can read all images on the hard disk and on the other , anyone who access the file index@@ .x@@ ml can easily read the password as un@@ encrypted text or delete . this type of password @-@ protection serves only to those who are using &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar to the view of private pictures . &quot;
&quot; the reason why you can manage all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can manage and spend hours over hours so of course , that you want to observe them at some point . for this reason &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . this reason you can view it from the preview , as described in the preview . &quot;
&quot; the viewer you can see in . he obviously shows the image , but additional all the information you can enter over the picture , such as who is on the image , when and where was it done , etc . &quot;
&quot; if the Info@@ Box on the top part of the picture you want to see , so you can easily drag this easy using the mouse and should be displayed otherwise . all these options are available after a right click on the viewer . all these options are available after a right click on the viewer . &quot;
&quot; some words in the Info@@ Box are under@@ lined . if you click here , the browser will then click here . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser displays you all pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you chose to choose from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; if you have loaded multiple images in the viewer , you can switch between them and return by using the keys image high and picture . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and the end . these features are also accessible from the context menu . &quot;
when multiple images are loaded in the viewer you can run this as Di@@ ash@@ au . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then a new image can be controlled by clicking the C@@ tr@@ l Taste and Plus or Min@@ us . it will be stopped and stopped by the keys C@@ tr@@ l ; S .
a very useful ability of the beh@@ older by &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it is used in full @-@ mode mode . in this mode the viewer uses the entire place on the screen . use the input key to change in full @-@ screen mode and back .
&quot; if you can use the viewer in the image and out , you can easily drag a rect@@ angle . with the Min@@ us button you can easily drag the Plus @-@ button zo@@ om@@ t in the middle of the picture . shows how a zoom @-@ rect@@ angle is marked and shows the result of the zo@@ oms . &quot;
&quot; with the point @-@ key you can res@@ et your zoom , so that the image is not ge@@ zo@@ om@@ t . with the equ@@ ation key sets the zo@@ oms , so each pix@@ el corresponds to the screen a pix@@ el of the image . &quot;
note that the only zo@@ om@@ oper@@ ations can work with videos that in and out @-@ zo@@ omes are with the Plus@@ - and Min@@ ust@@ aste .
&quot; with the swi@@ ft@@ functions from the context menu , you can rot@@ ate the picture . this does not work with videos . you can do comments on the current picture with the menu item notes from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; if you look at pictures it can happen that you &apos;ll find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten in the image . in the moment you can view it and add the configuration dialog of the image to select this name . but you might just consider the picture to mark and look at the picture . &quot;
&quot; another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures on a printer to see which photos you want to start watching the pictures and mark them as good or bad , while you can view one by one . &quot;
&quot; for the two examples above gives you the opportunity to view images with features , while you are viewing the characters A to Z and you can set a feature that you press the corresponding letter . see a picture , where the features A , B and C are set . &quot;
&quot; once you have set the features on your pictures , these are available to you in your browser . so you can use all pictures you want to print , print or whatever you are selected . after that , you can use a module to copy the selected images on a CD or whatever you just want to do . &quot;
&quot; categories and particularly features can be displayed in the front view , then you can add files to the images by pressing the letter for the hall@@ mark after the image was selected . this can be seen here : &quot;
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case allows you to paint your photo album ; on the picture to paint .
&quot; the mind is not saved with the image , but in the database . on the way you can undo your painting later . &quot;
in a picture you can see a picture on the ground floor . in order to turn the Mal@@ mo@@ dus from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; turn off on the picture of the context menu . to end the painting you simply press the cross at the top at the top of the window .
&quot; to work with &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; you must fully control the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray , but the documentation about &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you be read and understood . &quot;
in the property @-@ tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the Object properties and shown the object in the wire @-@ scale views yellow .
&quot; you can also select multiple objects simultaneously . but not the object of an already selected object , since all sub@@ objects are already selected with the object . &quot;
&quot; to insert a new object in the object tree , choose the position in which you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the menu . &quot;
&quot; there are several possible positions , the following folding menu will be inserted , so that you can choose the correct position : &quot;
&quot; by delet@@ ing either from the menu bar below editing , or from the context menu of the right button , you can previously remove selected objects from the scene . &quot;
&quot; if you have altered attributes , click App@@ ly to take these changes . if you have inv@@ alid values , a message will be displayed with a error description , then click on the input errors or change the changes to Canc@@ el . &quot;
if you enter the path to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the indicated object with help . &quot;
you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this property . if this documentation is not included in your distribution you can download them here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 has already given the user documentation .
&quot; if you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can view a preview in the peculi@@ ar view . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for a preview in the peculi@@ ar view and a small example of the scene will be selected using the selected texture ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , you can cross locally . &quot;
the screenshot shows the check@@ points of the camera . you can drag this check@@ points with the mouse button and thus change the position and direction of the camera .
&quot; when a transformation is selected , the control points and it will display a small cross in the wire model . this cross marks the centre for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shi@@ fts . you can change the shift through pulling with the mouse within the entire window . &quot;
every object has as a wire model . you can indicate this value relative to the level of level of higher @-@ level object or as absolute value . objects are only displayed when they are selected or equal in the tool@@ bar state of the scene is smaller or equal in the tool@@ bar of the scene .
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; has a window al@@ location than default . the lens @-@ tree and the view of the property properties are shown to the left and the four graphical views on the right .
&quot; if you do not like the standard window , or if you need any other arrangement , you can store them any number . you can also save several windows formations and easily switch from different formations . &quot;
&quot; to anchor a window to or under a present view , drag the beginnings to the top or lower edge of a view . a rect@@ angle then shows the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the beginnings to the right or left side of a view . the new view will then be ens@@ hr@@ ined at the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height . &quot;
&quot; if you would like to arrange several views over each other , take the beginnings right in the middle of another view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the cardboard box in the top of the views . &quot;
&quot; the last possible windows order are sch@@ web@@ ing views : views that are not mounted in the main window . to solve a view from the anch@@ oring , drag the beginnings to the desktop , or click on the link above on top arrow in the box . &quot;
&quot; to close a view , click on the small cross in the thickness line . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross . &quot;
you can insert additional views in the main window . in the menu View you will find entries for each type of views . new views are sch@@ web@@ end , you can anchor them to any of them . &quot;
the current window view can save you with View window . it will be a dialog shown in which you can save the window order under an existing or new name .
&quot; if you have created a scene , you can ren@@ dering them . &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ ray , used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray , this program has to be installed properly , was &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 up to date . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 does not support . &quot;
&quot; to ren@@ dering the current scene , click on the icon Ren@@ dering The icon Ren@@ dering in the tool@@ bar or select the menu one view scene . &quot;
&quot; a R@@ ender mode corresponds to entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray , s ini @-@ files . it determines the image size and quality of the ren@@ dering . if you want to insert a scene in different sizes and quality levels , you can insert as many R@@ ender @-@ modes , from a quick preview of up to full pictures in the highest quality . &quot;
if you click on the icon The R@@ ender settings in the tool@@ bar or in the menu View R@@ ender Mo@@ di ... the following dialogue will be opened :
&quot; each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , but sense is a name that allows the properties of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in map map size , you can choose the width and height of the framed image . if you want to ren@@ dering only a small area of the picture , choose the cross @-@ field section and give the image cut to the ren@@ dering in the input fields . &quot;
&quot; in the drop @-@ down quality you can select the properties , the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray , for ren@@ dering . this goes from a very simple color and light model for a model with complex @-@ diff@@ user refl@@ ex@@ ions . a detailed description of the R@@ ender features can be found in the user manual to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray . &quot;
&quot; if a picture is controlled with only one beam per pix@@ el , there are several bugs arise . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or stu@@ ds effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than a pix@@ el . this effect is ali@@ asing . &quot;
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of this error . in general see pictures of this property better .
if you turn anti @-@ ali@@ asing and connect &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than a beam per pix@@ el . this technique is called super @-@ sam@@ pling .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of the super sam@@ pling . as standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because each pix@@ el is spread over again and adap@@ tive because each pix@@ el depends again and is adap@@ tive because the recur@@ sion@@ ed colour depends on the advis@@ ory color values . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray provides an Stra@@ hl to the pix@@ el pixels , then both pixels are calculated by pursu@@ ing a certain extra number of pixels with super sam@@ pling . if you calculate the deep value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pix@@ el . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pix@@ el is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pix@@ el , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pix@@ el . the difference is then : &quot;
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pix@@ el . if the difference between the color indicate the pre@@ determined thresh@@ old , then the pix@@ el is divided into 4 sub@@ pix@@ el which can be trac@@ ed separately and to further sub@@ division , you can adjust the maximum depth of the record . &quot;
&quot; one more possibility to decrease the ali@@ asing effect is the generation of noise for the beam process , called J@@ itter@@ ing . if you dis@@ able J@@ itter@@ ing , changing &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the rays are a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
the last attitude for quality of ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property .
&quot; on this map , you can adjust if the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pix@@ el is then transparent when the corresponding rays have no object . &quot;
opens a new window for viewing the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly ends you can find the reason for this .
&quot; to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray , choose the menu item Imp@@ or@@ ization ... and choose a file in the dialog window . &quot;
&quot; currently , &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; not yet supported the complete command of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; if you can perform error messages or warnings , a dialog window displays a list of all reports . &quot;
if you do not support source text in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; import it to this source code between the two special comments / / * P@@ MR@@ aw@@ on and / / * P@@ MR@@ aw@@ End .
&quot; you can export objects from the property tree to the editor to export the source text for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; this adds to the source text of the object into the ge@@ opened text file in the editor . to import objects in the scene , simply mark the source text in the editor and drag it to the property . &quot;
with cop@@ ying and paste in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can insert Source text for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called if &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; a scene is ren@@ dered . usually this is P@@ ov@@ ray or x @-@ P@@ ov@@ ray .
&quot; if you click on the Help in the own view , open &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ ray ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation for the displayed object . place the path to your documentation and version . &quot;
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example height data ) in the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you choose files that are not found in the folder of the scene you also need to add the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library .
the color for the wire @-@ models . the second color is used for viewing the selected objects .
the color for the check@@ points . the second color is used for viewing the selected control points .
the colour of the rect@@ angle for the visual view in the camera view and in the window @-@ type features .
&quot; you can set the obj@@ ectivity of the points to the R@@ aster in the context menu of the spiral @-@ model views . you can set the grid separately for shi@@ fts , scal@@ ability and rot@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; greater values result in a more accurate wire model , and thus better wet@@ ness for the indicated objects , but require more time to ren@@ dering objects , but require more time to ren@@ dering . for some objects like the ball , you can set the details level for two directions . &quot;
&quot; advanced proj@@ ections are further divided into advanced proj@@ ections , all proj@@ ections are using an extended projection . advanced proj@@ ections are all proj@@ ections with exceptions to the perspective and the ver@@ tically proj@@ ections . this property provides a better approach to proj@@ ections , but requires more time to ren@@ dering . &quot;
&quot; if you display a wall , a wall behind the objects will display . the wall is displayed in a box patterns of two adjustable colors . &quot;
if you indicate the ground is shown below the objects below the floor is shown in a box patterns of two adjustable colors .
&quot; if you activate the u@@ ct@@ ance , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for the ren@@ dering of the scenes . the values for deep and swelling can be set . more detailed information about the parameters can be found in the section R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di . &quot;
on this page you can create existing window formations or create new window formations . in the section window orders will be explained how to create wind@@ ings and store .
the combination @-@ field default window : shows all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; uses the chosen window order at the start of the program .
the list of existing window orders shows all existing window orders . a new arrangement can create you with the button adding and delete a selected arrangement with the button un@@ install .
each window order is identified by the name . the name must be clear and must not be empty .
the list under the name shows all the views for the chosen window . new views can make you delete or delete selected views with the button .
&quot; the position of the new window . with new column , you create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with Below map , you get the window under the existing window , with map view , which view not inside the main window , but creates a separate window . &quot;
&quot; so you have just installed &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ ray , and now you would like to begin without a closer knowledge of both programs . if you can follow all steps in this guide , you should be able to create simple scene , beginners is very popular : a bul@@ let on one level . &quot;
&quot; but you should consider the following warnings carefully before you feel that you get as a result only one black screen . if you use a 3D program for first time , you should consider these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you do not adjust the camera , no rules are applied to the ren@@ dering as a result you get a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you are not paste light sources , your whole scene is in the dark , and you only get a black picture . &quot;
if you have everything error @-@ free installed at the first start of &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; the following pre @-@ set window :
&quot; take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation , so that you can expect a proper presentation of what you can expect from this program . &quot;
&quot; you will need to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . in order to follow this guide , you first need to delete all objects from the property tree . select the scene and then select the menu @-@ order editing . thus , you now have a scene without objects . &quot;
&quot; the scene view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene which you generate . in particular , you notice that in the fourth wire model ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this is the result of the ren@@ der@@ ns of the scene . &quot;
&quot; the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you can find the content of the object properties , in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user &apos;s documentation about &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; find out more details . &quot;
&quot; do not change anything about the basic settings of the camera , this is later reserved , but note that the camera will change the check@@ points with which you can change the target point of camera . simply click on a check@@ point and drag it to the desired spot . &quot;
&quot; if you press the button application or press , change the wire @-@ model views and the object tree immediately according to these settings . as a result they see the scene from the view@@ point of view of the camera . &quot;
&quot; there are many possibilities to create the ground for the scene . you could fit for example a Qu@@ ader ( Insert body Qu@@ ader ) and the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some method for solving this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; it actually offers an easy way . you can use an infinite layer as ground :
&quot; a good advice : select the layer in the object tree , change the name and then press the button application or the input file . in the lens , the new name is immediately displayed . &quot;
&quot; the wi@@ res view is now also shown at the moment , even at the moment as a limited final level . if you are ren@@ dering the scene , the level extends to the horizon . &quot;
&quot; if you want to see the property tree exactly , you will find that you click on the icon + before the object . in this case you will see the standard options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . select one of these options , changing the possible settings in the view of the object tra@@ its . &quot;
&quot; in this scene you should move the ground to exercise a unit under the horizon line , just for you to get to know some of these parameters . choose shift and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; only choose the floor to adjust its material properties , there are many different materials , but choose something in the moment . &quot;
&quot; in both cases a dialog opens , in which you can choose how the object is inserted . please choose the name in the object view ( name = ground @-@ pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button sne@@ ak you can see how the pig@@ ment looks now . &quot;
&quot; of course , the preview of Pig@@ ments only shows a matt@@ es black material because you need to enter settings for the pig@@ ment . do not always remember that you can check the appearance of materials at any time with one click on preview . also , there are many options now , but you now take the sim@@ pl@@ est . &quot;
if you see no color on qu@@ ader and ball . please click on the button user and then call the preview .
&quot; the material for the floor is right now . if your image is now with a click on the icon , you should get the following results : &quot;
&quot; of course , this is not the Far@@ ming you have expected . here are further settings necessary . in the color list you have to do two new attributes . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this also more frequently , but the ch@@ ess@@ board @-@ color list can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
select in the Objek@@ t@@ baum every@@ time and change the colors in the view of the object tra@@ its :
&quot; this step should you simply be able to run out , as you should have understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; the ball can be understood just as easy as the floor : &quot;
&quot; in view of the object tra@@ its you can immediately change the settings . put the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget to press En@@ ter or the button application ) , so the ball would catch up above the ground , as you have shi@@ fted the floor to post@@ pon@@ ed a unit down@@ wards . &quot;
&quot; of course , the ren@@ dering now results a wei@@ rd result : as before , the ball @-@ surface appears like a Matt@@ es black material . put in the following step a suitable material . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the ball , you can now point a material now . as already on the floor , enter the ball a pig@@ ment as color : &quot;
&quot; choose First shelter and change the name for example in sphere Pig@@ ment . click on the ball pig@@ ment , then select a far@@ thing and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; but you can reach more interesting effects , if you take the time to adjust some fin@@ ish features : &quot;
then change the values like in the following screen shots and click on users or press En@@ ter .
&quot; the settings shine @-@ effect and reflection already result in partly good visual effects , perfect for glass or ch@@ rom@@ ated surfaces , even if metal : not yet selected : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good impression of what options are you &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; hopefully , you have already learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ tracing is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
&quot; if you have a scene ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ts , the ren@@ derer is hyp@@ othe@@ tical rays from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that reflects the scenes ) through each pix@@ el in the scene and how atmosph@@ eric effects of light sources are reflected in the scene and how atmosph@@ eric effects such as fo@@ g function . so the scene is pix@@ el for pixels . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you will not see any camera without a camera , the camera is your eye , with which you see the scene . without a light of light you see nothing , the image is simple : obvious , some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
in the usual file dialog you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ inc .
opens a file . in the standard file dialog you can select a file you have before using &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ;
&quot; whenever you open a new model or create , the file will be inserted into this sub@@ menu and replace the oldest entry in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have already saved the model , it is stored under the same name . it is a new file , you need to enter a name and storage space . &quot;
sets the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage is rejected .
&quot; this menu item , you can only select if you have not saved changes in the scene . &quot;
&quot; repeat the most recently re @-@ made command . this menu item , you can only select if you have used editing them . &quot;
save the current window of window and opens a dialog in which you can enter a name for a new arrangement or an existing arrangement .
&quot; in this menu you can find options for setting up &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the look , the short@@ cuts and the default behavior . &quot;
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can change or change this option default for &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; commands may change or new .
opens a dialog to set up the tool@@ bar . you can add and remove them with this option tool@@ bar for &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; commands .
a b@@ ump @-@ map is a way to harsh surfaces without changing any b@@ ump on the surface and to change without the geomet@@ ric form of the object itself .
it is custom@@ ary to use the same file for both a dump map and for a texture map .
basic body are simple geomet@@ ric shapes you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are generated from do@@ z@@ ens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then further processed to give them a realistic appearance .
&quot; a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on Pixel base , by using a image file as a colour card . &quot;
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a more comfortable and browser @-@ browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display .
images can be represented either in an own window in the size of the image or in full @-@ screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is very easy . the file browser lists files that you can view using the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the button Return .
you can adjust if each image is to be displayed in an own window or if all images are always to use the same window .
&quot; if you are searching for a specific file , just type the first sign of the fil@@ en@@ ame in your browser window . then a small input field is found in the lower right corner . if a password file is found . you can leave the input field through g@@ aps from return or &amp; Es@@ c ; &quot;
&quot; in three of them , general and processing and slideshow , you can set the working method of &amp; c@@ ick@@ show ; set in the two other , sh@@ orts for the display window and sh@@ orts for the browser , can be set up the keyboard short@@ cuts for the respective windows . &quot;
&quot; if the picture is not large enough to fill the images in full screen mode . if the picture is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the sco@@ oter with the background colour is not a full @-@ screen mode . &quot;
&quot; this point is activated , invites &amp; k@@ ick@@ show ; already the next picture is in the folder , while you can still see the current picture . this reduces the delay , when you choose the next picture and is particularly suitable for a slideshow . &quot;
with this option saves &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the end the name of the last opened folder . next start opens &amp; k@@ ick@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
&quot; click on the colored beams in order to select a background colour . this is used in order to fill the background of screen in full screen mode . if in the window mode the window is bigger than the image is , it is also filled with the background with the selected color . &quot;
&quot; you can adjust &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show , so that only some of the file types may be shown that the program can also be represented . &quot;
this option is enabled for large images with the indicator of the full screen . this option is enabled as default .
determine whether the slideshow can start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
&quot; the tim@@ eline between the image changes in a slideshow . to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the sli@@ der and the small arrows to the right next to the input field . the default is 3 seconds . &quot;
&quot; the number of repet@@ itions . if this value is set to 0 , the di@@ as@@ how long will be repeated until it is interrupted by the user . to change the value , you can insert a new value into the input field or the sli@@ der and the small arrows to the right next to the input field . &quot;
change the key@@ boards for the different modes of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the map @-@ map for the advertis@@ ers and back@@ rest for the browser .
&quot; with this option , turn off between the two @-@ part view of the files@@ ystem ( a window for the sub@@ folder and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the files@@ ystem with folders and files in one window . &quot;
shows great symbols for the files in the folder . this ad is possible only in the short@@ list .
displays small symbols for the files in the folder . this ad is possible only in the short@@ list .
displays examples for files in the folder . this ad is possible only in the short@@ list .
the image is reduced by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
enlarged the picture by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
includes the indicator of the pictures . &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is also closed if no browser window is open anymore .

&amp; show@@ photo ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; photo based on the &amp; di@@ gi@@ an ; image processing . &amp; show@@ photo ; is part of the &amp; di@@ gi@@ an ; project .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a quick image processing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and make cor@@ rec@@ tions and changes .
&quot; like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ photo ; an open source project . this means it depends on that the user contributes to its part , at least problems and possible enh@@ anc@@ ements . &quot;
&quot; the menu provides you as easy as possible errors or possible enh@@ anc@@ ements , where you can also find a dialog with a link . if you use this , your browser opens a page about reports of problems and wishes . all necessary information is already filled , and you can simply follow the instructions to submit your message . &quot;
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a project supported by a community . that means users and developers can help each other . if you answer a frequent user of &amp; show@@ photo ; but then we would like to answer any questions about other users of &amp; show@@ photo ; however we would like to answer some questions of other users here . in this mail@@ ing list , however , you should be more powerful here . in this mail@@ ing list , you should be powerful this language . &quot;
&quot; the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ photo ; to participate , it is the developer mail@@ ing list to join . guide to join the developer mail@@ ing list of &amp; show@@ photo . &quot;
&amp; show@@ photo ; tries to give you so much control of his working process as possible . there are many options that access the behavior of &amp; show@@ photo ; you must select in the menu settings show@@ photo . you can switch between these settings by clicking on the symbols of the left side .
&quot; in the section of the coating , you can select the color that is displayed when the sub@@ - or over@@ stock exchange should be selected . dex@@ ter@@ ior should display the colors with what you want to see in contrast . under@@ exposure should be a bright color and over@@ load a dark color . &quot;
&quot; the main window of &amp; show@@ photo ; has a side bar at the right edge , which provides you with important information and promotions to the selected images . the same side bar can also be found in the image processing . you can view this page in which you click on one of the five riders : &quot;
&amp; sk@@ an@@ lite ; is an application to scan images that does not make more than pictures to scan and watch .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ lite is an easy application to scan images that does not make more than pictures to scan and drop . &amp; sc@@ an@@ lite ; can be stored for each picture in a given folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can also display the images in front of the store .
you can check the status of the support of your scanner on the SAN@@ E project by clicking the necessary information on this search page : http : / / www.s@@ ane @-@ project@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
&quot; a standard scanner can be placed on the command line of &amp; sk@@ an@@ lite , with the command sk@@ an@@ lite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in terminal . if this scanner is not opened , then a dialog to choose the scanner is opened . &quot;
the user can select the scanner scanner and press OK to open the scanner . cancel &amp; sk@@ an@@ lite .
further settings contain more det@@ a@@ illed options of the drivers . &amp; sk@@ an@@ lite . ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) is not treating these options .
&quot; to can@@ e a picture , the user can only start a pre@@ amp and then choose Scan@@ ia for the final scan . the Vor@@ os@@ aus@@ can run through the preview &quot; button . &quot;
to select the picture the user can get into the image and out of the current selection out zo@@ omen . he can also adjust the zoom that the complete preview can fit into the window .
if the picture has been selected then the final picture can be read with the scan button .
&quot; when on the stor@@ ing a preview can be displayed in the settings , the image is displayed in a pre @-@ show@@ case , shown below . if stor@@ ing is pressed , then the image will be saved and you get back into the main window . &quot;
&quot; by the button settings , the ep@@ onymous dialog will be opened in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here . &quot;
&quot; the user can view the image if desired , in front of the stor@@ ing . in this case the option has to be selected before the store . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be chosen . &quot;
&quot; this option allows them to select the way as &amp; sk@@ an@@ lite . images store . dialogue for stor@@ ing each picture opens the dialog to each inserted image . if &amp; sc@@ an@@ lite , it is automatically to be defined using a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you will have to ask for a fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
&quot; this setting defines where the images are stored in the option to be saved without a fil@@ en@@ ame , then this folder is used as default for dialogue to memory . the default value is your home directory and you can change it with the kno@@ b ... &quot;
&quot; this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for automatically to stor@@ ing images and is additionally the proposed name for the image in dialog to store . the automatically saved image gets a numer@@ ical su@@ ff@@ ix of each time . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers . &quot;
&quot; the user can adapt the user @-@ used image quality . this value also changes the compression @-@ value while stor@@ ing . if select the image quality is not selected , then the default value is used by Q@@ t . &quot;
the button Help starts the KDE assistance with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ lite ; -@@ Manual . the button About the KDE About -@@ Di@@ alogue for &amp; Sk@@ an@@ lite ; . the button settings displays the dialog for the settings and closing it can be used to stop &amp; sk@@ an@@ lite .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; used like all other programs key@@ boards . below you will find a list of these cuts and its function . the global Key@@ boards can set you up by clicking on the right mouse button in the player @-@ window and choose gran@@ ular key@@ boards by clicking on the right mouse button in the player @-@ window and select short @-@ commands .
&quot; you may set the existing multimedia buttons so that they function as &amp; Amar@@ ok , -@@ sh@@ orts . thereby , make your keyboard for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control centre . &quot;
&quot; the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions , which are mostly used in other KDE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context @-@ browser , player , playlist , play@@ lists and scripts . &quot;
Amar@@ ok supports the command @-@ line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; . in addition Amar@@ ok has some own command @-@ line options .
&quot; you should give the user a feedback when the script can not be executed due to a missing dependence . please check in your script , whether all the required modules are available and use k@@ dialog , so that the user does not run why a script does not run . &quot;
begin require &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; rescue Lo@@ ad@@ Er@@ ror error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( KDE bind@@ ings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ bind@@ ings v@@ 3.4 is ur@@ for this script . &apos; &apos;@@ k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit
&quot; in the folder of Scrip@@ ts / templates , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can extend it as a basis for your own script or just add it to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts are relatively simple . &quot;
&quot; with the help of D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with amar@@ ok and Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the command d@@ co@@ p ; which each KDE installation is to be installed . &quot;
most scripts allow the out@@ going of external programs and commands . this is usually called ex@@ ec ( ) function . this way d@@ co@@ p &gt; relatively easy to use . here is an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends messages to all running scripts . in this reason scripts are constantly monitored and respon@@ ding to the default script . of this reason , scripts should act constantly monitor and respond accordingly to events . of course , a script can even ignore the events if there is no use for it . &quot;
&quot; configure the script to display the setup dialog . to take care of the store data , each script does not have to take care of each script . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok supports the working folder to the folder where all data should be saved . &quot;
&quot; tr@@ ack@@ Change sign@@ aled that a new piece is played . the script might now be &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can ask further information about the new piece ( for example the met@@ ad@@ ata or the St@@ ü@@ ckl@@ es ) . &quot;
vol@@ um@@ e@@ Change new@@ Volume sign@@ aled a change of volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er between 0 and 100 .
&quot; custom@@ is@@ cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu item@@ Title &quot; &quot; contains the path to selected files the playlist , if a user @-@ defined menu item can also be used to remove the menu item you d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script re@@ mov@@ e@@ Custom@@ Menu@@ Item ( sub@@ menu item@@ Title ) . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; Amar@@ ok , stops , or if the user stops a script , send &amp; Amar@@ ok , the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M sent to the script . this signal should be processed to make the store data or configur@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ o@@ ks script administration may also install script packages , which can be downloaded by users &amp; z@@ b ; such packages are basically normal T@@ ar @-@ archives ( .@@ tar ) , which can also be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ b@@ z@@ 2 ) , which can be seen as optional even with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ b@@ z@@ 2 ) , that the user can clearly recognize the archive clearly as a Amar@@ ok script package . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will accept only script packages with the extension amar@@ oc@@ script . for this reason you should use your script packages right .
&quot; the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameters -@@ p to get the file rights : &quot;
&quot; if your script is done , you can apply it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.org and the link to the Wik@@ i script side of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; app@@ end . for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; script . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful functions and is still surprisingly simple to use .
&quot; with &amp; Amar@@ ok , you can simply drag music to the playlist rather than you need to go through endless menus . perhaps you are looking for only a very specific title of thousands of thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok , &apos;s collecting browser and quick search , you will find the piece within seconds . &quot;
&quot; maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but can never decide which you want to hear ? then the play@@ lists is exactly right for you . and if you decide the decision to choose right , select the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers IF@@ P and many general USB devices . moreover , many different audio systems can be used to listen to your music . these and many more useful functions do Amar@@ ok for the most advanced audio player . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - exactly the right to discover your music ! &quot;
&quot; usually , one must enter the bas@@ ins of Amar@@ ok and Fol@@ ding sources to comp@@ ile Amar@@ ok and install : &quot;
&quot; da &amp; Amar@@ ok , auto@@ conf and autom@@ ate use , you should not have any difficulty if you encounter problems , please report it in the &amp; k@@ de ; mail@@ ing lists . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok , as most of the applications has some options that you activate or dis@@ able to the comp@@ ile script with the configure script . this is a list of options available . &quot;
&quot; for some of the comp@@ ile options , certain depen@@ den@@ cies must be fulfilled , so that they can be used . details can be found in the section system conditions . &quot;
&quot; you have enabled deb@@ ug@@ ging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help in the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you should use full use . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set out without any trouble about direct@@ ing dialog . the setup dialog has several map cards to set up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ;
&quot; player @-@ window show the player @-@ window in addition to the playlist ( or off . if the option is swit@@ ched off , only the play@@ lists will be about Ju@@ K ) . &quot;
tuning bar@@ ometer use : this feature is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ oo@@ zing has been compiled . the option divi@@ des the experimental function of the mood .
&quot; design full : this feature is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok , it has been compiled with support for m@@ oo@@ zing . thus , the dy@@ sch@@ ema is altered for the mood . &quot;
&quot; stored files in the music files : this feature is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok , this feature is enabled , the mood files are stored on the storage site of the appropriate music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in the settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; stored ( usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / m@@ oo@@ sible / ) . &quot;
&quot; external browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; Amar@@ ok , if a browser is required . &quot;
use other browser : here you can specify the path to another browser which is not mentioned in the list .
&quot; playlist when stor@@ ing , saves the current playlist automatically with the end of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . activate this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the running playlist in the ending . &quot;
&quot; relative paths for manually saved play@@ lists : if you enable this setting , will use Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , otherwise . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files are stored . &quot;
&quot; current piece can be visible in the piece of change , that the play@@ lists window is up / off , in order to keep the running pieces always in the visible window . &quot;
&quot; in exchange of change to the context @-@ browser automatically shows the context @-@ browser , as soon as the next piece is played . &quot;
&quot; in the section appearance , you can adjust to Amar@@ ok ; s appearance . the section is in three parts sub@@ section . &quot;
&quot; in the fonts section you can set the use of different fonts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can choose fonts for the following areas : play@@ lists windows , player @-@ windows and context @-@ browser . click on select ... , so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of custom@@ ised color scheme , you have even set up the torture of choice and can set up your own color scheme . use the included color selection for front and background colour . &quot;
&quot; back at the start continue , that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after starting start playing back automatically with the part in the place , with which it has been stopped by the end of the end . &quot;
the sub@@ window on @-@ screen display allows you to switch on the O@@ SD . when On @-@ Screen display is a preview of the O@@ SD and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview .
the first option is the font . click on select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the cruci@@ fix@@ ing shadow causes the text in the O@@ SD sh@@ aded .
&quot; your own colors will give you the opportunity to adapt the O@@ SD colors for writing and background . one click on the color open spaces opens the dialog to paint selection . when they use colors are not activated , the default colors will be used . &quot;
the input field @-@ text sets the text displayed in the O@@ SD . through the type of plac@@ eholders can be adjusted to the O@@ SD . below you will find a list of available plac@@ eholder and what they mean .
the screen is intended for X@@ in@@ ama users . this allows you to specify on which screen to appear a multi @-@ monitor monitor the O@@ SD .
the card @-@ card audio @-@ edition allows you to select an audio @-@ driver from the selection box . some drivers are able to activate further settings in this map .
the card @-@ card collection is used for the setup of all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of the database for the collection .
&quot; here you can select the folder , select &amp; Amar@@ ok , according to music files . to include a folder to the collection , select the cross field in addition to its name . this section also contains swelling fields to the classification , such as using the selected folders . &quot;
sub@@ folder rep@@ sive : this means that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the crossed and their sub@@ folder to music .
&quot; amend@@ ments to : enables &amp; Amar@@ ok , to monitor the selected folder to changes ( such as music files are added or deleted ) . furthermore , an incre@@ mental search will be done to make the necessary changes to your collection . &quot;
play@@ lists import : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; all found play@@ lists in your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) add to your collection later in the play@@ lists .
the part of the Coll@@ ecting database is used to choose a database for the collection . the combination @-@ field driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ ql . if My@@ S@@ ql is selected yet another facility is necessary in the sub@@ window My@@ S@@ ql setup .
&quot; section My@@ S@@ ql @-@ facility is used for setting the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used under computer : the machine is inserted in the port port , which is accessible via the database port . name : is the database name to which the connection is produced . &quot;
use username : and password : the data required for the connection to the database .
the card @-@ card last@@ .@@ f@@ m depends on the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transfer the names of played mosquit@@ oes to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and make music recommendations regarding the current piece .
&quot; here you can enter your username and password for your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you do not have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website . &quot;
&quot; sending pieces and update the profile : this setting allows it &amp; Amar@@ ok , the name of the played pieces on your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to trans@@ mit . &quot;
&quot; similar interpre@@ ters : after activation of this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok , a list with similar interpre@@ ters is available to the played piece . note : you do not need to use the list in the context @-@ browser . note : you do not need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this function . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . further information can be found in the summary of the functions and the gallery using screens .
&quot; Amar@@ ok requires only the package of K@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no further KDE packages . you have to install K@@ deli@@ bs ( including the programs , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide how to re@@ comp@@ ile K@@ deli@@ bs . &quot;
&quot; some features such as the O@@ SD are ahead that your window manager keeps the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work for example , we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use K@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , as they provide an excellent development environment . &quot;
&quot; probably , one of your files will make an error in the diary library . you can see the file in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ scan@@ .@@ log . please also report the capac@@ itor file that causes the crash . afterwards , you can delete the file and create the collection again . &quot;
mostly it is that Tag@@ lib is short@@ ened by reading the met@@ a @-@ info from this file . please report this bug to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer under bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; if you use MySQL as a database , then try SQ@@ Lite . the support for it in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a little more mature . &quot;
&quot; make sure that all of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used libraries with the same comp@@ iler version were compiled . if for B. &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with GCC 3.4 , Tag@@ li@@ b has been compiled with GCC 3.@@ 3.@@ x , then this leads to cr@@ ashing the met@@ a @-@ information . &quot;
&quot; if you use KDE with art@@ s@@ d then de@@ activate car . off if in@@ active for ... in the setting of sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second . &quot;
you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail is automatically opening up with a crash ) and send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be guaranteed . &quot;
&quot; this is because many program write data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 into the met@@ a information , but this is not to mark the problem as Un@@ ic@@ ode . the following Perl script provides the problem . &quot;
# / / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; The file $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib@@ - &gt; new ( $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ) ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3- &gt; new ( $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ day , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ; &quot;
this script requires Perl @-@ module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be re@@ installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos;@@ install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &apos;
&quot; note &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( random mode / repet@@ ition / dynam@@ ical play@@ lists ) see in KDE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes you can click in the control center under the image symbols . please note the status of de@@ activated on grey and semi @-@ transparent . note that in some cases , you can click on a symbol for three times until this setting shows its effect . &quot;
if you get this error : amar@@ oc@@ app : amar@@ ok@@ app : Un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map and then check if Amar@@ ok can see the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos;@@ which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BAR _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
&quot; to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ing Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok will be the right version first . &quot;
there are some options . most of the installation problems are most easily by the help of an expert your Uni@@ xes or Linux distribution . you can also use assistance with other users or for developers . use the Forum and the IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ ok .
&quot; Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable to search for help . please take a mistake there , if something lies at the en@@ closure of a bug in Amar@@ ok itself . &quot;
&quot; after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok , there will be only a blank playlist . how do you get music pieces there ? &quot;
&quot; this is easy . use the file browser on the left side and open the desired folder , then drag the files to the right part of the playlist . &quot;
&quot; to keep the surface intu@@ iti@@ vely , the start @-@ window has been converted to the st@@ ati@@ stic windows . you can find it under extr@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for evalu@@ ating the user , while the points are automatically calculated . &quot;
&quot; to evaluate pieces , the playlist has to be displayed in the playlist and select column . click anywhere in the new review column , to set the rating for a piece . you can also use the sh@@ orts Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background . &quot;
&quot; select the files you want to remove , and then press release on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then select the playlist from the pop@@ up menu . &quot;
drag a play@@ lists file with the mouse into the playlist and let them fall there exactly as you would do it with other files . it is simple : - )
&quot; in the tool@@ bar of the playlist , right next to the addition button , you can save the button playlist . click on it . &quot;
probably the program x@@ mm@@ s config . install the package x@@ mm@@ s @-@ dev@@ el and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . take a look at lib@@ visual that this package contains a lot of very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations .
the equ@@ alizer is located in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . besides , you can find it via the menu bar under extr@@ as Equ@@ alizer .... &quot;
&quot; no . yes , that is really true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses one of the brick independent approach , therefore the real question of which media types support G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we support this pretty much only concei@@ vable audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even help text and PNG ! &quot;
&quot; maybe it can ! maybe use Fed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which is not supplied with any MP3 @-@ deco@@ der ( for patent @-@ legal reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , input &quot;
run the Ya@@ ST online update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s from : - )
if you use the G@@ sa S@@ ink driver with the al@@ sa @-@ s@@ ink to use the device a bl@@ ender . a bl@@ ender allows multiple applications to use the device to use the same time . this can be accessed through a sound@@ card with hardware bl@@ ender ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for AL@@ SA .
the output of this command should help you search for the problem of problems and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer you have to specify a different s@@ ink ( e.g. las@@ ers ) .
&quot; the sorry &amp; Amar@@ ok ; already . do not forget that media will first be de@@ generated , you would only hear a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer is the best choice for most people . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ code them and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . exactly like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
&quot; also X@@ M@@ MS de@@ generated the data first . G@@ spre@@ ader can give directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine . &quot;
use Control System Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System ( genuin@@ ely great ! ) or optimize the settings of the Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable Sound@@ server operated with highest priority ( real @-@ time authority ) and increase the size of the sound buff@@ ers ( warning and see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ s@@ wr@@ ap@@ per su@@ id is set :
&quot; at KDE 3.@@ 2.@@ X , there are problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia code@@ cs that can cause disturbed reproduction . read this bug report . read the magni@@ fying the sound buff@@ ers in your AL@@ SA policy file . as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help . &quot;
&quot; either use the Arts driver , but instead using G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install KDE @-@ multimedia completely around the faster Arts code@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc . ) . &quot;
&quot; probably use the Arts driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver was optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or reduce the size of the Arts bu@@ ffer in the control centre and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buff@@ ers , the less applications react to visu@@ aliz@@ ations . yes , this is an error , please help us to fix it . &quot;
&quot; ste@@ amer is installed , but when I want to change to the G@@ Stre@@ amer cycle , cr@@ ashes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; from . why ? &quot;
after the installation of G@@ Stre@@ amer you must register all the components . run G@@ ST register to register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
&quot; read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if this does not help , you can also ask the IR@@ C channel # g@@ stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; try this ( quit Amar@@ ok previously ! ) : - Download m@@ peg down , comp@@ iling and install it . then run the module file with G@@ ST @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and then run G@@ ST file again . start now &amp; Amar@@ ok . &quot;
please report it under bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de.@@ org. If you have a full list of proposals / wishes you send it the best to our mail@@ ing@@ list : Amar@@ ok @-@ dev@@ el @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .

&quot; thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , which is already possible . put an alarm on your Calendar program and leave with the alarm of this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play &quot;
&quot; this command lets you start and start playing . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok , running before you go to bed , then you are arous@@ ed by the gentle tones of music that you are stopped in front of the bed . &quot;
how can we experience up to date in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; current titles as one is on another computer ?
&quot; if a functioning SSH setting is available , you can proceed as follows . diesel command gives you interpre@@ t and titles of the current piece ( ssh -@@ I ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ R@@ SA ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user @-@ user name Amar@@ ok player ) &quot;
replace IP address with your IP and your username . this is ahead that your identification is available in the file ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ R@@ SA .
visu@@ aliz@@ ations can be separated from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; open windows . click on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens up in an independent , in the size changeable windows . &quot;

&quot; standardi@@ zation : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . this can be useful for example to create rented CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize , the different recording level of different albums can result in the un@@ happy effect that the music pieces can be displayed differently . &quot;
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to launch from CD and automatically restore all videos in the basic folder of the CD .
&quot; this is a convenient way , recently opened projects again . the corresponding menu menu contains a list of these projects . one click on an entry opens the project . &quot;
&quot; saves the current project . if the project has already been saved once , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it is asked for a new fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
&quot; saves the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ame . KDE &apos;s dialogue will be displayed , with which you can select the folder and file name for the project file . &quot;
&quot; saves all the open projects . this is the same , as if you would call for every single project file . &quot;
&quot; includes the current project . if a project has changed and not saved , ask &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after what happened . you can then break between memory and changes . also , you can break down and stop the project . &quot;
&quot; includes all opened projects . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; will not be saved for any project , which should be done so as if you had called for any project file . &quot;
includes all opened projects and ends &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; . for each not saved project it is supposed to be done so as if you had called a file .
&quot; if you call this entry , you can select the same dialog files for addition to the project . this has the same effect when you drag the files straight from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data @-@ CD , the added files appear in the bas@@ ins of the CD . &quot;
&quot; opens the dialog &quot; &quot; Burn &quot; &quot; for the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the properties @-@ dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional button br@@ enn@@ as , the &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; for burning dialogue can only be opened , if the project already contains data . &quot;
opens the properties @-@ dialog to the current project . here you can make a lot of project @-@ related settings . every project @-@ type has different possible settings , most of them are described via the What is it ? -@@ Help described by the right mouse button . &quot;
this entry will only appear in an active data @-@ CD / DVD or video @-@ DVD project . it is useful if you are using files for a multi @-@ session CD . this data is not used for you . it &apos;s more likely to be used as help you can see the files already existing files and folders .
&quot; this entry is only available on an active data @-@ CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function causes us to remove &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; , imports files from the current project . all other files are removed from the medium , it only ends the previously imported files back . &quot;
&quot; opens the CD @-@ cop@@ ying dialog . this also allows no project file to create a CD to another medium . alternatively , there is also possible to create a picture of a CD , which you would like to burn then eventually . also , there are also the possibility of climbing instead of normal cop@@ ying . you should also want to copy cl@@ ones when you want to copy CDs with def@@ ects sectors or video CDs . &quot;
&quot; opens the DVD cop@@ ying dialog . this also allows no project file to create a DVD to another medium . alternatively , there is also possible to create a picture of a DVD using a normal copy . also , there is also the possibility of climbing on a DVD with help of cop@@ ying dialogue will not be supported , therefore the target must be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source medi@@ ums in the original form . &quot;
&quot; opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW , so you can delete the entire contents or parts of a CD @-@ RW . &quot;
&quot; opens the dialog to the form@@ att@@ ing of a DVD . with this dialog , you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , thereby the content is completely deleted . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the writing mod@@ elling and incre@@ mental . &quot;
&quot; the dialog burns a previously created CD @-@ image . the dialogue asks you after a * .@@ is@@ o , * .c@@ ue or * .@@ to@@ c file as data source , which then immediately will not be supported by pressing the Br@@ enn@@ as button . ( Ner@@ os * .n@@ r@@ g files are not currently un@@ supported , you need other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . ) &quot;
&quot; the dialog burns a previously created DVD image . the dialogue asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o file as data source , which can then be immediately burned through pressing the b@@ enn@@ as button . &quot;
&quot; a previously printed DVD video can be converted . this dialogue window will usually be used after reading a DVD in the ingredient , but can also be used as well . it contains information about the expres@@ sing video , codi@@ fication settings and even options to change the size and cut black rings . &quot;
&quot; displays information about the occa@@ sional medium . this information is displayed in the ingredient and contain features of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD . &quot;
&quot; shows a list of the tool@@ bars of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is crossed , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window . &quot;
&quot; if this is crossed , a small bar at the bottom of the window appears . it contains information about the status of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not crossed , the status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; the folder view is one or out . the folder view contains an overview of your folder and the CD / DVD drives . if the content view is activated , its content is displayed in the file format . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , locks and un@@ locking the drive or exclusion of the medium . &quot;
&quot; the table view is one or out . the table view allows you to select and drag files into the project view . the ingredient is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , if a drive has been selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view . &quot;
&quot; the p@@ inch is a nar@@ rower area in the project view , which is only visible when the project view has an actual function , it looks only pretty , and separates the project view clear from the remaining views . &quot;
&quot; this will open a dialog window to change the key@@ orders for &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after having selected one of the available commands in the upper part , one can adjust the keyboard order to be further down . &quot;
&quot; this will start the K@@ 3@@ b ; in@@ filtr@@ ation assist@@ ants . thus , the correct pre@@ dict@@ ations to the burning of CDs and DVDs are set . therefore , system administ@@ rators need to enter the password for the system administ@@ rators ( root ) . &quot;
opens the settings of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; here you can set general pro@@ portions . almost all the functions of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; should be applied to an@@ hi@@ eb . this dialog is intended to person@@ alize and for the anim@@ al@@ ment of the program .
&amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; is how many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications can be equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . with the help of this interface can be controlled parts of the functionality for instance via a shell script .
&quot; to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions , you can either use the command line program d@@ co@@ p , or which is a bit more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are crucial in the functioning program , so it is more likely to give your taste and the nature of your task . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter , we suppose that you can use the command line program d@@ co@@ p . to make use of the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; you have to make sure you need to make sure that &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; start something like the following to the console : &quot;
&quot; besides the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; features that all &amp; k@@ de ; program used , supports &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts , which are described below . &quot;
&quot; the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions such as copy@@ CD , form@@ at@@ DVD and other functions to create new projects . &quot;
D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref creat@@ e@@ Navigator CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref creat@@ e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref creat@@ e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref creat@@ e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref creat@@ e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref creat@@ e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( )
&quot; as a result of such a creat@@ e@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , you can create a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly generated project : # K@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project received by # d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above @-@ proj@@ ected interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface which is only applicable on data @-@ projects ( CD and DVD ) :
&quot; void creat@@ e@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ string name ) void creat@@ e@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ string name , Q@@ string Material ) void add@@ Ur@@ ls ( Q@@ String path ) void re@@ mov@@ e@@ Item ( Q@@ String path ) void ren@@ ame@@ Item ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String new@@ name ) void ini@@ qu@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String path ) &quot;
&quot; for example , it is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , multiple folder and then adds files to the new folder : &quot;
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T = $ ( d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface creat@@ e@@ Data@@ Type Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T creatine $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T creatine Ur@@ l / home / tru@@ eg / som@@ ef@@ oot txt / foo / bar
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ Read@@ er for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it all simple audio CD ; s can be read and stored in MP@@ 3- or OGG files . other formats are possible depending on the Enco@@ der that is installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the interface of cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for evalu@@ ating &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on hard disk ) and by many codi@@ ers who will be installed as default for MP3 , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs and FLA@@ C ( los@@ s@@ loss compression ) . &quot;
&quot; first , the title of the &amp; CD ; read and stored in WAV files on the computer ( left @-@ free and compressed ) ; and then &quot;
are used in a second step to this WAV files ( usually one per title ) compressed to the MP@@ 3- or OGG format or also in other formats such as the los@@ s@@ free FLA@@ C .
&quot; for the first step , the output of the &amp; CD ; is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator , cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not installed , this has to be done now . &quot;
&quot; for the second step you have to be installed ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for OGG ) or other codi@@ fication . all these programs are usually not necessary for any Linux distri@@ butions , but it is not necessary for any Linux distribution . however , if for example FLA@@ C is not used , the installation is also not required . &quot;
which co@@ ding / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher codi@@ erer gives a small introduction to co@@ erer , audio quality and compromise . &quot;
&quot; a word about cop@@ ying protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator , cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read the audio data from the &amp; CD ; it is not possible to deal with a protected audio CD ; it is not possible to avoid a protected audio CD ; it &apos;s not possible to avoid the mechanisms of cop@@ ying audio CD ; s you simply avoid the purchase of copy @-@ protected audio @-@ CD ; s ! &quot;
&quot; while the setup only has to be made ( the setup dialog , but can often be called up to a suitable configuration ) , after the daily handling of a &amp; CD ; this leads ( hopefully ) to understanding the slim approach of the user interface , which you often have to see at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; can convert into many formats - depending on what codi@@ les programs are installed ( MP3 , OGG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) &quot;
&quot; can &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB can get from the internet or can fully work without network , whereby all is manually recorded . &quot;
&quot; this is only a brief list of the commands of the main window . on the side step by step , you will find out more information about how this program is used as well as screen pictures with descriptions of the tab for the configuration of the program . &quot;
&quot; start the CD@@ DB request to CD @-@ Data according to the establishment of request at the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be locally or online , in the latter case the connection must first be made to the Internet . ) &quot;
starts editing and - if a enco@@ der is configured in the registry settings in the installation address - the co@@ ding .
&quot; opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available enco@@ der , so that selecting to be read with another enco@@ der as the standard . it is to note that before the Enco@@ der is configured in the registry settings in the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; opening the file manager , so an already selected file is selected for the code rather than a full &amp; CD ; add and to co @-@ code . &quot;
&quot; opens the installation dialog to configure the type of not@@ ifications ( such as protocols , pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for pro@@ portions ( including reading the &amp; CD ; finished ) . &quot;
&quot; opens the main @-@ setup dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator , with different mapping cards ( such as Enco@@ der , to setup the Enco@@ ders ) . here you have to go before the program can be used successfully ! &quot;
this chapter describes audio quality , codi@@ fication and com@@ pres@@ sion@@ ary and helps you to choose the right codi@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information is to be lost , a lost audio format is needed . besides FLA@@ C there are also other such as &apos; sh@@ orts &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are the small compression rati@@ os and hardly available commercial devices that can restore this files . &quot;
&quot; among the audio formats , the information is losing by data compression depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and OGG , today may have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 kb@@ ps ) , but above this bit@@ rate the differences become less important , as both codi@@ les can produce very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; O &apos; not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is still delivered with most distri@@ butions , but there are open license issues &quot;
+ high up very high pick@@ up quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) but compared to OGG slightly deeper quality at deeper bit@@ rates .
OGG - if only music should be heard from a machine or a machine based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG devices are available .
&quot; MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , storage , hard drive ) or special car stereo systems . today - beginning 2009 - support these devices mostly only the MP3 format . &quot;
a short list of parameters to the audio quality and derived from the compression rati@@ os for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer transparency for most people and most musicians acceptable , and has quite high quality . good enough for Hi@@ Fi @-@ stereo with high quality . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 kb@@ ps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 mm needs up to 320 kb@@ ps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for Hi@@ Fi @-@ stereo with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 kb@@ ps CB@@ R , compression rate around 5.5 . requires always 256 kb@@ ps for complex and less complex pieces of a tit@@ els . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for Hi@@ Fi @-@ stereo with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos; = 128 kb@@ ps CB@@ R common stereo , compression rate approximately 11 128 kb@@ ps for all pieces of a tit@@ els . good geni@@ uses for music by juven@@ iles , portable devices and auto@@ stere@@ ograms . but not good enough for better Hi@@ Fi stereo systems . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et Ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ kb@@ ps CB@@ R . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments but if you absolutely want to have the absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size , then select this setting . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; CD ; information that is manually entered or by the program automatically from the free@@ DB program , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can hand / used with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator , and the codi@@ fication program to create the folder and file names as well as the features of the music files . &quot;
&quot; in connection with codi@@ fication programs , there is often a combination of program provisions for the codi@@ fication and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the co@@ ding regist@@ ers declare the switches for these programs . &quot;
&quot; for example , add the &amp; CD ; titles to the keywords , if MP@@ 3@@ s will be co@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ tt from l@@ ame and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; the results can be seen as follows : &apos; ... -@@ tt { ... } ... &apos; . &quot;
this is a summary of &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button @-@ drawing in the wiz@@ ard ) :
&quot; this is what the free@@ DB is : a free database , in which person can read the audio CDs , so that all other information can be downloaded into the computer . it is to note that all the other information can be downloaded into the machine : &amp; CD ; title , artists , names of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal , but I am not attor@@ ney . however , no one can prevent that you are encrypted by the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so that any information can be added to the music nor the music company . all information can be obtained from a B@@ um@@ mel through a &amp; CD ; business , physically , or virtual . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; K@@ audi@@ o@@ creator , is an active part of an address ( sending an address ) . for the use of free@@ DB can be used with another ( fake ) address when using the data from the server ( This can only know the programmer who has checked the code . ) &quot;
&quot; there are in many different countries copies of the main database . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator , is set up to use of free@@ DB , the geographic scope should be used in the network and balances the burden on the computer . &quot;
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mir@@ ror@@ servers for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during ex@@ clude on a &amp; CD ; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which read@@ ings program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
there is ru@@ mo@@ urs that this is called cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ; those who want to know more precisely in the source code .... it has always been the best choice for reading audio @-@ CD ; see it is always necessary that the cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package has to be installed first if this is not yet happened .
&quot; to save the selected WAV files , the codi@@ fication and the desired file format will be selected . at the first opening there are pre@@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a des@@ erted compression for audio data ) can be added on this tab . &quot;
the codi@@ erer package must be installed from the concerned Linux distribution before the co@@ co@@ erer can be used . this is also necessary for the pre @-@ defined codi@@ fication . for more information about codi@@ les are in the chapter Wel@@ cher codi@@ les .
after installing a codi@@ fication can further information about his switches can be obtained through the input of a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a con@@ sol@@ en@@ window ( eg ; console ) . it must be replaced by the name of the installed codi@@ fication .
&quot; this can have many causes . check the equipment of the device recording of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drives , the writing and readers are installed for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , fl@@ ac &amp; etc ; ) . try to give both programs with a command line in a terminal . that could give an indication of what is wrong . &quot;
check if you do not want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the env@@ elope of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
&quot; there is a chapter with a step for step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; have you read the complete manual , all understood , but are somehow still uns@@ ure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by example , and you will get enough information to do those areas that make the program exactly what you want . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we will start the program for the first time to start everything and use our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to create MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 kb@@ ps on average and I@@ D3@@ v@@ 1 keywords ( tags ) . &quot;
there must be cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found for example with a search@@ engine since it is not necessary to comp@@ ile the source files you can always do .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have scre@@ ams on it ( eg ; by trying to copy with the Con@@ quer@@ or something . )
&quot; the first section covers the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator , something which is probably done only once and &quot;
&quot; the second section describes the procedure for reading a &amp; CD , which must be repeated for each fil@@ ing &amp; CD ; &quot;
&quot; here we determine the co@@ ded co@@ co@@ ding to the compression of music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 kb@@ ps ) . as we are lazy , we split the program to use the free@@ DB to download the &amp; CD ; data from the Internet . &quot;
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change it with any one &amp; CD ; if once the appropriate settings are found . &quot;
the instrument @-@ design@@ ation is transferred to the read@@ ings program to read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces can be read .
&quot; frequently / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real dev@@ ic@@ ation of your drive . if this is not working or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive can also be accessed , so helps a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab as well as an attempt to select there existing entries for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot;
here are not much to do . here you can &apos;t find a lot of conversion . here you can see an additional conversion . in our example everything will be displayed as screen as shown in the screenshot .
&quot; only if you want to ask for incomplete information , so you will be informed when information about the creation of keywords ( tags ) are missing . &quot;
the card @-@ card CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the Internet from a free@@ DB machine .
note : the machine must be connected to the out@@ reading of the &amp; CD ; with the internet so he can access the free@@ DB server .
&quot; the second drop @-@ off is simpler , a &amp; CD ; entry was found immediately , starts immediately the output &apos;s name / fil@@ en@@ ame or day entries , you can easily change . the directory or fil@@ en@@ ame is changed to cont@@ quer@@ or and the ID@@ 3 tags with Kid@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; tag@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; apart from this example is further to note : if you want to manually enter everything manually . however , this about 620 MB large , you can download the database before . however , this is about 620 MB . however , these two choices must be selected in the Off@@ line mode , the two choices must be selected on the following map . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB is free@@ DB for us . these are settings for the data requested , for retri@@ ev@@ ing the &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB server via the Internet . how do I know the system which data is to get the CD ? read the section about free@@ DB . see everything as it is displayed in the screenshot . &quot;
mode : we do not download the database and we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB @-@ Server : please go to page fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server in your area . this way the burden will be distributed between the computers . this attitude is however first attempt to work .
&quot; both are functioning out what the server concerns , as though many fire@@ walls fall by 88@@ 80 as default , there is perhaps more happiness with the protocol 80 , since the &amp; HTTP ; protocol is usually open to surf on the internet . &quot;
in this example we do not want to submit any &amp; CD ; data to the free@@ DB server should be able to switch .
simply take the settings of the screen shot . ( make sure that the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
&quot; at the same time per@@ mis@@ sible pieces : exc@@ use , there is a reason why more than one at the same time is just one existing drive ? parallel reading and co@@ ding ? the author does not know it , therefore simply try yourself . &quot;
&quot; CD ; after reading the last piece , you can cross this to the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process . &quot;
&quot; custom@@ ised folders for temporary files : if you are displayed this cross , then the path must be stored / folder in which the WAV file is available . if the field cannot be crossed , the files will not be swit@@ ched on a different drive . if you do not forget this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files . &quot;
&quot; all in the same way as it is on the screen shot . the command is somewhat long , under circumstances a bit must be coated to see everything . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good hi @-@ quality stereo . it is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption . &quot;
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the restriction of the production of tags to version 1 / v@@ 1.@@ 1 &apos; I@@ D3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags can also be deleted if needed . Kid@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of later change the tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
put the rest like in the screenshot . some comments for future use outside this example :
&quot; the number of simultaneously co@@ ded WAV files : at a Du@@ al@@ Core or Quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine can be tried , more than a WAV file at the same time . &quot;
&quot; this is , we have just finished the basic establishment of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator , . this configuration is used as default for each output of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music , you never need to change it again . &quot;
&quot; in this section is described , as the process of read@@ ings of the &amp; CD ; on the hard disk . we will build MP3 files . first , a connection to the Internet is structured , as we are convenient and the &amp; CD ; data from the free@@ DB will be described , must be repeated for each fil@@ ing &amp; CD ; &quot;
&quot; as we use a &amp; CD , which is not included in free@@ DB , see the screenshot is a little different than that for a &amp; CD ; with successful from free@@ DB de@@ pressed data . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually enter , instead of pick them from the Internet . &quot;
try not the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this hand@@ book .
&quot; if this is not yet happened , now the &amp; CD has to be defined in the main window , which is defined in the main window . &quot;
&quot; after a short moment the pieces and its length should be listed in the window , just as in the screen shot . this only when the &amp; CD ; can be identified as audio CD ; could be read and from cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
if this is not happening then you are looking for questions and answers to the help or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings .
&quot; attention : if the &amp; CD ; successfully completed by the free@@ DB , all tracks of the pieces are already filled and also the name of the artist and the album are shown . &quot;
&quot; in the event that there is more than an entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; key for your &amp; CD ; there will be a window appears , and you can select the database entry , which you think is best about your &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; if you do not have the cruci@@ fix@@ ing for the automatic query of free@@ DB ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in dialogue for the settings ) , you can also manually trigger this by choosing the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you do not pick any local database , but collect data from the internet , you need the connection to the Internet . &quot;
e 1.2 step 02 : the CD @-@ Editor - entry of the CD @-@ Data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen shot .
the artist does not have to be given any more in the input field &apos; Current Title &apos; unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece .
&quot; the lower comment field can be used for the individual comments ini@@ di@@ oxide per piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments which apply to all the pieces of the CD . &quot;
&quot; attention : after the successful withdrawal of the data from the free@@ DB file , the CD Editor is not empty , but it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD Editor , so that you can not only begin with the artist &apos;s album or not ... ) but also to check whether there are any undes@@ irable remarks . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example we use only I@@ D3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this is limited by the fields of fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of one piece and on only 28 characters for the comment area . if you have I@@ D3@@ v@@ 2 tags , at least on what &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; maximum allows you to set a look at the tab code settings ; take a look into the section &apos; basic settings &apos; . &quot;
you can change the day information of produced files later at any time with the tag editor . Kid@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create I@@ D3@@ v@@ 2 tags . &quot;
tags are not supported by all the co@@ ding or file formats . see in the help to the codi@@ fication in order to get more information .
&quot; simply select an entry that obviously does not agree with the style of the out@@ appro@@ ve CD ; in this example , this is not important , as we do not transfer the &amp; CD ; for more information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or r@@ ap for example are to be found under Rock . &quot;
after the choice of &apos; OK &apos; you return to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece .
&quot; the window of the CD @-@ Ed@@ itors will appear again and you will see that the fields for the album are already filled with the given data , which we have gathered for the first piece . enter the piece of the piece in any case and other information you wish . &quot;
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you entered all the title data of the &amp; CD ;
attention : this window does not appear when you download the data from the free@@ DB file . it is already sorted in one of these categories in the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album are shown above the list .
&quot; note that it has a check @-@ in before each line of a piece . only the titles are selected , or simply select the button . select all the pieces , or bet@@ rot@@ ate the button all the pieces select at the bottom of the screen to choose all the pieces at once . &quot;
was started by clicking the button selection out of the read@@ able process so this window will appear . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what runs out .
&quot; click on the rider orders to switch on the order window . it is in the upper upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool@@ bar . &quot;
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece will be read straight onto the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the lower part of the window in the status line .
this error tells you when you are trying to work with a codi@@ fication that you have not installed yet . pieces that were not successful with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
&quot; inci@@ dentally , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the target folder are not what we have entered into example . have you checked whether you access the folder for the temporary files and the target folder ? ; - ) &quot;
&quot; now , it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of the celebration of the first piece . &quot;
&quot; the contract 1 reads the first piece of it , he is finished . but we have a new record : commissioned 4 is the code of pieces 1 into the format MP3 . therefore , read and code parallel . note the status in the lower part of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
the author of the program has no configur@@ ations found to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes to read and code . all the machines used with a AM@@ D@@ 64 does not seem to have a problem at the simultaneous output and co@@ ding ( of but two different pieces ) .
&quot; now , the last song is read , while another piece is co@@ ded and a third order is rolled in the queue . after the last piece is co@@ ded , a small window with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window appears . &quot;
&quot; for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.x and cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create un@@ compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG , you need the codi@@ fication of your choice . &quot;
&amp; K@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; will be maintained today within the &amp; k@@ de ; CVS as part of the cultivation practice package . most distri@@ butions have already included a pre @-@ compiled package because &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package . if you read this , you probably have done it already ... &quot;
&quot; this section is addressed to people that comp@@ ile from source files , and not for users who are intended to use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for help as the program can be adjusted to your needs if it is running , then the following is correct for you : &quot;
&quot; a program that calls many different other programs , has many variations in settings . best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it displays screens of the different card cards of settings and also contains comments for options that are not used for example . &quot;
&quot; Hi , still read on ? even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked on the first starting point of the program , without any cl@@ ue point as it should go on from this somewhat empty screen ( especially if at the time of the program startup , no audio CD ; it is on the drive ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ? &quot;
&quot; who is about it ? who reads this , probably already started the program . it should somehow look like this : &quot;
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately , no e @-@ mail . the author cannot be maintained or change this manual . it is as the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator , thought it may do . at least , after contact with the author . and if you read this , he has besieg@@ ed this section and therefore agree with this proposal . &quot;
&quot; wei@@ rd if it has managed to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you do not need this information , but ... &quot;
&amp; C@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kar@@ a@@ ok@@ esp@@ iel@@ er by &amp; k@@ de ; . besides others he has not added some features that other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have any other features .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system to work on all systems with O@@ SS - and &amp; k@@ de ; support also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultra @-@ proj@@ ections that is required for G@@ US cards . Al@@ sa is included as soon as there is a sequence .
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; shows the lyrics on the screen with altern@@ ating colour , so it is easy to follow the piece . &quot;
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI @-@ channel by lifting of the penet@@ rated buttons on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop so that you can draw in &amp; k@@ de ; every MIDI file can be drawn from a &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; window on S@@ ME@@ s .
supports the two existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( trac@@ ts or textures ) . S@@ ME@@ s automatically determine the methods used each .
&quot; when you stop and finish ; during the waste of a song , S@@ ME@@ s will start again with the same song again . &quot;
&quot; supports external MIDI @-@ syn@@ thesizer , awe , FM and CIS cards ( for the latter , you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first , you can opening ... from the menu file . it appears the usual file dialog , with whose help you can choose the desired song . &quot;
you can also drop a file from a &amp; cross ; window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; windows drop . this also works with several songs simultaneously .
&quot; to play a piece of music , open it and bet@@ rot@@ ate the button to play in the tool@@ bar , choose the entry play out of the menu piece or bet@@ rot@@ ate the Le@@ ert@@ aste . &quot;
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts as soon as you prefer it on the &amp; k@@ mid set . ( with several pieces they are added to a collection and then re@@ played on each other . )
&quot; once you play a piece , you can jump in any place by using the middle mouse button and drive through the controller . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song is too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows on the left and right of the Tem@@ po@@ display and so to get the speed speed . to get back the original pace , click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
&quot; the Le@@ ert@@ aste has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the button break or the selection of the menu items in the menu , therefore inter@@ rup@@ ts the play@@ back while no piece is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playing . &quot;
lyrics can be stored on two species in a piece of music . some pieces use textures and others . some pieces have no text : - )
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid , you can adjust which events are to be depic@@ ted and even better : the event type is automatically selected , so you can change anything manually . you still have the option to change this , if you want to see the other type . &quot;
&quot; if you want to set a event type to set a event type , select from the menu settings , entries and entries . the same function also have the buttons 1 and 2 . &quot;
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you play together . these are the series to be played . in this section how you can use collections efficiently .
&quot; to create a collection , first open the collection @-@ bearings . here you will find in the menu collection under the point .... Click there on New and give the name for the collection . &quot;
you can also copy a existing collection by clicking on cop@@ ying and then select the name for the new collection . this collection is included at the beginning the same songs as the original .
&quot; if you have more than one collection , you can set the desired output in the collector . &quot;
&quot; to the temporary collection you will find all the songs , which you want to add to any other collection . &quot;
&quot; when using the application , this collection is not saved . raise this when you add many pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , it is necessary to add a song in the collectors . there again you can select a song with the button Add @-@ dialogue with whose help you want to select the song you want . &quot;
&quot; a second method to add a song depends on the setting of automation to the collection . &quot;
&quot; if automatic addition to the collection is activated , a piece will be added to the opening ( using file Open or Dra@@ g &amp; Drop ) automatically to the active collection . &quot;
if automatic add to the collection is not activated in opening a piece the tem@@ p collection is activated and the temporary collection will then be added .
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection @-@ bearings , select the collection and the desired song and then click &quot; &quot; Del@@ ete &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the series following the sub@@ menu sequence of menus , the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; if you add songs or select a random sequence in the menu , the order will be re @-@ defined . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , select it in the collection bearings , or use the drop@@ down list above the karaoke text . &quot;
&quot; to jump a song further , select the button next song , the entry next song from the menu or press the button on the right . &quot;
&quot; to move around a song back to jump , choose the button pre@@ y piece , the entry pre@@ y piece of the menu or press the button on the left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collectors , select the collection and click on the button Clear . &quot;
&quot; temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not play a role , since it is not stored at the leaving of &amp; k@@ mid ; not saved . &quot;
&quot; this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers that are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map General @-@ MIDI @-@ Events translated into events that understands the syn@@ thesizer . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI map showing all the events of the type Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the type Change patch to Tru@@ mp@@ et and thus always sound a trumpet , if originally a piano should play . &quot;
&quot; if you only have a sound@@ card , you do not need MIDI @-@ Map because all Sound@@ cards GM are compatible ( including awe and CIS cards , FM radio devices and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is no programs to create MIDI @-@ maps . so you need to edit the appropriate file of your hand ( using your favorite editor ) . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI @-@ map is a text file , all needed conver@@ sions for the play of a piece . &quot;
&quot; each section may only appear once except the KE@@ Y@@ MAP section , which may be as often as desired . prerequis@@ ite for this , however , that every appearance has a different texture ( see below ) . &quot;
define P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP ... END define KE@@ Y@@ MAP &quot; name &quot; KE@@ Y@@ MAP &quot; ... END define KE@@ Y@@ MAP &quot; ... END define CHAN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP ... END Options ... END
&quot; you see that define it is needed to display , that a section begins ( except for Options ) and END that the end of a line is achieved . &quot;
&quot; please send me your Map file as e @-@ mail , so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can offer for devices that are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ compliant . &quot;
&quot; in this section is specified , such as the patches of General MIDI on your specific keyboard . the general use looks like this : &quot;
&quot; please note that the left side of the equ@@ ator will be ignored . it is assumed that the GM -@@ patches in the right order lie ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order and no line for one of the 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to put all the sounds , which need this instrument to put on the sound with the number M ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which is similar to a tissue type . this allows you to carry the following in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section : &quot;
&quot; so if a MIDI @-@ file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 ( Win shot ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that here with the term Drum patch of the patch , in which every sound is a different percussion instrument ( drum , pel@@ vis , Marac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one , in which the sound means the pitch of the always same drum . &quot;
KE@@ Y@@ MAP section will be used to specify how sounds on a specific channel or instrument can be pic@@ tured .
&quot; as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of lines is very important , as well as their presence . you must therefore create 128 entries . &quot;
you can define several key@@ maps for each channel and each instrument . you just need to use different names in the first line .
Key@@ maps are used mainly to form sounds on the per@@ me@@ tic canal . check out as an example the supplied Key@@ maps .
&quot; this section can be used to form some channels to others . if you want to change the first and second channel , make it quite simply at the CHAN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards , which have the percussion on a certain channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; Midi devices need 16 channels , the CHAN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern : &quot;
&quot; n is the channel , which is shown on the channel N . if you use the key@@ map option , the Key@@ map does not need to use the name for this channel . the corresponding Key@@ map does not need to change the patch on this channel . in this case , all events will try to change the patch on this channel . in this case is then always patch x used . &quot;
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful for instance to always use the per@@ ky patch on the Per@@ k@@ iv channel .
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio gives to what is multip@@ lied , in which relation Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der events will be multip@@ lied with the value , it is calculated with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then only forwar@@ ded . the value 40@@ 96 is used to do so in the map file ( no dec@@ imal com@@ pressor ) . &quot;
&quot; this attitude is needed because GM will present that a keyboard , which should play a Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der @-@ Event with the value 40@@ 96 , a sound higher . unfortunately , try to play the correct value on your keyboard , you must try a bit of &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI @-@ map , just open the dialog MIDI settings . this can be found in the menu under Settings , point MIDI @-@ settings &quot;
the can@@ oe @-@ view is a window with a whole series of pian@@ os ( one for each MIDI @-@ channel ) . on these pian@@ os you can see which sounds are being played .
&quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain channel . for each channel there is a selection list , where you can choose an instrument , illuminated the kno@@ bs not more green but red , to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used . &quot;
the can@@ oe @-@ view has ( until now ) two different views to display the played sounds . the view can choose in the menu Settings under the point Kan@@ al@@ View : settings
&quot; the speed LCD displays the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the pace of a song . so if you find for example , a song is too fast to follow the text you can slow it . to change the pace , use the arrows on the left and right of the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI files is a file that contains information about how a piece of music has to be played . it contains the notes , the rhythm , the speed , &amp; etc ; . &quot;
&quot; good , I can force no one to use , &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while a mp3 @-@ file needs a similar sound quality . at a MIDI files you can also change the single instruments , the speed &amp; etc . you have control of everything . &quot;
&quot; this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; because it has been compiled , because &amp; k@@ mid ; without awe @-@ support has been compiled , you need to download a source distribution and install it ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s homepage ) &quot;
&quot; I would like to add a whole folder to a collection , but I do not want to add all files individually . &quot;
&quot; agree , this is why &amp; k@@ mid ; Dra@@ g &amp; Drop . open the folder you want to add in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; , choose all the files , and drag them onto the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ windows . &quot;
&quot; previously , you necessarily enable the setting of automation to the collection . otherwise the files are added to the temporary collection . &quot;
you can use the arrow key to the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD replacement for viewing the play@@ back . to re@@ produce the standard temp@@ o you click on the LCD double click .
I have to play on a &amp; k@@ ite ; desktop window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this way I have to play a MIDI files or I want to play a file just into the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; window and drag the desired file to the window of &amp; k@@ mid .
&quot; if you want to listen to a file just a file without adding them into a collection , turn off the adjustment to the collection , and the new ; file is added to the temporary collection . opening files &quot;
&quot; suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . only you want to play the first file . so please introduce the adjustment to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your tem@@ p collection will then be exactly this a MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; then un@@ lock yourself , also B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid set up and create a collection of all three files . how do you do that ? &quot;
these people have sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you so much ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard animated me to go on &amp; k@@ mid .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; I studied mathematics at the University of Ma@@ h ; Lag@@ a . at the moment I am in the third year so that I &apos;m not much time for my hob@@ bies but I try to collect my little time for my hob@@ bies but I try to collect myself a bit of time . when hob@@ bies I have program@@ ing to collect music and make propositions .
&quot; if you want to know where to download MIDI / karaoke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you just want to make me happy , write me an e @-@ mail : Lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is.@@ it &quot;
&quot; if you really want to send me a postcard from your location or send a MI@@ DI@@ - / karaoke file from a local group . if you want to send me a postcard or a MIDI file , but if you want to contact me , as I might get in touch with me as I might have the file . &quot;
I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; entirely written in my spare time and don &apos;t want to make money from anyone . I would like to emphasize that I just want to proceed with it because / when I get back feed@@ backs from users ( post@@ cards or e @-@ mails ) .

and of course my thanks also applies to all these outstanding musicians on the web that give us this wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and karaoke files .
&quot; in addition , &amp; k@@ mid , can also be found on his homepage , which is found at http : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is.@@ it / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .html . on the homepage you can see the development , find information and pictures . you will also find links to pages with further karaoke songs , &amp; etc . &quot;
a sound@@ card . I recommend you a good sound@@ card or an external syn@@ thesizer since the sound quality is essentially dependent on your sound@@ card . it is not the same as you use an FM device or a awe @-@ card .
&quot; if you do not have a sound@@ card , you must comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ Demo _ ON@@ LY@@ VI@@ SU@@ AL . it runs as if you had a sound@@ card , except that you can &apos;t hear music of course . &quot;
&quot; if problems occur , please contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; mail@@ ing lists or send an error message directly to me . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ player ; is a simple interface for M@@ player , Ph@@ ono and FF@@ M@@ peg . the program is used for playing video files from M@@ player or PH@@ ON@@ ON supported formats , as well as to play DVD &apos;s , VCD , or TV and camera . &quot;
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished yet than &amp; k@@ de ; was installed on this machine .
for additional assistance please check the page The KDE website on new versions or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; user mail@@ ing list .
the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ ock@@ ing windows . there is always the window with the central view . op@@ tionally there is the window with the playlist . and finally there is an information window which is only displayed when information is re @-@ admit .
&quot; it is possible to watch the preferred connection under the menu bookmark extract , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category permanent playlist . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarch@@ ic body . if you copy an entry , his group and all its sub @-@ groups are copied and the play begins with the cli@@ cked entry . &quot;
&quot; the categories &apos; News &apos; , TV and permanent playlist can also be changed by direct editing of XML configuration files . of course you can only do the different files in the directory ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / km@@ player , but also by clicking on a name of a category of click , but also by clicking on a name of a sub@@ group , only the XML content of this part is displayed . &quot;
&quot; after changing XML files , the menu has to be selected from the menu with a playlist , or select either the edit mode , or another category . &quot;
&quot; all changes are lost , if the editing mode can leave or another group is selected without the playlist . &quot;
&quot; as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; km@@ player , some features can only be swit@@ ched on by changing the XML configuration files . &quot;
&quot; the animation in the starting and ending can be disabled by the editing of ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ err@@ c and modification of &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 the option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can be easily inserted . &quot;
it is also possible to activate a different animation . &amp; km@@ player ; the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / km@@ player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / km@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format has to be an supported XML file .
&quot; the animation at the start does not need to be short , it is automatically stopped by opening another source . this would be bot@@ her@@ ed by the end @-@ animation , the user can therefore finish the application a second time . &quot;
&quot; a simple example of a start @-@ animation can be the ads of a favourite pictures : &amp; lt ; body@@ work ; &amp; lt ; body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; announ@@ cing in the directory tests / a few examples of S@@ MIL that are supported by &amp; km@@ player ; &quot;
there is a tab for the configuration of M@@ Player in the configuration dialog by &amp; km@@ player ; here you can set the path from the M@@ player and the cli@@ pl@@ ess size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for error @-@ looking is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of km@@ . here is the output of m@@ player visible .
there is no rider for this rend@@ ition@@ dialog by &amp; km@@ player ; everything has to be configured through manu@@ als of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ ma@@ c . here is an example of a &apos; flash &apos; with the module sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa is played :
&quot; Flash &apos;@@ can be played within &amp; km@@ player ; it can even be played with the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML . &quot;
&quot; thus the &amp; km@@ player , &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages can be re@@ written , it must be specified as a service provider for the M@@ ime @-@ type application / x @-@ shock@@ wave file in the setup @-@ dialog file mapping . &quot;
&quot; the Con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; km@@ player ; is to set up in a consoles , and after error messages related to the browser module library . if there is no mistakes , the back@@ end issue is called within &amp; km@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) . &quot;
&quot; in order that whenever a prescribed back@@ end is taken for a specific M@@ ime type ( of course only if this was also determined ) , this must be done by manu@@ als of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example , PH@@ ON@@ ON can be displayed all og@@ g files : &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ player ; can be used by TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be configured , the scanner device can be used and the configuration file can be manually edited . &quot;
&quot; configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( Video Data Rec@@ order ) settings in km@@ player can be found in the settings under - &gt; source - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there , ports should be detected ( e.g. , it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a DVB in it . &quot;
&quot; since the V@@ DR support from km@@ player can only be able to use X@@ Video ( presum@@ ably , this type of playing video equipment under Linux should be the only one that works ) . this is why the vide@@ o@@ for@@ linux extension has to be functional for the X server ( / etc / X11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) . &quot;

are there tips as I can do my CD@@ ROM drive if I do not play from him ( not from the VCD : / / ) ?
yes the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ e 8 / dev / c@@ drom is as user root according to the installation of the tool . it is absolutely secure to make that / dev / c@@ drom can be seen on the CD@@ ROM drive .
&quot; X@@ ine is only slowly starting , why does every time my CPU need to be checked on their performance ? &quot;
&quot; note : the answer is over@@ taking . k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the final value , only the first time is x@@ ins check the CPU . &quot;

Q@@ t ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is required for comp@@ ile by &amp; k@@ ile ;
lat@@ ex ; : a professional font application . under Unix @-@ like systems is likely to be accessed through the package &amp; tex@@ til ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be used in the used &amp; Linux ; distribution must be included . for the installation the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be drawn .
the &amp; k@@ ile ; -@@ Project contains some already compiled packages of &amp; k@@ ile ; for various distri@@ butions ; they enable easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the k@@ ile ;
&quot; this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; k@@ ile , or &amp; Linux ; &quot;
&quot; advanced users must hardly read this manual . however , all suggestions concerning the documentation needs to be considered . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , the contact should be made via the k@@ ile , website . &quot;
&quot; if you have any questions or while the comp@@ iling of &amp; k@@ ile ; on or are extensions , this should be addressed at the mail@@ ing list k@@ ile @-@ dev@@ el @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net . &quot;

&quot; to learn more about &amp; Kate ; and his possibilities to learn , the manual should be attracted to Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can start there directly with reading the chapter with the editor of &amp; Kate ; &quot;
&quot; perfect to use and lat@@ ex ; it is difficult to use the original &amp; tex ; difficult to use , can also use a mood ( engl@@ . lay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ mac@@ ros use . a less demanding but realistic ground@@ ing is that it comes from the surname of Les@@ lie La mp@@ ort . &quot;

&quot; just like other def@@ ences , includes &amp; Latex ; an introduction to be determined by the general public properties like paper format , side tables and text messages . the introduction includes at least the command \ \ Docum@@ ent@@ class , the message starts with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed again with the command \ \ end { document } . &quot;
the Quick @-@ Assist@@ ent of &amp; k@@ ile ; is a great function for the rapid preparation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; the choice of assist@@ ants ( Men@@ Ã ¼ ) offers some possibilities for the preparation of the document . there can also be some possibilities for the document related to the document .
&quot; documentation : this document is defined by the type of created document ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , report &#91; report &#93; , article &#91; report &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , projection ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , projection ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , projection ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , projection ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , projection ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , projection ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , projection ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , Book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , projection ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , Book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , projection ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , Book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , projection ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , Book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , projection ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , Book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , projection ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , Book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , projection ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , Book ( DIN )
code : hereby the string is set to be set . modern systems are increasingly using UT@@ F @-@ 8 -@@ co@@ ding as standard . best in accordance with UT@@ F @-@ 8 -@@ co@@ ding should be used ( correct processing of the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ documents ) .
this list contains the most used pres@@ et used for lat@@ ex cer@@ v@@ ex ; . for the involvement they can only be fully balanced in the cruise line .
&quot; article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the documentation of Com@@ a @-@ Script ( for compliance with German DIN regulations ) . &quot;
new users can now be worried either . it is merely a brief description of the functions and further information on this will be given in the section .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers - as well as other source code editors - the flo@@ wering of the used commands and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . through &amp; k@@ ile ; it is a simple problem looking for that some mathematical environment is not closed . however it is saved by the modest appearance of the output file . however it is saved by the abolition of time and ho@@ unds .
the automatic re@@ activation of the environments is generated by entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) by &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically an idle line ( e.g. \ \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be disabled in the men@@ Ã ¼ settings .
all documents are usually divided into several elements .
&quot; with the view of the document at the structure , the individual elements can be changed by a mouse @-@ click on the respective changes and be viewed . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be very helpful , navig@@ ate &amp; k@@ ile ; by clicking on the right mouse button in the DVI , -@@ viewer per the corresponding line in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ sourc@@ ec@@ ode . &quot;
&quot; a DVI ; file contains a description of the format of the document and also other information such as the font , and is next to PDF the usual output of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; . there are many tools to view , transformation and printing out of DVI ; -@@ Files for various systems and skins . &quot;
&quot; when using the R@@ Ã ¼ bin , the elements of the DVI ; -@@ file has been cli@@ cked on a item in the DVI ; -@@ source code , is the exact opposite of it . once upon a section in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ sourc@@ ec@@ ode is cli@@ cked on a section in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ sourc@@ ec@@ ode is going to the corresponding place in the DVI ; -@@ viewer . &quot;
Master &apos;s document : this function is easier when working with multiple files . using a Master document the work is simpli@@ fied . when using a project can be set to project project settings .
quick @-@ growing : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ sourc@@ ec@@ ode is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if there are no mistakes in the source code ) .
&quot; status surveillance : in this mode , the DVI ; -@@ File to Ã ¼ n@@ der@@ ungen@@ â used to be used for cy@@ n@@ urses , and there is no appeal to &amp; Oc@@ epi@@ ece , according to the fast @-@ growing market . &quot;
&quot; for viewing the edit tool@@ bar , the three gro@@ oves should be conceived in the document for the rapid deployment of the document in parts , chapter , sections , ... &quot;
&quot; the drop@@ outs Read is for example of articles such as keywords , fleet , notes or refer@@ r@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; name : with this command a name is created for a section , a picture or other element . &quot;
reference : is used for the reference to a fixed name ( selection possible ) .
&quot; when using quote , a selection list with literary entries is indicated . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; it only works if the file is necessary to a project . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; and that &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; -@@ files can also be written in &amp; k@@ ile ; by hand . &quot;
the last drop @-@ up box will be used for the purpose of the secretary of the secretary . it is possible to establish the secretary for the main text that will be defined in notes etc . there are the following images :
&quot; when calling &amp; k@@ ile , there are two choices : 1 . assistant for the creation of a new document through selection of documents and fixed settings . &quot;
&quot; the cl@@ as@@ ps according to the command \ \ Docum@@ ent@@ class contain the settings for the command . the option &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; lays down the secretary king , this is not at the beginning , this can also be done in the text . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the above source code has been compiled , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source text has to be compiled . the easiest way to this is the use of the men@@ Ã ¼ s or the button fast . &quot;
the source text must be saved in front of the comp@@ ile . &amp; k@@ ile ; the storage is automatically removed .
&quot; the comp@@ iling of the document fails , should be sear@@ ched in the log file according to the faul@@ ts . when using quick @-@ construction , this should not be started . if this is not the case , the log should also be observed . &quot;
&quot; an environment ( engl@@ . environment ) is a text that will be treated differently from the remaining document . for example , a report with the writer has been created 12 and only a few clicks . &quot;
the Ã ¼ n@@ tions are only sight@@ ed within the area ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no circum@@ cis@@ ed ( number ) for charge of charge within an environment .
&quot; there are many possibilities to increase the read@@ ability and us@@ ability of the document . there can be used for example certain fonts , burning , c@@ ant printing , etc . these commands may either add to the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment . &quot;
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is closed for the course of course and is closed until it is closed until he is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in one set can be represented with \ \ emp@@ h { word } ital@@ ic .
\ \ quote : creates a quot@@ ation in the document . the quot@@ ation starts with \ \ begin { $ } and ends with \ \ end { quote } .
&quot; after the background to write the source text with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; ex@@ clude language was followed , now follows a step @-@ step guide to the preparation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; &quot;
&quot; once in the wiz@@ ard , a bit of text was entered , a few adjustments should be accomplished for the better read@@ ability of the document . we should mind@@ set a quote , a few places in the fat and spa printing and a poem to use to see the differences of these commands . &quot;
&quot; once the document was viewed , can be used by Editor @-@ View or Str@@ g E back to the editor . with an external viewer , its window must be closed . &quot;
&quot; once the DVI ; file has been created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . &quot;
&quot; this files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; Latex ; these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; Latex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi edition such as pr@@ inters , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF -@@ transform@@ ers or computer @-@ umbre@@ llas . &quot;
for printing a &amp; DVI ; file is the same steps as for the preparation of the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - the document can be printed correctly ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is properly set ) .
&quot; the tool@@ bar allows the transformation of DVI ; -@@ file to other formats . as soon as the DVI ; -@@ file created from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ sourc@@ ec@@ ode , the conversion rate can be started with the buttons in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
the preference for direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position inside the DVI ; -@@ file .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a suitable setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ bin@@ aries . there must be only Modern under Settings K@@ ile ... tools B@@ auen .
&quot; to feed the accus@@ ations , the mouse @-@ line must be positioned in a line of the source text and enter into pre @-@ set @-@ looking back@@ rest . the jump to the corresponding place in the DVI ; -@@ viewer takes place immediately . &quot;
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with one click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; document the appropriate &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ document of &amp; k@@ ile ; ge@@ aring and at the corresponding line there must be defined ( settings ey@@ epi@@ ece ( settings ey@@ epi@@ ece ... Editor )
&quot; if using fast @-@ mounting the &amp; DVI ; ob@@ server does not apply , an error can be found . if an error occurred , this is displayed in the log file or in the news window . &quot;
the log file can be used in the source code . in the editor the log file can always be used in the error . the log file can always be cli@@ cked on the error in the log file and k@@ ile ; jump to error in the log file and &amp; k@@ ile ; jump to fl@@ aw@@ ful line .
&quot; once you click on the corresponding button in the tool@@ bar , a window will appear for the selection of the suitable template for the document . &quot;
&quot; when selecting a empty document , a document may be written either from scratch or assistant for quick creating a new document . further information can be found in the section . &quot;
H@@ Ã ¤ u@@ f@@ ige users of &amp; Latex ; mostly use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be saved in &amp; k@@ ile ; created and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
&quot; to create a new template , either have to create an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; a new template can be created using an existing document and choose from file template . &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document from a template using a file , some strings can be replaced by other data ( e.g. name or string enco@@ ding ) . these variables can be set in settings according to settings . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know what string bet@@ s are replaced by which variables are : &quot;
&quot; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ TC@@ LA@@ S@@ SO@@ P@@ TIONS $ $ : this string is replaced by typ@@ ing in documentation : \ \ Docum@@ ent@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ TC@@ LA@@ S@@ SO@@ P@@ TIONS $ $ &#93; { article } . &quot;
the sim@@ pl@@ est way to create a template is the use of the wiz@@ ard and the cover@@ t of the commands in the editor . once the document was created in this way :
&quot; when creating a new document , your own template can be selected instead of standard@@ ly . &quot;
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files created . will be a simple way to create a template should be sought after one in the Internet and the steps described below .
&amp; Kate ; used by Kate ; as an internal editor . &amp; Kate ; is a text editor with the possibility of reading and pos@@ sessions of many different types of text files ( including &amp; ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings are made directly from &amp; k@@ ile .
&quot; to learn more about Kate ; and his possibilities to learn , the manual should be attracted to Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile , can begin with the reading of the chapter with the editor of &amp; Kate ; start . &quot;
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ command refer@@ enz which can be called for the help of La@@ TeX reference . it contains a leading description of virtually all commands that can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; use them as well as their syntax .
a double @-@ click with penet@@ rated C@@ tr@@ l -@@ button to add the &amp; tex ; word meaning that in this way when clicking \ \ par \ \ \ par \ \ big@@ sc@@ ip is only \ \ par well @-@ balanced .
&quot; when pulling the text with penet@@ rated left mouse , the selected text will be automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
when using the arrow buttons with penet@@ rated Exchange can be taken from parts of the source text in the Ed@@ itor@@ window .
&amp; k@@ ile ; has the ability to browse the most diverse types of source @-@ tex@@ tiles ; for example , the patterns differ from normal text and the mathematical form@@ ulas are highlighted by another color . &quot;
&quot; a lot of assist@@ ants can be seen , there is a separate type of book@@ marks within the text . the menu is highlighted or the corresponding key@@ boards , so that it is automatically highlighted in the first input of a sign . &quot;
&quot; the editing is probably one of the main aspects of using a program like &amp; k@@ ile ; . although &amp; Kate ; already excellent opportunities offered , have been added in &amp; k@@ ile ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; special orders for their selection . &quot;
&quot; with a paragraph a complete paragraph ( group of lines that contain on both sides a blank line ) . with a paragraph it is not a text with penet@@ rated lines ( as in other text edit@@ ors ) . this advanced meaning will be included in the tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands and all other lines of the source text . the only bow @-@ proof thing in &amp; k@@ ile ; is that the sum of two blank lines are separated . &quot;
&quot; however , the word under the current C@@ urs@@ or@@ position . this selection has also an advanced meaning , since this command also holds a lat@@ ex ; commands with a rings ( \ \ ) and a Additi@@ onal star ( * ) at the end of the end . &quot;
&quot; for example , a part of the document can be removed from this first and by pressing the button hi@@ des . &amp; Kate ; offers its own command such as a faster result . &quot;
remo@@ ves a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; k@@ ile ; is contained in the description to edit files .
it has already been clari@@ fied that environments to play a central role in &amp; Latex ; therefore offers &amp; k@@ ile ; for further orders in editing environment for a m@@ Ã ¶ h@@ ful simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
with this command the current environment is spra@@ yed to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the c@@ ursor is placed directly in front of the command to the destination of the environment .
this command is going to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the c@@ ursor is placed directly behind the command to the shooting of the area .
if the c@@ ursor is before or inside the command \ \ begin { surroundings } is spra@@ yed to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
&quot; if the entry of many w@@ ax@@ ed environments can be lost quickly the Ã ¨ es@@ view , the most recently ordered area , so that the w@@ ax@@ ed environment structure will not be used . &quot;
&amp; k@@ ile ; also offers special orders for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ groups that are determined by cl@@ as@@ ps { ... } are a few important commands that meet those from Ed@@ iting surroundings .
the c@@ ursor is placed at the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the c@@ ursor is placed directly in front of the pe@@ eping cl@@ amps .
this command will lead to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the c@@ ursor is placed directly behind the wel@@ ded cl@@ amps .
&quot; when the c@@ ursor is before or behind the wel@@ ded cl@@ amps of a &amp; tex ; group # it is spra@@ yed to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; when entering many cas@@ ed groups brackets , groups par@@ enth@@ eses can be lost quickly the Ã ¨ es@@ view of the mountain@@ ous group , so that the laugh@@ ed structure of the &amp; tex ; groups will not be rep@@ lic@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; the sign is used in &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the purpose of purpose , the sign is used . &quot;
this automatic inser@@ tion of double suits can be set under settings K@@ ile ... La@@ TeX and will be exhausted .
there are also many other languages available . there are also many other languages available .
&quot; if the current position within a list@@ ings ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or item@@ ize ) , i.e. the current position within a list@@ ings ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or item@@ ize ) , but at the same time the command \ \ item . &quot;
inside a tables area included ho@@ ops &amp; k@@ ile ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with a stroke reed cut off .
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to support vo@@ re@@ ing@@ est@@ ell@@ te &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or custom @-@ defined environments . these can be added to settings according to settings .
&quot; some users were able to arrange the columns in tables -@@ environments with each other E@@ t @-@ sign ( amp ; ) to each other . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; Kate ; already has a good source code review , this was built in &amp; k@@ ile ; in order to have special commands ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) still extended . there are three different modes available for the automatic re@@ plac@@ ements . all of these modes can be set for automatic re@@ plac@@ ements . &quot;
at the beginning a new environment using the command \ \ begin { surroundings } is &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically add the command \ \ end { an } after an empty row ( for the text ) .
&quot; by pressing the r@@ ind key , the last letter of entry is removed and multip@@ lied , the list can be reduced by entering a further letter . &quot;
&quot; all orders will be written with a brief description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions can be found in a selection of a command . alternatively you can find a jump to these positions by modi@@ fying explo@@ sives . &quot;
under settings k@@ ile ; set ... k@@ ile ; re@@ plac@@ ements can be made to these lists . it can be used for different value @-@ lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands as well as w@@ axes of the general language .
the command mo@@ dus is not necessary for the pro@@ hibition of environments . there is always a few letters to be entered into a list of environments . on the other hand , the environments are used as often that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode is used for prevention . &quot;
&quot; when calling the ful@@ fil@@ ment mode , the Men@@ Ã ¼ r@@ Ã ¤ n@@ ter surroundings or the key@@ boards of the surrounding area is automatically adjusted and it will appear \ \ begin { . after that , the environment can be continued in the sim@@ pl@@ est way and ended by pressing the entry key . &quot;
&quot; after this is accomplished , the environment is automatically closed again . once &amp; k@@ ile , recogni@@ zes that it is a lists . &quot;
under settings k@@ ile ; set ... k@@ ile ; re@@ plac@@ ements can be made to these lists . this mode uses the value @-@ list of the ful@@ fil@@ ing mode &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands .

&quot; this is not only a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described , but rather a complete piece of users are described here ) but rather it is ideal for the search for a certain form@@ att@@ ing . since it is a very large part of the document , it is divided into &amp; k@@ ile , divided into three important book@@ marks . &quot;
&quot; because of the amount of documents with those &amp; tet@@ ex ; / texts live ; the finding of the right document offers not always easy . as possible , the small use of tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , which contains a database with all to &amp; k@@ ile ; supplied documents and such as a graphical element . &quot;
all documents are divided into categories and the biggest advantage is the search for par@@ cel names or stroke . by &amp; k@@ ile ; then only the results are displayed .

version 3.2 of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in its integration in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; all these tools use com@@ mander as surface and lib@@ x@@ ml@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as under@@ lining . the combination comes fast , efficient , complete and productive tools . &quot;
&quot; everyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation has worked , knows the pro@@ c and how over@@ looks it is . lift it a piece , give it a graphical interface ! not more to a terminal ; simply click on a terminal ; simply complete the icon for the XML @-@ processor and ready ! &quot;
&quot; this application is called a index@@ .@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if index@@ .@@ doc@@ book is set to the folder , then remove the current folder folder . if not , then remove the selection of current job folders and add them in the fields of other folder to the desired folder . &quot;
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files are deleted each time if said pro@@ c .
&quot; as already said everyone who has worked on the &amp; k@@ ite ; documentation already worked , knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , there is now a great graphic interface for it . &quot;
&quot; if the newly opened file index@@ .@@ doc@@ book is , then they simply select the current folder folder . if not , then select current job folders and enter the folder where index@@ .@@ doc@@ book can be found . &quot;
&quot; when it comes to an output on the screen , its file is faul@@ ty . please check the errors and try again . &quot;
&quot; if the check @-@ in file is already marked in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; then they let the current file is easy to act . if not , delete it at the current file the bun@@ als and select the to check @-@ in file via other file - file selection . &quot;
&quot; if you only want to know if the file is well @-@ form , they click the Well @-@ form review selection . &quot;
&quot; to the use of a &amp; D@@ TD ; that is specified in the &amp; XML ; file , they select &amp; D@@ TD ; ( Ex@@ ternal ) , otherwise , D@@ TD ; ( Ex@@ ternal ) and enter the place of &amp; D@@ TD ; as well as for the Relax@@ NG Test is the specification of the Defin@@ itions UR@@ I ; in the file selection . &quot;

&quot; if the file should be selected in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; already marked , then let the current file select simply . if not , remove the selection of the current file and select the file using the other file file . &quot;
&quot; enter the name of the file , as the result shall be named , the file is usually stored in their home folder . &quot;
&quot; the plug @-@ ins , which &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus : la@@ det , have little to do with &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus . it may benefit from the additional functionality and must not wait until someone can use the desired in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; they can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements . read more about it below . &quot;
&quot; to install a plugin or a part , we start using the menu plug @-@ ins . thus , this dialogue will be opened : &quot;
this dialog enables to manage all the plugins and add new . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search trail . during the addition of plug @-@ ins without a storage location &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path to the su@@ ck of the plug @-@ ins .
often working on a project has been working for several people in a type of hierarch@@ ical relationship . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the information of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project properties .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nickname is the nickname of the user and serves to clear identification .
a member may have several roles in the project as well as the sub@@ project leader as well as sub@@ project leader .
&quot; the user can search for yourself from the list of team@@ members who he is . this happens by pressing the team member from the list and the button st@@ ills as supp@@ resses . the currently selected member ( their identification ) will appear after you are : text . &quot;
nickname and setting of their own identity are important as regards messages and comments . see further information on notes .
&quot; besides the overview of their team there is another advantage by the collection of the members of the team : it can be created an event to the information about the team leader , if something happens . see in for further information . &quot;
&quot; event actions are actions that are executed when something certain in the project happens . an example would be correct@@ ed by the opening of the project , or the sending of a message , when a file is secured , or a script that will be added to the CVS as soon as it is added to the project , etc . &quot;
&quot; on the site &apos;s configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project reposit@@ ories , events can be created , edited and deleted . &quot;
an email will be sent to the recipient list of selected address . the Ad@@ res@@ sat can be a team or sub@@ project leader .
remarks are special comments in documents . you differ from normal comments using the following things :
&quot; to insert notes is simple . it can be selected either from the note entry from the editor @-@ context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation key word in a comment section , followed by inv@@ ocation text . &quot;
&quot; notes can be a determining member of the team . in this case the syntax is sent to a team member ( nickname ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , the nickname member of the team member states should be introduced in the project : team leader in the sub@@ project or sub@@ project names , as described in the following examples below . &quot;
nickname and roles names are independent of big or small @-@ tender but whit@@ esp@@ ace to par@@ enth@@ eses and of : make the note inv@@ alid .
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scripts and form@@ att@@ ing languages the D@@ TD @-@ ag@@ nost@@ ically and script@@ ing languages supported .
the settings can be reached via the Settings menu . here only about &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in . &quot;
the settings can be called via settings Qu@@ anta . diesel dialogue extends over a few pages that will be dealt with each other .
the behavior of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; concerning tags including car coverage can thus be changed . the entries are :
&quot; large / small @-@ tender of tags : large / lo@@ wer@@ ed tags : normal Large / lo@@ wer@@ ed means , the tags are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot;
large / lo@@ wer@@ ed attributes of attributes : large / lo@@ wer@@ ed attributes of automatically included attributes . normal Groß / lo@@ wer@@ ed means that attributes become as inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
&quot; optional tags automatically include : when attached , it is optional for tags , for which the closing day is optional , this immediately after that &amp; gt ; added . &quot;
un@@ optional tags automatically include : as above for all other tags with the exception of the simple tags .
&quot; start @-@ up and start @-@ up day automatically update : when enabled , the corresponding day will be changed and vice @-@ versa . &quot;
automatic res@@ et of acc@@ ent signs : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ entu@@ ated characters into the appropriate co@@ ding during the income .
M@@ IME @-@ Typ@@ es : Mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es to identify different types of files . using the button standard the default policy can be restored .
default enco@@ ding : the co@@ ding of newly created files or in other ways as with file opening files ( where the co@@ ding of the file can be over@@ taken ) . this attitude here is covered by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
&quot; standard D@@ TD : the selected D@@ TD is used for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ TD is not recognized . however , this setting is provided by the same in the project characteristics , if a project is loaded . &quot;
&quot; create a backup copy : &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; created regularly sick@@ ness , so that with a black@@ out or crash upon the next start of the program . this is not the same as the storage of the file . even for not saved documents will be a backup regularly , according to the time provided . &quot;
&quot; the preview and documentation can be shown either in the editing area or its own view ( or the documentation in a cart@@ ei@@ re@@ iter ) , which makes it possible to look at the preview the preview and the Source text at the same time . &quot;
Set the window settings back next to the next start is useful when the user interface by changing the M@@ DI @-@ Mo@@ di and and@@ o@@ cken @-@ depend on each other . it is equivalent to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command parameter .
the War@@ nings area serves the taxes for the possibility to switch the display of warnings using h@@ ooks by no more bel@@ ong@@ ated .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it may change the ad of symbols instead of scripts as well as the dub@@ bing behaviour of the V@@ PL@@ R and the source @-@ text view in the shared mode .
&quot; here , the par@@ ser and the structure @-@ tree , which represents the illustration of the par@@ ser @-@ knot@@ s in the document , can be set in details . &quot;
in the field of mouse @-@ click on the structure @-@ tree it causes the following action it is possible to change the dis@@ solved action by clicking the structural reforms .
&quot; in the range of structural adjustments , the visibility of no@@ des in the tree can be opened automatically . empty knot@@ s are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are not found in which the current document was not found . &quot;
&quot; the section for the forti@@ fication of abbre@@ vi@@ ations ( a kind of templates ) which can be un@@ folded in groups , each one can be divided into several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s means that it can be a valid group for PHP , in which the if@@ cl@@ ause sh@@ orth@@ and something else means in a group valid for Jav@@ ascript . &quot;
&quot; plug @-@ ins are managed to manage the plugins . plug @-@ ins are K@@ Part @-@ Applications from third page , which can be used by any K@@ Part @-@ capable application , at the best known &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; . while inser@@ ting a plugin must be specified following : &quot;
ad@@ ress : the path to the plug @-@ in if it is not located at a standard place like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib .
&quot; input : this information is transferred to the plugin at the start , so it can open the current file to the file folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder . &quot;
component in the &quot; Only @-@ L@@ ese &quot; mode : check if the plugin denied the store . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts usually refuse to load the store when this option is not selected .
&quot; check the plugin : this is enabled , then test@@ et &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; if the given information is correct . select the store of the entry also if the plugin is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , the error was completely new developed . Di@@ e@@ Support for the not more necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) deb@@ ug@@ ger was set up , as well as support for the db@@ g deb@@ ug@@ ger . instead , a deb@@ ug@@ ger @-@ plugin concept was implemented , the various implementation requirements regarding plug @-@ ins . &quot;
&quot; currently , only a plugin available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; in@@ quant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
the use of the deb@@ ug@@ gers for a project begins with the selection of a suitable deb@@ ug@@ ger plug @-@ ins in the project settings . with the button options in addition to the deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin exec@@ utable .
&quot; if a deb@@ ug@@ ger is activated for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; interface : &quot;
a view in which the content of above variables is displayed . appears normally in the left Dock .
&quot; a view , in which all belts , with numbers and conditions are listed . usually appear in the bottom dock . &quot;
a view in which the output ( like in HTML ) of the deb@@ ug@@ ger is shown . usually appear in the lower Dock .
&quot; depending on the supported features of the deb@@ ug@@ ger , everything or part of the following functionality is available . &quot;
&quot; this action will be the connection to the deb@@ ug@@ ger , if required , or it shares the plug @-@ in . this action is being triggered by default if a project is opened , that a deb@@ ug@@ ger is used , so that the normal @-@ case must not be respected . &quot;
the counter@@ part to deb@@ ug@@ ging session starts the session . includes the connection to the deb@@ ug@@ ger or ends the l@@ ute to requirements .
sends a HTTP request to the server for a de@@ bug request . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to watch the current document . the output of this requirement is displayed in the view deb@@ ug@@ ger output .
&quot; displays the deb@@ ug@@ ger to begin with the execution of the script and to send information about the monitoring variables as well as the currently selected line . if this happens when the script is stopped , the execution goes before it starts the script with the request . &quot;
&quot; identi@@ fies the deb@@ ug@@ ger to begin with the execution of the script , without information about monitoring variables and the current line number . if this happens when a script is attached , the execution goes on , starts as soon as a requirement is provided . &quot;
the deb@@ ug@@ ger introduces the next instruction in the script without entering the functions or includes .
&quot; deb@@ ug@@ ger introduces the next instruction in the script , whereby if possible in functions and includes error @-@ adjusted . &quot;
&quot; points the deb@@ ug@@ ger to overcome the directive and to go to the next one , as if there were the current doesn &apos;t . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog , where a variable or an expression can be entered , which is to be monitored . the super@@ vised value appears in the variable view . &quot;
&quot; with this dialog , a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable . &quot;

&quot; documentation type E@@ diti@@ er@@ packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; used to make support for Mark@@ up@@ - and script@@ ing , as well as &amp; CSS ; to make your simplicity and flexibility ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web@@ developer , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s there are in two types , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script language , and the tool@@ bars . day @-@ file contain two data types , the &amp; col@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and Tag@@ XML files are included in a document ( above the E@@ diti@@ er @-@ window ) , the text and instructions faster in a document than a user could ever be . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing D@@ TD . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how to create Tag@@ XML files , then the &amp; S@@ ahr@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; &quot;
&quot; Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define the specific attribute for tags as well as the layout and content of the Features@@ Rec@@ order , which shows &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the day shows the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; itself . tool@@ bars provides a fast paste of tags in a document without risk of a typ@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; tag folder are nothing as a folder . they include only the &amp; S@@ ahr@@ r@@ c ; and the equin@@ ox files . day file carry the name of the descrip@@ tive language and version , so available . ( for example , html @-@ 4@@ .01 @-@ strict ) &quot;
&quot; the table below lists the elements of the equin@@ ox and clarify whether they are necessary or not . although not all necessary , it is advis@@ able to use as many as possible , so that other users have a better insight and more information at work with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes each element in detail . all about the possibilities and borders is placed in a simple way .
&quot; this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML @-@ document . it can only be used in a document . it may contain the definition of many tags , but includes as only element type over itself otherwise . &quot;
the type of tags is a script function . when using it becomes &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only for the diary class class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only for the Type method valid . returns the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
&quot; if yes , the day has a common attributes group and the attributes within this tags can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 ) &quot;
sets out a text in dialogue . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; Day . this is an only element type element .
&quot; describes a attribute of a tags . this element can only happen once for any attribute . it lays the name and type of the attribute . additionally , it contains more tags that should describe how this attribute is to be displayed , etc . this is an only element @-@ type element . &quot;
&quot; returns the source text used for the attributes in the day @-@ Ed@@ itor@@ dialog , and in the attribute @-@ tree &quot;
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to reach the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p metho@@ d@@ name is used within &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to reach the source .
&quot; requires source = d@@ co@@ p , an incis@@ ional and a metho@@ d@@ name . the arguments sent to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tags . &quot;
a container tag which group@@ ed the elements of a list together . it can only occur for a attribute description only once . it is an only element element .
speci@@ fies the position of the Attri@@ but@@ tex@@ tes of a tags within a dialogue . this day can only occur for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; Day ) . the item is empty .
returns the position and size of a field in dialog . this day should be present for each field in dialog ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Day ) . this element is empty .
returns a list of elements that may occur within the defined tags . this element is an only element type .
gives a list of elements that ending a day . this element is an only element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with an &amp; XML ; -@@ declar@@ ations : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 enco@@ ding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be neat and closed .
&quot; spaces do not affect nothing but pay attention to &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; replaced . this will not be caused , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
&quot; to check the Tag@@ XML files , the tools dialog above is to start in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; windows to start and check the Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . a further dialog will appear to follow its simple instructions . &quot;
&quot; currently , this feature is not yet available . currently , checking only occurs in the store of the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
in the following an example of a family 1 diary file . this file describes this &amp; lt ; sch@@ ema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; -@@ sch@@ ema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this diary file is meant to be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
&quot; in the following , an example of a working family 2 Tag@@ XML @-@ file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; overview function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this diary file is to be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag . &quot;
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; enco@@ ding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; Day name = &quot; version &quot; re@@ turn@@ Type = &quot; function &quot; &gt; &amp; lt ; att@@ r name = &quot; string &quot; &gt; &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt;
&quot; the &amp; Se@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as pretty simple and there is an editor for this , accessible via D@@ TD Bear@@ be@@ ite D@@ TD settings ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; with the following entries : &quot;
&#91; General &#93; Version = Ver@@ wende 1 for &amp; quantitative ; Version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = D@@ TD . ( - / / W@@ 3@@ C ; / / D@@ TD HTML 4@@ .01 trans@@ itional / / EN ) nickname = The simpli@@ fied name of D@@ TD . ( HTML 4@@ .01 trans@@ itional ) . if not specified , the name is used as a nickname . &quot;
an action can set by setting actions ... created on New action leads to the same dialog :
this action refers to certain keyboard short@@ cuts . with clicking the button user can be assigned a keyboard short@@ ened ; with K@@ einer is the current keyboard short@@ cuts .
the sim@@ pl@@ est actions . it can be entered into the Det@@ ai@@ able settings and in execution of the action this text will be inserted in the document on the current C@@ ursor position . see the example below .
&quot; this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this promotion , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) to change the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) . examples from &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; themselves are the Schnell@@ start @-@ dialog or the different See in ... campaigns for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps . &quot;
first the name of the script and interpre@@ ter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scri@@ pt@@ .@@ sh .
&quot; although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % script@@ ing variable in the command line : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / quant@@ a / Scrip@@ ts in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in the command line : &quot;
% f : we replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file file : / from the document names .
&quot; % pi@@ d : will be replaced with the P@@ ID of current &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance is running , the text is unique to the P@@ ID number . this is useful if D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the external script . &quot;
&quot; the parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or the path to the project file . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the above mentioned methods there can be a script input from &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; at the default entry , you can submit to the default settings . possibilities are : &quot;
selected text : the selected range of the document is sent to the script . the % input is usually only useful with this setting .
&quot; according to the input , the issue of the completed application can also be re@@ directed . there are two kinds of output : normal issue , on the default issue . it can be stated that which should be done with the default issue written by clicking on the default output issue : &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups . it is necessary for each group to create their own tool@@ bar . in the case it is not too many , therefore you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the set ups . &quot;
&quot; once a tool@@ bar is added , you must add actions and configure . select settings actions . &quot;
the parts of this window are rather self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New action button at the bottom of the window starts the edit mode .
complete all the fields and add them to the appropriate tool@@ bar .
&quot; complete all and , if the day attribute has and you plan your use , activate the dialog &quot; Day , &quot; if available , so that a entry when using the action is possible . &quot;
Ig@@ itt ! is that a ugly symbol . who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol we will replace it before we have difficulties .
&quot; to create a symbol that the action represents better , we will use &amp; k@@ icon@@ edit ; use . select from the &amp; k@@ menu ; , graphics Additi@@ onal programs ( or where otherwise it is located in their distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; using default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select editing size others . &quot;
&quot; please note that the created symbol not only helps you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to that the day start , I decided to create a start kno@@ b as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually interpreted as loose , star@@ ved , further interpreted ) , or should at least be a message to the user to sign@@ aled ; start this symbol ; start in the current document . &quot;
&quot; after creating a symbol , it has to be connected to the action . this happens via the menu with setting actions ... ( in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selecting the desired action . in addition to the text box is a button , press it . &quot;
&quot; select the folder , in which the saved symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; push the button and continue it with other tags , so there are still which there is , or confirm with OK to finish . &quot;
suppose you want some common &amp; quantitative ; -@@ functions to the tool@@ bar or it should be added to the better overview of some separ@@ ators in several groups . open the tool@@ bar set dialog by settings tool@@ bars . make sure that the desired tool@@ bar is selected .
&quot; I would like to choose the tray ( very left above ) for my tool@@ bar . after selecting the element , which should be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the item to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; for example , I would like to add a quick way to access the Con@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; please note , as the separ@@ ator do not know the group@@ ing . someone who does not know my tool@@ bar , could believe that the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button the opposite of the start @-@ button . &quot;
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by block@@ ing all symbols to ensure that everything works .
&quot; if you do not exist in the right folder . after new XML does not exist , it will be stored im@@ root folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be loaded in the right folder . &quot;
perhaps the most notable expansion of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user is the opportunity to add documentation for the script@@ ing language or the form@@ att@@ acking language that you like most . this is why I describe a &amp; PHP ; -@@ documentation tree for my personal use .
&quot; before you start your own documentation , you might check in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory review whether someone has done this for you . &quot;
there are two parts in this process . first you have to search a exist@@ ential documentation for the form@@ att@@ ing / script / etc ; -@@ language . then you have to leave the do@@ cr@@ c file . the first part we leave you to the second we treat .
&quot; # KDE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = pf@@ ad , relative to this file , to the docum@@ entations Section 1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ 2.@@ html , tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 3@@ .html &quot;
the section tree defined the visible part of the documentation in the documentary tree . for example you can see in the &amp; PHP ; documentation such a thing :
# KDE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level elements Top Element = PHP 4.2 on PHP 4.2 on PHP 4.2 on PHP 4.2 on PHP 4.2 on PHP 4.2 . ... Intro@@ duction = intro@@ duc@@ tion@@ .html ...
note the # before G@@ etting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this shows that it is sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known border for chess magazines ( except for reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the table directory is directly refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequ@@ ential on the top of the construction supervision &amp; m@@ d@@ ash folder ! ) .
spaces affect nothing but pay attention to &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; Resources .
&quot; the content section is to be displayed in the field of do@@ cr@@ c file , which should be displayed by using a &amp; PHP ; -@@ script will display the documentation for the my@@ sql _ fetch _ array . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file @-@ supply lines . &quot;
&quot; a simple list of by a separated context @-@ elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) . &quot;
now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c and save on $ HO@@ ME / share / apps / quant@@ a / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / quant@@ a / doc for local and global use . then create a folder in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation .
&quot; if you are sure that this good and it is worth to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. what documentation have been used to the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for the use by the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Community . you will not be rich , but proud to have worked with the best web@@ developer platform . &quot;
&quot; with quant@@ ap@@ lus you are not alone . it is possible to share the prescription resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or otherwise to whom . at different places there is an email address , such as D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates , and in the scripts . &quot;
&quot; the resources can be up@@ loaded into our main archive , from where all the other &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus you can download it . the posts will be checked and only available for publication , where our team needs them as correct and user @-@ full for publication . thus the origin of the resources guarantees them , both for our team and for later users . &quot;
&quot; when up@@ loading you will not be saved for their private G@@ PG keys ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase will not be saved ) , or in the event you will have multiple keys you will have to stay in . in the dialog New resource you need to stay empty ) and click OK . &quot;
&quot; the high @-@ load can be loaded from the menus D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , tool@@ bar tool@@ bars , and in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , still before installation , exam@@ ining &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; the un@@ disp@@ arity of the resource by checking the integrity and the signature . if the integrity is given and it can be can@@ cel@@ ed . please note the warnings and the resource is displayed correctly , a message with the indication of the Creator of the resource . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work on XML @-@ languages which is currently not supported by &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; but creating a D@@ TE@@ P package , but creating a D@@ TD files in the day XML format . there is the easiest way to convert a D@@ TD into a D@@ TE@@ P package . &quot;
&quot; the conversion can be started by the D@@ TD load and Conver@@ ting a D@@ TD . select the .@@ dt@@ d file with the D@@ TD description , which should be used . afterwards , the following dialogue will appear : &quot;
target @-@ directory : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; will be written using this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / quant@@ a / d@@ te@@ p folder .
&quot; DO@@ C@@ TY@@ PE definition : the string , which should be released in the ! DO@@ C@@ TY@@ PE Day , such as HTML P@@ UB@@ LI@@ C , / / W@@ 3@@ C / / D@@ TD HTML 4@@ .01 trans@@ itional / / EN http : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / ht@@ ml@@ 4 / lo@@ os@@ e.@@ dt@@ d &quot;
&quot; fine @-@ setting of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : when activated , brings &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; after the transformation the &amp; col@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to uti@@ lize this possibility . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . in order to understand this and trust the benefits from &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus . this chapter is trying to teach them precisely these concepts , without their understanding &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; little benefit . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; the work@@ space is divided into three areas : global , locally and proj@@ ected . this distinction affects a number of components in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; &quot;
&quot; global elements are available for each , who is &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; saved . it is possible to secure the group of administ@@ rators from &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; this enables the group of administ@@ rators to secure , promotions and patterns in the global tree , which are then available to each in a multi @-@ user environment . &quot;
local elements represent a personal collection of web developers for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user interface so they can only use this user personally .
&quot; project @-@ related elements are only available within a particular project . this can be done all by &amp; CSS ; -@@ designs up to tool@@ bars , especially for the files of a particular project . simply said this is the most restricted size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which del@@ ayed the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the Ed@@ itor@@ window , the building views , the cart@@ ons with information and the tool@@ bars . please suggest in , and for further information on these fields . &quot;
&quot; you can click on the map with the right mouse button to receive a context menu with the current documents , such as include the current , other or all Kart@@ ei@@ re@@ iter , re @-@ load , delete or up@@ loading of the document , jump to a book@@ marks or execution of CVS instruction to the current document . &quot;
&quot; right click regarding a further context menu regarding the specified document contents , such as basic processing steps ( outputs / paste / paste ) , edit the file under the mouse c@@ ursor , or opening the file , if the string is under the mouse button under the mouse c@@ ursor . &quot;
&quot; at the upper end of the Ed@@ itor@@ fen@@ sters are the tool@@ bars of the Ed@@ itors . currently , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4@@ .01 trans@@ itional as default , for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of further development of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; the tool@@ bars will be adapted to the new functions and associated user needs . &quot;
&quot; the use of tool@@ bars is really light . if they want to insert a single day , such as &amp; lt ; p@@ onder@@ s ; in their document you want to insert , then you can insert the data for this just added day . if you want to insert the data for this just day . if you want to insert the data for this just day . if you want to insert several attributes , you can fill in a dialog different fields . &quot;
&quot; the assem@@ bl@@ views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow it to navig@@ ate in the information about &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; navig@@ ate to navig@@ ate , opening up and through stri@@ ps . in the presentation with cardboard boxes are available for files , project , patterns , attributes , attributes , and documentation . &quot;
&quot; project management is a powerful tool that puts &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; provides . this view displays all the files in the project and allows the manag@@ erial of the files in the project with right mouse @-@ click . promotions such as addition , removal , up@@ loading or delet@@ ing the files from the storage medium can be performed using the text menu . &quot;
&quot; an additional possibility of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : images , program parts , a whole web page &amp; etc ; There are all options open . &quot;
&quot; templates can be divided into three categories , depending on which connection they are used . the category depends on the terms and conditions . global templates are always available , local templates only for the respective users and templates in projects are only available in the project . &quot;
&quot; here you will find information about the available script@@ ing languages . the concept of the break@@ down in Global , Local and Project also works here . by clicking on the right mouse button , you can access the available information about a script like e.g. the script , to edit or send with email . &quot;
&quot; in this view , one shows the internal structure of the active document . through links to a element , the c@@ ursor is set in the document on the position of the element . through the right click of an element , a list of commands will be shown in terms of navigation and refresh@@ er of the tree . &quot;
&quot; this tree appears among the other construction views . with it you can change man@@ at@@ attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces . this on the contents of the relevant system allows the change of all available attributes , with few clicks . &quot;
&quot; here is the complete documentation for web technology for your development to find . there can be pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; quantitative ; &apos; document site can be downloaded , and by adding a folder back to a project can be edited , edited and edited . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; two cart@@ ei@@ vers at the bottom of the window , can be reached at the bottom of the window : the news window and the problem . &quot;
&quot; this kart@@ ing re@@ iter provides information on each in Qu@@ anta current script , such as the D@@ TD used in the current document and all changes to D@@ TD . &quot;
&quot; this kart@@ ing re@@ iter shows all errors in the market @-@ up of the current document . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ scripts that are executed , all bug@@ fixes ( so it can be ) in this window . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; quantitative ; tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command . the chocol@@ ates of the tool@@ bar is the possibility to define their own commands as symbols in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; a further function of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with E@@ Mail . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , sends the tool@@ bar as funny T@@ ar @-@ archive about &amp; k@@ mail ; if they can secure this in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; as any other secure and load ! &quot;
&quot; it is reasonable , if you want to adjust the place of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; files on your system want to custom@@ ize auto@@ conf file . to get a complete list of options that are to configure the configure script . the options are easy to understand and here is not executed . &quot;
&quot; if you have problems when starting from &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 I folder . also , you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in the P@@ AT@@ H before her I folder is the same is true for &amp; Q@@ t ; &quot;
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the KDE surface . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; was optimized for a quick web development and combines a proven development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
&quot; during the effort to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor to create the developers of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus : what if &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus : what if &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; a stand@@ alone , exten@@ sible Mark@@ up @-@ language editor would be ? well , this would make him an absolutely greatest web @-@ development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; it is no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; now on the way to a general and comprehensive Web @-@ development tool . &quot;
&quot; now , to the above claim must be recorded that &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the whole &amp; k@@ de ; development cooperation is based , in good application of free software , the idea of Why developers , but it allows users and developers , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; to extend as they need it for their need . &quot;
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; allows web@@ developers to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can extend the productivity dramatically . by the programme of Com@@ mander they can count &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus . ( more about it can be found in . )
&amp; quant@@ a ; Plus ; is a web development environment designed for HTML and related languages . it was designed for a fast web development and quickly converted to a mature editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; quant@@ a ; Plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of &amp; quant@@ a ; connected to the original developers left the GPL @-@ licensed version and produced a commercial program .
&quot; more in the detailed documentation is available with help : / quant@@ a ( either this URL into &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or k@@ help@@ center help : / quant@@ a ) . &quot;
&amp; quant@@ a ; is currently developed and maintained by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon sequ@@ el @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; a quick @-@ access list of files that you have opened . this list is changing every@@ time when you open a file , which is not on it , being the oldest entry . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to store code parts and whole files as templates for later use . check in the section about templates . should they try to store the selected file / text outside the local / project pre @-@ storage box , only a error message is reported . &quot;
&quot; when inser@@ ting the cli@@ p@@ board there are special characters to the &amp; HTML ; description , so they are displayed correctly and not be understood by the browser as a form@@ att@@ age reference . &quot;
converting the text from the cli@@ p@@ board into &amp; URL ; description which is the correct way to Insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s is primarily used for inser@@ ting &amp; URL ; s into the anchor day .
&quot; remove the block selection , respectively . this allows you to select text @-@ bu@@ cks with the help of &amp; Shift ; taste . &quot;
&quot; go directly to a line number . this is very helpful , if your &amp; PHP ; -@@ script error messages are out ! &quot;
searches a string or regular expression in selected directory . a kind of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the news window or not on . this is the window in which you see the display of scripts and deb@@ ug@@ ger .
dis@@ able and switching of the problem rep@@ or@@ ters at the bottom of the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window . the problem rep@@ orter is activated once you change to the structure @-@ tree .
displays the symbols of the main window on the main window . this column allows you to put bookmark with a mouse click .
&quot; if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu together with the entries forecast or next , depending on the position of the c@@ urs@@ ors in the document . &quot;
Book@@ marks from other documents appear in the menu under the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents .
opens a exist@@ ential project from the hard drive . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects will be saved with the file . web@@ pr@@ j .
presenting a dialog to paste files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
&quot; search the project directory according to new files that could be there . this allows you to copy graphics files to your project folders or sub@@ folder , and then add them to the project . &quot;
invites the files in your project to the server high . the list of available transportation methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and whether you have downloaded additional inputs / output module ( K@@ IO Sl@@ aves ) .
&quot; settings , such as &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project managed . in the chapter &amp; quantitative ; -@@ projects you can find the details . &quot;
loads up a project @-@ tool@@ bar . these are stored in project / tool@@ bars and are only in this menu if you have assigned it to this project .
a dialog to save your tool@@ bars . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or project .
&quot; opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this creates only the name . actions must be stored by means of setting actions ... or you will be asked if you want to save the tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; remo@@ ves a tool@@ bar out of the range . it does not delete it from the disk . if you have not saved the tool@@ bar , you will be asked if you want to do this . &quot;
&quot; so you can send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( maybe to the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; team , so that the tool@@ bar is available in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new e @-@ mail message with the tool@@ bar as an attachment . &quot;
allows the up@@ loading of tool@@ bars on the main server where everyone can access it . see in .

&quot; load / real@@ ities of the de@@ ities of the &amp; D@@ TD ; it is useful if the relief from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be refresh@@ ed , without the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this globally is and a write permission in the global KDE folders is not present , fails to shop the store . &quot;
&quot; this menu contains a list of tags , which is present in the currently loaded tool@@ bars . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there is in the tags menu a sub@@ menu standard , which contains the list of tags / promotions on this tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; allows access to the current day settings dialog , if there is one . this entry is always present in the menu Tags , followed by &amp; D@@ TD ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus . &quot;
&quot; it is enabled or de@@ activ@@ ating the intelligent paste of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ Ds . intelligent Insert means that &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; this means by means of tool@@ bar when this day is contrary to the rules . &quot;
in the plug @-@ in menu the available plug @-@ ins are listed under the above @-@ mentioned menus . click on the click . click of an active plug @-@ in .
select the syn@@ tax@@ onom@@ a mode for the current file . the list of available her@@ prints @-@ schem@@ ata depends on der@@ k@@ ate ; -@@ version .
&quot; select the type of tick @-@ powered characteristics . very useful if you know people to use other OS platforms for the wrap . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh . &quot;

&quot; immediate conversion of the different types of user interface . through some limitations in the KDE libraries , the switching of sometimes need time need or un@@ nice graphics , which is also the default mode , which is also the default mode , which is the representation in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this menu provides an entry for each open sub@@ window . with a selection of entries , the appropriate sub@@ window will be activated . &quot;
fold the display of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window on or off .
&quot; the changes in this dialog are influenced every application , which use the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Web@@ browser . &quot;
the behavior of the Ed@@ itor@@ fen@@ sters depends on the documentation of &amp; Kate ; you will find details .
a dialog appears in which you can delete entries from the tool@@ bars or which can change and modify the sequences .
&quot; this should generate a help according to the field of mouse c@@ ursor , but is not yet implemented . &quot;
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project the developers can always use the help . if they want to support &amp; quantitative ; -@@ development in financial form , they find here the way . &quot;
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be filled up by the top of the project , as after filling out the project , the whole files@@ ystem is automatically completed for the rest of the project . all these paths and author @-@ information fields can be completed later with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project properties . &quot;
&quot; here is the name for the project to enter , for example foo . when entering the name file is automatically filled . &quot;
this is the name of the &amp; quantitative ; -@@ project file . by default it has the name of the project in inf@@ ancy and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
&quot; here you can access the server address of the machine , to which you want to access , one , except you edited local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exam@@ ple@@ .de ) or an IP @-@ address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible . &quot;
&quot; if one can be empty , this field is empty , the default settings of the selected protocol may be used . depending on the setting of the remote host could be an adaptation necessary . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder in which the templates for the project are stored . it is a relative path to the project and by default , if a common collection of files are used for various projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder in which the tool@@ bars will be saved for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files are used for various projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
this allows files to insert files from the local files@@ ystem into the project . you can select multiple files or whole folder .
&quot; this setting is great if you have stat@@ ely Web@@ in@@ halt to download and change it . in ser@@ ver@@ sive script ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently . &quot;
&quot; to be raised when files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project , are to be integrated . if a project is opened up , not an@@ ger . &quot;
this option will display all files and folders within the main folder and you can make a precise selection according to services .
&quot; this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by checking , or from removing the hem@@ at@@ ry , cl@@ ing out of the project . &quot;
&quot; the last screen of the new project assist@@ ants contains three settings , which can simplify your work . these settings can be loaded in the menu with project project properties in the sub @-@ window profiles or with the short@@ cuts shift ; F@@ 7 . &quot;
some settings correspond to those in the project assist@@ ants and are described in described . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ame ( wild@@ card possible ) which can be ignored by project @-@ related operations like project folders .
&quot; added option to above , also files that are listed in .c@@ v@@ signals are excluded from the project . &quot;
the project view that is loaded in opening the project . in more information about project views can be read .
&quot; with this , the desired deb@@ ug@@ ger can be selected . currently only Gub@@ ed is supported . more information about Gub@@ ed can be found in . the deb@@ ug@@ ger @-@ Plugin can be set with the button options . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window profiles upload high @-@ profile profiles ( see in ) , as well as the display of a construction view for the content of the server for any profile , by showing its own construction @-@ view for every profile . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mail@@ ing list . see the details . &quot;
&quot; in the sub @-@ window event configuration you can switch event actions and add this actions to change or delete . event actions will be executed , such as the sig@@ hting of a file . see the details . &quot;
&quot; standard opens &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus : the last project , which was opened . this behavior can currently not be influenced . &quot;
to open another project to open a project ... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project will open and allows selecting a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
&quot; if &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; closed , the project file is automatically saved . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , if &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files . same happens when you download a new project . &quot;
the project supervision gives free access to the files in the project . there the files in the current project can be managed .
&quot; folder are just as well , however the entries are missing and opening ... in with the right button of the mouse button &quot;
here you can download different profiles . the profile contains information about the place of the high @-@ per@@ mis@@ ed files .
&quot; allows the removal of the current profile . if only one profile exists , the button will fail to prevent the removal . &quot;
the password is kept in the core @-@ memory and forget about the programming . this possibility is useful when frequent up@@ loading files are necessary and that rather un@@ secure password on the disk does not save the option .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your opinion prior to the up@@ loading .
&quot; in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , many high @-@ profile profiles have created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be up@@ loaded into a variety of server . editing or create a profile will be displayed : &quot;
&quot; this is the name of the server , to which the files are to be copied , either a fully qualified domain name or IP address . &quot;
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and installed K@@ IO Sl@@ aves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; to file ( local ) and n@@ fs .
&quot; the port for transfer . usually , this does not have to be modified except the network administrator runs a service at the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your anxiety thresh@@ old this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it according to your discretion . the password is stored on the record , so it can not be easily read but everyone can see with programming language it can easily be seen in the plain text . &quot;
&quot; a project view is only one set of files and tool@@ bars . it can be loaded into a project many views , i.e. by simple ex@@ changing of view , different files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replaced the currently open files and tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; views can be opened or saved in the menu Project or the Project tool@@ bar , accessible via settings work @-@ owned project tool@@ bars , open or deleted . &quot;
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; with which one has to do most . this helps not only increase productivity but also allows adaptation of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; to their own work .
as mentioned above are tool@@ bars in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; best designed by the menu tool@@ bars . use and adding is different . the addition of tool@@ bars will be treated below in the section of addition of tool@@ bars .
&quot; the tool@@ bars and the symbols can be adjusted either via the context menu ( right click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which with New action , there can be different actions such as tool@@ bars , should be specified in dialogue where actions can be visible on this or other tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context to an action ( icon ) on a tool@@ bar , in addition to the entries will remove and displayed action that are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
the tool@@ bars and the actions on them can set up in the menu with settings tool@@ bars ... and setting actions .. adjusted .
&quot; templates are essentially docum@@ ent@@ skel@@ eton , code @-@ Escal@@ opes and files to the link . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; uses templates , move or any of the system to link in the store@@ enb@@ aum . templates in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; in about the restrictions you imagine for the files@@ ystem . &quot;
some with &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; included pre @-@ templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions at the start of each template before use exactly through .
&quot; bin@@ aries is all that not pur@@ er text is . there may be any file except text , so pictures , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash @-@ files &amp; etc ; bin@@ aries / ur@@ l . some examples can be found in the store@@ houses below global templates . further information about the templates tree is available in documents . &quot;
documents can be compiled by any text docum@@ ent@@ . based on these templates can be compiled new documents . normally a simple rum@@ ors for the purpose and organised the work in appropriate manner to be efficiently . some examples can be found in the pre @-@ storage room under global templates .
&quot; this kind of templates is useful if not a new document based on a template , but the same text area will always be inserted into the documents on Jav@@ ascript or Perl base . some examples are available in front of a full menu on Jav@@ ascript or Perl base . see in for more information about templates . &quot;
&quot; as the name says , these templates are used for all sites as templates . they are a collection of different documents , which can be organized in a comm@@ anding tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; &quot;
&quot; design a documentation structure based on will ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc . ) and select file As a template as a local template .... &quot;
&quot; once that is done , notice that ( even if it was saved as a project situation ) the template is not visible in the project tree . check in the store@@ house under project templates . &quot;
select text in your document and click File The template as a template can be stored as a local / project location . alternatively , the selection can simply be drawn up with pulling and depos@@ ited for the construction @-@ view templates . &quot;
&quot; the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can be copied , only in a pre @-@ storage folder . it can be used for all file @-@ administration functions , such as pulling and dist@@ res@@ et or paste the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or . &quot;
&quot; you can select a folder in the file tree or in the project connector , select a name for the template and secure . by default in the project folder , but of course it can be stored as a local or global template . &quot;
&quot; project templates makes a very target @-@ oriented approach . you can create head@@ line and foot@@ er search , or dynamic with &amp; PHP ; in addition , you can add some things when using templates in projects very deep @-@ green@@ ish in mind . &quot;
the pre @-@ storage structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / quantitative and $ HO@@ ME / sec . each of this folder corresponds to one of four types of container as above .
&quot; in order to set the behavior of a folder , click on the folder with the right mouse button on the folder and select in the context menu properties below . the following dialogue will appear : &quot;
&quot; a drop @-@ down with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is dri@@ fted as soon as El@@ ter@@ al attributes . &quot;
&quot; this is enabled by default and adapted to everything except the stem cell in the front view . if a tri@@ bal folder would be de@@ activated , it would be explicitly enabled in the event of a normal folder . if nothing appears , one is probably in a tri@@ bal folder . &quot;
allows you to search or follow @-@ up text for templates in this folder . this could be general header lines or foot@@ ers for all templates in a folder with special header lines / foot@@ ers a whole presentation can already be connected with the desired header lines / foot@@ ers .
&quot; in addition , you are using context menu ( pointing right mouse button press ) via a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and insert from one place to another . &quot;
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor which can be reached via the menu View . the first mode is replacing the Ed@@ itor@@ text editor in two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : he invites a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; XHTML ; -@@ page and a c@@ ursor . then you can edit and switch on to the source code in which the carried out changes in V@@ PL ; -@@ editor in source code .
&quot; when working with the V@@ PL ; editor on a document that includes &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; editor editor . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL , editor . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; editor , continues to change the source text editor . there are no plans to change these behavior . &quot;
&quot; the second mode works just as the first one , except that at the same time the changes are visible in the source text editor and in V@@ PL ; editor editor and the c@@ ursor in the source text editor and in V@@ PL ; -@@ editor syn@@ ch@@ ron is already active , this mode is already active the active c@@ ursor of a window to another , with the position in the document is maintained . &quot;
the synchron@@ isation was set between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source @-@ text editor can be adjusted to settings of Qu@@ anta . in the selection automatically the time @-@ span can also be adjusted for a click or automatically . in principle the recommendation can also be adjusted for quick calcul@@ ator and a large fr@@ ills for slow .
&quot; suppose you want to change the title of the website , so the tools can be created in the work with the V@@ PL ; editor will also be called as soon as a new document with the V@@ PL ; editor will also be created . this can be used to reduce the suspension lat@@ ent codi@@ fication . so that you can change the following : &quot;
&quot; met@@ a @-@ tags admit the storage of information about the document itself . met@@ a @-@ elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons bottom or removed . one click on the list allows modification of the content , e.g. key words on the column names and keyword . &quot;
CSS rules are the new way to design the design of sites in the browser . you can add CSS @-@ rules with the buttons under the list or delete . a change on the list is just as possible with the met@@ a @-@ elements . the editing of CSS @-@ rules is currently not supported .
&quot; it is possible to include an external CSS @-@ style sheet , pressing on the file button and select the appropriate file . &quot;
&quot; the use of the C@@ urs@@ ors is like in a text processing , through moving with the arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the c@@ ursor is beh@@ ave like usual . text can be inserted as usual . text can be added by typ@@ ing and using back@@ drop or removed . &quot;
&quot; Insert tags is made in the same way over the tool@@ bars , as it is in the source text editor . it is to be noted that inser@@ ting tags mentioned before the existing identical tags are not removed , e.g. if a anchor tag , each other will have to be inserted with text , every other per@@ ker must be removed . &quot;
some materials such as the tables @-@ Assist@@ ent or the lists assistant are disabled . you will later work in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release you need to use the tables or lists of tool@@ bars .
&amp; x@@ sl@@ db@@ g ; is a tool for the examination of breastfeeding templates . in the difference to other programs for breast @-@ templates is the search for certain elements possible and the execution of breastfeeding can be pro@@ sec@@ uted .
&quot; to be able to comp@@ ile &amp; x@@ sl@@ db@@ g ; successful comp@@ ile , need besides &amp; k@@ de ; nor the libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ xml , which are available at a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ; already available . &quot;

x@@ sl@@ db@@ g you can select the complete path from a fil@@ en@@ ame without path@@ name . fil@@ en@@ ame in the same folder as the top @-@ loaded style sheet with relative path to the Work@@ folder con x@@ sl@@ db@@ g is loaded for example a style file name .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l is the following input :
this command will be checked on a partial or entire agreement with a pre @-@ age named QNA@@ ME or a given module name . &amp; eg ; licence is correct with each QNA@@ ME that includes the string .

&quot; template _ NA@@ ME : a valid name of a template , which consists only of the ASCII character 0x@@ 00 to 0x@@ 7@@ F . this name can be a fully qualified name like &quot; x@@ s@@ l : tem@@ plat@@ e@@ Name . &quot;
fil@@ en@@ ame : a valid local fil@@ en@@ ame on the system of user . on Uni@@ xes or Cy@@ g@@ win systems may have the name the pre@@ fix &quot; ~ &quot; as short @-@ form for personal folder . on RI@@ SC @-@ OS systems are also other ambient variable .
path : a path to the Trans@@ ition of the operating system . on some operating systems the pre@@ fix &quot; ~ &quot; is replaced by the path to your personal folder .

there are many graphic tools to compare . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain briefly why I have written .
the con@@ duction was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors has made many changes and has been correct@@ ed at many places the installation . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result was a lot of conflicts at the meeting .
&quot; the program used by me only showed me the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly has changed within these lines . and there were no indications of the places where the mer@@ ging of these changes was a small night@@ mare . &quot;
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could contain differences within a line and changes to white characters . later a lot of other useful functions have been added .
&quot; if you would like to compare the example fast text , just copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and add it to one of the comparison window . &quot;
&quot; a function made a lot of work , was the compar@@ isons and mer@@ ging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full file browser . &quot;
&quot; also 3 @-@ way together is fully supported . this is useful when two people work independently from each other on one piece of co @-@ operation and changes . the original file ( the base ) helps you dis@@ solve the result of the correct change . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly . the screenshot displays three Qu@@ ell files at the mer@@ ging : &quot;
&amp; K@@ diff@@ 3 ; helps you also with the compar@@ isons and assem@@ bling complete folder . this screenshot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folder merge :
&amp; K@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and design@@ ate the possibilities of active color mon@@ itors . if you frequently have to check Ko@@ de you will like this function .
differences in white characters and tab@@ ulators are visible visible . if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters you can see at a summary of the summary in the column on the left side . ( no trouble anymore if someone is changing . )
&quot; if a file is equal , and the other is different in one line , then the color indicate which file is different . red color means that both are different . &quot;
&quot; if all files are the same name , but in different folders , you can make yourself the ti@@ p@@ work by using only the fil@@ en@@ ame of the first file . example : &quot;
stat@@ ute 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 3
&quot; opening @-@ dialog enables manu@@ als of fil@@ en@@ ame to select a selection of the file browser ( File ... ) or selecting a recently opened file out of the folding @-@ out list . you do not need to specify the third file ; if you do not have the entry for C blank , the analysis of the differences are performed with two files . &quot;
&quot; via the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the compar@@ isons or mer@@ ging of folders will be selected for B and C , then a folder , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ame from A in the two other folders . &quot;
&quot; if cont@@ ex@@ ts is crossed , the input field is active for target and can be processed . however , it is not necessarily required to set up a output file . you can also do this step later when stor@@ ing . &quot;
the setup @-@ button opens a dialog with settings . here you can specify options before you start using the compar@@ isons / inter@@ connection .
&quot; sometimes one does not want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text file . &quot;
you can also use pulling and drag : drag a file from a file manager or select text from an editor and let him fall over a comparison window .
&quot; which thought is behind it ? sometimes , a file contains e.g. several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , they would only need two corresponding files to copy them into &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; and then you can copy the relevant sections just copy , paste and then compare . &quot;
&quot; note : currently , you can draw nothing from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the case can be obtained from text into a comparison window . &quot;
warning : some editors interpre@@ t the pulling and dist@@ orting of text into another program as cut and paste ( instead of cop@@ ying and paste ) . in such cases your original data could be lost .
&quot; in the upper part of each text window , the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window is optional . ) every window has a while on the line . then a small auxiliary window will display the full name . ) &quot;
the three back@@ pack star are the characters A , B and C . a has the colour blue , B the color of green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these pres@@ ets may change over the settings menu . ) &quot;
&quot; when a difference is recognized , one sees in the color that file is different . if both files are different , the default color is useful for red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files . this is good in the next section ( inter@@ connection ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left next to the text there is the corresponding menu . when differences are found , the column shows the corresponding color . in some programming , where white characters are not so important , it is useful to only see the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + ) , it is useful to relevant only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + ) , it is useful to relevant only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + ) , for the pre@@ processor and in few , rare items relevant . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line , which separates the co@@ her@@ ing column of text , is interrupted by places where the particular source file has no lines . if the shi@@ fting change is activated , the line is attached to bl@@ ackl@@ ed lines . &quot;
&quot; result window ( under the comparison windows ) also has a info line with the inscription output : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; change &#93; if you have dealt with the result . usually , it does not contain text , but often it also contains conflicts . &quot;
! ! ! to all conflicts dis@@ solved is the stor@@ ing de@@ activated ! ! ! ( use the buttons to the cheapest / un@@ solved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
&quot; if only two comparison windows are used , each difference is also to be resolved at the same time a conflict of manually . &quot;
by clicking on the left mouse button in one of the windows that marks the line belonging to the line in all windows and the first line of the group is not visible . ) This group will then be highlighted the current group . it will be highlighted with the color background colour for the current field and each on the left appears a black beam .
&quot; sometimes , by automatic assem@@ bling or by manual or no further line will be left in the group ; then there is only a wild@@ card for the event that you will change your mind and perhaps another source . this text appears neither in the final saved file , nor in a mar@@ ker that you might copy and paste something else . &quot;
&quot; the text &amp; lt ; merge operation ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board , if you copy such text from the result window . go carefully with this feature . &quot;
&quot; note : when selecting the sources the options ignore or ignore C / C + + comments , changes are treated in numbers or comments as well as white characters . &quot;
&quot; navig@@ ate mainly with the sc@@ roll@@ ers and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you are used in one of the window , you can use the arrow buttons , right , back , bottom , page , Str@@ g @-@ beginning and Str@@ g end , Si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs also to navig@@ ate . &quot;
in the Aug@@ er@@ ef@@ case you can also use the other buttons to edit files . with the Insert key you can switch between one @-@ feet and over@@ read mode . ( default is the plug @-@ in mode ) .
a click with the left mouse button in one of the coll@@ ision columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as already in the section mer@@ ging and the ed@@ itable output window ) .
&quot; the tool@@ bar includes seven buttons on navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture down@@ wards ) or to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture down@@ wards ) or to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture down@@ wards ) or to the next / previous conflict . hence , there must be differences between sol@@ dered and un@@ solved conflicts . &quot;
&quot; to copy the mark@@ ings into the cli@@ p@@ board , you need to copy the cop@@ ying button ( C@@ tr@@ g @-@ C or Str@@ g @-@ paste ) . if this enabled , it is automatically copied to automatically into the cli@@ p@@ board . be careful with this option however , because you might be able to write so the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
&quot; Unix systems are not stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a tick @-@ mounted sign \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 keeps the tick @-@ powered files \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 keeps the tick @-@ powered files , so you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not with bin@@ aries . &quot;
the options and the list of the most recently used files will be automatically saved and re@@ produced at the next start . ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 setup ... )
&quot; select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialogue also asks fonts with variable width to choose from , you should not use it . ) &quot;
&quot; when you activate this option , differences are shown in cur@@ sive scrip@@ tures . if the chosen scrip@@ ture is not supported , nothing happens . &quot;
&quot; in systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form , but would be controlled automatically . on these systems the button pres@@ ets automatically represents an odd colour . &quot;
&quot; when this option is activated , the pressing the Tab@@ ulator button will be inserted with the corresponding number of spaces . otherwise , a tabl@@ ulator will be inserted . &quot;
if you hit or push your input or return will automatically be used for the next line .
&quot; when this option is activated , each selection will be automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
you can choose which tick @-@ type you prefer to store . the default value is the generally usual choice on the operating system used .
&quot; in the compar@@ isons of files temp@@ ted &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , all completely identical lines can be ignored . the second step will not be ignored . this step will not be ignored . in this step white signs will not be ignored . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) save a car mark &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a tick @-@ sheet &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , others only store a tick @-@ sheet &apos; \ &apos; . usually ignore &amp; k@@ asy signs , but then files can be disabled . if this option has been activated , however , this option has to be disabled . in the context this option has to be de@@ activated . in the default , this option is de@@ activated . &quot;
&quot; in the default settings , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis are ignored numbers and corresponding signs ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) . in the result the differences are still indicated , but they are treated like white characters . &quot;
in the default this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters .
&quot; the option is enabled after even smaller differences . the option is enabled in the default delivery . it is effectively in complicated and large files , but slowly in very large files . &quot;
&quot; in the automatic res@@ ell mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed , before the next un@@ solved conflict will be continued . &quot;
&quot; automatically resol@@ ves all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as a source . ( default choice ) It is useful when white characters are less important in many files . note that the automatic selection also involves conflicts in numbers or comments , if the options ignore the numbers or ignore C / C + + comments . &quot;
these options are treated in the chapter to scan folders and run a mer@@ ging . take a look at the documentation on the directory comparison and mer@@ ging .
&quot; if a file is stored and already exists an older version , the original version exists the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ or@@ ig . if there is already such a back@@ drop file with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ or@@ ig , it is deleted without any further backup . &quot;
&quot; does not fit the language of the user interface . this option does not fit the current ongoing program . you need to finish and re@@ boot the change , so that the change is active in the KDE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available , because the language is over the control over the control centre . ) &quot;
&quot; the following co@@ ding settings can be adjusted for each entry separately . if you enabled this option , it is used for all entries to the upper setting . &quot;
&quot; above the selection fields for the code , a short notice of what the local co@@ ding is . ( this can not be changed here and has a purely informal character . ) &quot;
adjust the file code for source files . this influences how special characters are treated and will be interpreted . as the co@@ ding is individually adjustable for each file can be compared and assembled even files with different co@@ ding .
&quot; if you have compiled a file , you can set the code to save the code . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre @-@ processing commands , they may not function with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files can be 16 @-@ bit un@@ ic@@ ode , but the pre @-@ processing command can be set only with 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option one can set the code of the output of pre @-@ processing commands . &quot;
&quot; off , turn off to supp@@ ress pos@@ sessions of changes in white characters in text or over@@ sight points . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments , if the options ignore or ignor@@ ant C / C + + comments are activated ) . &quot;
&quot; this selection is only available when you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are shown in a color@@ co@@ ded over@@ saf@@ ed column column . but sometimes you may only see the differences between two of three files . according to the selection of A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C will be shown in addition to the normal remains a second pass @-@ on column with the required information . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , you would like to use the available place on the screen for long lines . scroll down the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu . ) &quot;
it can also be useful in comparison to each other or by one another . this option can also be useful to the ads of long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
&quot; sometimes you consider the differences and then decide to bring about the files into the mer@@ ging menu even if you only compare two files . a simple click begins to start the coll@@ ision and use the fil@@ en@@ ame of the last source file as default , then the name of the most recently used output file will be ret@@ ained . ) &quot;
&quot; reading a file first will be transferred to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own preferences , you can use this function for example or to correct any interference . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it is specified first to this external command ( see above ) , then the output of the command can be used only by the command operation . you can write your own preferences , which corresponds exactly your needs . each entry line must have an associated output line . &quot;
&quot; the thought behind it is to allow the user to provide more flexibility when creating the Di@@ ff results . however , the good news does not want to program itself . the good news is however , that in most cases sed or per@@ l are totally sufficient . &quot;
use this pre @-@ processing commands for sp@@ anning : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ U \ \ 1 / &apos; The \ \ 1 in the replacement string refers to the found text in the first hook line . the \ \ U walk the found text in grandfather .
&quot; http : / / \ _ BAR _ _ \ \ \ _ \ \ \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ _ \ \ \ _ \ \ \ \ \ _ \ \ \ \ \ _ \ \ \ \ \ _ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; while you experiment with sed , you might begin to understand it and perhaps you like these regular phrases even . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
&quot; the Ig@@ nor@@ ing of numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of a further pre@@ dispos@@ ition command equ@@ als / &#91; 0@@ 123@@ 45@@ 678@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; E@@ ach character between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , so they are virtually deleted . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you might want to perform several users at once . then , you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the compositions apart from each other . example : &quot;
sed after sed by per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos; s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / replacement / switch &apos; How@@ ever you need per@@ l a few details . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs per@@ l only ( and ) without the proce@@ eding &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre@@ processor will be ret@@ ained for display and inter@@ connected . the other operations only change the data that the two @-@ piece algorith@@ m looks like .
&quot; note : in some rare cases , if you use a normal preview , the edition of the normal Pre@@ processor can be seen as input . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function , the text changes or hidden differences , you may acci@@ dentally notice certain differences and destro@@ ying important data in the worst case . &quot;
&quot; often , programmers need to edit files in a folder of many files . for this reason you can compare with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folder re@@ ital@@ ic and merge . &quot;
... makes for every object a suggestion for interaction ; you can adjust the proposal before the start
... can the assem@@ ble simul@@ ate and shows the simul@@ ated changes without them really carry out
... guides selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 button ) or only with the selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) .
this is very similar to the compar@@ isons and mer@@ ging of individual files . you just need to specify file on the command line or in the dialog file .
&quot; if three folder are assembled , folder 1 is used as a base . if there is no target folder , use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as an objective folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , do not start the mer@@ ging . to select the connection , you must select the appropriate menu item or follow the F@@ 7 button . &quot;
&quot; during the recording of the folder you will find a small news window on current progress . if you break the folder , only the files are listed , that were compared to that . &quot;
&quot; when the dig@@ itiz@@ ation of the folder is completed , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list of window with the results on the left side , ... &quot;
each file and any folder found during the scan is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click here .
&quot; the folder structure is usually compiled together . you can click on a folder by clicking on the + / - click on the item , or by clicking on the object . the directory menu contains two functions all sub @-@ directories and all sub@@ directories , with which you can add all folders and folders . &quot;
&quot; click on a file double , the file is started and there will be a comparison window . &quot;
the icon in the column Name reflects the Data@@ Type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
&quot; if the Data@@ Type is different in the other folder , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details window to the selected object . in such a case the merge operation is not automatically selected . if the inter@@ connection is started , you will be informed about problems of this type again . &quot;
&quot; as seen in the above picture , in the columns A / B / C the colors red , green , yellow and black . &quot;
&quot; identical entries , the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different . &quot;
&quot; folder are considered identical if you are identical to the same content , then folder the same color . at folders , age is in@@ significant for its color . &quot;
&quot; the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf again , which is only green , then yellow is and later , when it is old , red . &quot;
&quot; a and C identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target , if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; a and B identical , but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target , if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; B and C are identical , but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target , if it exists ) &quot;
... A , B and C not the same fil@@ et@@ ype ( e.g. if A is a folder and B a file ) : error : contra@@ dic@@ tory objects . as long as such faul@@ ty objects have exist , the coll@@ ars cannot be started . &quot;
... A and B not have the same fil@@ et@@ ype ( e.g. if A is a folder and B a file ) : error : contra@@ dic@@ tory objects . as long as such faul@@ ty objects have exist , the coll@@ ars cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; the mode is to syn@@ chr@@ oni@@ ze is active if only two folder and no explicit target folder were active . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action is identical , so that both folder are identical . if for an entry ... &quot;
... A and B exist but not identical : together and store the result in both folders ; ( the user can see as visible fil@@ en@@ ame for output file only B ; directly after the mer@@ ging copied &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
&quot; when two files are assembled and select the option re@@ activated file instead of con@@ duction ( uns@@ ure ) , then an error message may vary , but the date appears to determine the same date . if the files are different , but the date appears to be identical .. sol@@ ves such errors may not be eliminated , the file cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; during the mer@@ ging , a file is done after the other . you have status @-@ column shows fer@@ tig when the mer@@ ger has been successfully completed , and corresponding to other messages when something un@@ expect@@ edly has been completed , you should make a final review and see if the status is all right . &quot;
&quot; if in the setup @-@ dialog , the file method is selected , K@@ Diff@@ 3 more columns are selected . they contain the number of sol@@ dered , sol@@ dered , not white and white conflicts . ( the column for sol@@ dered conflicts will only be shown if three files are compared or assembled . ) &quot;
&quot; you can either run the currently selected entry ( File or Od@@ ors ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the merge actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start the inter@@ connection . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you have not specified any target folder , then in the three @-@ folder merge mode C is used as the target used in the two @-@ folder merge , A and / or B is used as a target . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected a target folder , please check out if all entries are to be displayed in the target folder , also in the folder structure . there are some options by certain entries to avoid un@@ mistak@@ able surprises : &quot;
to run all entries : select directories / continue in the directory -@@ menu or press F@@ 7 ( the keyboard short@@ cuts ) . to run only the current entry : select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
&quot; if by contra@@ dic@@ tory data types still exist , a message appears to be applied to the faul@@ ty elements . you can then select a valid action . &quot;
&quot; if you perform all entries , a dialogue window will appear with the options search , simul@@ ate and break . &quot;
select Sim@@ ulation if you just want to see what would happen without which really changes will be made . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; K@@ diff@@ 3 ; then it takes certain actions with all entries . if a manual operation is necessary ( merge a single file ) then opens a mer@@ ging window ( note the screenshot ) .
&quot; if you are ready to start with a file , choose again directory / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you have not yet saved , does an appropriate dialog . then leads &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; his work will continue with the next entry . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on an error message , you will see a message and detailed status information . at the end of the list you will find it again to try to solve the cause of the problem . so you have the option to solve another action for the entry or to solve the problem in another way before you proceed with the mer@@ ging . &quot;
&quot; if some entries have been individually assembled , notice &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and will lead them to later . even if you have summar@@ izing the mer@@ ging action , these entries will change as done . only if you change the mer@@ ging action , these entries will again be mer@@ ged . &quot;
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 setup ... ) has now set a section called directory mer@@ ging with these options :
&quot; only files that fit into the specified pattern will be displayed in the Elem@@ ent@@ baum . you can separate the pattern with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( such as * .c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . &quot;
&quot; files and folders correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the elementary tree . it can be used more than a pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ or@@ ig ; * .@@ O . &quot;
&quot; files and folders correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the elementary tree . it can be used more than a pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ or@@ ig ; * .@@ O . &quot;
&quot; ignored files , which would also be ignored by CVS . many nau@@ tical produced files are ignored by CVS . the great advantage is that this folder can be adjusted with a .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( look at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . ) &quot;
&quot; in some file systems , files have an error attribute . in other file systems , a file is marked as hidden . this option allows you to decide whether these files are to be displayed in elementary @-@ tree or not . this option is enabled in the default . &quot;
&quot; in links to files : if the option is swit@@ ched off , symbolic cuts is compared . when the option enabled , the files will be compared to which the links will be de@@ activated . this is de@@ activated in the default settings . &quot;
&quot; in links on the folder , if the option is swit@@ ched off . if the option is enabled , the links are treated as normal folder and recur@@ sively . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; do not appear on possible record versions and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; cr@@ ashes down . ) This option is in the default settings . &quot;
&quot; complete analysis includes a complete analysis of any file by and displays statistics columns . ( the number of sol@@ dered , un@@ solved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is s@@ lower than a simple bin@@ aries , and essentially s@@ lower if they contain no text . ( enter an appropriate anti @-@ pattern . ) &quot;
&quot; if you compare a large folder of a slow network , it &apos;s possible to compare only the changing date and the file size . please note this speed . this option is in the default settings . &quot;
similar to the changing date . there is no real comparison instead of . the files are considered identical if they are equally useful when cop@@ ying the ch@@ angel@@ ing date . please be treated with caution . this option is in preference .
&quot; syn@@ chr@@ oni@@ ze the syn@@ chr@@ oni@@ ze mode if two files are compared and no target folder , in this mode , the proposals are selected to inter@@ f@@ ere that both folder are identical . also , the results of the mer@@ ging of files are stored in both folders . &quot;
&quot; if there are differences , the cop@@ ying of the newer file is proposed as an action . ( this is provided as un@@ certain , for it is provided that the other file has not been modified . ) This option is in the default settings . &quot;
&quot; if a file or folder is replaced by another or deleted , the original version will be ren@@ amed and get the extension .@@ original extension already exists , this is no further backup of individual files , not just the mer@@ ging of individual files , not only the mer@@ ging of individual files . this option is enabled in the default . &quot;
&quot; normally , the folder mer@@ ging of individual files is visible ; you can switch the window of the window with the mouse . if you do not want it , you can switch the window directory and text window , and switch from the link between directory &amp; text window to switch between the two views . &quot;
&quot; probably you prefer to compare a file simply using double @-@ click menu . however , there is also a single menu in the directory . you can manage a single file directly , without losing the folder menu . as soon as you can save the result , the status will be done correctly and the file will not run again when you run the folder . &quot;
&quot; however , this status is lost however , if you want to read the directory again : list menu : new entries &quot;
&quot; KDE supports network transparent with the help of K@@ IO @-@ Sl@@ aves . K@@ Diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way you can specify files and folders for opening , which are located on local or remote computers . &quot;
the first command line is compar@@ es a local file with a FTP server . the second command line is compar@@ es a folder inside a compressed arch@@ iv@@ s with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax to local files and folders . a few things you should consider :
a path can be relatively un@@ . or .. included . this is not possible with UR@@ Ls , these are always absolute . &quot;
&quot; special characters must be mas@@ king . ( # - &gt; % 23 , empty , &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # foo # the URL file : / % 23@@ foo % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes due to the files@@ ystem on the server , sometimes by the used protocol . it follows a short list of constra@@ ints : &quot;
&quot; or it cannot be distinguished whether a link is shown to a file or a folder . then , a file is accepted as a link destination . ( FTP : , s@@ ftp : ) . &quot;
there is no way to edit just@@ ifications or change date . therefore the author@@ is@@ ations or modification date from the original . ( note the option Con@@ fi@@ denti@@ ality of the size . ) ( This is only available in local files . )
&quot; the main verification is currently under differences in K@@ Dev@@ elop . K@@ Dev@@ elop first always starts to start the built @-@ in differences . in order to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the difference viewer and then select In K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; normally , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two full input file is used , takes &amp; dis@@ diff@@ 3 ; the names of the original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then start &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch is to restore the missing file . &quot;
&quot; in the Con@@ quer@@ or you can select a patch file , and select from the context menu preview in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . moreover , this is un@@ reliable , if the original files have been changed since generating the patch file . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part runs , it only supports the compar@@ isons of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . &quot;
&quot; using the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now He@@ ist it coma ) there is already . also , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already indicates that there can be mer@@ ging as the program diff@@ user from the Di@@ ff tool collection . &quot;
I use GPL programs for a long time and I learned a lot when I have looked at the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone the way or let him go .
&quot; you probably compiled the program from the sources and configure the configure script , probably not the right pre@@ fix to KDE . in the Vo@@ re@@ inst@@ ation installed configure in / usr / local , but then KDE cannot find resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file , you will find further information on this subject . &quot;
&quot; if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are differently treated as identical ; however , the line will not be treated differently . if similar lines appear next to each other , this ei@@ is , but this is more often the case . &quot;
&quot; the editor will notice any difference in the files where he starts and where he ends . this important information is simply lost , if the result is simply stored as text file and it will be too much effort to design such a file format that could store this information . &quot;
the effort for this was so far too big . you can restore a certain version always through the output of a source A / B / C . to edit larger amounts of text should be used another editor .
after removing text is suddenly ; No src lin@@ ts ; published and the text cannot be extingu@@ ished . what does this mean and how can this be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses many colors to highlight differences . even more circulation would be confusing and l@@ acks the purpose . use a different editor .
many good ideas and bug@@ fixes came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
&quot; to use all the functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; use , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later . &quot;
information on how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage .
a list of recent changes can be found at http : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the Qu@@ ell package .
&quot; to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; to comp@@ ile and install , use the following command in the bas@@ ins of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; distribution : &quot;
&quot; KDE @-@ dir gives the folder in your system , installed in which KDE is installed . if you are uns@@ ure , you will find further details in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file . &quot;
&quot; as &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ate use , you should not have any problems while comp@@ iling . should nonetheless difficulties occur , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mail@@ ing lists . &quot;
cutting ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or Shift @-@ Del@@ ete ) copies into the cli@@ p@@ board and delet@@ es the selected text . Insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or Um@@ sch@@ alt @-@ paste ) add the text from the cli@@ p@@ board to the current c@@ urs@@ or@@ position or replaced the current mark .
&quot; only variations in all folders are identical in all folders , and therefore not in the target folder . &quot;
( in the current program version you will need to make changes to these options the folder with the function updates . )
&quot; there are only entries displayed , the differences you have . this also leads to that identical files will not be copied to the target folder . if the target file does not already exist in the target folder . ( the behavior is likely to be removed after the mer@@ ging version . ) This option is not swit@@ ched in a later program version . &quot;
&quot; please note the buttons to choose the source with the lab@@ elling A , B and C below the menu bar . if you are on one of the buttons , the lines are attached from the corresponding window to the end of the selected group in the result window , if the lines are already present , they will be back on the button accordingly . &quot;
in the default this option is disabled . under@@ differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters .
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini@@ pre@@ view of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the desktop to change its size , to stop them or move it . this works both inside a desktop and at several . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops as well as those used in the ongoing applications . the applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to the other .
the middle mouse button can be moved on windows within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both within a desktop and on other des@@ kt@@ ops .
&quot; the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked on , if on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; click on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; it is also shown the symbol and the name of the application as well as the entries minim@@ ize , maxim@@ ize , on desktop and ending . &quot;
maxim@@ izes the application window on the full size of the desktop . appears only when using a application .
sends the application to select virtual desktop . appears only when a application has been cli@@ cked on .
&quot; if this cross @-@ field is marked , window can be shi@@ fted within the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop , and also to other work@@ spaces are shi@@ fted . &quot;
&quot; if this field is crossed , the name of the virtual des@@ kt@@ ops are displayed . &quot;
&quot; cruise this field leaves the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the numbers of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is displayed together with name , the names are provided with folder , &amp; eg ; 1st work@@ space . &quot;
&quot; if this field is crossed , the background of each desktop is also shown as the background in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; if this field is crossed , the running programs are displayed as small windows in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only the empty spaces are shown to allow their selection . &quot;
&quot; here , the view of the program window is selected . simply displays simple rect@@ angles with the pro@@ portions of the program window . symbol indicates the window with its default window and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is recommended only for very fast systems . &quot;
&quot; here , the arrangement of the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; -@@ main window will be defined : classic makes &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ n @-@ aster , which shows all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops in some other Window@@ s- and ver@@ tically in a vertical range , which is very good for the presentation on the desktop . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager Mini@@ program in the control bar . he has the advantage that he can view the window as symbols or with its content and can also move beyond the control bar .
right mouse button within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; and subsequent selection of switch switches ... makes the dialog settings appear .
currently this cannot be modified in dialog settings . but you can do it manually :
&quot; open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor , such as &amp; k@@ edit ; or VI@@ . if you do not have a write permission for the file , you must register as user root or sign up to your system administrator . in this file you need to set the key wind@@ ow@@ Transpar@@ ent mode and apply this a value . possible values are : &quot;
&quot; da &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; part of the package base , you need a functioning installation of the KDE packages . &quot;

&quot; in the standard position , it may be magni@@ fied ; the area around the mouse c@@ ater such as a moving magni@@ fier . alternatively , you can &amp; k@@ mag ; to cause a selected screen in the screen window ( drop@@ down mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse on screen ( eg ; at the left screen ) . &quot;
&quot; you would like to avoid that the mouse c@@ ursor in the enlarged window is displayed , select the default mouse button . please note that the mouse c@@ ursor is not yet able to recognize the shape of the mouse c@@ ursor . this is always the standard @-@ k@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ mouse c@@ ursor . &quot;
&quot; in the drop@@ down mode , you can adjust the drop@@ down window to your own needs . you can change it with the arrow and sn@@ acking and change its size . this can be done in the following ways : &quot;
move the mouse button in the enlargement window and keep the left mouse button de@@ pressed , so you can catch the contents of enlar@@ ging window and move . this also goes with the arrow buttons . &quot;
&quot; if you are additionally pressing the &amp; Shift ; taste or die &amp; M@@ MB ; use , you can move the drop@@ down window . &quot;
&quot; with this combination , you can change the size of the drop@@ down window . note that the upper @-@ left corner of the drop @-@ up will remain stable and only the lower right corner is to move . &quot;
&quot; you may send a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer , into a file to add to the cli@@ p@@ board ( to add it later to other applications ) , the picture rot@@ ate and much more . &quot;
starts and stops the update of the display . the up@@ dating of the update causes the needed CPU @-@ time against 0 .
&quot; select the Update rate ( Very low , straight@@ ening , means , h@@ och , Very high ) . the higher the updates , the more CPU time is needed . &quot;
in this mode the selection window will be displayed . the selected range is displayed in a window .
&quot; if you are using a new window command to save files , opening up a new window , print , new@@ com@@ ades ( with the button document again ) in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , magni@@ fying and commun@@ ism &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; you can also use a micro@@ scope . you can use &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; to use an area of the screen , so as if you use a magni@@ fier to consider the mini@@ printed in a paper or a photo . this application is used for various people of benefit : from the research or artist to the web @-@ designer or visual impair@@ ment . &quot;

&amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse @-@ click as soon as the mouse c@@ ursor is a while on the same spot . it is meant to help people who suffer from R@@ SI syndrome ( Rep@@ et@@ itive strain syndrome ) and those of each mouse @-@ click pain is prepared .
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse @-@ click , once the mouse c@@ ursor is a while on the same spot . it is designed to help people who em@@ ulate the Rep@@ et@@ itive strain In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and those of each mouse click pain . furthermore , it may require the pulling with the mouse . this requires a little practice . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain that is created when clicking the mouse . unfortunately , you can also get rid of the mouse with no pain . unfortunately , you may also suffer from the mere admir@@ ation of your computer , you should seek a doctor if this is not yet happened . &quot;
&quot; to clarify it once again : even if &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; p@@ ains that helps when clicking the mouse it is against p@@ ains that is caused by moving the mouse , the result can vary for every variable . &quot;
the use of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitor your mouse movements and runs a mouse click as soon as you break the movement briefly .
&quot; is the smart car@@ ps activated , makes &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a break after it is executed the mouse button . move the mouse , wait until the end of the movement , before turning the mouse button . move on this way you can move the pulling at penet@@ rate , but you get used to it quickly . &quot;
&quot; this delay must be hidden after the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click out . &quot;
&quot; is Intel@@ ligent Ver@@ moving on , the shooting range is enabled ( 1 / 10 s ) active . here , the time is shut down , the &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after the down@@ fall , the mouse button is waiting for the mouse button again , if the mouse button will go back again , if the mouse is no moving of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports the clicking on the right and back , followed by a break . these movements are stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ txt . this movements will be launched in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ txt . &quot;
&quot; if the sound is del@@ ayed , you can sh@@ orten the response time . open it to sound &amp; multimedia , choose sound system and here the rider display . here is a sli@@ der @-@ bu@@ ffer , which you set to a lower value to sh@@ orten the answer times . &quot;
&quot; this function is marked with km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; for each start of &amp; k@@ de ; start . this feature is currently only under &amp; k@@ de ; available . by GNO@@ ME or other window prints , please drag the particular documentation to rate to find out how to start a program automatically . &quot;
&quot; Set all settings back on the values that have been set when opening the dialogue . have already pressed the button user @-@ down , the settings will be res@@ et upon the last wi@@ gs of users . &quot;
&quot; most of you use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the pres@@ ets . especially the intelligent sli@@ mming you should first turn off at first . if you then get used to the automatic mouse , you can later gain the intelligent shift . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the answer@@ ing times of &amp; k@@ de ; at sounds . &quot;
&quot; first , you should be aware of what places a mouse @-@ click without effect stays : clicking on the neutral ingredients of windows or on placement in the browser window , which does not show any link , does not lead to invol@@ unt@@ ary reactions . you can therefore use the mouse on such dig@@ its , until you want to use them again . &quot;
&quot; if your mouse is printed , you should clean your mouse . this is usually pretty straight@@ forward . the trick is that you are not only the mouse @-@ ball clean , but also the re@@ els that occur with the mouse ball in touch . &quot;
&quot; first , you have to take out the mouse ball . as that happens , is different from mouse to mouse different . it should be quickly clear when you look at the under@@ side of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the roles . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . the dirt and the fil@@ s can easily be easily scrat@@ ching with a flat blade or the f@@ ing@@ ern@@ el . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations the operating system breaks down the execution of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you are just begun in this case the smart shift , means that &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the surgery can no longer finish by the slogan of the mouse button . &quot;
this happens when you use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; using another window manager and move a window .
the solution to this problem is that you can run a mouse @-@ click here . this is the status of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; return and you can continue to work as usual .
&quot; problem : if you enter text , try &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and continue the c@@ ursor to another passage . &quot;
&quot; solution : use the mouse to place the c@@ ursor to place where you want to have it . but do not park the mouse on a neutral range of working space , if you don &apos;t want to cause the mouse into a neutral range . secure zones for the maus@@ oleum and menus and the cover @-@ line of windows . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with the smar@@ ter shift , but I do not create it to edit text . &quot;
&quot; the smart bu@@ ckl@@ ing is an advanced feature of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it needs his time to copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board to move and move again into the cli@@ p@@ board to move back into the cli@@ p@@ board . however , it will probably only cause problems with the mouse button . here are some advice on this : &quot;
&quot; do not use the intelligent shift , if you just start using &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use text instead as follows : run the mouse button down , while you move the mouse button , while you move the mouse button on the other end of the text and again the mouse button again . &quot;
&quot; by using the audi@@ ble mouse click . this is the mouse button , when &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button presses a sound like a mouse @-@ click . later you can use the intelligent push without the audi@@ ble mouse click . but later , it requires some exercise . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use the X@@ Test @-@ extension for &amp; X Window , which should be installed on most of the system . &quot;
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available when the system is equipped with a sound@@ card and loud@@ speakers and it is correct .
&amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; access the mouse button as soon as the mouse c@@ ursor is short @-@ har@@ dened . this program has been developed for people who suffer from R@@ SI syndrome and those made the bed@@ ding of the mu@@ ff@@ le pain .
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured , that it is a certain time to wait for a pulling process before the mouse button is left . in this way , the pulling and dist@@ res@@ et can be performed with the mouse . &quot;

&quot; &amp; km@@ outh ; is a program , with the m@@ ute user can speak their computer for themselves . &quot;
&quot; with the program &amp; km@@ outh ; M@@ ute users can speak the computer for themselves . the user can choose from a list of conversation , which should be talked again . &quot;
&quot; on the first page of the wiz@@ ard ( left screen shot ) you enter the command , which later is used for the language issue of text . further details can be found in the description of the installation . &quot;
&quot; on the second page you can choose the standard text@@ book . from the text@@ books , you can often choose text passages without having to tap into . the text passages can be processed naturally . &quot;
&quot; on the third page ( right screenshot ) you define the dictionary for the worthy language . &amp; km@@ outh ; reads the KDE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of the individual words . additionally , you can record the words with an Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary . &quot;
the main window of &amp; km@@ outh ; is clear and contains essentially a input field for the key@@ note of your propositions ( the lower white field in the screenshot of your propositions ( the upper white field in the screenshot of the screenshot ) .
&quot; if you have a km@@ er , you can enter in the input field the propositions you want to hear . each s@@ pro@@ ch@@ ene set is attached to the lead memory . you can select from this propositions which are to be discussed again . &quot;
&quot; this dialog includes two cards dialog by &amp; km@@ outh ; . this dialog contains two cards , voice @-@ over@@ s and settings , the site of worthy authority as well as the page K@@ TT@@ SD @-@ language service . &quot;
&quot; in the input field of the map language , enter the command to call the language @-@ generator . in the drop@@ down section under the input field , you place the string @-@ generator , with which text is passed on to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ outh ; knows two species to pass the text . select the cruci@@ fix@@ ing , if the text is unchanged as default one to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; if the cruci@@ fix@@ ture is not selected , the text will be passed as parameters . you can use the following wild@@ card : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command to voice files . this command can be found in the documentation to your language generator . examples can be found in the App@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; with as possible to use as a language service , &amp; km@@ outh ; as the first attempt to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service , and the timing of this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
&quot; by selecting a text box , you will determine which action by the keyboard short@@ cuts or by choosing a text message in the menu text pass@@ agen@@ buch or in the bar for text pass@@ ag@@ books . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of So@@ fort , the selected text message will speak directly in addition to the memory of the text@@ book . with the selection of in the input field the selected text message will initially be entered into the text@@ field . &quot;
&quot; with the second exit box , closing the editing phase for text pass@@ agen@@ buch can you specify whether the text@@ book manual on the closing of the editing phase will be automatically saved . &quot;
&quot; the selection of text pass@@ agen@@ buch will save the book . if you select changes , the text@@ book is not saved . choose your memory file , becomes &amp; km@@ outh ; ask if the text@@ book is stored . &quot;
&quot; the site of words contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the words . in the main window , next to the input field shows &amp; km@@ outh ; a drop @-@ off , if this list contains more than a dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons on the right on the side you can delete dic@@ tion@@ aries or add the order of books , or put them into a file . below the list , you can set the name in the input field and in the selection field the language for the dictionary . &quot;
select for this source the desired language ; &amp; km@@ outh ; reads the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of the individual words is determined simply by counting the occurrence . additionally you can add the wor@@ dl@@ ist with an Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary to add just correctly written words into the new dictionary .
this option allows you to summar@@ ize the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; km@@ outh ; asks why dic@@ tion@@ aries are mer@@ ged , and how it should be weight@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; with this option you place a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; km@@ outh ; newly entered words automatically into the dictionary , you can create a dictionary with your voc@@ abulary . &quot;
the main area of the window to the processing of text pass@@ ag@@ rams is two @-@ divided . in the upper part the text@@ books are represented as a tree structure .
&quot; in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text message , you can change the texture or the related key@@ boards . if you have selected a text@@ book , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; actions such as new text passages or books add or delete selected text passages and books , you can either reach via the selection in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or via a folding menu . &quot;
the order of text passages or text passages can change through pulling with the mouse to the new place or with the arrows and the old ; -@@ key .
&quot; the chosen text is cut off and copies into the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field is selected , it is used , otherwise the selected areas of the contact store . &quot;
&quot; the chosen text is copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field is selected a text section , it is used , otherwise the selected areas of the contact store . &quot;
&quot; the currently active sentence is spoken . if text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected movements of the shi@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; if this menu item is listed , a movable tool@@ bar with kno@@ bs displayed directly below the menu bar . by mouse @-@ click on the reverse left side and pulling the tool@@ bar can be post@@ pon@@ ed to another point . &quot;
&quot; if this menu is crossed , a narrow base in the lower part of the main window with instructions about the condition of &amp; km@@ outh ; displayed when not crossed , this status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; this menu is indicated by default , a movable glue for text pass@@ ag@@ books with entries . the bar is provided by default about the editing window directly under the tool@@ bar . by mouse @-@ click on the wr@@ inkl@@ ed left side and pulling the tool@@ bar may be post@@ pon@@ ed to another point . &quot;
&quot; probably you have the command for voice @-@ over@@ s not properly or not completely entered . opening Settings km@@ outh ; set ... , open the page of General settings and enter the command for voice @-@ voice files on the map of card files . ( see Settings dialog for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers for more details . ) &quot;
&quot; the Festival is a voice @-@ over@@ s system of the University of Edinburgh . currently , only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh is supported . the license allows you to use Festival free of charge and re@@ distribute any restrictions . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for the setting of voice @-@ over@@ s , is thought that Festival in the folder / usr / local / festival is installed . the command to the language issue is then : &quot;
&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a in &amp; Java ; trained language generator . currently , he only supports the English pron@@ unci@@ ations . the license allows it to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and to re@@ distribute any restrictions . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for the institution &apos;s command , it is thought that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the folder / usr / local / fre@@ el@@ et . the language issue is then possible with one of the three following command examples : &quot;
for the third example the option must be enabled as default settings . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
M@@ BR@@ OL@@ A is a language generator for many languages . he trans@@ forms a list of phon@@ eme in an Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei ; therefore you need an additional program to cr@@ ush the text in Ph@@ on@@ eme . the license permits it to use M@@ BR@@ OL@@ A for free and non @-@ commercial applications .
&quot; in our example H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text in Ph@@ on@@ eme to M@@ BR@@ OL@@ A , under the assumption that H@@ adi@@ fax and M@@ BR@@ OL@@ A is installed in / usr / local / i@@ fax and / usr / local / M@@ BR@@ OL@@ A . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately H@@ adi@@ fax is happy to swal@@ lowed the last sign of the text , so that an additional sign has to be added . the complete command is therefore more elaborate than in the other examples : &quot;
( cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BAR _ / usr / local / M@@ BR@@ OL@@ A / M@@ BR@@ OL@@ A / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; art@@ spl@@ ay / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; rm / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in a line . the option has to be enabled as default settings .
&quot; the TT@@ SD is a &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ more language service , which is currently being developed for voice @-@ over@@ s . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various voice @-@ over@@ s . &quot;
&quot; since the settings of the voice @-@ generator is done only in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you just need to use as the language service as speech service in &amp; km@@ outh ; adjust . &quot;
&quot; to adjust the page K@@ TT@@ SD @-@ Sprach@@ dienst , which appears in the Settings dialog by &amp; km@@ outh ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; km@@ outh ; successful to use , you need a language generator ( and natural &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; km@@ outh ; requires about 15 MB memory ( and in addition memory for the voice @-@ generator ) , but it depends on the individual from your computer and its configuration . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ outh ; is an application , with the people who can not speak , text by the computer . it will be a list of already spoken sentences , which the user can always restore again . &quot;
note that &amp; km@@ outh ; no voice syn@@ thesizer contains . on the computer must be a voice syn@@ thesizer .

&quot; before you use , you need to install and correctly set the program speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher and correctly . see also &quot;
&quot; when the first start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr or as long as no speakers are set up , the card map is displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker , the map is displayed . see . &quot;
&quot; most T@@ TS @-@ syn@@ thesizer offer different languages and voices , so also different male or female , or those who are called in volume or speed . you can also use several variants for a syn@@ thesizer . you should at least use a speaker before you use , as the program speed @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher otherwise used the standard speaker . &quot;
various speakers for the same syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers are comparable to several printed long for the same printer .
&quot; if you click on the cart@@ ei@@ ph@@ er@@ re@@ iter spokes@@ man in kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr , the card map will appear automatically . it will appear automatically when you start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ s and not have been set up any spokes@@ man . &quot;
all already mentioned speakers appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear on top in the list . the top speaker is used for voice @-@ over@@ s when an application is no speaker .
&quot; select a spokes@@ man on the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list . &quot;
&quot; select a spokes@@ man on the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below . &quot;
&quot; select a spokes@@ man on the list , and click on this button to push the speaker in the list a line further down . the order of the spokes@@ man in the list certainly determines its priority . &quot;
click on one of these buttons to use your changes to the current &amp; time system ;
&quot; select a voice type , there are three male and three female voices as well as a Jun@@ gen@@ - and girls vote for choosing . &quot;
&quot; if you click here , the new speaker will appear on the map map speakers . to change the settings of this talk , click on &quot; &quot; Edit &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; now you can use &amp; kt@@ ops ; already almost use . go back to the map of map and check whether language issue can be activated ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , so that the T@@ TS @-@ service from &amp; k@@ de ; start . now you can read and manage text messages in order to make text messages and manage . see . &quot;
&quot; if you set up at least one spokes@@ man , you can start the language system of &amp; k@@ de ; click on the map of the map to open this map . here you can set some general options . &quot;
&quot; mark this startup box to activate the machine @-@ box ; this start is successful , the card @-@ card service is displayed , and you can create text messages and read . see . remove the mark , becomes K@@ TT@@ SD , and the T@@ TS @-@ system of &amp; k@@ de ; de@@ activated . &quot;
&quot; when kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is finished , it is running ; further , provided the box files ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is activated ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; if this cross @-@ field marks and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr appears in advance automatically in the system division of the control bar , it dis@@ appears as soon as the pre @-@ reading is completed . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this series you can start text@@ orders , break down , stop and record again . &quot;
with the buttons in this series you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; cli@@ p@@ board read or read a text file for reading . you can also read the speaker for an order .
&quot; click App@@ ear@@ ed or OK , then all changed settings on all sides . &quot;
&quot; card @-@ card orders will only be displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD has started to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the card @-@ card display and cross the voice @-@ over@@ s ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the requested page . check out if &amp; kt@@ ts ; runs first , select the text , which should be read , and choose from the main menu Tools text . after a short time the language issue should start . &quot;
&quot; it is almost always recommend@@ able to mark the desired text of a website . you can also move this step too , but then many &amp; HTML ; -@@ pre@@ tension and other invisible brands are also pre@@ read . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; Kate ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read text read before . check the text , which should be read , and select the main menu tools text . then , the voice issue should start . &quot;
&quot; this also works if &amp; Kate ; in other applications is embedded , like &amp; eg ; in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; quant@@ a ; &quot;
K@@ Not@@ ice is the news system of &amp; k@@ de ; you can notify you of writing events . you can read the text of these messages also from &amp; kt@@ ts ; read the text of this news .

filters are one of the advanced skills of &amp; rect@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; time ; filters are not required .
&quot; in filter@@ ing , text will be processed , before it is sent to the program speech disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for enhancing the pron@@ unci@@ ation to select false spoken words or abbre@@ vi@@ ations to get a suitable language and speakers or to deal with certain short@@ com@@ ings of language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices . &quot;
&quot; to understand the working method of filter@@ ing , it is important to know how the program works &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; with a text . &quot;
&quot; the output of Screen function has the highest priority . it is pro@@ pul@@ led to all other orders and keeps these orders . if the output of the Screen Reader is pre@@ read , the re@@ igned orders will be continued . &quot;
warnings have the next priority . this stage is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is not reserved . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will be continued after the issue of warning .
&quot; News have the night &apos;s highest priority . a message inter@@ rup@@ ts normal text . &amp; km@@ outh ; is an example of a application that uses messages . while you &amp; eg ; a long text on a website can be read , you can access the room . &amp; k@@ de ; not@@ ifications are also news . read about this . &quot;
&quot; the rest are simple text @-@ orders . every order that you get from the card @-@ card orders is a text@@ book . K@@ Say@@ it is an example of an application , the text messages used . text messages are intended for the edition of prolonged articles that do not have special ur@@ gency . &quot;
&quot; all four commis@@ sions are worked in qu@@ eu@@ es , except the output of Screen Re@@ aders . when applying the output of a Screen Re@@ aders . when applying the output of a Screen Re@@ aders , during &amp; time ; just one such pre@@ reads , this issue is stopped and finished . &quot;
&quot; first , you must know that filters are never applied to the output of Screen Re@@ aders . they are applied to normal warnings , news and text messages as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages . &quot;
filters edit the text and continue to pass it to the next filter . at the time there are three types of filters .
filters are carried out as modules . in the future there are still other kinds of filters .
&quot; strings replace parts of a text by other text . the following parts you can indicate either as words or as regular expressions ; it is defined with pre @-@ defined string emot@@ icons like : - ) by text or for the form@@ att@@ ing of messages from &amp; con@@ vers@@ ation , or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understanding . &quot;
&amp; XML ; - trans@@ duc@@ ers use a X@@ SLT file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; used by a format into another format .
&quot; if you can filter orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program , which sent the text to , sent to a spokes@@ person , you can read text from KDE messages about it . &quot;
&quot; each of these various filters has adjustable rules , where it is applied to a voice issue . if the filter states that his rules are not applicable , he will continue the text unchanged at the next filter . &quot;
&quot; when a text message , a message , warning or an &amp; k@@ de ; message is sent to it ; it will be processed by all the activated filter that will be set up on the page below . the processing by the filter is performed in the sequence from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; this shows the list of the furnished normal filters . if a filter is not crossed , it is not activated and is not used . filters are given the series down from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; click here to insert a new filter . select the type of fil@@ ters , and it will be displayed below the following setup di@@ alogs . &quot;
&quot; for the establishment of strings , you need to enter a list of words or regular phrases as a comparison pattern . will this pattern be replaced in the text , then the text is replaced with the replacement text . &quot;
&quot; give you a name for your filter a name . you can choose any name , it must be distinguished only by the name of the other filters . &quot;
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the string in the column match and re@@ places it in accordance with the string from the column . the list is displayed in the sequence from top to bottom .
click here to shift the distinctive word or the regular expression in the list .
&quot; with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular phrases from a file to save the current list or delete a list from a file , the entries will be attached to the existing list . &quot;
&quot; if a language is registered , the filter is only applied when the spokes@@ person speaks for the text message one of the languages here . you can also select multiple languages if you click on the mouse click the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l ; key . &quot;
&quot; if a value is registered , the filter is used only when the text is used by one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs by comm@@ a . example : conversation , k@@ mail &quot;
&quot; the application @-@ ID programs are available with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; d@@ bus ; -@@ Num@@ bers , you have to take away . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application @-@ ID kop@@ ete @-@ 34@@ 32 are allowed to enter only copies . &quot;
&quot; the string connector filter is applied only to the text when all conditions are applied with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter if match . all input fields are empty , the filter will be applied to all texts . &quot;
&quot; in comparison of words , the string connector filters are used in the form \ \ s word \ \ s. the words must therefore be limited by divi@@ ders ( spaces ) . &quot;
in this manual you will find no guide to writing regular phrases . if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; phrases can be found in the par@@ am@@ big@@ s package .
&amp; XML ; - trans@@ duc@@ ers translate &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SLT files from a format into another format . X@@ SLT ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such transform@@ ations . it can only be applied to well @-@ shaped XML . the b@@ ail@@ program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c must be installed on your system .
enter the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c can be reached on the ambient variable P@@ AT@@ H variable .
&quot; you can send text to a particular spokes@@ person , which is set up on the map speaker , or to a speaker with certain properties . you can specify that texts from k@@ mail to be read from a female voice . &quot;
&quot; before , before , there is a text to the filter , it searches a spokes@@ man for the text . the speaker is selected by the spokes@@ man &apos;s speaker . the speaker is selected by the speaker , and the properties of the speaker selection , you can write the chosen speaker . &quot;
&quot; if a value is registered , the filter is applied to the filter is applied to your system of &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expressions , you can call this with a click on the button to get help in entering . &quot;
&quot; to achieve a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression in the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; if the text is selected by you desired speakers . if the text is fulfilled the above filter@@ ing conditions , the spokes@@ man will be selected to show the desired requirements for the most desired requirements . click on the button on the right to show the dialog &apos;s selection . &quot;
use these buttons to store your inter@@ phone settings or to delete all settings .
&quot; the Spre@@ ader filter is applied only to the text when all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter if applicable . you must apply at least one condition . &quot;
&quot; the voice @-@ over@@ s API , by &amp; k@@ de ; with the programmer to give their applications T@@ TS abilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; d@@ bus ; &quot;
&quot; the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the voice syn@@ thesizer to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so that they can use this syn@@ thesizer . &quot;
the following section contains a brief description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; -@@ interface of the voice @-@ over@@ s API by &amp; k@@ de ; . the complete documentation for both API@@ s can be found on the k@@ de ; Acc@@ essi@@ bility Website ( http : / / accessi@@ bil@@ ity.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications demand Langu@@ ages over the &amp; d@@ bus ; -@@ interface by &amp; k@@ de ; from program kt@@ ts@@ d on the object k@@ spe@@ ech .
&quot; this text is text to read and option a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc . &quot;
there are even more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands
&quot; open two &amp; Con@@ sole ; windows . run first on one window , then kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr in other . &quot;
none of the mentioned language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
&quot; I have created the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; Re@@ form@@ er@@ filter furnished , but with the use of the module for the festival website will not be read . &quot;
&quot; due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male British ) Voice of Rab _ di@@ phone so that S@@ able does not work at all . you need to do this voice not for reading websites . make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is not installed and can be found on the ambient variable P@@ AT@@ H . &quot;
certain signs or pressing signs seem to cause mistakes in syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers so that whole propositions can be ski@@ pped or only gi@@ b@@ lows . what can I do against it ?
&quot; first , make sure the option of the enco@@ ding is set to the correct value for the corresponding language . there are problems with certain signs or words , these may be solved by a string connector filter . &quot;

K@@ T@@ TS also works with any voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers that can be started at the command line in a &amp; console ;
&quot; the list of these languages can be un@@ complete or out@@ dated , so do not drag the description of the syn@@ thesizer to the supported languages . take a look at the website of kt@@ ts ; , according to information , which are not included in this manual . &quot;
the program &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; uses an adap@@ table module for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . if you would like to expand the use of any other syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , contact the development team . &quot;
the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; -@@ conversion filter is not mandatory . Debian user can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c using the command ap@@ t @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
&quot; to comp@@ ile , comp@@ iling , you need a current development environment by KDE ( Version 3.4 or later ) including the packages k@@ deli@@ bs and the wrap @-@ files for the program &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you have downloaded the source text by &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source text archive , or have downloaded each night currently released tar@@ ball , install and install the program with the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before you &amp; kt@@ ts ; use , check whether speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher is correct with your voice syn@@ thesizer . so you can use the shell SPD conf . &quot;
&amp; rect@@ al ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; rect@@ ts ; it is intended to be used as the program speech disp@@ at@@ cher . the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr is to be developed directly and the script SPD @-@ conf is no longer needed .
&quot; a long text is un@@ break@@ down into individual sets . the user can leave stat@@ utes , or dis@@ rup@@ tions , repeat the issue . &quot;
&quot; if an application text is attached to the output , it can request the characteristics of the preferred speakers for output . so if you want to set up a speaker , the language of English and its gender is female , it is automatically selected the best matching speakers . if you want to know more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; a speaker will choose , see you in . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the map speakers to add or click on the map , and click on to edit a spokes@@ man on the list . as an example is shown by the configuration of the module for Festival Interactive . details on the modules can be found here . &quot;
&quot; enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path is included in P@@ AT@@ H , you just have to enter the festival . &quot;
&quot; select the string enco@@ ding for text , which is transferred to Festival . in general , this setting will be automatically set . generally , the Western languages use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , eastern languages such as Czech or Slov@@ ak@@ ian use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; with these sli@@ ders you make volume , talk @-@ speed and pitch of syn@@ thetic language . if you cannot select some regul@@ ator and may not be displayed this gray , the voice can not select these settings . &quot;
&quot; some votes such as Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices need to be loaded for several seconds because of their size , these voices are already loaded at the start of the K@@ TT@@ SD , so that ( on greatest storage consumption ) the first set is syn@@ thetic . &quot;
&quot; if this approach is not selected , you have not yet appointed a spokes@@ man ( or forget to click on users ) . &quot;
&quot; if this cross @-@ field is marked with the start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr the program window . otherwise , after the start only the icon kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr in the system section is visible , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; if this cross @-@ field is marked and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr does not run , it appears in the system range when K@@ TT@@ SD will read a text before you can read or otherwise control it . &quot;
&quot; here all orders in the queue is listed , together with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of propositions and the straight set . the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the map speaker . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this series , you can count on the order that is selected in the list below , pre@@ - or back . ( but not every order consists of several movements ) . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on OK , all changes of the settings ( also applied to the other card tickets ) and t@@ sm@@ t becomes a symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to show the program window . &quot;
&quot; if the sound@@ system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the map audio . see also . &quot;
&quot; here are only text messages listed and managed . issues of Screen Re@@ a@@ vers , warnings and messages are not displayed . further information on the news types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; can be found here . &quot;
&quot; choose here the type of audio files . if a component can not be selected , it was re@@ produced , either without support for the appropriate audio module or &amp; kt@@ ops ; can not load the necessary libraries . &quot;
&quot; if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is to be used for the audio output , select the audio output . if no output Mod@@ ules are displayed in the list , you have to install at least one module . please click here the PC@@ M device . &quot;
&quot; Set the talk speed here . 50@@ nbsp ; % equivalent to approximately half and 200@@ nbsp ; % about the double normal inter@@ speed . hence , these settings must be implemented so@@ x . &quot;
click App@@ lic@@ ting to take advantage of the new settings for the current &amp; time system ;
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you need to find out which device works with you . in doubt you choose standard .
&quot; on this map , you can set special promotions that will always be executed when the text is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &quot;
&quot; the output of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ ders has the highest priority . it will be raised to all other orders and hold these orders . after the output of the Screen Reader , the cont@@ ended orders will be re@@ sum@@ ed . &quot;
warnings have priority . this stage is important news as &amp; eg ; processor will never be reserved . a warning keeps the output of news and normal text . these orders will continue after reading the warning again .
&quot; News have the next priority . a message inter@@ rup@@ ts normal text . &amp; km@@ outh ; is an example of an application that speaks news . if you &amp; eg ; just a long text on a website can be read , you can go with &amp; km@@ outh ; yet to have someone who just got the room . &quot;
&quot; a text message is interrupted by a message , warning or output of a Screen Re@@ aders , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audi@@ ences into the queue . &quot;
&quot; this audio file will always be played when a normal text will be interrupted . if both intro@@ duc@@ tory sound as well as intro@@ duc@@ tory message are active , the intro@@ duc@@ tory sound is played before the intro@@ duc@@ tory message . &quot;
&quot; the settings on this map are only valid for normal text messages . for news , warnings and issues of Screen Re@@ a@@ dern there are no special promotions when this is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &quot;
&quot; to be able to read with &amp; rect@@ ts ; K@@ not@@ s news , start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and click not@@ ifications . the card @-@ card not@@ ifications appears . &quot;
tick this p@@ ud@@ dle to read the reading of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ not@@ ifications are not marked ; the other settings are de@@ activated and pun@@ ts ; do not read al@@ erts .
&quot; if this setting is marked , messages be re@@ ass@@ essed with which a sound is played , by &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to add events to the list or delete it . if you click on the button , a dialog appears in which you can select the application and the event you want to list . &quot;
&quot; this event will read the message before , the &amp; con@@ vers@@ ation ; sent when somebody mentioned in a IR@@ C message to your nickname . &quot;
&quot; all events , for which in the list is nothing else stated , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts ; ignored . &quot;

&quot; the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to mark text for a voice @-@ issue . this standard includes marks for the control of voices , the talk @-@ speed , the volume of the voice and the pitch . &quot;
&quot; currently , SS@@ ML is only partly and only in the basic functions . the following restrictions are available : &quot;
you must install the Rab _ di@@ phone Voice ( brit@@ ish male ) because this is the default voice which is the festival in the output of SS@@ ML .
&quot; if the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration is not set to 100@@ nbsp ; % dis@@ continued , SS@@ ML text is usually very mon@@ oton@@ ous . &quot;

&quot; there are two kinds of filters - normal filters and stat@@ utes identi@@ fying filter ( SD@@ B filter ) . S@@ B@@ Ds under@@ divide text into individual sets . thus , you can also read through the first set of orders - or return or break down , even if the voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers do not directly support this . &quot;
&quot; here you can see the stat@@ ute cross @-@ border filter . at the first start of &amp; time , it is automatically set up as a pro@@ positi@@ onal con@@ formity filter . you can change its settings or add additional stat@@ ute data , but it will be dis@@ cour@@ aged . &quot;
&quot; at the sim@@ pl@@ est you can learn to read the installation selection by selecting and give text to read . check the speaking selection of the speaker , change some features and check out how the selection of the talk have changed . to do this , you need to have more than one spokes@@ man otherwise , otherwise the filter is un@@ effective . &quot;
&quot; then faster with the reading can start , as only the first sentence has to be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long &quot;
&quot; you can then hold text messages on the cardboard card orders or break down , even if the voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers do not support this function . &quot;
&quot; for these reasons the normal stat@@ ute document is automatically set up , when you start using kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be swit@@ ched off only . change anything about this filter , unless you know what you are doing . &quot;
stat@@ utes filter compare text with a regular expression for pro@@ positi@@ onal and add a tab@@ ulation ( dec@@ imal code 8 ) to the stat@@ utes . note that the standard stat@@ utes will be automatically removed from the text ) . note that the standard stat@@ utes in@@ calcul@@ ator will be ret@@ ained .
&quot; S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( knot@@ s ) , warnings , messages or output of Screen function . &quot;
if you are coming out of Ver@@ see the normal stat@@ ute cross @-@ identi@@ fier filters you can insert this again by using the file standard _ sb@@ dr@@ c file .
&quot; on the map selection , you can write the phone settings for the application . the card card is displayed when &quot;
use of the default speaker ( the top on the map speaker ) . in other words : there are no inter@@ rup@@ tions .
&quot; if you are not able to delete or edit the settings of an expert talk . if you are unable to delete or edit the settings of the Spe@@ aker , sel@@ ects &amp; kt@@ ts ; these speakers ; otherwise the speaker are chosen ; the speaker is the most originally introduced . &quot;
&quot; select the method for entering the desired inter@@ viewer , by clicking on one of the selection buttons . &quot;
&quot; select the properties of the desired speakers here . if this property does not play a role , there is nothing . &quot;
tick this p@@ kreu@@ z when the property should have priority against other properties . you can also place several mark@@ ings here .
&quot; since the language is a critical factor when it comes to the issue , it will always be treated as prescribed character . the only case , where you may want to specify the attribute language , if you know that a particular application text is listed in a different language as the work in the working environment . &quot;
&quot; to use all the properties in the speaker , which corresponds to the bottom to the following , click on the drop@@ down button and then use it on speaker , which is the most viewed . &quot;
in this case 0 is for the last text update in queue . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number is the input 0 required ) .
&quot; applied immediately when it is started . I have de@@ bug @-@ support , but I do not get any re@@ trac@@ eable . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is crashed and , yet it was finished . probably you have to register G@@ spre@@ ader . at G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x is the command G@@ ST @-@ register @-@ 0.8 . if the problem is not solved , it may not be a compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer or un@@ install it . &quot;
&quot; the audi@@ ences via AL@@ SA does not work when I stop playing music at the same time . when I stop a text message , fri@@ ert &amp; kt@@ ts ; one . on the &amp; Con@@ sole ; a message that says : un@@ able to open PC@@ M . &quot;
&quot; on your system , the problem is that conflicts with AL@@ SA can prevent the simultaneous opening of several PC@@ M devices . notes for possible solutions can be found on the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) under www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ project@@ .org . &quot;
I have loaded an extra voice for the festival from the internet . I have it installed and can use them in Festival but kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr does not show this voice .
&quot; add the new voice in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / festiv@@ al@@ int / voices , please send the other entries . if this is successful , please send a patch together with the &amp; URL ; that you have found the voice to the developer . &quot;
&quot; on the map material , there is a setting speed . so that this works , the program must be installed so@@ x and install the ambient variable P@@ AT@@ H function . some syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ er@@ module works such as Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed . depending on the chosen voice this is active or in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; the settings for the talk speed will be ignored if &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; pre@@ reads ( this is about own tags , by which the speed is controlled . ) De@@ activate either the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; according to &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are quite cour@@ ageous , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; and set the talk speed . &quot;
&quot; I do not create that web pages with a female voice can be read , I have set up a female festival or@@ ator , but it reads the web pages with a male voice . &quot;
&quot; at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the day S@@ able GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . thus , there are no mistakes produced , the x@@ s@@ l file re@@ jects the converting of SS@@ ML to S@@ aber the GEN@@ DER tags . the same applies to VO@@ ICE tags . &quot;
I have added a dedicated string filter and now I can register in &amp; kt@@ ts ; can no longer work on - or return . on the Kart@@ ei@@ re@@ iter orders will be displayed , the order del@@ e only from one sentence . what am I doing wrong ? &quot;
&quot; press release ( point , question mark , Com@@ ma and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) you must not filter out . use this sign as a filter for stat@@ utes . &quot;
al@@ sa ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; Sound Architecture ) . Al@@ sa is installed on most systems with &amp; Linux ; already installed . ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ project@@ .org )
G@@ Stre@@ amer in the version 0.@@ 8.7 or later . note : make sure that the modules are registered for G@@ Stre@@ amer by calling G@@ spre@@ ader in &amp; kt@@ ts ; the command G@@ ST @-@ register . ( http : / / g@@ stre@@ amer@@ .@@ fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org )
&quot; some users are experienced in connection with AL@@ SA conflicts with the audio issue . if your system also counts , you can not simultaneously play music and start a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; fri@@ ert a text assignment and then start a further . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) . &quot;
&quot; with Stand of July 2005 a@@ Ko@@ de still does not support real p@@ auses . if you have a text assignment in &amp; time , the current proposition is still pre@@ read . &quot;
the audio program so@@ x is used for the general setting of the talk speed is otherwise not mandatory . Debian user may so@@ x install with the command ap@@ t @-@ get install so@@ x . the program is already included on most &amp; Linux ;

&quot; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4 , the module &amp; arts ; probably removed or at least just created on request . &quot;
&quot; the following modules for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers are created by default , some of them have a running time @-@ dependent of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free according to the guidelines of the Debian distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; if required , this folder is not installed in the ambient variable $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS , you need to specify a --@@ pre@@ fix = target . for example &quot;
&quot; Debian @-@ systems is / usr / local of the right folder for programs , which are translated from sources . &quot;

&quot; before you &amp; kt@@ ts ; use , check whether your language syn@@ thesizer works properly . follow the instructions that you have received with the syn@@ thesizer . &quot;
&quot; the Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS @-@ syn@@ thesizer , whose source code is generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported . with many voices you can adjust volume , talk @-@ speed and pitch with &amp; kt@@ ts ; adjust . &quot;
you need to install at least one language . help to get in the instructions provided with the festival . would you like to read Web sites you need to install the ( male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone .
&quot; for these voices you need to comp@@ ile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on the transmission . &quot;
this voice continues Festival 1.@@ 95 beta or later . the voice is still in an early stage of development . extract the software in the festival / lib / voices / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you enter the Russian voices you need to enter the votes MS@@ U _ ru _ n@@ sh _ di@@ phone . choose a Cyr@@ illi@@ an ( 8 @-@ bit ) co@@ ding like KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux ; distri@@ butions available . are you looking for the festival as a first to the CDs of your distribution .
&quot; if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the code must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the option must be set to an 8 @-@ bit Cyr@@ illi@@ c such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
the Festival can be used together with the &amp; M@@ BR@@ OL@@ A ; for syn@@ thesizer there is the l@@ ex@@ ical analysis and the M@@ BR@@ OL@@ A ; it creates the audio version . the &amp; M@@ BR@@ OL@@ A ; -@@ Sche@@ dule and the &amp; M@@ BR@@ OL@@ A ; votes can be downloaded from
note that &amp; M@@ BR@@ OL@@ A ; no complete language system is generated . &amp; M@@ BR@@ OL@@ A ; generate additional software to create these di@@ phone . festival generates this by &amp; M@@ BR@@ OL@@ A ; needed Di@@ ph@@ one@@ . you can also create from German texts Di@@ phone . further information can be found here .
&quot; in this procedure , additional W@@ rap@@ per Code is added to the festival , to use &amp; M@@ BR@@ OL@@ A ; -@@ votes to voice synthesis , but in the folder festival / lib / . instructions can be found here . &quot;
&quot; IM@@ S German Festival is a revised version of Festival for German &amp; M@@ BR@@ OL@@ A ; vote is either the festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first , you will install the Festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . &quot;
directions can be found in the file RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E in the package that you have downloaded . ( for use with Festival 2.0 is the deposit of the dys@@ functions not required to you just need Festival re@@ translate ) . add the following lines to the file festival / lib / sit@@ ein@@ it@@ .@@ sc@@ m .

&quot; this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf , a module for the &amp; k@@ monitor center ; which enables the administration of the network interfaces , the rout@@ ing and the DNS settings . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ monitor center ; allows the user to manage a range of system and des@@ kt@@ op@@ settings via a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by choice of K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; &quot;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way . the areas of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf : create the areas of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple surface for the following tasks :
after installation a new module network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; displayed . the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network network settings in &amp; k@@ menu .
&quot; it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf , network hardware is not able to install . physical devices and their drivers have to be installed , and configured , thus &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf , the device is enabled and the setting of the network properties . &quot;
&quot; in most cases , drivers will be installed for the network hardware and other devices in installing &amp; Linux ; with installed and set up . network equipment later , the driver must be loaded by adap@@ ting files according to the core version , are loaded : &quot;
&quot; the module network settings is loaded , when the option is selected for network settings in the &amp; k@@ monitor center ; index is selected . when starting the module settings , this is the used platform to automatically detect the system on the system . &quot;
&quot; if the platform cannot be recognized , the selected selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to select the distribution and the rel@@ eas@@ ur@@ ring . by selecting the setting non @-@ again questions the definition of the network settings will then be taken permanently . next start of the network settings , this selection will be automatically default . &quot;
&quot; changing the network settings is possible only in system control mode . previously , all of the options are grey , which means , the settings can only be considered , the change is not possible . in the system of control mode by clicking on the lower bottom of the module . it is the input of the password required . &quot;
the entire functionality of the module is available in the system &apos;s system mode . it is divided into three riders :
&quot; the tab interfaces is used for the administration of the system devices of the system . all available network equipment are displayed . from the tab interfaces , the following tasks can be performed : &quot;
the settings of this network can be set by selecting the desired device in the list and click on the button and click on the dialog device ... in the dialog device .
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click of the button &quot; Advanced Settings &quot; , &quot; shows the dialog with further possibilities . &quot;
&quot; with the selection Autom@@ atically , the TCP / IP settings are done by a D@@ HC@@ P server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode the TCP / IP data is required for the system at the same time with the launch of system services . the D@@ H@@ CP@@ - or BO@@ O@@ TP server will be required . in the drop@@ down list , either D@@ HC@@ P or BO@@ O@@ TP can be selected according to the system . &quot;
&quot; with the selection Manu@@ ally , without D@@ HC@@ P or BO@@ O@@ TP , the TCP / IP address must be specified . in the input field &apos;s IP address , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is marked , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface on the bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated . &quot;
the values in this dialog are shown as the characteristics of the device in the device .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping into the &amp; console ; you can find whether the requested address is already in use . in doubt the network administrator should be asked .
&quot; network equipment can be activated or swit@@ ched off , depending on the needs of the list and click on the interface and click on the interface and click on the interface . &quot;
&quot; network equipment can be activated or swit@@ ched on , depending on the need . off of a activated network device is carried out by selecting from the list and click on interface . &quot;
sets the IP @-@ address of the computer in the local sub@@ net which convey@@ s the physical connection to remote networks and is used as standard for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ network .
&quot; if the computer is available more than a network interface , the interface is to be selected on the net , where the gateway computer is selected . &quot;
&quot; a computer with DNS support re@@ places a complete domain letter by the appropriate IP address . this is necessary because computer can only understand IP addresses . if the machine is available http : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS releases this name into an IP address such as 12@@ 3.4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.90 . &quot;
&quot; the computer solution to the nam@@ ing solution is a simple management of this list . entries can be added , removed or altered wer@@ den@@ .@@ DNS entries can be ordered by selecting a contract , or drop @-@ up in the list with the buttons , or down in the priority . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on the button , add ... from the group computer to the nam@@ ing solution can be added to a DNS server . it will be shown in the dialog &apos;s New Nam@@ eser@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click on the button Add . the entry then will be inserted in the list . &quot;
&quot; from the group computer to the name resolution , select an entry and then click on the button &quot; &quot; Edit ... It will be shown to the dialog . &quot;
&quot; the list renowned calcul@@ ator describes the b@@ illing address on the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used during bo@@ oting , if no DNS servers are available . in small , remote networks it can replace DNS servers . &quot;
&quot; normally , the list contains well @-@ known machines to support some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses support . these are still being used in the test version of IP . &quot;
enter the IP @-@ address of the well @-@ known calcul@@ ator and click to add .... The dialogue New Ali@@ as will be displayed .
&quot; enter the name of the known computer , and add the button adding . if the well known computer has multiple ali@@ ases that press release several times and enter the other ali@@ ases . &quot;
select an entry of a well @-@ known calcul@@ ator from the list and select editing .... The dialogue of acquain@@ t@@ ances will be processed .
&quot; it can be done one of the following tasks , then by clicking OK , the list of static hosts is updated . &quot;
&quot; the settings made in network settings are not immediately effective in the system to enable the changes , must be set in a &amp; console ; the following command must be cancelled . &quot;
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is http : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source text . &quot;
for the installation of binary distri@@ butions ( mostly rpm packages ) is enough if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t installed .
the installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
&quot; alternatively , a tool can be used with graphical interface like a package or the installation tool for its distribution . &quot;
&quot; for this case the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; not , but in addition , the development packages are required with libraries and other things . &quot;
&quot; this is only recommended to experienced users . however , it is not difficult to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf . the following commands should do this . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic power technology is given , in the second will all be discussed by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf . &quot;
&quot; this area can not replace further knowledge about IP networks . in this Anne@@ x , only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small ( home network ) network can be convey@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; currently , IP @-@ networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found great spread . &quot;
&quot; one of the most important information is aware of which IP @-@ address of a network interface is to be al@@ located . in foreign networks , am &amp; eg ; workplace is the response administrator that can be used as a valid IP address or if available , D@@ HC@@ P can not be chosen any number ! &quot;
&quot; when setting up a small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from one specifically for this purpose in order to avoid IP address cont@@ acting with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwar@@ ded , so that any use is possible . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be made by setting up a gat@@ ew@@ ays . &quot;
&quot; for smaller networks mostly addresses are used in the field of 19@@ 2.16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the range is large enough for networks up to 250 computers , large enough . &quot;
&quot; additionally , the net mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so all the hosts are in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for particular things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second line @-@ back @-@ address ( loc@@ al@@ host = of your own machine ) . &quot;
&quot; the network @-@ address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine . usually , the address is assigned to the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 , such as lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle . &quot;
&quot; in this section there are the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf , and where they are stored in the different distri@@ butions . &quot;
&quot; this file is sometimes altered in DSL , so that it is not surprised if in the case of active DSL compounds there is a different content to find there . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; Su@@ SE , it is known that this file will be sorted using the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another stand as expected can therefore occur . &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; is a sig@@ hting of band@@ works on the basis of tar . it offers the opportunity to save several archives on a band . the first target was to answer a question which is provided by d@@ ds@@ 2@@ tar for quick , sel@@ ective trig@@ gering . the second goal was to answer a question which my wife asked : how much longer takes it when you secure ? &quot;
&quot; before a tape can be used , it must be part of &amp; k@@ dat ; it can happen in three types : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; sp@@ ult the band back and reads the pre@@ cl@@ amping information of the belt . det@@ ects &amp; k@@ dated ; the pre@@ h@@ ann is not on the band , you will be asked whether the tape should be form@@ att@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; recogni@@ zes &amp; k@@ dat ; the pioneer , it searches for the suitable index on your record . can this not be found , you will be asked whether the band index is new to be created . &quot;
&quot; everything has gone smooth , changes the symbol of the band@@ width to show that the band is integrated . in the status bar , the contents of the belt can now be sear@@ ched through the selection of the entry for the band . &quot;
&quot; prior to the throw of the belt , first the integration must be solved . there are three methods to achieve this . &quot;
&amp; k@@ dat ; returns through a change in the symbol for the band that the integration of the band was solved and shows an appropriate message in the status bar . the band can now be ej@@ ected without any danger .
&quot; before a volume of &amp; k@@ dat ; can be used , it must be form@@ att@@ ed by &amp; k@@ dat . &quot;
&quot; a band @-@ types must be form@@ att@@ ed before you can use the form@@ att@@ ing of data . this process is not to be form@@ att@@ ed with the form@@ att@@ ing of &amp; k@@ dat ; this process is not to be form@@ att@@ ed before using the band from &amp; k@@ dat . flo@@ ppy drives , it is usually not going to form@@ att@@ ing a form@@ att@@ ing of the belt , DAT drives , on the other hand . &quot;
after entering the band@@ name and capacity drives &amp; k@@ dat ; with the form@@ att@@ ing of the belt . all data on the band go lost ! after the end of the form@@ att@@ ing process the band is automatically integrated and is ready to use .
&quot; before you encounter the backup process , you need to select the most secure files . this can happen in three types : &quot;
&quot; select a file or folder in the local file tree , only this file or folder . &quot;
select a backup profile in the tree . it is only stored in the profile specified in the profile .
select files in the local file tree with a bun@@ ny . only the so selected files and / or sub@@ folder are backed up .
right click on the local file tree and choose in the menu Sh@@ echem ...
&quot; once the backup was initiated , the dialog settings opens up . in this dialog , you can check the selected files and change the settings for the backup . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings , the dialogue will appear . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time . &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it is only checked the selected file or the folder .
mark the files in one of the archives in the entry for the band with a bun@@ ny . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders checked .
click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and choose the menu check ....
&quot; once the test process was started , the dialogue will appear for checking . in this dialog , you can once again check your selection and change the work folder for the review . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for checking , the dialog appears . this dialog shows the progress of the test process as well as the dat@@ as@@ ps and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; before you can restore the re@@ produce , the files that are to be re@@ produced , this can be displayed on two types : &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the entry for the band@@ engine . it will be restored only the selected file or sub@@ folder .
mark the desired files from one of the archives with a bun@@ ks . only those selected files and / or sub@@ folder are re@@ produced .
right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and choose to restore in the menu ....
&quot; once the re @-@ date process has started , the dialogue will appear for recovery . in this dialog , you can once again check your selection and change the work folder for restoration . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for rest@@ oring , dialogue will appear re@@ produce . this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data transfer and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , it proves to be a necessary to create the band@@ inde@@ file based on the band &apos;s content . this process er@@ ases all existing index files for this band . you can create the index on two types of tape : &quot;
here is a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
the current working folder in which the backup is to be carried out . the list of in@@ sured files will be automatically updated according to the folder folders automatically .
&quot; for all folders , which are listed under control files , is that only those files are stored on the same files@@ ystem , as the folder . folder , which are stored on other file systems , you can add separately under certain files . each entry is ir@@ respective of tar regardless of the other . &quot;
&quot; perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used since the last incre@@ mental backup . it will only be the files that have since changed . &quot;
&quot; the name of the file , which is used to capture changes since the last incre@@ mental backup . &quot;
delete the snapshot file in front of the call of tar . this means that all files are assured and a new snapshot file for the next backup is created .
the functionality of buttons files &amp; gt ; and lt ; and lt ; files at the time of the creation of this documentation is not yet implemented .
the settings can be set via the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the menu settings . the following settings can be done :
the complete path to the device driver ( normally / dev / T@@ ape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ a@@ erial version of the band .
&quot; if this setting is active , transm@@ uted &amp; k@@ dat ; before the band is involved , the command will be loaded to the drive . at some drives , this is necessary before reading or writing operations . &quot;
&quot; is the option enabled , try &amp; k@@ dat ; the re@@ design is un@@ locking in the band@@ width . maybe this setting does not work with all the band@@ ages . &quot;
&quot; the option is enabled , when solving the integration of &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically the band is ej@@ ected . use this option not with fl@@ ppy Stream@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; is the option enabled , tries to change &amp; k@@ dat ; the hard@@ war@@ es@@ ed block size for the band &apos;s drive . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you must provide &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the block@@ ing size for your band works . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ dat : a band form@@ att@@ ed , it writes a file to the beginning of the belt . this file should only indicate a memory block on the tape . the content of the file sets up as follows : &quot;
&quot; ( by@@ te ) The band @-@ ID . the format of this string is b@@ ass@@ name : seconds , where calcul@@ ator of the complete name of the system has been form@@ att@@ ed . seconds is the number of seconds that has passed since the period was form@@ att@@ ed . &quot;
the band @-@ ID is used to use a file named $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat file .
the remaining files on the band are pure tar archives that can be directly administ@@ ered directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as it is not about incre@@ mental f@@ uses .
check the content of a sig@@ hting . this symbol is only active when a band is involved .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer viewer is suitable for un@@ experienced users . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users or where the system allows you to get information about your system or where the system allows easy access to the example of information about problems that appear on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps to understand what your computer is in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simpli@@ fied representation of the protocol @-@ files of your own system . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who cannot know where you can get information about your system or where the system returns the different protocol files .
&quot; in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users will provide quick access to information about problems that may appear on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; attempts to provide some more advanced functions , with which help the protocol @-@ files of certain programs can be fil@@ tered and analy@@ sed . &quot;
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has a number of useful functions . these include :
&quot; support for many different types of log files , for the format of the sys@@ log server and for Sam@@ ba . &quot;
many other functions are also included and will be explained in the further chapters of this hand@@ book .
&quot; as you can see in the following screen shot , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions available to enable the individual protocol lines of a protocol file easily fil@@ tered and sort . the individual options for s@@ orting and filter@@ ing are shown in the next chapter of this hand@@ book . &quot;
&quot; after the start tries &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first the most important protocol file of the system - system protocol , so you will not have a small message window , so you will not have a system folder . the protocol files can usually be found in the folder / var / log , for the normal users normally do not have author@@ ization to read . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filter@@ bar , in order to filter a string line in the filter box . the list of the log @-@ lines will now automatically be displayed , so that only protocols are displayed in default settings . in the default column contains the drop@@ down menu next to the filter . then a protocol line will only be displayed when in one of the columns the string of the filter is included . &quot;
&quot; you can also select a different entry on this site . select the column process in which you select the column process . select the column process , and carry out the name of a process so shows you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all protocol lines that have been sent or created by this process . &quot;
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to see the important protocol lines . protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a show@@ y color as a protocol lines of level note . the colored representation of protocol lines can be swit@@ ched off dialog .
&quot; if you just want to see certain process ( for example in the system protocol or in cr@@ on protocol ) , so you can test the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process . this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case you can use Filter@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can jump the option to create new lines in the context menu of the main window , to display all new additions lines . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows to use multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ windows . to open this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open additional sub @-@ window and manage . once you have selected a sub@@ window , choose a protocol on display . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website at http : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ soft@@ war@@ e.@@ org. There will be more recent information about the source of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; can also be found in the following folder of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion Arch@@ iv@@ s : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; archive
welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor but also known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; k@@ sys@@ v ; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sys@@ v ;
&quot; the system V In@@ it rapidly develops to the standard for controlling the program startup , while using the system in the &amp; Linux ; the world . and therefore , because it is easier to use , powerful and the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD In@@ it . &quot;
I will not go here further on historical aspects ( e.g. because I know nothing about it : - ) .
&quot; the In@@ it @-@ bin@@ aries is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because someone might try to convert a machine to System V In@@ it , without a re@@ install and re@@ format . the &amp; Linux ; kernel first you must make sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there when there was one . &quot;
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it is also different from the BSD In@@ it that is the configuration files in a sub@@ folder of / etc / etc / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ p. D@@ ort will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and following further folder :
&quot; basically you need a lot of scripts . basically you need a script for any system service , which you want to start using the system or when changing to another run@@ level . system services include such things such as network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc . system services do not include such things such as set@@ serial , which is only once started . such calls are a r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
r@@ c.@@ local should be in turn right under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file even though it does not have a lot of use for it . you can also do a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial port .
the kernel is looking for different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one he finds .
the standard Run@@ level is registered in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . you should see a line like the following :
&quot; at this point you can take a look into the second column and most likely you want to change it , then you can edit / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab by hand and edit the 3 . be very careful when you start using the system , then follow the system by re@@ boot the system and execute the following : &quot;
&quot; but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you are in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you will probably see something like the following : &quot;
you will notice that this folder are not correct in this folder . instead each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d .
how starts and stops in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts are so written that there is an argument like start and stop . you can actually start this script by hand on the command line :
&quot; this would keep the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the one K contains , the script will be called stop using the argument . if it includes a S , the script will start with the argument start . &quot;
&quot; some people want to set up a simple way to set machines for many purposes . I could &amp; eg ; a server Run@@ level have just htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc ; can I also have a user @-@ level level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , Network &amp; etc . &quot;
here you learn the use of &amp; k@@ sys@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sys@@ v ; with a mouse or another po@@ inter is simple to not say tri@@ vial : drag an entry from the range of Avail@@ able system services to one of the six run@@ level to start it on this level ( or to stop ) .
&quot; you can also move the position between Run@@ lev@@ eling or change the position within a level by moving it elsewhere . this is only if the entry is removed from its original Run@@ level ( or its position ) , if it is done only if you draw an entry out of the range of Avail@@ able system services . &quot;
&quot; note : entries will be post@@ pon@@ ed if you want to drag them into a new range , you must explicitly choose cop@@ ying from the menu editing , or from the context menu , even then when the same entry has already existed in the scope of the promotion . &quot;
&quot; the application number of a contract may sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you need to edit the ser@@ um numbers of the surrounding entries before you try again to insert your system service . &quot;
&quot; at present , there is no way to re @-@ restore items that have been thrown into the tr@@ ash . be careful . &quot;
&quot; you can use the tab@@ ulator key to enable the different work@@ spaces ( Avail@@ able system services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the c@@ ursor buttons to make a selection of top or below the previous one . &quot;
&quot; to move an entry to another Run@@ level , move it with cut into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it to the desired Run@@ level with Insert ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to manually change the box number or change the name of a entry manually , press the input key to switch the properties button . use the to@@ l button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to change the changes . &quot;
&quot; because of the danger of the data , all entries in the menu will require a confirmation before they are executed . &quot;
all settings are saved in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ svr@@ c . if it is available to the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ svr@@ c ) . otherwise they are made of &amp; k@@ sys@@ v ; re@@ produced changes to the pres@@ ets are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ rat@@ c .
&quot; I have experim@@ ented with the standard runner , and now the machine will start ste@@ adily . what can I do ? &quot;
enter at LI@@ LO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t linux single and press the input key to launch in individual mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ tra and change the default level at a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
&quot; I have provided some system services with &amp; k@@ sys@@ v ; for execution at Run@@ level X , but they are not executed . &quot;
&quot; if you use &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) , you will need to edit additional files in / etc that are available only in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution . &quot;
&quot; the way , as system services started in these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately does not correspond to the configuration for the propri@@ etary installation programs of these distri@@ butions , but are unfortunately not planning an extension of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you use a different distribution , please check whether all configuration files are available from the respective system service ( and also whether you are in the right directory ) . some services ( like &amp; eg ; Apache or htt@@ p@@ d ) simply quit without a message , if their configuration files are not present or false . &quot;
&quot; the importance of &amp; Linux ; - Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use a different distribution , please send me information about the Run@@ level so that this manual can be added . &quot;
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the user and groups of your system .
&quot; to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; to read .
&quot; after you have made some changes , you must save it . either use the appropriate symbol of the tool@@ bar or entry to the menu file . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ user ; is an easy application . the main window is made up of two cards , the user and the user @-@ groups list . to edit the desired user or the desired group with a double @-@ click on the entry . it appears on the dialog user and group properties . &quot;
&quot; some map cards are shown only if you have extended advanced system settings . only if you are limited card restrictions on which you can make individual settings , if shadow -@@ pass@@ words or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ wd , are installed in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes . &quot;
the map @-@ map is published in case of shadow -@@ pass@@ words or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ wd as used in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes .
this card map appears to be activated only if for at least a built @-@ in files@@ ystem ( Qu@@ ota ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( recogni@@ z@@ able to file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the files@@ ystem ) . here you can change parameters for any user parameters , with the limited liability limitations in KB are : &quot;
these parameters can be adjusted for each files@@ ystem separately . the current files@@ ystem will be selected using the field @-@ system with the help of the field system .
&quot; map groups provide information about the group &apos;s affili@@ ation of the selected user . the default group , to which the user belongs , you will find in the field of primary group . furthermore , users can mark the user in other groups by selecting them in the big field . &quot;
&quot; the dialogue features of the group contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list . &quot;
to add a user or group to add a user from the menu user or group or click on the matching button of the tool@@ bar . editing or delet@@ ing the selected users or the selected group is similar .
&quot; with this module you can install the LI@@ LO Boot@@ manager to remove the boot@@ loader , remove and change the time up to the boats of the standard system , remove the standard system , change operating systems , change , change and more . &quot;
