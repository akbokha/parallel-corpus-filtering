<seg id="389">"the functions normalise the same, automation and contrast from the menu Corrigate Automatic correction will try to make the best of your colors the best. you will have experimenting with these effects, to see which is best in your photo."</seg>
<seg id="390">"normalization: this method is scalding the luminosity values via the entire picture, so the darkest point is black and the brightest point is as bright as possible. this feature is often a magical correction for pictures that are dark or balanced."</seg>
<seg id="391">"the same: this method donated the luminaires of the colors of the selected image, so that the history of the intensor range is the same number of pixels. sometimes it is a very powerful surgery, which means either wonder at one image or destroyed it."</seg>
<seg id="392">"automation: this method maximizes the color range in the red, green and blueprint. you find the dark and bright marshones and adjust the red, green and blueprint on the entire histogrammrange."</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improves the contrast and the luminosity of the RGB values of an image by move the lowest and highest values on the highest possible area and a new cistement of all values in between. this is only visible when chosen pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">"the Weißabby & digifted, is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white-off of a photo."</seg>
<seg id="395">"the white-off correction is somewhat limited because of a color-room with 8-bit per suit. in case you can do so far from the original image, in case you can perform the whiteboard in the raw mode, which will allow you to better decline in the 16-bit mode."</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a Weißabequation algorithm by copyright of Pawel T. Jochym. you will start with the menu item white-out of the image processing.</seg>

<seg id="398">The preview of the Target has a red marker. the Luminous of the Pixels is shown as vertical line in the history.</seg>
<seg id="399">"on the right above, a Histogram is shown that dynamically is changed once you have a parameter. this Histogram is very helpful since you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is shown. the sum is called luminous."</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadow, saturation and Gamma. the shadow adjustment lets you improve the attendance of your photos or also descend dimming. "</seg>
<seg id="401">"using the above controls, you should use the color temperature-pipette. press on this knob and then anywhere in the image in order to use the color temperature of the white cover. in this way the temperature and green value are automatically set."</seg>
<seg id="402">"in addition, you can set the white-off with the list of presets. the following settings are available:"</seg>
<seg id="403">The Transitional Indikator increases the colours if more than a color-channel of the Pixels is overexposed.. you will see the combined result in the white indicator. this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final picture.</seg>
<seg id="404">The buttons made as well and charging exactly this. each setting of the whitish you have put you can save in a text file and reload later.</seg>
<seg id="405">"the button presets apply all the filter values back to their default values and the corresponding neutral country. note that also neutral settings will be a different photo than your original. if you store it, your original image will change."</seg>
<seg id="406">"you can set up the Kodierunstiefe per suit-channel of the beet image. 8-bit code is the widely used JPEG-format, 16-bit coding is better for high-quality images. this coding requires even more record size, PNM, TIFF and DNG to the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG."</seg>

<seg id="408">"another important tool is available in the menu under colors sound corrections. this tool provides an integrated path to adjust to multiple colour canals at the same time. this is helpful if your camera or your scanner always do the same error, and you can always need the same correction. in the manual on the sound corrections you will find more information."</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct vising problems is the tool for gradation that you can find under colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">"the & digifted, tool colour effects provides you with four color effects, a solar cell effect, a velvia filter, a neon effect and a cantonal filter."</seg>

<seg id="481">"unsharpening mask works on the contrast of the edges to look like a picture. indeed it is not a bit, it works rather psychotherapist. you can use it to remove atmospheric haste and it makes a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang."</seg>
<seg id="482">"referrussionist is possibly the best of the three, since it really improves the sharpness. it is a little complicated in its application and has different parameters to adapt."</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitised pictures need a correction of sharpness. this is because of the digitization process needs to be combined with only minimal differences. the same phenomenon can be observed if suit-points are printed on paper. SLR cameras require more downrigation than normal cameras for the private application.</seg>
<seg id="484">At JPEG-images often have been applied to an camera internal sharpness. images in the pipe-format however must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">"some scanner apply an archipelago during the entry of the picture. if you activate this deactivation, you get control of your image."</seg>
<seg id="486">"in some situations you can get usable results by pressing a photo with the sharpening tool. you can call with the menu item Korrigate sharpens."</seg>
<seg id="487">"however, you should deal with careful as the results do not seem very natural: the sharpness increases the edge of the edges, but also reincares the noise. in general, the most suitable technique for sharpening a picture. you can find out more information and a comparison of all techniques to the sharpness."</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crack. the solution to draw a little soft and experiment with the menu item corrigate softener and experiment some with settings. the pre-window on the right side of dialogue will show you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter unsharp masculine is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and the preview can help edit the image. the showcase shows the output of the filters with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius, and the amount. the default values may generate good results and should be tried first. an increase in radius or the amount will enhance the effect. if you create the bumper mask, the noise and the impression of grats in the vicinity of sharp edges."</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius represents a like many pixel to each side of a edge by the filter. high-resolution images allow greater radians. you should therefore increase images of the best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the caught image which is added to the original one that becomes the strength of the sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="494">"the swellas is a break from the maximum RGB value and to apply differential difference. it can be applied to a minimum difference for a edge of the filter. in this way areas, areas with a soft change between the tones of sharpening and therefore avoid flaw in faces, crossroads and water surfaces."</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the unsharp masculine filter. the original image is the (1) and the worked picture (2). unsharp masks was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a sponge = 0.0. "</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digifted; tool refusing a picture by improving the sharpness. it used to use the copyrighted unfolding-filters algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries to undo an image to & quot; refocussed; in which there is better approach than just trying the photo. it uses better results than unsharp masculine. you can start it from the menu by using colors Refokussionist in the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">"in practice the circular design works much better than the Gauß 'sche Faltung. the Gauß' sche Faltung has a very long tail, which is widely affected by the original pixel pixel. the FIR Wiener Inverse the Gauß 'will depend on most cases even greatly from the distant pixel. it causes unwanted results."</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the key parameter for the use of this module. it is the most important parameter for the use of this module. for most pictures the default value should set 1 good results. you can put a higher value when your image should be very unsharp then to Heiligenscha.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help reduce artifacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and the values near 1, & eg; 0,95 and medium. a high value for correlation reduces the sharply effect of the module. "</seg>
<seg id="501">Rauschfilter: an increase in the sound filter can help you reduce artifacts. however, values higher than 0.1 only rarely. if the spacing filter is too low, & eg; 0 is the image quality very poor. a high value is 0.03. a high value the image will be even more polluted. "</seg>
<seg id="502">"Gauß'sche sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauß's sharpness. use this parameter if your unsharpness of Gauß is. in most cases you should use this value to 0, to avoid annoying artifacts. in most cases you should use this value to 0, so you might need to increase the correlation and / oderden sound filter."</seg>
<seg id="503">Note: this value determines the size of transformationsmatrix. an increase in the mattress size can have good results especially if you choose large values for the circular sharpness or the Gauß ''s sharpness. note that the module is very slow if you choose large values for this parameter. in most cases you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">"the storing and charging buttons are used precisely for this purpose. any set of referrussionist parameters you have set, thus can be saved for later and can be loaded."</seg>
<seg id="505">"try to perform all the trimmers, dyes and intensor rections on the picture before using the module before using the module."</seg>
<seg id="506">"otherwise, you should use the module before you change the image and change it. the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible, but the later uncomfortable artifacts left."</seg>
<seg id="507">"if you can read pictures and compress, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image."</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally producing unsharp masks better results than sharpness. this could be caused by the unsharp masking a larger neighborhood as sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="509">"theoretically, the result of the FIR Vienna Filters has to show that it is the optimal lineare filters. practically the result of the FIR Wiener Filters can always be at least as good as the insharpness mask. the FIR Wiener filter is often better at the processing of small details."</seg>

<seg id="520">"directional alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions, while having a value close to 1 only in one direction. if you create a film gritt, or CCD noise will produce a high value of corrupt patterns. JPEG Artefacts will be best at a value near 1."</seg>
<seg id="521">"[0, 500]: this sets the maximum glucose actor over all. p then defines the relative smoothing. put this value to the degree of noise in your image."</seg>
<seg id="522">"[0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, as it is difficult to create the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh's Turbulbs effect, it must be set higher than 3."</seg>

<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) which is used for the filter. large values increase the time of the filters per pixel. the image of the image is moving across the image and the color in it is inserted and hence minor errors. "</seg>
<seg id="536">"sharpness: this value reduces the pixel levels of the filter to the front look at the front of the filter. if it is increased, you may need to change the edges. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter details can no longer be preserved and rushing or lubricate up again."</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the canteen accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong cannot change the whole rushing or noise tips. put it on a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak roaring or JPEG-artefacts without losing the details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminosity of the image. we recommend you to change colour or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process by the details of the screen.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the colour-tolerant of the image. we recommend you either color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process by the details of the screen.</seg>

<seg id="1047">"the difference between two pixel is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:"</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (b 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">"the recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference between the color indicate the predetermined threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 subpixel which can be traced separately and to further subdivision, you can adjust the maximum depth of the record."</seg>

<seg id="1525">"--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments but if you absolutely want to have the absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size, then select this setting."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"the & CD; information that is manually entered or by the program automatically from the freeDB program, are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can hand / used with & kaudiocreator, and the codification program to create the folder and file names as well as the features of the music files."</seg>
<seg id="1527">"in connection with codification programs, there is often a combination of program provisions for the codification and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the coding registers declare the switches for these programs."</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for example, add the & CD; titles to the keywords, if MP3s will be coded with lame, the switch -tt from lame and the title parameter of & kaudiocreator; the results can be seen as follows: '... -tt {...}...'."</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & audiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button-drawing in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">"this is what the freeDB is: a free database, in which person can read the audio CDs, so that all other information can be downloaded into the computer. it is to note that all the other information can be downloaded into the machine: & CD; title, artists, names of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"yes, it should be legal, but I am not attorney. however, no one can prevent that you are encrypted by the & CD; more or less worthless, so that any information can be added to the music nor the music company. all information can be obtained from a Bummel through a & CD; business, physically, or virtual."</seg>

<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of mirrorservers for the online retrieval of & CD; information during exclude on a & CD; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or (usually monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which readings program is used to store pieces from the & CD; in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There is rumours that this is called cdparanoia; those who want to know more precisely in the source code.... it has always been the best choice for reading audio-CD; see it is always necessary that the cdparanoia package has to be installed first if this is not yet happened.</seg>
<seg id="1537">"to save the selected WAV files, the codification and the desired file format will be selected. at the first opening there are predefined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a deserted compression for audio data) can be added on this tab."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The codierer package must be installed from the concerned Linux distribution before the cocoerer can be used. this is also necessary for the pre-defined codification. for more information about codiles are in the chapter Welcher codiles.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a codification can further information about his switches can be obtained through the input of a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a consolenwindow (eg; console). it must be replaced by the name of the installed codification.</seg>
<seg id="1540">"this can have many causes. check the equipment of the device recording of the & CD; / DVD drives, the writing and readers are installed for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, flac & etc;). try to give both programs with a command line in a terminal. that could give an indication of what is wrong."</seg>

<seg id="1545">There must be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be found as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can be found for example with a searchengine since it is not necessary to compile the source files you can always do.</seg>

<seg id="1652">"this is absolutely necessary for synthesizers that are not General-MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI-Map General-MIDI-Events translated into events that understands the synthesizer."</seg>
<seg id="1653">"for example, you can create a MIDI map showing all the events of the type Change patch to Bright Piano in events of the type Change patch to Trumpet and thus always sound a trumpet, if originally a piano should play."</seg>
<seg id="1654">"if you only have a soundcard, you do not need MIDI-Map because all Soundcards GM are compatible (including awe and CIS cards, FM radio devices and so on)."</seg>
<seg id="1655">"unfortunately, there is no programs to create MIDI-maps. so you need to edit the appropriate file of your hand (using your favorite editor)."</seg>
<seg id="1656">"a MIDI-map is a text file, all needed conversions for the play of a piece."</seg>
<seg id="1657">"each section may only appear once except the KEYMAP section, which may be as often as desired. prerequisite for this, however, that every appearance has a different texture (see below)."</seg>

<seg id="1660">"please send me your Map file as e-mail, so that I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support can offer for devices that are not General-MIDI-compliant."</seg>
<seg id="1661">"in this section is specified, such as the patches of General MIDI on your specific keyboard. the general use looks like this:"</seg>
<seg id="1662">"please note that the left side of the equator will be ignored. it is assumed that the GM -patches in the right order lie (from 0 to 127), you may not change the order and no line for one of the 128 instruments."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"the optional AllKeysTo M is used to put all the sounds, which need this instrument to put on the sound with the number M (GM-Patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which is similar to a tissue type. this allows you to carry the following in the PATCHMAP section:"</seg>
<seg id="1664">"so if a MIDI-file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 (Win shot), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"please note that here with the term Drum patch of the patch, in which every sound is a different percussion instrument (drum, pelvis, Maracas & etc;) and not the one, in which the sound means the pitch of the always same drum."</seg>
<seg id="1666">KEYMAP section will be used to specify how sounds on a specific channel or instrument can be pictured.</seg>
<seg id="1667">"as with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as well as their presence. you must therefore create 128 entries."</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several keymaps for each channel and each instrument. you just need to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used mainly to form sounds on the permetic canal. check out as an example the supplied Keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">"this section can be used to form some channels to others. if you want to change the first and second channel, make it quite simply at the CHANNELMAP section."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"however, these settings are useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a certain channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9)."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"Midi devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:"</seg>
<seg id="1673">"n is the channel, which is shown on the channel N. if you use the keymap option, the Keymap does not need to use the name for this channel. the corresponding Keymap does not need to change the patch on this channel. in this case, all events will try to change the patch on this channel. in this case is then always patch x used."</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful for instance to always use the perky patch on the Perkiv channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">"the value for PitchBenderRatio gives to what is multiplied, in which relation Pitch-Bender events will be multiplied with the value, it is calculated with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then only forwarded. the value 4096 is used to do so in the map file (no decimal compressor)."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"this attitude is needed because GM will present that a keyboard, which should play a Pitch-Bender-Event with the value 4096, a sound higher. unfortunately, try to play the correct value on your keyboard, you must try a bit of & kmid."</seg>
<seg id="1677">"to use a MIDI-map, just open the dialog MIDI settings. this can be found in the menu under Settings, point MIDI-settings"</seg>
<seg id="1678">The canoe-view is a window with a whole series of pianos (one for each MIDI-channel). on these pianos you can see which sounds are being played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">"you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain channel. for each channel there is a selection list, where you can choose an instrument, illuminated the knobs not more green but red, to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used."</seg>
<seg id="1680">The canoe-view has (until now) two different views to display the played sounds. the view can choose in the menu Settings under the point KanalView: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">"the speed LCD displays the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed."</seg>
<seg id="1682">"you can change the pace of a song. so if you find for example, a song is too fast to follow the text you can slow it. to change the pace, use the arrows on the left and right of the LCD."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"a MIDI files is a file that contains information about how a piece of music has to be played. it contains the notes, the rhythm, the speed, & etc;."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"good, I can force no one to use, & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while a mp3-file needs a similar sound quality. at a MIDI files you can also change the single instruments, the speed & etc. you have control of everything."</seg>
<seg id="1685">"this can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) by & kmid; because it has been compiled, because & kmid; without awe-support has been compiled, you need to download a source distribution and install it (for example from kmid; 's homepage)"</seg>
<seg id="1686">"I would like to add a whole folder to a collection, but I do not want to add all files individually."</seg>
<seg id="1687">"agree, this is why & kmid; Drag & Drop. open the folder you want to add in & Konqueror;, choose all the files, and drag them onto the & kmid; -windows."</seg>
<seg id="1688">"previously, you necessarily enable the setting of automation to the collection. otherwise the files are added to the temporary collection."</seg>

<seg id="2282">The conduction was very complicated because one of the contributors has made many changes and has been corrected at many places the installation. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result was a lot of conflicts at the meeting.</seg>
<seg id="2283">"the program used by me only showed me the changed lines, but I could not see what exactly has changed within these lines. and there were no indications of the places where the merging of these changes was a small nightmare."</seg>

<seg id="2286">"a function made a lot of work, was the comparisons and merging of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into a full file browser."</seg>
<seg id="2287">"also 3-way together is fully supported. this is useful when two people work independently from each other on one piece of co-operation and changes. the original file (the base) helps you dissolve the result of the correct change. in this editor, you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot displays three Quell files at the merging:"</seg>

<seg id="2942">"in addition, & ksystemlog; experienced users will provide quick access to information about problems that may appear on their server. & ksystemlog; attempts to provide some more advanced functions, with which help the protocol-files of certain programs can be filtered and analysed."</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 has a number of useful functions. these include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">"support for many different types of log files, for the format of the syslog server and for Samba."</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and will be explained in the further chapters of this handbook.</seg>
<seg id="2946">"as you can see in the following screen shot, & ksystemlog; functions available to enable the individual protocol lines of a protocol file easily filtered and sort. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this handbook."</seg>
<seg id="2947">"after the start tries & ksystemlog; first the most important protocol file of the system - system protocol, so you will not have a small message window, so you will not have a system folder. the protocol files can usually be found in the folder / var / log, for the normal users normally do not have authorization to read."</seg>

<seg id="2951">"if you just want to see certain process (for example in the system protocol or in cron protocol), so you can test the process identification (PID) in the column process. this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the Samba server. in this case you can use Filterbar."</seg>

<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor but also known (and in the following also named) as & ksysv; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv;</seg>
<seg id="2957">"the system V Init rapidly develops to the standard for controlling the program startup, while using the system in the & Linux; the world. and therefore, because it is easier to use, powerful and the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD Init."</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go here further on historical aspects (e.g. because I know nothing about it: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">"the Init-binaries is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because someone might try to convert a machine to System V Init, without a reinstall and reformat. the & Linux; kernel first you must make sure that the old Init was removed from there when there was one."</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init is also different from the BSD Init that is the configuration files in a subfolder of / etc / etc / etc. this folder is called rc.p. Dort will find rc.sysinit and following further folder:</seg>
<seg id="2961">"basically you need a lot of scripts. basically you need a script for any system service, which you want to start using the system or when changing to another runlevel. system services include such things such as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc. system services do not include such things such as setserial, which is only once started. such calls are a rc.local."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be in turn right under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file even though it does not have a lot of use for it. you can also do a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel is looking for different places after the program init and starts the first one he finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The standard Runlevel is registered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">"at this point you can take a look into the second column and most likely you want to change it, then you can edit / etc / inittab by hand and edit the 3. be very careful when you start using the system, then follow the system by reboot the system and execute the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how does it start all the right scripts? if you are in rc3.d, then you will probably see something like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that this folder are not correct in this folder. instead each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the directory init.d.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How starts and stops init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts are so written that there is an argument like start and stop. you can actually start this script by hand on the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would keep the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the one K contains, the script will be called stop using the argument. if it includes a S, the script will start with the argument start."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people want to set up a simple way to set machines for many purposes. I could & eg; a server Runlevel have just httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc; can I also have a user-level level, the & eg; & kdm;, Network & etc."</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointer is simple to not say trivial: drag an entry from the range of Available system services to one of the six runlevel to start it on this level (or to stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">"you can also move the position between Runleveling or change the position within a level by moving it elsewhere. this is only if the entry is removed from its original Runlevel (or its position), if it is done only if you draw an entry out of the range of Available system services."</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries will be postponed if you want to drag them into a new range, you must explicitly choose copying from the menu editing, or from the context menu, even then when the same entry has already existed in the scope of the promotion."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the application number of a contract may sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you need to edit the serum numbers of the surrounding entries before you try again to insert your system service."</seg>
<seg id="2976">"at present, there is no way to re-restore items that have been thrown into the trash. be careful."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the tabulator key to enable the different workspaces (Available system services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor buttons to make a selection of top or below the previous one."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"to move an entry to another Runlevel, move it with cut into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it to the desired Runlevel with Insert (with Ctrl; V)."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"in order to manually change the box number or change the name of a entry manually, press the input key to switch the properties button. use the tol button to accept the changes, or press Esc to change the changes."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"because of the danger of the data, all entries in the menu will require a confirmation before they are executed."</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are saved in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. if it is available to the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc). otherwise they are made of & ksysv; reproduced changes to the presets are stored in a local ksyratc.</seg>

<seg id="2983">Enter at LILO -Prompt linux single and press the input key to launch in individual mode. then edit the file / etc / intra and change the default level at a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">"I have provided some system services with & ksysv; for execution at Runlevel X, but they are not executed."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"if you use & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you will need to edit additional files in / etc that are available only in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"the way, as system services started in these distributions, but unfortunately does not correspond to the configuration for the proprietary installation programs of these distributions, but are unfortunately not planning an extension of the program for this approach."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"if you use a different distribution, please check whether all configuration files are available from the respective system service (and also whether you are in the right directory). some services (like & eg; Apache or httpd) simply quit without a message, if their configuration files are not present or false."</seg>
<seg id="2988">"the importance of & Linux; - Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use a different distribution, please send me information about the Runlevel so that this manual can be added."</seg>
