&quot; although I had visited the USA for at least once a year , I would now live there for the first time . &quot;
and that was very exciting for me .
my love of America is extremely big .
&quot; as many of my generation I grew up with American films , I have read American music , American authors have read and run its sport . &quot;
&quot; indeed , this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly due to a American film journalist . &quot;
&quot; when 14 years old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gr@@ ay Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , a fear@@ less rep@@ or@@ ters who d@@ anced with the help of Julia Roberts as a Jura student who had tried his interest in judges who were his interest . &quot;
I was tr@@ apped .
&quot; free to Meth@@ od One , &quot; I was as if that is absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year , which I lived in Arizona , had only strengthened my admir@@ ation for the USA . &quot;
&quot; I always said , &quot; America is the only country where I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting you are always who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of equal people . &quot;
I even had a very fier@@ y love connection about his size .
then Donald Tru@@ mp came .
much was written about x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his as@@ cen@@ sion is for me as he goes with his bott@@ ling .
&quot; he never stops behind the mountain , as one says so beautiful . &quot;
&quot; he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague , and explains publicly his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ American and Women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , people have responded to his statements and tuned for him . &quot;
&quot; the 13 million votes , which he won in the Republi@@ can elections , was the highest number that had ever reached by the party nomin@@ ate candidate . &quot;
I was speech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ otte person I asked me ?
I could not get rid of Tru@@ mp and his voters with people whom I met during my time in Phoenix .
&quot; for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , Director of Journ@@ alists , the people from all over the world takes a deep believing person , with whom I could talk about Islam and his past . &quot;
&quot; ini@@ quity did not agree with Peter Bh@@ atia , the present editor of the &quot; &quot; Cincinnati In@@ quir@@ er &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bh@@ atia and I met our common love for basketball and we spent many hours with it , the &quot; Phoenix Suns &quot; play in the game . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp@@ s intoler@@ ance is also in contrast to the gener@@ osity which I lived in Sandy B@@ ahr , which was fighting for the environment , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like her son . &quot;
&quot; it does not fit her to the commitment of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es , who always helped with lots of patience and grace to me and my colleagues helped us to get used to the complexity of the American life . &quot;
&quot; then there were Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my mentor , whose wise advice has helped me a lot in my career . &quot;
these people and the people they em@@ bo@@ died out of my love for America .
&quot; during the Tru@@ mp its way to the nomin@@ ee presidential race , she offered me a stop and the counter@@ part to its limited vision of America . &quot;
&quot; however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule . &quot;
&quot; on November 8th 2016 there are over 50 million Americans , mostly white , the presi@@ dency of a man , despite - or perhaps precisely because of its contemp@@ t to non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the examination of the idea that people voted for Tru@@ mp , because they were either part of his rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were ready to over@@ look those things , broke me almost the heart . &quot;
perhaps it is unfair to describe the Tru@@ mp voters as R@@ assi@@ sts .
&quot; to arrange people , one of my friends , is exactly what has led to us to this situation . &quot;
this is superf@@ ici@@ ally and respect@@ ful and indicates a in@@ ability to understand those who act in another way and think .
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the h@@ ectic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
&quot; could it be that these voters , of which most white are tuned for Tru@@ mp , because they want to reg@@ ain control of a country that she has disappointed ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , they might want to say that in this America they are still important ? &quot;
maybe .
&quot; however , you hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick who commented the cruel decision to look up a man who look with contemp@@ t for those who look different from him . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; ( An@@ m. and SC . : so much like &quot; E@@ ching of the wh@@ ites against all other eth@@ nic@@ ities &quot; ; p@@ un from white in suits to the wh@@ ites and wh@@ i@@ pl@@ ash as it was the great Van Jones , exactly what America did so magnificent . &quot;
&quot; millions of people across the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality , it is nonetheless a powerful idea - which belief or background you may have always welcome , America is welcome . &quot;
&quot; for this country voted as his president , twice the son of a Ken@@ ian@@ ers , whose history , as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible . &quot;
&quot; with the choice Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s , there is a huge part of the white America this promise to and says : to hell with diversity , religious freedom and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is back at the rod , they say . &quot;
&quot; with all that I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq and what he was on the eve of the election . &quot;
at a manifestation for Hill@@ ary Clinton had Mr. Khan had a mo@@ dest@@ al change with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp , would have my son , Captain hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan . &quot;
&quot; the crowd answered with a &quot; &quot; strong &quot; &quot; no ! &quot;
&quot; could Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; &quot; cre@@ sted the crowd . &quot;
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; answered them .
do you have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; &quot; they called and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot;
&quot; would someone who is not like you , a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a mon@@ y and silent &quot; NE@@ IN &quot; !
&quot; Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; &quot; God is thanks , Mr. Tru@@ mp , is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was correct@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the land , for which his son was fallen , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; that is now Tru@@ mp@@ s Land , said the message . &quot;
&quot; and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could not find a place in this new America . &quot;
and that breaks me my heart .

what did the Mexican music school in the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the Province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ean town Cat@@ e@@ ura together ?
&quot; the music that is played in both places , not only the life of the children has changed but also a very close connection with ... &quot;
music that lives with the waste
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large gar@@ bage dump just 16 Kilomet@@ ers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an ancient colonial city which is very popular among tourists but worlds from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world @-@ famous kitchen .
&quot; for several years now , La b@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( Musik@@ ban@@ de ) has been playing in the municipality : one of children and adults of existing sym@@ ph@@ ony Orchestra , which has found a possibility to overcome the surrounding poverty by their music instruments . &quot;
a music school with 100 students has become the central interest for the municipality of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; the community , which is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico , is known for its drugs abuse and gangs violence . &quot;
but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilots who started a musical project and the youth provided such a wei@@ rd@@ est hop@@ pers .
&quot; the young band@@ members take their obligations towards the music group very seriously , the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI means : &quot;
&quot; once they come from school , go back home and immediately after lunch run it through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion . &quot;
&quot; they always come laugh@@ ing and with sh@@ iny eyes and play in the chest you learn day for day trumpet , trombone , pic@@ colo , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , forest horn , p@@ gos and the Con@@ ga . &quot;
music from Mül@@ l
&quot; more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero playing the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura - a village that is practically on the largest gar@@ bage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paragu@@ ays capital - on instruments that are made of recycl@@ ing waste material : &quot;
&quot; music with re@@ formed instruments made of local firm waste materials , made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ e@@ ura , where the recycl@@ ed under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Chávez began to transform parts of the fall into instruments . &quot;
&quot; im@@ itate violins , viola , har@@ ps , contr@@ ab@@ asses , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trumpets , tromb@@ ones and percussion , all made out of the tr@@ ash . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ish and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article in the Los Angeles Times F@@ avi@@ o Chávez , a local econom@@ ist and musician taught the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura , to the initial time : &quot;
&quot; first , it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ s@@ als and we had no room at the same place where children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact parents , because many of them do not live with their children . &quot;
&quot; this changed as F@@ avi@@ o something that he had never seen before , one out of appl@@ ause . &quot;
&quot; today , there are a whole orchestra which plays out on instruments made of recycl@@ ed material and which is called The recycl@@ ed Orchestra . &quot;
a documentary named &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic gar@@ bage dump ) draws the musical performance on :
the world generated every year approximately one billion tonnes of tr@@ ash .
those who live with him and live from him are the poorest - like the people in Cat@@ e@@ ura . Paraguay .
and here they transform him into something Schön@@ es .
land @-@ fill harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring spect@@ acle out of rub@@ b@@ ish music around the world .
the Orchestra has played his music even before Pope Francis :
these Eastern African countries show how technology and teamwork can successfully fight illegal fishing
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that the wild illegal fishing fought .
&quot; this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published by En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports about international , practic@@ ed solutions for environmental problems . &quot;
re @-@ release happens within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for joint use of content .
&quot; in West @-@ Africa , it was then known that this ship was already engaged in liberal waters illegal fishing , before it was looking for the other coast of Africa . &quot;
the East African countries were raised so far and little gen@@ ei@@ ves to welcome a legislative re@@ bre@@ aker of this kind on their co@@ asts .
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ os , Mozambique and the Seychelles mobil@@ ised rapidly against the ship . they refuse to give him one of their ports and refuse to give him a fishing permit . &quot;
&quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries who were simply denied , Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a leading employee of the Ken@@ yan fisher@@ ies authority . he discovered a part of a team that discovered the ship at the time and followed . &quot;
in 2013 the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : it was not managed to catch fish in there .
&quot; finally , it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars in Liberia , due to lo@@ oting the fish stocks of the country . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , the criminal practices protects and protect resources was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the NR@@ O Stop Il@@ legal F@@ ishing ( Il@@ legal fishing ) . &quot;
the members of this network are adjacent to Somalia and Madagascar the six countries who had sold the prime minister of their waters at that time .
&quot; &quot; so we have eight countries that are equ@@ ated and working together . they exchange information and stand up each other when it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts project En@@ ding Il@@ legal F@@ ishing . this project offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
illegal fishing is by definition un@@ regulated : what is caught is hidden because it is extremely difficult to reduce it because it is illegal fishing as a main cause of over @-@ fisher@@ ies by regions .
&quot; by inten@@ tional dis@@ regard to existing laws , by which certain habitats and species are to be protected , the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems can harm , which have a delicate balance . &quot;
&quot; but while actions against illegal fishing once were imposed by the bureaucr@@ atic barriers and also by the sn@@ ail @-@ emp@@ o , with the information between individual countries , the actions of today is done in real time , with trac@@ eable on F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; there can exchange individual countries with each other such as lists , news about suspic@@ ious activities or details that can be noticed during a port @-@ inspection or experienced . &quot;
fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very attentive when moving these at the open sea by satellite data .
&quot; this allows the authorities to mark ships that are fish in the bot@@ her@@ ed areas . also , there can be so suspic@@ ious rides such as such that hin@@ ts that a ship loads his caught fish on other ships . &quot;
&quot; ideally , such investigations can show whether the ships involved have a fish @-@ scale licence , where they were traveling and possibly whether they have a pen@@ gu@@ age . &quot;
&quot; countries that are opposed to illegal fishing , the adoption of such ships can then be denied by their ports . and that the ships could not sell its charge . and that they could even be forced to numbers of pen@@ alties as in the case of the prime minister . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a significant financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , leading Director of NF@@ DS Africa . the latter is a Advisory company that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
a closed front
&quot; the platform has been created to reg@@ ained valued 20 million USD to the lost sales , which will lose the eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i each year because of the illegal fishermen that penet@@ rate into eastern African waters . &quot;
East @-@ Africa has become one of the most productive t@@ una fish @-@ fish because of the region &apos;s commercial fishing from all over the world . among these also those illegal fishermen .
&quot; among other practices such as actions include the s@@ ails under false flag , counter@@ f@@ eit licens@@ ing , information protected by Phant@@ asi@@ en@@ amen , fish protected species and fish in conservation areas . &quot;
&quot; &quot; they use the lack of international co @-@ operation and make the weaknesses of a non @-@ crow@@ ned control system , &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; previously , a ship could not be illegal and a country could then say &quot; You do not get my port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &quot; &quot; and exactly this legal lo@@ op@@ ath tried to close F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
so far the closed front .
since its foundation F@@ ISH @-@ i was involved in more than 30 investigations of susp@@ ects ships .
it has left crimin@@ als being exposed to spread the fake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several fr@@ aud@@ ul@@ ent ident@@ ities and it has been pro@@ sec@@ uted ships and found refugees .
&quot; due to its co @-@ operation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority for com@@ bating crimes , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information about illegal fishing on large distances and preserved . &quot;
&quot; &quot; some of our studies lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
he builds a system that is to help the F@@ ISH @-@ i @-@ proof ships precise and precise .
photo with friendly permission of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; Fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which will always be further developed , also helps to watch the illegal ships who would like to hide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position , &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chef at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tr@@ acking , an NGO focusing on fishing data and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; some of the ships also turn their automatic identification systems , with which they can no longer be fed by satellite . &quot;
Cop@@ eland helps to build a system that connects different information levels . it should help F@@ ISH @-@ i to help criminal ships with greater precision .
a model program
but F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team can actually influence the fact global problem of illegal fishing ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the NR@@ O Sky@@ Truth , believes that . &quot;
&quot; recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the platform Global F@@ ishing Watch platform : a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed worldwide by using the position of every single trac@@ eable ship worldwide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; together with the neighbors , to get a better picture of what is doing - that &apos;s simply meaning , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; here &apos;s a chance for countries to unite and to b@@ undle their resources to study . &quot;
&quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project to run , where a global system pro@@ sec@@ ures the persecution of ships . &quot;
there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities are not only in@@ crimin@@ als but also as@@ shop@@ pers .
ships which used to be f@@ ished without license and hardly count with consequences they know that they are observed .
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ ISH @-@ i participating countries have now reached a 33 % increase in fisher@@ ies sales , since fishing boats for more licenses . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had helped to hit Gre@@ ko 1 , the insp@@ ectors found there on board tow , whose use is forbidden . &quot;
photo with friendly permission of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; other countries also notice that successes . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we have now also copy other countries &quot; , &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; in West Africa disappear several hundred million dollars annually by illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , six countries joined together in the West Africa Task Force . they are now fighting illegal fishing , according to the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; With safety , the goal is to make even more such initiatives and structures even in other regions , &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member state in Somalia with his first major triumph : in October it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was under wrong flag . and not only the ship was also without a license and were used for bul@@ lets that are now b@@ anned . &quot;
&quot; the ship was also penet@@ rated as bot@@ her@@ ed waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with the accept@@ ing of rules against Gre@@ ko 1 , the strong sign that they go against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time evidence that such a special , collaborative approach to protect the oceans actually works throughout the world sea .

the mot@@ ion@@ ings in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of fier@@ ce demonstrations .
they are regarded as protest against the decision of the government to stop referendum for the referendum of the President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

&quot; after the government in Venezuela , the request of the opposition had refused to referendum on a referendum in whose eyes were the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country into the country where they gathered themselves on the streets . &quot;
under the has@@ ht@@ ag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the return of Venezuela ) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them .
&quot; the debate will also be run in other parts of the country - among other things in the low@@ land area of Bar@@ inas , in the Andes @-@ regions of Mé@@ rida and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , in central to the north @-@ north of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on the Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva Esp@@ arta . &quot;
the political and economic situation of the country continually deteri@@ or@@ ates what makes themselves noticeable in everyday life of the Vene@@ tians by a acute lack of food and medication .
&quot; many representatives of the opposition saw in the am@@ ni@@ es@@ ho@@ oting of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , the chance for a fundamental change ; ultimately , the post@@ ure of a re @-@ election was blocked from the official authorities . &quot;
Marianne D@@ í@@ az , co @-@ acting at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , takes up in its latest articles in the context of the government &apos;s government : &quot;
&quot; in the context of social , political and economic crisis , in which the In@@ fl@@ air and tissues to reach the highest around the world ( the in@@ cision rate is estimated at 500 % of the annual defic@@ ien@@ cies for many as the only way to reg@@ ain his institutional structures and close a new government . &quot;

&quot; on Twitter , images that tell about disp@@ utes , as well as reports of oppression and abuse . &quot;
particularly large waves hit the message about polished oppression in the central city of Marac@@ ay .
&quot; there , the prot@@ esters went back to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves according to their own statement before the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government . &quot;
&quot; hours later they were able to leave the cathedral again , but the protests went further . &quot;
&quot; in other parts of the country , some prot@@ esters are attemp@@ ted to hold the police forces , including those women in the An@@ den@@ im state T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira : &quot;
&quot; the women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira do not bear the skirts , because you might see something that many nation@@ als did not have ! &quot;
meanwhile there is an infection on the lap that forms the scale of oppression per day :
thus the dictatorship has oppressed the country .
many representatives of the government had question@@ ed the validity of the demand for a counter@@ part procedure - this was now proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the road .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Labs :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ d@@ ado claim that 1 % of the signat@@ ures are fake .
here is your am@@ bl@@ es@@ ho@@ oting !
on the road !
&quot; other levels these protests come as a further step in the fight against a government , which has done little against the devast@@ ating economic crisis and would rather be busy to leave critical voices : &quot;
they have taken us so much - but even the fear !
the mar@@ ches take more and more of frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported the media they were to be hungry to participate in a strike rather than to work or shopping .

&quot; this is an adapted version of an interview of Al@@ ejo Gó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qu@@ ij@@ ano , which was released on 23 August 2016 at D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argentin@@ ean site . &quot;
the interview was translated into English and will be published here with friendly permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qu@@ ij@@ ano was forced by his father , the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argentin@@ ean city Córdoba . &quot;
as now an now adult man Qu@@ ij@@ ano said now at the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process in the province of Cordoba against his father .
&quot; in the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were investigated that were committed during the Argentin@@ ean army . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qu@@ ij@@ ano is not looking for his life .
&quot; starting with the burden , the same name as his father to wear up to the brutal Mil@@ ca@@ per@@ ations in the prison of La Per@@ la which he watched at the age of 15 , he suffered enough . &quot;
34 years of life he ret@@ ained the surname for itself .
in the situation at that time I believed that was fine .
I felt like a sal@@ ary .
&quot; as a child with 15 years , one does not notice that one is manip@@ ulated by his father . &quot;
&quot; I could not realise that my father was a th@@ ief , tort@@ ur@@ ers and mur@@ der@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; Luis was no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qu@@ ij@@ ano was G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie@@ be@@ am@@ ter . during the Argentin@@ ean military coup of 1974 to 1983 , a time of state domination , was his father in 1976 to 1978 Deputy Minister of Intelligence in the prison La Per@@ la . &quot;

&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qu@@ ix@@ anos son , a man who saw the scale of atro@@ cities that he had experienced as a boy , and he said before a federal court toward his own father . &quot;
his story shows that great power has a parent to his child and like this child chose a path of rede@@ mption .
from the gym to the military base
&quot; when my father began to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I was with a boy who made martial arts . &quot;
all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ white photo and called me to identify my friend to this .
he said :

&quot; therefore , he provided me to go back into the sports hall . several days later he took me to work on the military base . &quot;
&quot; he told me , I would be hearing . &quot;
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be ok . for so my father had raised me .
on the military base I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners .
&quot; these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , prop@@ ag@@ and@@ am@@ material , books , just everything . &quot;

&apos;@@ da over@@ practice the prisoners are tort@@ ured .
&quot; my father took me four times to La Per@@ la , with everything in 1976 . &quot;
&quot; during the first time and during the last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car . &quot;
&quot; when he took me the second time he commanded me to rise . he led me to a bar@@ racks , in the cars , furniture , TV , refriger@@ ators - simply everything possible - were standing . &quot;
everything that was stolen .
&quot; he gave me a little wr@@ apped packages , and commanded me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a great cl@@ ump of silver . &quot;
&quot; on this day I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks , where the stolen objects were removed and kept me with an wax . &quot;
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
&quot; so , the prisoners are tort@@ ured . &quot;
I sp@@ illed and saw a couch that were tort@@ ured on the human being .
it looked like a br@@ acket and metal @-@ feathers .
later I found out that they attached to the end of a cable . the other end was fixed at the body of the person who was exactly there .
&quot; they f@@ rarely a person with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to bed , over@@ s him with water and h@@ unted him a cargo of 220 vol@@ ts in the gen@@ itals . &quot;

the sten@@ ch was there in place ... like a dirty v@@ del .
&quot; years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room . &quot;
I realized the smell back immediately and I became clear that it is the smell of a body in need .
I could never forget this smell .
&quot; and I asked me , how is it possible to make a man to another so much suffering ? &quot;
I knew that these people were killed
&quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were fil@@ med with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and were carried on and eyel@@ ids . &quot;
&quot; he spoke to &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilians who was also charged in the trial ) and I used the opportunity to take a look at La cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
in the background I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people with the face down - all were in hands and feet fil@@ med .
close to the entrance of the entrance to the matt@@ resses .
&quot; when my father noted that I saw to the prisoners , he said , &quot; What gu@@ ck@@ est thou so , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot;
I escap@@ ed &quot; Why have you brought me ? &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were cast into a pit and were killed and buried by soldiers .
I know that because my father told me about it .
&quot; beside La cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms , which were referred to as office . &quot;
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero took a man there and killed .
&quot; ( according to the survi@@ v@@ ors of the civil ist Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also charged at La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process , the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina on death ) . &quot;
&quot; in the following video , Emi@@ lio F@@ essi@@ a , the manager of the memorial La Per@@ la , through the former tort@@ ur@@ ges . &quot;
&quot; the way to which you come here are also the way , on which the duck came here . &quot;
&quot; if you look at the map , take a look at that they took about this road and then tort@@ ured for the first time . &quot;
here their names were changed and they were assigned as part of the process of deh@@ um@@ an@@ isation .
&quot; when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the arrangement of the top came that they should be moved . &quot;
&quot; this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the sho@@ ots of men and the dis@@ appearance of their corp@@ ses in most cases . &quot;
the &apos; war@@ fare &apos;
my father brought all sorts of stolen things with home .
at that time at the age I had no idea what the &quot; war@@ fare &quot; - how they called it - was .
&quot; but when I was later on the military , I was in the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie - I realized that war was a b@@ aj@@ on@@ ett , or perhaps military signs that one takes up to an enemy that you fought against . &quot;

&quot; but if you go into a house and the fridge , the turn@@ table , clothes , paintings , money ... , then there is no war , but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
this is theft .
&quot; I always asked myself how my father , the head of security forces , with this v@@ and@@ alism could participate . &quot;
I simply understand it .
&quot; I was also officers in the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter into a house , and to ste@@ al everything in it . &quot;
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do this .
&quot; once he called me an crimin@@ als and I rep@@ lied , and thou that you were on the road on the street ? &quot;
you are not a crimin@@ als ?
&quot; he explo@@ ded before W@@ ut , beat me and cried : &quot;
&quot; if you go so far , then I will find you and kill you . &quot;
&quot; therefore , we no one need others ! &quot;
so was my father .
I have no only good memory of him .
&quot; when I said in the trial , I showed a photo of that time , where I was a jacket and a wheelchair pul@@ lover from wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he still brought clothes to home . &quot;
&quot; at that time I accused the defense , a co @-@ gru@@ m@@ ful of this crime . I conqu@@ ered , no problem ; they can lay me a burden on what they wanted . &quot;
I was anyway there to pre@@ dict .
&apos;@@ The tight@@ ening of the corp@@ se is the last ab@@ omin@@ able act &apos;
&quot; now , where I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
&quot; I have children . if you first have children , one sees the value of a life . &quot;
it develops and recognis@@ es that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
&quot; well , you have so far away during the dictatorship of the dictatorship . but why do the corp@@ ses disappear ? &quot;
why children ab@@ ide ?
&quot; one day my father brought a girl with his home , whose mother was killed . &quot;
&quot; it was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl . &quot;
&quot; I always asked me the question : they were tort@@ ured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
they could just have put them into prison .
&quot; I appreciate , it was simply decided to kill these people . but why do their corp@@ ses disappear ? &quot;
did these people not even families who were able to hand their immort@@ al rem@@ n@@ ants ?
dis@@ appearance of the corp@@ se is the last ab@@ omin@@ able act that you can ant@@ un to a man .
&quot; my father told me when the democracy was introduced again , they brought machines to eliminate the immort@@ al rem@@ n@@ ants of the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they have been broken and somewhere escap@@ es - no idea , where . &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot;
but something of course remains .
&quot; I have seen how you killed people ! &apos; &quot;
only to clarify : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 crimin@@ als - including my dad .
&quot; the thought , show my Father , was born during a conversation , when he was under house arrest . &quot;
&quot; I made it accus@@ ations because of all the atro@@ cities , which I had to experience , because of all the atro@@ cities . &quot;
&quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I don &apos;t have killed anybody . &quot;
&quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly ti@@ ered and asked me why all the exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings , &quot; which they were supposed to def@@ ended themselves . &quot;
then I cried :
how can you tell me ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed horri@@ ble crimes and you made me as a child to participate in doing so .
&quot; he only with@@ ered &quot; &quot; Well , then I forgive me . &quot;
exactly that did me .
2010 I refund@@ able the first ad .
finally I realized that he was a criminal .
nobody can imagine that I am bi@@ ased . I finally have said against my own father .
Luis Alberto Qu@@ ij@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest still at the end of the process .

a translation process makes older people in Kyoto to &quot; aw@@ ful auto@@ driving &quot;
the sign with the transl@@ ating mistake at a center in Kyoto where you can extend his leader .
the photo was distributed in the social media .
mach@@ ining of the original pictures of Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto customers have been a newly opened centre in which you can pro@@ long his leader in the last month witnesses a very much mis@@ understood translation .
&quot; on a sign the Japanese word has been known as a &quot; &quot; older Auto@@ drivers &quot; , &quot; the &quot; &quot; older Auto@@ drivers &quot; , &quot; - but maybe also with mal@@ ign@@ ant hind@@ rance &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as a &quot; &quot; awesome car &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was from 1st to 20 September on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself .
&quot; the original pictures of Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was often shared in the social media . &quot;
&quot; the mistake was the transl@@ ator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ otos , he liked . he was also aware of the locality . &quot;
the daily Kyoto Shim@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; this is an ins@@ ult to older people and in an international city such as Kyoto simply unacceptable , &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot;
the faul@@ ty English translation was initially removed . the name &quot; TER@@ RI@@ BLE drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; awesome driving ) was later replaced by the appropriate label &quot; Elder drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older car drivers &quot; ) .
&quot; the police of the pre@@ fecture of Kyoto exc@@ ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation errors . furthermore , she explained that the bug was already contained in the text that they had been tested by the transl@@ ators and that the translation was not checked on their correct@@ ness before it was published . &quot;
a blo@@ gger reported as follows :
&quot; we are sorry that older people felt by the in@@ sufficient correction ( the translation ) , &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News set up a bit more detailed with the phenomenon of &quot; terrible &quot; older auto@@ drivers in Japan and wrote :
the word &quot; fear &quot; was den@@ oun@@ ced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police there are the proportion of older drivers who are involved in accidents but quite a matter of concern .
in the pre@@ fecture of Kyoto for example were caused in 2005 1.@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19.@@ 460 accidents of sen@@ iors . this represents a share of 10 % .
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , the sen@@ iors of 1.8@@ 03 caused by a total of 11.@@ 850 accidents . &quot;
thus their share rose to 17.@@ 7 % .
&quot; while the number of accidents decl@@ ined , the proportion of sen@@ iors has risen in the same period . &quot;
&quot; yet it did not rep@@ or@@ ters rep@@ or@@ ters released in the published version of the article comments in the light , which show which prejudi@@ ces are some Japanese apparently against older cars : &quot;
the article on Yahoo on the translation process received the following comments :
- &quot; Is this ( &quot; horri@@ ble driving &quot; ) about not the reality ?
&quot; - &quot; So faul@@ ty , the translation is actually not at all , or ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I do not think that this is a real transl@@ ator error . &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread in all Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and all Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a real foundation for this bizarre mistake in English .
photo by Flick@@ r @-@ user Andrew .
the reasons for the wide distribution of transl@@ ators are manifold .
&quot; to transfer you need two important skills : passive skills , in order to understand the text text and to transfer active language skills to transfer him into the target language . &quot;
&quot; the latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is in terms of mother tongue . generally , the conviction that transl@@ ators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - mother tongue . &quot;
this is how a French mother tongue should translate into French - not from French into English .
photo of Flick@@ r @-@ user Karl Baron .
&quot; many Japanese companies do not deal with English as mother tongue , which could be translations into English . this may be attributed to a lack of understanding of the survival , quot@@ a or the relatively small number of English speakers who can be Japanese . &quot;
&quot; some companies that even do not have foreign employees , can be used translations to build fir@@ ing intern@@ ally . then , the Japanese staff , whose English is made known to transl@@ ators - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are . &quot;
photo of Flick@@ r @-@ user Karl Baron .
mechanical translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
&quot; the liter@@ al and pu@@ zz@@ ling phrases created by mechanical translations , show that this technique may not replace a human transl@@ ator for a long time . this applies to some of the languages . &quot;
&quot; some of the stran@@ gest English phrases in Japan , including the mysterious prints , often used T @-@ shirts or po@@ ckets , are only used for sty@@ li@@ stic reasons - not to be read or understood . &quot;
photo of Flick@@ r users Joseph Br@@ ent .
&quot; translation errors may be acceptable or harmless or at least harmless , but by large companies or from the government that have the means to guarantee higher standards , you can expect to have more careful translations . &quot;
the city of Kyoto uses in the future hopefully a rep@@ utable source of their translations .
Venezuela : protests and sub @-@ measures on the Internet and television take
&quot; main@@ page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ eg@@ ar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( Free Adventure ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institute of Press and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; on Friday morning , 7 April , mel@@ ted ven@@ ez@@ ol@@ an Internet users that they had no access to the online station Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay . &quot;
&quot; later , other users wrote that the website of V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV were no longer accessible . &quot;
&quot; other online transm@@ is@@ sed recordings of the protests in Car@@ acas , which were organized by op@@ position@@ ists , who ref@@ ute the government Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros . &quot;
&quot; the protests began in early April , after the Supreme Court ruled the Parliament and transferred to the responsibilities of Parliament on the executive , and the Supreme Court themselves . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author of Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a Trac@@ er@@ out@@ es . he pointed out that the connection must be used , and received the users , VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet . &quot;
# c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship : re@@ activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that web sites ven@@ z@@ ol@@ anic providers are once again locked .
this is from the site of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net
&quot; offers like Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; traditional media has been hes@@ it@@ ant since 2014 in reporting about protests . at that time , the Commission had to report with money pun@@ ches and closure , as they continue to report on demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as a &quot; call to violence . &quot; &quot;
&quot; without har@@ ness and informative national TV channels , I found myself back at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net . &quot;
amazing that this continues to be cheaper than two lit@@ re Lim@@ on@@ ade .
&quot; the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ us confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay is in@@ accessible through a block@@ ing of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online transm@@ is@@ sions . this also concerns the website where the National Assembly is concerned . &quot;
&quot; earlier research of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had to be able to use the local Internet provider . this is a technique if the DNS servers are faul@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server respon@@ sive or denied the request when calling on such a website . &quot;
we confirm the DNS @-@ lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net &quot;
&quot; at V@@ P@@ IT@@ V , a third locked channel , the transmission on Thursday , 6th April , set as the V@@ P@@ IT@@ V c@@ amer@@ aman Elvis Flo@@ res that was taken live in Car@@ acas by the protests in Car@@ acas . &quot;
Flo@@ res was be@@ aten while he was in polic@@ emen .
eight hours later he was released and V@@ P@@ IT@@ V went back to broadcast .
&quot; although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it has also been reported that the government regul@@ ates Internet connections : thus the Venezu@@ el@@ ans of access to multi @-@ media coverage over the current events in the country is always worth further . &quot;
in Paraguay many girls become s@@ cler@@ ks to get a training
Tina Al@@ var@@ enga was a child a cri@@ ad@@ ita . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
&quot; today , Tina is fighting for the rights of children and coll@@ ects others Cri@@ ad@@ itas that were just like they were victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot;
photo of Cecilia Ro@@ jas . use with friendly permission of curiosity .
&quot; the following article is the abbre@@ vi@@ ated version of a report of Kur@@ dish , which is published by Global Vo@@ ices , with friendly permission of the authors . &quot;
&quot; the article is part of a series with the title &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ elas que Piano &quot; ( &quot; f@@ ens cows , dec@@ aying schools &quot; ) , which is edited by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America and re@@ published . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ enga lived eight years in a household , in which they did not live together with the family who lived there . &quot;
&quot; shortly before her university degree at the university she returned to the house , and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride over she said . &quot; she is like a daughter for us . &quot;
&quot; that has become , from which something has become &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ enga has never been treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she was ten years old she began working to work as a cri@@ ad@@ ita for the family . as Cri@@ ad@@ itas , one described in Paraguay the more than 4@@ ,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school . &quot;
&quot; the shop is quite simple : a big family with little money over@@ comes up their min@@ ate son or her min@@ ate daughter to another , rich@@ ly family . in exchange receives the child food , a training and a roof over the head . &quot;
&quot; however , what is not mentioned however , is that the children do not need to work for countless days of house@@ work that can never be paid and are victims of abuse and abuse - and all this within the framework of an agreement you cannot raise . &quot;
this as a cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go practice has been widely used in Paraguay due to the involvement and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous ail@@ ments of human rights organizations .
&quot; after the conclusion of her studies , Al@@ var@@ enga worked for a few years for an organization that is fighting for the rights of boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; she spoke with Cri@@ ad@@ itas , especially young girls - especially young girls have been affected by the practice of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - sam@@ pled stuff , cher@@ ished and pran@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; tried to name things in the name , because the feeling of gratitude that the Cri@@ ad@@ itas is vacc@@ inated , guaranteed in general st@@ agn@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ enga . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand the family , which her daughter is in faith , that they cannot improve their education in society and do something out of it , to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family who takes up the girl with themselves and whose exploitation ought to just@@ ify that they would give someone a chance that otherwise would not get any training , and maybe even star@@ ved . &quot;
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; when the girl is mist@@ re@@ ated , his family will only learn many years later . &quot;
sometimes they even learn about it .
&quot; in January 2016 this has been relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the secret in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , but a face . &quot;
&quot; when Carolina Mar@@ ín in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú came into hospital , her body showed traces of fier@@ ce b@@ lows . shortly afterwards she died . &quot;
it was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ ad@@ ita in the household of the former Mil@@ ky Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo who works as an official representative office .
&quot; Mar@@ ín lived in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ on . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 Fer@@ re@@ ira proposed Fer@@ re@@ ira as long as with a stick to Mar@@ ín , until they suffered fatal injury . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
some days later the media reported on the incident .
they stressed that the ph@@ ord@@ ed child was a cri@@ ad@@ ita .
organizations like UNI@@ CE@@ F or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the deeply responsible practice of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go practice for the death of the girl .
they recorded the cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came to protest and demanded that there would be &quot; no more Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widespread in the social media .
&quot; in Paraguay is more cows than children registered , &quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ enga . &quot;
&quot; without papers it is much easier , un@@ pun@@ ished the rights of children to hurt . &quot;
&quot; without official documents it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live . &quot;
the neighbours of the couple and almost 60 civil society organisations called for a fast investigation into the case .
&quot; they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was sent@@ enced to 30 years in prison . &quot;
&quot; if the case is judged before judgment , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be judged for the first time in the history of Paragu@@ ays a case of cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go before judgment . &quot;
the everyday life of a cri@@ ad@@ ita
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ itas are not only exploited , they also live isolated from other girls in their age . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ enga was ten years old when the Far@@ es , who had worked in her father , who had to register and lost her father his work . &quot;
&quot; your brothers had to go all working , and started to sell money on the street or on the market of sweets to make money . &quot;
but they all went on to school .
&quot; only Tina was sent as a cri@@ ad@@ ita , in the capital As@@ unci@@ on . &quot;
in the house of her employer Al@@ var@@ enga worked between four and six hours every day .
&quot; in doing so , she had to share the time so that you still have time to learn . &quot;
she got up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared breakfast for their employers .
&quot; for example pur@@ ged them the fridge , used the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected . &quot;
&quot; when school was at the end , she went back home and had time to learn . &quot;
&quot; the more they had finished with learning , the more leisure it had . &quot;
&quot; however , this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ var@@ enga says they had never been star@@ ving , but got not un@@ confin@@ ed food . &quot; &quot; I was allowed to get more books from the library of the landlord than food from the fridge . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the library was well appointed and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party that was during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner who was in power from 1954 to 1989 . &quot;
&quot; at some precip@@ itation of the households Al@@ var@@ enga , standing next to him and read the editorial from opposition from opposition to such as &quot; &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; El Pueb@@ lo &quot; . &quot; &quot;
he tried to persu@@ ade her to convince the reports of the official media about the regime of dict@@ ators .
&quot; he held her for intelligent , but did not keep someone with her . &quot; the househ@@ older had found someone who heard while he spoke about politics &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; they did not allow me to visit my family because they were the opinion that I would like to learn bad habits , the indigenous group of guar@@ an@@ í would speak at home again her mother@@ language guar@@ an@@ í . &quot;
&quot; your Lord feared that they had the education , which they had to allow them to lose again , she explains . &quot;
&quot; but it was perfectly clear that they had paid for everything they had paid from them , with their hard work . &quot;
&quot; also in school , Al@@ var@@ enga had been discrimin@@ ated . &quot; one thing that is almost never spoken , bul@@ lying and the chic@@ ks are exposed to the Cri@@ ad@@ itas when they go to school . &quot;
&quot; because the other children parents have parents , they immediately recognize that anyone who has no parents , a cri@@ ad@@ ita . &quot;

society cheap the cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can see vac@@ ations for cleaning personnel and kinder@@ gart@@ ens in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; the administ@@ rators of the group is Pep@@ a Ko@@ sti@@ anov@@ sky , a city district in the As@@ unci@@ on district . &quot;
hello ! I am looking for a little companion for my little daughter who plays in the morning and in the afternoon with her .
to learning .
please send you .
&quot; beginning from Monday , if possible . &quot;
the ad got five &quot; li@@ kes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the village Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she could have had a little girl and gave their phone number .
&quot; another woman who also came from Ñ@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 year old ni@@ ece . &quot; &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; the third comment was written by &quot; a girl from the inland , who wants to work &quot; . &quot; &quot;
then the fi@@ bers of displ@@ aying the display is once again :
&quot; dear friends , I have found one . I look , if it works with her . &quot;
&quot; thank you , I write again if something is . &quot;
the shop was completed .
&quot; in the pro@@ log to the report Cri@@ ad@@ itas , ¿ H@@ asta cu@@ án@@ do ? &quot;
&quot; ( Cri@@ ad@@ itas , how long nor ? ) , a collection of witness of former Cri@@ ad@@ itas , writes Or@@ ti@@ z : &quot;
&quot; in the course of our history we managed to create systems like slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice out of the early history of Paragu@@ ays , the Con@@ qu@@ ist@@ ad@@ ores , the women of guar@@ dian had to be destroyed and to their &quot; wives &quot; ) , the women of guar@@ dian had to be forced into a system of slavery , in which they are slight victims of abuse and exploitation . &quot;
the social inequality in Paraguay and its to show power are the key to the understanding of the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
legislative design writes the Egyptian users of social media to register with the government

published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
&quot; six@@ ty Egyptian parliament@@ arians have recently agreed a bill on &quot; &quot; regul@@ ators concerning use and usage of social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if it is accepted by the Parliament , we must register the user of social media in Egypt with a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the law , a place would then be set up to use citizens with respect to social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months , with acceptance of the law , the user would have to register to the website of the site with their right names and personnel numbers , to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; will it be missed so , this could bring out a penalty of up to six months imprisonment or a fin@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; the bill that consists of six par@@ ag@@ ra@@ ids and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent Kur@@ dish , defines social media as the &quot; jed@@ ve@@ de application , which runs through the Internet and be used to communicate with others using voice , video clips and text . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear how the law is en@@ forced if it is assumed , since the design is not to submit an indication that the Egyptian authorities should not register to the fact that the Egyptian government is not able to register the regulation on the level of social media company . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , parliament@@ arians and promot@@ ers of the legislative action , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a username and a password to get through the fire@@ wall , Facebook blocks . &quot;
&quot; this could mean that Egypt is planning to cross a fire@@ wall at a national level around Facebook . due to those , it would be necessary for the Egyptian and Egyptians to submit information on their identity to access the network . &quot;
&quot; yet , it is not known that such plans are to exist . &quot;
experts and experts on site are sc@@ ep@@ tical regarding the technical feasi@@ bility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of the Egyptian Foundation for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R ) in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
I doubt strongly about technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt with regard to what to do with technology .
&quot; in my opinion , they imagine that just as they could be violent physical public and private spaces could also be done online . &quot;
&quot; if I take them seriously , then it means that they should apply a strong surveillance system to control a permit or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor the activities of the people and also to bring them to a trial process . &quot;
this is technically real@@ ist@@ ically realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed in the leg@@ is@@ lat@@ ure of Parliament and constitutional affairs , before it comes to the plen@@ ary debate . &quot;
&quot; whether his acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not , the design &quot; is in line with a pro @-@ military mind in the Parliament , in whose sense the control is to be maxim@@ ised and ensured that there is no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration on the screen . &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;
last year the vote of Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a legislative action against cy@@ ber @-@ crimin@@ als in which a life @-@ long prison sentence for those who were found guilty to thre@@ aten the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest . &quot;

&quot; a sub@@ type of the larger family of the Leop@@ ards , which touches through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian Leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ olor ) . &quot;
why is this particular type of le@@ op@@ ards so important ?
&quot; as R@@ aza shows in the video , the Persian le@@ op@@ ard is the only remaining car@@ ni@@ v@@ ore in the Kur@@ dish ecos@@ ystem , and the health and the memorial of the ecos@@ ystem also depends on that a great pre@@ dat@@ ory is present . &quot;
the chance to see a Persian Leop@@ ards actually is low in the free wild@@ bahn is low and goes against zero . when the team st@@ alls in the video that they have a recording of a big cat in the c@@ amer@@ af@@ all that breaks R@@ aza in pure joy .

&quot; in early March 2017 , designed for the North @-@ East Japanese daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o , which were achieved in the last six years to re@@ build the life of those who were triggered by the &quot; triple disaster &quot; of March 2011 . a massive earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom @-@ accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima had triggered the disaster . &quot;
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in S@@ end@@ ai that is located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ fecture . the pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was an et@@ ected Pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in Japan . the both of them had to experience the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighboring win@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hima and Iw@@ ate became tw@@ ined for the ts@@ un@@ ami and the ts@@ un@@ ami had to disappear all the coastal cities of the map .
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ hima still lived in Fu@@ kus@@ hima a nuclear accident , already alone because of the fact 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes . &quot;
the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o shows from local point of view which progress has been achieved for six years to re@@ build the lives of local residents .
the detailed report of the newspaper includes both the statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authorities as well as survey results of those affected themselves .
&quot; residential construction in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and Iw@@ ate &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement houses ( &quot;
&quot; the largest success among the three Pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures could mark Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , here 80 percent of the planned spare houses were finished . &quot;
&quot; Iw@@ ate has 75 percent of such houses finished , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hima forms at 70 percent of the closing . &quot;
&quot; still , they are still trying to move for six years after the catastrophe , ev@@ acu@@ ated by Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ es@@ Tr@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ( iri@@ descent themes ) . &quot;
after the triple catastrophe almost 80 000 people were forced to live in homes with homes .
&quot; in December 2016 there are still 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and Iw@@ ate in such Beh@@ aus@@ ungen . &quot;
&quot; nearly 40 per cent of the ev@@ acu@@ ated in 2011 ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima still live in emergency , while Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was a successful problem . more than 75 percent of the ev@@ acu@@ ated farms that have been inhabited in final homes . &quot;
for Iw@@ ate the figure is here at 34 percent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
&quot; how the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper was able to determine 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , which were affected by the disaster , its doors until December 2016 , which makes almost 98 percent of the schools of the three Pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . &quot;
six years later stands firmly that industrial reconstruction in the three Pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures are far more difficult .
&quot; while almost 100 percent of the fisher@@ ies in Iw@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now back in operation , in Fu@@ kus@@ hima only 30 percent of the fisher@@ ies and re@@ produced their operation in Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; the ts@@ un@@ ami and the atomic accident , have moved into the three Pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures agr@@ arian agricultural land in Mit@@ ill@@ um@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could re@@ produce 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 percent of the A@@ cker@@ land in Iw@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed A@@ cker@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the atomic situation , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed A@@ cker@@ land of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , lie in the &quot; nuclear @-@ nuclear @-@ zone . &quot;
&quot; in two of the three Pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has broad@@ ly reco@@ vered , but also here Fu@@ kus@@ hima remains far off @-@ be@@ aten . &quot;
&quot; the tourist figures in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and Iw@@ ate are again to 90 percent at the same level as before the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hima , however , can be found here only 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper also reported that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants , it was more difficult to earn their livel@@ ih@@ oods . &quot;
is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake ?
&quot; to determine a total picture , the paper led numerous surveys conducted among the native population and under the ev@@ acu@@ ation and also how their sensation has changed on the ts@@ un@@ ami risk . &quot;
in their introduction of the article the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o conducted a survey in order to bring more about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness among the native population in experience .
&quot; the survey conducted that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents , measures have taken to be taken to have in order to be prepared for the future earthquake and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is . &quot;
&quot; however , 55,@@ 9 percent of the respon@@ dents can still be done enough in matters of disasters prevention . &quot;
how it is to those who had to ev@@ acu@@ ated from the Fu@@ kus@@ hima Pre@@ fecture
&quot; in their issue on the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper has strengthened its attention to the position of the ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ hima did not just have to experience the huge earthquake and devast@@ ating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture , was also the witness of the worst , cat@@ ast@@ ro@@ phen@@ olic , atomic fact , the Japan ever had to experience . &quot;
&quot; from 160 000 ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima , nearly 63 000 people were transferred outside the pre@@ fecture . &quot;
&quot; early 2016 there were a little more than 23 000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima , in permanent replacement houses . &quot;
&quot; after the date of 2017 still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hima still live outside of their home country pre@@ fecture . &quot;
&quot; in the Kat@@ ast@@ ro@@ phen@@ ates , most of the ev@@ acu@@ ated areas are still known in Beh@@ el@@ ow , Iw@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima with massive construction projects . this is the construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo . &quot;

&quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look at exactly these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast , we handle issues that will often get less attention in reporting than they deserve . &quot;
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment in which they have felt very strong with someone over language and country borders .

Rei@@ ght : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva is based on a widespread photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 years ago this week was delivered to the Inten@@ sive station : last Friday it had struck him a police officer during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with a perc@@ ussi@@ onist against the head . land@@ long taken millions of prot@@ esters on a protest against savings .
&quot; Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , studies of social sciences at the Bundes@@ university Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a sk@@ ull @-@ brain trau@@ ma and several fr@@ ac@@ tures . &quot;
doctors operate it this Saturday and now took him into an artificial comm@@ a .
its condition is considered critical .
the local imaging Lu@@ iz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus the spread within a few days rapidly in Brazil .
on the pictures the face of the police officer can also recognize the face of the police attack . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
&quot; after the incident the military police were known in the Brazilian state Go@@ i@@ ás , that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been susp@@ ended to the end of the examination of the incident of the active service . &quot;
the pictures show the police officer like in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his impact on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Luz ) .
&quot; would be a police officer of a prot@@ esters and land on the intensive care station , his face would be six months long on TV and the whole repression would be justified . &quot;
&quot; the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ ne@@ aliz@@ ador &quot; , &quot; a press @-@ channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia divided by Lu@@ iz da Luz , divided by Lu@@ iz da Luz , and several plumbing is attacked shortly there@@ after . &quot;
&quot; another video with the same scenes , but from another perspective , is also established in social networks . &quot;
in the below clip you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
&quot; for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state of federal state , have had access to a part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while he is in hospital . &quot;

&quot; on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás to memory : &quot;
&quot; Go@@ i@@ ás experiences a wave of political force : here the activity has been mur@@ dered by his father , because he was attacked the Occup@@ y movement in Sec@@ ond@@ ary schools . and now we have been attacked the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , who has been attacked by a police station , having been attacked by a polic@@ eman who has struck him with a perc@@ ussi@@ onist . &quot;
police re@@ efs
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil where it came to brutal police officer against prot@@ esters .
&quot; polic@@ emen were in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where they built a stage for Red@@ ner , Gum@@ mig@@ esch@@ ke and Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the MP Fl@@ avi@@ o Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Fried@@ Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police via loud@@ speakers to declare violence against prot@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the whole country . &quot;
&quot; once again , the Brazilian media street shows how they focus on another , unexpected prot@@ agon@@ ists : a window disc . &quot;
Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported on a zer@@ bro@@ chen@@ ko glass windows to shape with a photo their tit@@ ers .
&quot; however , the O Glo@@ bo preferred a title story with a set on brand @-@ set bus . &quot;
&quot; there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic grounds , more about a broken wind@@ screen than the protests of thousands of people who serve the defense of a special thing . &quot;
it is necessary to recognise that if you are strictly against any form of obj@@ ectivity .
&quot; also here the term &quot; &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; is an absur@@ dity , disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ate meaning , and the typical violence of the military police are under@@ lined with the title &quot; prot@@ esters on con@@ front@@ ational course with the police &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the villages of the de@@ centr@@ alization forgotten villages in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso closed almost hundreds of sugar@@ s in all Cuba the doors ( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the Greg@@ orian Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cub@@ an province of May@@ ab@@ e@@ que , is commonly known as el Central - in Spanish sugar@@ s - regardless of the fact that there is no appreci@@ able sugar@@ s on site . &quot;
it is two years ago when the activities were placed in the sugar@@ s .
&quot; after the yield , the sugar@@ s industry stood still in the region and the factory lost gradually its installations , until only the ru@@ mor of steel and concrete left remained . &quot;
about 272 workers had to be re@@ inv@@ ent .
some changes the work .
&quot; other re@@ signed and comm@@ ute daily to factories , which still war@@ ns . &quot;
&quot; n@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an , who stands up every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the car@@ rot industry does not turn his sleep . &quot;
&quot; he heard that it shows in the eastern part of the region sugar in the area that after a long in@@ active time , because they have been preserved . &quot;
that was something he did not expect .
&quot; N@@ ene re@@ minds exactly that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich will get the sugar@@ ro@@ hr@@ fabrik , but the promise was not held . &quot;
&quot; the sugar@@ s industry resist the pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , the low market prices , the in@@ efficiency , the poor administrative decision and climate change . &quot;
&quot; the production was 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the 1910 produced . &quot;
&quot; the message would have been a motive for a turbul@@ ent for a few decades ago , but the bad harvest@@ ing are no new . &quot;
why was the Cub@@ an sugar@@ s industry turned off ?
the old train rigi@@ d of the municipality already saw better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the reduction of the car@@ rot @-@ industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar@@ ro@@ hr@@ ams were technically out@@ dated , and hardly competitive , they have been un@@ sustainable for the country . &quot;
&quot; the initial idea was to focus on production on the most efficient factories , the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes . &quot;
they just left the factories that can produce sugar for at a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the moti@@ fs led to such measures were the small productivity of the sugar farms and the diabetes crisis in the world market .
&quot; however , the sugar price increased from around a decade ago . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 to 2025 it must remain the price of un@@ refined sugar between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per po@@ und , according to the 2016 published report &quot; &quot; economic inspection &quot; &quot; of the OECD and FA@@ O , the agricultural and food organisation of the United Nations . &quot;
&quot; if the current production of 2001 would reach the level of 2001 ( 3,@@ 6 million tonnes ) , the pipe export of around 85 million dollars would have to manage over 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; today &apos;s day will go back to history , those were the first words of the Cub@@ an President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
&quot; from there , the process of restructuring began in the sugar @-@ industry . &quot;
&quot; in the following years the stand@@ ar@@ dis@@ ation of a total of 98 sugar@@ ro@@ hr@@ amps , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further education . &quot;
the same happened in the sugar@@ ro@@ hr@@ fabrik Greg@@ orio Arl@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked since 1967 in the factory .
&quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , about the closure of the factory , is the word that he is most repeated , &quot; sc@@ am . &quot; &quot;
nearly all respon@@ dents are of the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory was n@@ ud@@ ed .
&quot; in order to get the place , they formed a full time - working group . &quot;
&quot; in front of the first shot , the first letters began to come . &quot;
&quot; it was officially negoti@@ ated documents , which would only be removed about the parts that would be removed to the addres@@ see and the date . &quot;
&quot; they were all signed by Ul@@ timo Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could appro@@ ve any alien@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; from there , the responsibility was over@@ doing and the letters have always been more common . &quot;
Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the still@@ birth for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money in operation . &quot; the country had no money in operation . &quot;
&quot; Eddy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waiting for the retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; he was in action against his will at the down@@ side of the factory , whose construction he helped . &quot;
&quot; with each part , which he removed , demon@@ ised one of his 31 years . &quot;
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important job manufacturer has been er@@ ased .
&quot; in many cases there were no alternatives to work and services , which were generated into the communities in which they were created . &quot;
&quot; we will never know whether during the mam@@ mot@@ h speech of 21 October 2002 , the former president saw in the eyes of the present people saw that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years . &quot;
the price of the population for the closure of the sugar@@ s
since 2004 sugar is extrac@@ ted only high due to grinding .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; after two years the People &apos;s Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ i learned that many things are changing , but not always for the better if a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; as the sugar@@ ro@@ hr@@ fabrik closed , or better said when they started to asp@@ hal@@ ted them , they also listened to paved the road , and dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with already advanced age , N@@ ene and Eddy had to look for other factories . &quot;
these were to be spare @-@ parts .
&quot; without future perspective , many young people left the region . &quot;
in the area a food factory has been created whose production serves not even for the supply of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
&quot; in the end of 2016 N@@ ene came back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work . &quot;
Ne@@ un@@ und@@ forty flus@@ hes bring the old soldiers a r@@ ente of two thousand p@@ eso per month to spend the years at retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
&quot; Mr. N@@ ene , a man black @-@ colour , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a trag@@ ic person , yet he gives the lies that one told him . &quot;
they qu@@ ests him for ten years .
&quot; N@@ ene goes with 65 years in re@@ ente , not because it is lacking in force , but because he is bit@@ tered . &quot;

&quot; as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an @-@ Tour for 2014 workshop , mobile audio studios have come directly to schools and youth centres in order to teach young groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production . &quot;
&quot; the original workshops were led by the ped@@ ago@@ gues David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked together in North @-@ Que@@ bec with ten Cre@@ e @-@ communities and then with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop Group The North@@ stars . &quot;
&quot; the workshop increases with that the young participants in conversations like &quot; cultural identity , language , examination , love , self @-@ acceptable &quot; or whatever way of them come in mind . &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the main actors .
&quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian Province of British Columbia , and was invited to organise similar workshops with the tribe of the Winn@@ eb@@ ago in the U.S. federal state Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Y@@ oo in the territory of the tribe of the k@@ ittens , for example , the history of Highway 16 , also &quot; Highway of tears &quot; , &quot; a street of street in West@@ kan@@ ada , where almost two dozen indigenous young women were mur@@ dered or mur@@ dered . &quot;
the cases were largely un@@ solved .
&quot; the next video of the Nem@@ aska Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important to obtain traditional customs and customs , despite the influences of globalisation . &quot;
&quot; many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people were not always domin@@ ating the languages of the First Nations . &quot;
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation will be sung the ref@@ rain is sung on Cre@@ e .
&quot; the young people involved took some help from Gary Jol@@ ly from the North@@ stars Hip @-@ Hop group , which gave them a stub@@ born in dialect eastern James Bay Cre@@ e . &quot;
&quot; on the Fac@@ ebook@@ site of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an stands at the St@@ rop@@ he &apos;s inscription , as well as a translation into English , which is translated here into German : &quot;
sometimes I feel as if no one would ever be interested in me
but I try to go on my days on the earth
that is the day when you get our cry
because we lost our way to life as a youth
&quot; but I believe that we will rise up one day , &quot;
I would not like to see how they live a bad life
this way they can grow and approach as well as our youth
so they can do that which determines the creator

plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant
&quot; plastic dishes ( , sk@@ ill@@ ery ) outside of a typical restaurant in Japan . &quot;

in Japan you can see almost every restaurant plastic dishes .
&quot; to show potential customers what exactly is on the menu , are located close to the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ to@@ u ( i.e. , &quot; &quot; Plastic models of dishes &quot; ) from each food that is served in this restaurant . &quot;
the customers see these sculptures and then decide whether to enter the restaurant or go on .
there is an entire industry which is dedicated to the manufacture of these plastics .
&quot; in the Tok@@ i@@ oter district K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi there are a variety of these small companies that produce the German filmm@@ aker Wim Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a , over 20 years ago . &quot;
for most Japanese these plastics are so usually not even more striking . a new trend is turning it today in show@@ y cell accessories and other gad@@ gets .
&quot; with Nav@@ al Mat@@ ome , the Blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i published the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos , which show this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ to@@ u . &quot;
&quot; now in special sales : new with plastic , decor@@ ated mobile bands such as they are shown in K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ yu Kauf@@ haus . &quot;
&quot; many of these artificial foods have been turned to kit@@ sch@@ y collective @-@ objective , as in this case , refriger@@ ation magn@@ ets : &quot;
here are a few Sho@@ c@@ els cool@@ ers for a new exhibition at the Tokyo Station .
the new boom of the Essen@@ ti@@ fications becomes increasingly more complex .
in this case a dec@@ isen @-@ don ( a popular travel package was turned into a cell @-@ base .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we have found a good use as mobile support .
also this part we have made for the exhibition at the station Tokyo .
and here is an apple that contains your cell phone :
&quot; designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for mobile phone , this is already a great design . &quot;
and that is just the beginning of an increasing approach .
&quot; some cell @-@ stand and mobile designers allow you to manufacture your own artwork . in this case , ik@@ ura and salmon , is used , a popular Top@@ ping which is served with white rice . &quot;
on Twitter some of the users had their doubts :
&quot; can there be someone who would say , &quot; Wow , cool , now I can wash my mobile phone with salmon . &quot;
I think I will probably be the only one .
&quot; this interest in plastic , can also take a less appeti@@ zing form to surprise my colleagues or family members . &quot;
our new mobile phone @-@ stand has the form of mel@@ ting ice .
&quot; in addition , there are also a trav@@ eller ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , ear@@ rings , and hand@@ y@@ rings made of dried salmon . &quot;
&quot; for more sc@@ ur@@ r@@ ile plastic , you can see yourself at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Nav@@ er Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter using the has@@ ht@@ ag # sk@@ ill@@ ary , &quot;
&quot; if you like to learn more about the origin of this trends , then this video gives you an insight into the district K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi who is dedicated to the popularity of the restaurant industry . like for example with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ to@@ u . &quot;
the following video shows how the Japanese plast@@ ic@@ ger@@ ies can actually be produced .
a Mexican project tells the stories of the survi@@ v@@ ors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the struggle against drug dealers . &quot;

&quot; in reports and foreign media over the not@@ orious &quot; fight against drug trade &quot; in Mexico , the most contra@@ sts and cer@@ eals are regularly reflected in statistics . however , these reflect not at all the extent of the human tragedy , that this struggle with itself brings . &quot;
&quot; the coverage about drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the head of the Sin@@ alo@@ a @-@ Kart@@ ells , the stories of the victims of conflict is entirely in the background . &quot;
&quot; on the day after a violent incident , no one looks at the sad@@ ness or on the par@@ ishes who have learned to live with pain . &quot;
&quot; stand behind each corp@@ se , behind each bone , in the hundreds of secret gra@@ ves , the stories paid for parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , whose wo@@ unds may never heal . &quot;
&quot; that is why the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico is called the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir Con El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; with the drug , life ) to give this sacrifice and stories of people that gr@@ ated in the fight between pro@@ secution and boxes . &quot;
animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project so :
organised crime cannot only be afraid of our lives .
the effects are much deeper .
&quot; for example , if businesses are closing , because they are threatened by drug dealers and have to travel many kilometers in order to buy something such as milk . &quot;
the pain of victims
a video entitled &quot; vi@@ das cam@@ es@@ p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; how fear life changes &quot; ) tells exactly these stories .
&quot; a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father , who is searching for his son every weekend gra@@ ves after his son . &quot;
&quot; or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ guez , who lost in just one day her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ew . &quot;
&quot; priest : &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves again to the task that we have provided us , go and to the gra@@ ves , according to the people we loved , to seek . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Contr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Contr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in a electric shop in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
&quot; on October 15th he should be back again , but he never came again . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it is very hard for me , for I am now alone with three children who need a training . &quot;
&quot; there is also my mother , which is also here with me . &quot;
at the moment it has no income .
&quot; you are the insurance of my Father , but she does not pay it because they demand a mort@@ al customer . &quot;
where should we get it ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
we don &apos;t just have to show the faces of those who are fear . we have to show the international community the conflicts , the frag@@ ility and governance . &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
&quot; KY@@ HB , a reader of Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this post from tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central mex@@ ico . &quot;
&quot; your contribution re@@ minds us that one should never consider violence as normal , no matter what form it occurs : &quot;
disease and sensitivity journ@@ alism do I know now for several years .
I am coming over every day and see the cover @-@ pages with images that actually can only come from a text@@ book for criminal .
it brings me out of the version .
&quot; sometimes I have the feeling as if I am the only one who is disp@@ uted , or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body . &quot;
I can not be in@@ different or consider it as normal .
she writes further :
&quot; no , it is not normal that my 10 years old c@@ ousin thinks that he is great . and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; &quot; of offen@@ ders , when they go through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me this is , when would they fail those who have lost someone and those who have fear that they have something like that . &quot;
I see our weakness when stories are going to blo@@ c numbers in a statistics .
the in@@ om@@ nia of men is incredible for me when the death of six people and the dis@@ appearance of 43 students become justified in a neighboring village that they are being settled .
&quot; I think they are trying to conc@@ eive that they remain spar@@ ed by such trag@@ e@@ dies , if they are not stir@@ ing and silent . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico @-@ Stadt wrote the post &quot; Four @-@ month Er@@ press@@ ings in the main city district . &quot; in this she describes how armed crimin@@ als was destroyed for month money from their business , until the end not only destroyed the business , but also their family apart . &quot;
&quot; you think of everything you have lost , and how many people can change your whole life in just a few days . &quot;
&quot; the pain of it never goes , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes back again when you are alone . &quot;
habits have changed , phone numbers too . &quot;
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the more we are removed from each other , the better . &quot;
she closed her report with the words :
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , for you don &apos;t know when they will guide you or kill you . &quot;
&quot; I asked me in these terrible days if wines are dis@@ solve my deepest feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how you we@@ ep . I must learn to live with pain . &quot;
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; The Lost Children of Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ á@@ rez : one of the victims of violence . &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions like : who takes care of the child of a missed woman and a man who was mur@@ dered by organised crime ?
how is it to grow in a settlement at the edge of the most dangerous city of Mex@@ ic@@ os ?
&quot; he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents worry about them . &quot;
&quot; br@@ yan is a Wa@@ ise and he tells us that he had to teach himself as a egg is coo@@ ks , Tor@@ til@@ las warm and &quot; Ch@@ ichi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for preparing the bottles with water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for the whole life of violence and who had to learn to live .
&quot; when he was five years old , he told him that his mother is gone . &quot;
&quot; but this was not the day , in which his childhood ended . &quot;
his childhood was over two years ago when he was only a few blocks away from his home to the bloody corp@@ ses of his father had been shot by armed men from a pre @-@ driving car .
&quot; when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this : &quot;
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 as a force by organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
&quot; 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders for public safety and the government of the United States Government . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 , the Pro@@ secutor of 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this is equivalent to 8,5 Mor@@ den per day . &quot;
these are just a few of the hundreds of thousands of stories that organised organised crime in Mexico and inv@@ ade the soul of the country .
only a few stories live in the face of getting new headlines further . this project we re@@ minds us of those who we are not allowed to forget .
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir Con El Nar@@ co &quot; has established the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data in which the complex information has been tort@@ ured behind the failed fight against drug trade , which has produced the country over the last four decades , in intel@@ li@@ gible manner . &quot;
if a picture worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Flick@@ r users Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ ström ( CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ NING : this contribution and the pages to which he linked , contains images , on which violence is represented . &quot;
Fak@@ ten@@ check is important in a moment in which it comes to lift up a rum@@ our or to remove a fake .
&quot; but what is the first time ever sur@@ faced ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , t@@ ends to exist . &quot;
let &apos;s take this photo of a terrible accident in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) .
&quot; since its first release , it was dec@@ eptive to ass@@ essing trag@@ e@@ dies that actually occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
this false p@@ airing of image and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First D@@ raft News - den@@ ies not the fact that there are plenty of careful reporting about events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
but it raises questions about our desire for pictures to messages .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
&quot; in 2010 a pet@@ rol station passed the village of S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , ki@@ pp@@ te and explo@@ ded . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war , Africa &apos;s largest country had been negl@@ ected and thereby devast@@ ated , the streets in the region have become dangerous paths of p@@ aws that were difficult to drive . &quot;
&quot; typically , the pet@@ rol station fell to the victim . &quot;
&quot; h @-@ representatives described a fire@@ ball , the un@@ used houses l@@ apped , including a cinema in the vicinity , which was full of people that view the football world@@ cup . &quot;
houses har@@ dened and temper@@ ed corp@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to ignorance .
&quot; a picture with the title &quot; &quot; This is Nigeria &quot; . &quot; by the Im@@ g@@ ur @-@ user Myst@@ ical Monkey , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident form the gray scenes of this day . &quot;
above is an example of this .
it shows ranks short@@ ened body that tu@@ fted on the ground while people are watching them .
but here the story does not find its end .
&quot; over the years the same photo was conducted several times on social media , blogs and other platforms and may not be attributed to real trag@@ e@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 the fighter of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am the leg@@ alized Nig@@ eri@@ an villages B@@ aga and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
witnesses reported dra@@ st@@ ically of atro@@ cities they had to fle@@ e .
houses and shops were burned down and ly@@ ch@@ anc@@ ers in roads and gi@@ vers .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were mass@@ ac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; but the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; nobody remained back to count corp@@ ses , &quot; said a resident to Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; many have been dism@@ ember@@ ed , shot or burnt . &quot;
&quot; only on the basis of satellite images , the fol@@ k@@ time could be depic@@ ted . &quot;
the occasion for the attack remained un@@ solved but the armies in B@@ aga has been a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt by the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am to win country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
&quot; and here the picture of the DR Congo has again on , as it wr@@ ongly been presented as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack : &quot;
this is Nigeria .
a mass@@ acre of 2.000 people took place two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; in fact , this ab@@ norm@@ ative use of the image from the DR Congo is only a series of mis@@ calculations ; Africa Check has documented arrangements to Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
in all of these cases the picture was taken as a letter for mass@@ ages .
&quot; yet another step further bring personal comments such as the DR Congo with sources of mass media , related to arguments . &quot;
the picture of S@@ ange joined in conjunction with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a flash message , published by the United Nations , the ones could fle@@ e , rape and several dead , some through burning . &quot;
&quot; while others reported of violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts as the following refers to these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo : &quot;
&quot; this image comes from an aci@@ di @-@ Arab hand side , the 2012 he claimed that President My@@ an@@ mar@@ s Th@@ ein being said , mon@@ ks and politicians could have used themselves at the ass@@ ass@@ ination of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the picture from the DR Congo to record this information . &quot;
&quot; the original fee , accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here . &quot;
&quot; other news organisations called for AFP for their source , had also wr@@ ongly ected Th@@ ein His testimony , but had not associated with the image of the DR Congo . &quot;
the global range of fal@@ con information
traces of this false cou@@ pling range up to 2011 and 2012 and actually come back all over the world .
&quot; with a &quot; &quot; they returned &quot; , &quot; you can see how far information can exceed limit . &quot;
a revers@@ al picture search with the search@@ engine Tin@@ Eye has found among 18.@@ 8 billion images ( status of 3 May 2017 ) 344 images that are very similar to the animated picture of the DR Congo .
&quot; they come from a mixed lot of private sites , platforms of social media and common publications as well as national publications and are available in many different languages like English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot;
some have passed wrong reports - others tried to lar@@ v@@ ae the for@@ ger@@ ies .
&quot; we have given examples of ab@@ norm@@ ative use and associated with the respective countries , based on which side they had been published . thus , we want to be more clearly more clearly than by the language alone . &quot;
listed in some cases listed below ( which were linked in some cases ) can be used several examples of ab@@ used use .
here are some cases which now can still be fully played ( on the map in orange ) :
map : News Fr@@ ames .
&quot; worldwide examples of false cop@@ h@@ ings of the image from the DR Congo , with Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; the most important countries are still available on both sides or servers , about the examples of counter@@ f@@ eit@@ ing or fal@@ seh@@ oods are still available . &quot;
&quot; the countries in Gr@@ ay are examples , which are based according to the met@@ ad@@ ata and information that are available via Tin@@ Eye , probably also counter@@ f@@ eit examples . &quot;
&quot; remembered as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( in blue ) . &quot;
&quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image from the DR Congo has been posted in an online discussion forum ( directed to Alger@@ ian and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread to the &quot; war of Budd@@ hist@@ s against Muslims . &quot;

&quot; this post , which established itself to the members of the Russian @-@ orthodo@@ x community , clearly shows that the image of the DR Congo are NOT Muslims in killing the Christians . &quot;
&quot; Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 &quot;
&quot; this message has claimed that the president of Myanmar Th@@ ein @-@ being was introduced in 2012 , that mon@@ ks and politicians were involved in the killing of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of S@@ ange . &quot;
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the image continues to be included .
Spain . 2015 / 2016 .
&quot; this article published by 2014 on students who had been killed by the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am , published by the Catholic right of An@@ á@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , has expressly stated that the picture is not from the k@@ ill@@ ings , but it claims that there is a &quot; similar d@@ z@@ dist@@ an attack &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when the picture was later placed in connection with the mass@@ acre of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am from 2015 in Um@@ bre@@ ach , tried to ref@@ ute the newspaper El Pa@@ is , that there were connections to Nigeria . &quot;

&quot; the image of the DR Congo was de@@ formed , provided with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ has@@ ht@@ ag , and delet@@ es a discussion among Muslims after the mass@@ acre of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am 2015 and the Tu@@ es@@ days at Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to achieve that their communities have taken place these events , which took place in the name of Islam , a greater attention . &quot;
United States , 2015 . &quot;
the picture was taken as evidence of the mass@@ acre of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am 2015 ( and more than 9.@@ 300 times ret@@ we@@ es ) . but the messages that were associated with it were inter@@ ven@@ ed in no religious context .
&quot; instead , the goal was to focus attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage in the comparison of Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
Vietnam ( ese ) - 2014 .
&quot; after a message that was supposed to be written by a &quot; &quot; P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mart@@ os &quot; &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an mass@@ acre , in circulation , circul@@ ations like this here on Vietnam@@ ese and declared it to be wrong . &quot;
&quot; from the message to which the picture from the DR Congo was included , the organization of the Clar@@ eti@@ ine Mission@@ aries and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mart@@ os . &quot;
&quot; there are more confirmed examples of a fl@@ aw@@ ful use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;
&quot; other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and pages in the following countries ( on the cap in Grey ) is also no longer completely trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China . &quot;
( data applications with UR@@ Ls and time@@ - / date stamp exist on the web cra@@ w@@ ler and pre@@ load them via cap@@ tions in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
&quot; in all these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original un@@ happiness of 2010 , the image will ultimately be a correct description , but the original fee is not available or accessible . &quot;
frames and images
there are two strong issues or frames ( in@@ hib@@ itions ) which these po@@ sts go through . the first frame focused on religion .
the photo was used in relation to larger discussions about the silence in connection with the ass@@ ass@@ ination of Christians by Muslims or - for the defence of the Muslims - the ass@@ ass@@ ination of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hist@@ s .
a second fr@@ aming uses the picture to discuss how a African life is under@@ rated by a European or French life .
&quot; to understand religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth to examine how pictures are used in connection with these efforts . &quot;
&quot; however , a deeper question is what happens when readers cannot share this pictures any longer . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are zig people who un@@ inten@@ tional share of the water around a tragedy . &quot;
&quot; suggests this mood of mis@@ - and fal@@ s@@ information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true , and lubric@@ ating it the real atro@@ cities of what actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ? &quot;
the spread of non @-@ violent images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
an argument is that the restra@@ ining of pictures of a ref@@ us@@ al comes to recognize the tragedy . sometimes these pictures are even demanded of the victims itself .
&quot; at the same time , the concern that non @-@ violent images and audience des@@ en@@ cing and to take them the ability to emp@@ athy emp@@ athy ( such as this study which are examined how violent media function to help others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there is a lot to discuss more violent represent@@ ations in the news media , it is fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news coverage . &quot;
&quot; Techn@@ ologists experim@@ enting because with algorith@@ ms to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News . &quot; you will thoroughly think about situation in which an image is somewhat sug@@ ger@@ ated , which actually can also be dis@@ solved by context or completely ab@@ stain@@ ing type . &quot;
but an exam@@ ple@@ ated de@@ preci@@ ation should also be taken into account as well as international it can be .

the &quot; Un@@ transl@@ atable &quot; Blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo from Andy Simm@@ ons used in accordance with CC BY @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name Un@@ transl@@ atable ( eg . uns@@ ur@@ ably ) attempts to offer a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not at all at all .
such words are in every language : they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific .
&quot; some of these irre@@ plac@@ eable words are already well known today ( like the famous Portuguese acid acid ) and others , which are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish So@@ bre@@ m@@ esa ) . &quot;
but all contra@@ dic@@ ted stub@@ born every attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; a word or expression is not enough , which is why a full explanation and sometimes a little context are required to understand what to do with this one word . &quot;
these unique words were collected quite a while in an online list .
&quot; most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , during the author and lingu@@ ist &quot; &quot; Un@@ transl@@ atable &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages . &quot;
&quot; in the blog you can find example words from the VAT language of Vanuatu , such as : &quot;
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Su@@ rely on your parents in recognition of how to make you effort in your younger years .
&quot; and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language , spoken in parts of Brazil as : &quot;
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The ease or sl@@ oth , which you feel after being angry at the cold days in the sun . &quot;
in birds own words from his blog About :
they de@@ fer@@ ing other cultures that reveal other thought @-@ ings and wake up our curiosity .
&quot; sometimes , you will affect the way we analyse the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page would like to publish even more of this &quot; insur@@ able &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are . &quot;
&quot; speakers of the &quot; &quot; Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages &quot; &quot; which are very much appreciated by un@@ transl@@ atable and are invited to re@@ charge their favorite words here . &quot;

how Sri Lanka conver@@ ts with the worst floo@@ ding disaster of the decade
the island of Sri Lanka is located at the moment of the worst floo@@ ding and inv@@ aded disaster in this decade .
&quot; triggered by the mon@@ soon , which usually starts at the end of May , are due to strong ra@@ inf@@ all the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and Att@@ an@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya in 15 districts in the south and west of the country over the shore . &quot;
after a statement of the cat@@ astrop@@ hic center of Sri Lanka from 28 May 2017 126 people were killed and almost hundreds of people are missing because of floo@@ ds and fl@@ amm@@ ers .
over 400 000 people have been affected by Friday ( 26 May ) and around 100 000 people have been brought to a safe location .
the ra@@ w@@ ling began on Saturday ( 27 May ) and the waters of some areas went slowly .
health and toil@@ ic conditions of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the subsequent pictures and videos convey an impression of the scale of the Fl@@ ut@@ kat@@ ze :
high @-@ water in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water distances of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter user like A@@ zz@@ am Ame@@ en and Sri Lanka Twe@@ et provide regular updates on the water@@ front .
many use the has@@ ht@@ ag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of disaster .
Sri Lan@@ kan deadly Fl@@ utes are mer@@ ged the Den@@ gu@@ e@@ fi@@ eb@@ ac rise , war@@ ns the Children , after further ra@@ ils are already on their way . &quot;
&quot; today , the Nel@@ o@@ wa bus stood in the high water , water level up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ago@@ da at G@@ alle also floo@@ ds because of the yesterday covered water @-@ peg@@ els of the Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a . &quot;
the Air Force has made five aircraft for b@@ ail@@ out campaigns and another five are included in the transport of staff members in their floo@@ ded villages .
also various organizations and start @-@ ups have been prepared to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Rel@@ ief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on the water@@ front and humanitarian aid .
&quot; if any search and b@@ ail@@ ships dr@@ ones need for their operations , please call the number 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 . &quot;
&quot; for all , the dry food and essential ingredients for high @-@ water offerings - &quot;
we are today in the area around Kel@@ en@@ i@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call today the number 07@@ 77@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 07@@ 7@@ 78@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if animals need help in this area .
&quot; the Tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f @-@ App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their site data with the help of the app , so that the cat@@ aly@@ ac@@ enter is informed . &quot;
&quot; last year after the catastrophe of the Tro@@ ost@@ u Ro@@ an@@ u , p@@ impl@@ ements introduced a &quot; high @-@ water remedy &quot; key which allowed the users to retri@@ eve a vehicle for pick@@ up from Hil@@ fel@@ icity and donations . these were then forwar@@ ded for free to the sr@@ il@@ ank@@ ian r@@ ote cross . &quot;
&quot; likewise , they introduced a &quot; SOS &quot; key that had more than thousand requests and 150 successful jet@@ ties promotions for floo@@ ds and hei@@ r people included . &quot;
&quot; the unification of the Government and the civilian population of Sri Lan@@ kan , where several social media platforms are fully exhausted , bring residents in need in need of security and improve aid . &quot;
&quot; this has prevented the loss of further lives , whereby the population of Sri Lan@@ kan is now approaching the long way to restore the norm@@ ality . &quot;

the Women &apos;s March on 21 January 2017 in San Francisco .
photo of Sah@@ ar Hab@@ ib G@@ ha@@ zi .
&quot; when used in January I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neigh@@ bor , and love girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; I trust her my four year old daughter , she familiar to me her children ; she is my rock in the branch . &quot;
&quot; in the one minute , we call even slo@@ gans for the rights of women . &quot;
in the next we conclude rights for trans@@ gender .
&quot; we are located in a sea of umbre@@ llas and people , some keep the ic@@ onic picture of a woman with head@@ sc@@ arf high , bound from an American flag , other sk@@ ul@@ ent par@@ ole against Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; my girlfriend looks at me and said , &quot; &quot; These things do not concern yourself , or ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not a Muslim ? &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot;
I have already managed these entertainment .
&quot; people with whom I work or people who have known me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar that they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; that has built themselves in their idea . &quot;
they escap@@ ed me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims .
we do not see all equal .
we do our religion differently .
we identify ourselves to be Muslim to different kind . but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim dra@@ wer .
&quot; this dra@@ wer is so well constructed in our collective imagination , as soon as Muslims , who like I do not suit there . &quot;
dischar@@ ges are to be mist@@ re@@ ated
I am not alone .
&quot; this even happened to the poet , whose poetry in America is mostly sold in America : Rum@@ i . &quot;
which images come to mind when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
&quot; when Jal@@ ā@@ l@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an orthodo@@ xer mus@@ li@@ mi@@ xer and schol@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; Islam , the Koran , and the Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the centre of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; but in the western conception the religion was er@@ ased , as it is from the most popular translations of its poetry . &quot;
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a big part of the history of 1.7 billion Muslims of this world .
another consists of the reduced pictures of Muslims the Western books have been col@@ oni@@ ze for centuries .
this temp@@ ting image language is determined by the dark man that you should fear and the exotic woman that you should save .
the pione@@ ering Palestinian scientists Edward S@@ aid was in the seven@@ ties the story behind these pictures .
but these photos stand still further forth today .
&quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood are continuing them to continue . &quot;
&quot; I have worked for thir@@ teen years in the news industry and I have seen how this powerful , faul@@ ty N@@ arr@@ ative can domin@@ ate our news@@ fe@@ eds . &quot;
&quot; this n@@ arr@@ ative over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed the reality , which have resulted in the last three decades nine Muslim women who could not even choose their first female presidential par@@ ables . &quot;
&quot; this n@@ arr@@ ative fails to acknowledge that when French , Muslim women are going to bear in public buildings and su@@ di @-@ Arab , Muslim women by their government to cover their entire body that these both are two sides of the same coin . &quot;
a powerful group practice his &quot; control &quot; on the &quot; other . &quot;
&quot; this powerful N@@ arr@@ ative we@@ aken Muslim women , which cause movements for change . &quot;
it &apos;s about it that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil of Afri@@ cans who had been brought with slave @-@ ships .
it Del@@ etes the existence of Que@@ er Muslims .
&quot; this N@@ arr@@ ative has so deeply occupied by our collective imagination , so deep and faul@@ ty occupied that often S@@ ik@@ h @-@ men and children become the goal of an@@ tim@@ us@@ ory attacks and chic@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; due to these stories we tell and about the way we tell them is Islam@@ opho@@ bia today not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; others . &quot; &quot;
1.7 billion belong to the 1.7 billion
we are doing more than just stories to tell in the news industry that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create n@@ arr@@ ative that help us to understand the world .
and my industry is meaning@@ fully to capture the N@@ arr@@ ative of 1.7 billion .
&quot; and we are here , where seven million Muslims made the highest degree of &quot; various &quot; religious group in America . &quot;
more than one third of the whole Muslim population are African @-@ based Americans .
&quot; six of ten American Muslims are among the immigrants of the first generation , coming from 77 countries . &quot;
the parents of the author in 1976 in New York .
use approved .
four decades ago my immig@@ rant parents came to live in New York to live their American dream .
&quot; my mother made her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue before and my father worked hard in the skyscrap@@ ers of New York ; skyscrap@@ ers were made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ cian from Bangladesh by the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan . &quot;
&quot; back then , when k@@ ew the sky@@ lines of the world was new , my parents had been overcome for Muslims and Americans . &quot;
&quot; yet , I am now illeg@@ itim@@ ate Mos@@ l@@ ems and Americ@@ an@@ erin ? &quot;
&quot; sometimes , if I ask people why I am not a pork , I say - instead of my mus@@ li@@ ly recipes or get my hand@@ ful diary , who carry out all Muslims with respect - &quot; &quot; Resp@@ ect to Pep@@ pa W@@ utz &quot; . &quot; &quot;
I treats , we do not carry all the pick@@ po@@ ons with us . &quot;
we must also be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or to be selected almost always for additional security che@@ ques at the airport .
&quot; there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who endeav@@ our to fight widespread lies beyond Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies are produced at the running volume of a well @-@ lubric@@ ated Islam@@ ist background , which is our already faul@@ ty image of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manip@@ ulated . &quot;
&quot; due to the stories we tell and based on the way we share it , there is Islam@@ opho@@ bia in more than just a stran@@ ger , who under@@ mines the head . &quot;
&quot; or as the start@@ ling map of attacks on mos@@ ques in the whole USA , see below . &quot;

Islam@@ opho@@ bia in its ugly forms assume our affili@@ ation .
&quot; it touches our identity , which is so extensive , so versatile and multi @-@ lay@@ ered that it can be impossible to fit into a dra@@ wer . &quot;

I would like to explain that .
&quot; I was born as a Muslim , but a Muslim was born only when I was four years old , in a pro@@ visional mosque in the basement of a Pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian Church in New York . &quot;
&quot; when soci@@ alists can describe religious life , they attack on the following terms : believe , behavior and affili@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim belief and behaviour are not always visible , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; maybe my girlfriend would see my neigh@@ bor , my neigh@@ bor , my rock in the surf , that I am Muslims when they could look through the 15 feet of concrete and air that separate our houses . &quot;
&quot; it would see the sole ritual with my daughter when I susp@@ ended them in my poor cradle and her the Arab verses , to protect the Koran , and called the Q@@ ul@@ les . &quot;
every one of them I repeat three times .
&quot; I ask that they are protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil that you cannot see . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim belief is possibly not always visible , but my Muslim membership is always part of my shadow . &quot;
&quot; the grandmother of the author , when she wins a Ik@@ eb@@ ana competition in Kar@@ achi , with her sisters at some point in the 1960s . &quot;
use approved .
&quot; affili@@ ation is the image of my grandmother , mother &apos;s mother with her sisters ; as she has been winning a contest for the art of the flower in Kar@@ achi . &quot;
&quot; it is the picture of her that I could see in this moment when I close my eyes : Nano , surrounded by their complete and un@@ finished painting , with many book@@ marks , a book with a hundred and four@@ teen chapters , which it can nearly explo@@ it . &quot;
&quot; to be Muslims means to speak prayers , who had said to speak to me if I have a bad day . &quot;
&quot; it is to be a Muslim in it , as she taught me to God : Allah M@@ ian , what God means , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a people , that - over centuries - through a &quot; &quot; Imperi@@ um &quot; &quot; colon@@ ized , which has founded a company with the name Ehr@@ worthy British Ost@@ ini@@ dien com@@ pan@@ ie , it has a deep meaning to name God , my only Lord . &quot;
the author 1987 with her grandfather .
use approved .
&quot; affili@@ ation means to grow and hear that men do not we@@ ep , but at the same time to see that my cro@@ oked grandfather wept . &quot;
&quot; zw@@ isch@@ rin , while he writes books on the modern Islam and about the independence K@@ ash@@ mir@@ s , crying N@@ ana J@@ aan un@@ f@@ aded by his family in India , K@@ ash@@ mir , family , which he could not enter into his arms in half a century . &quot;
&quot; belonging to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians whose families , as were in my grandfather , by colon@@ alists , who shared the Muslim world like the game risk . &quot;
&quot; to be a Muslim means knowing that in the last two centuries Europeans are col@@ oni@@ alized to four Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that the first fly erb@@ ow@@ ment of the story was thrown out in a century on a Muslim country , a Muslim country . &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an in@@ ald , k@@ asch@@ mir@@ ischer Unter@@ tan of the British empire , known from the newspapers of his time as &quot; &quot; dangerous &quot; , &quot; as he was the first mosque in England . &quot;
&quot; even before it existed , he traveled to more parts of the world than I ever was and pre@@ ached the radical word of love , peace and social justice . &quot;

to my Muslim strain of 1.7 billion to belong deeply into our unforgettable family rooms ; our un@@ plug@@ ging history .
&quot; it means remember@@ ing that four@@ teen years the m@@ igh@@ ti@@ est military in the world , with troops being divided over every continent apart from the Antarc@@ tic , divided in Iraq to meet mass destruction that were not exist@@ ential . &quot;
knowing that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried among the ruins of the war .
&quot; to be an American Muslim Br@@ ma , knowing that the su@@ icide rate among veter@@ ans since 2001 increased by more than 32 percent . &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that when a tragedy is based on the U.S. and carries a Muslim name , the history of four times more will be reported as a story with a white ass@@ ass@@ le . &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that four@@ teen years ago the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called a liber@@ ated black slave by the name Bil@@ al . &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that two hundred years ago a African Islam@@ ist , called Bil@@ ali Muhammad and this country has been brought into this country . &quot;
it means Mal@@ col@@ m X to name a American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people fight the airports to fight against the Muslim B@@ an .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black life .
&quot; a Americ@@ ana , a Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ erin , a K@@ asch@@ mir@@ i , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Muslim and a journalist , the inherent inter@@ se@@ tion@@ ality of our with multic@@ olo@@ red con@@ stri@@ ches den@@ ies , but to fail to communicate them to others . &quot;
&quot; the ar@@ arr@@ ative of 1.7 billion has more possibilities than a sor@@ cer@@ er , but is represented in the reduced branch of &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; against &quot; &quot; it &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; his mother means to care for my child and to build all Muslim children , well @-@ knowing that powerful and privileged people er@@ ect on this branch of structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia is divided into the Muslim tab@@ s , which began with President Bush and extended by President Obama . &quot;
it consists in per@@ si@@ ent monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists in the immig@@ rant workers who takes a five year old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it is in a country that includes its borders to people from just the countries that bom@@ bed it .
it is a false and neb@@ ulous &quot; no @-@ fly @-@ list &quot; which takes largely Arabs and Muslims in sight .
they are the wars that we lead and the bom@@ bs we ab@@ stain on Muslim countries .
&quot; due to the stories we tell and due to those who we are not telling , we are here today . &quot;
&quot; in a study with the title Asc@@ ent of Man , scientists of the North@@ western University of participants showed a scienti@@ fic@@ ally un@@ real picture and b@@ ying them , groups on a scale of 1 to 100 in terms of evolution . &quot;
Muslims got the lowest score .
the con@@ vers@@ ations which we have to lead
&quot; we are too deeply dar@@ ing to reveal the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; others &quot; . &quot; &quot;
we have decades back to recognize the roots of our fears and be the faul@@ ty and dangerous expression expression which we promise in our news .
&quot; at least , there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry , trying to capture our multiple with conn@@ ective ident@@ ities and forgotten history . &quot;

&quot; but I am concerned due to this difficult global point , where we are located . &quot;
and that moment has consequences that go over 1.7 billion .
&quot; there is a reason for this conspiracy the@@ or@@ ist , which existed in the dark corners of the internet , now run the White House . &quot;
they have grown exp@@ on@@ entially because they have made Muslims too .
&quot; there is another group that has grown exp@@ on@@ entially by using the &quot; &quot; other &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a few years ago , it had not yet been given ; now they domin@@ ate large areas in Syria and Iraq . &quot;
&quot; I am concerned about the real@@ ities and the story of which I was not aware of as I was as old now , as it is now my daughter , but today I have made me an un@@ disp@@ uted Muslim . &quot;
things I have left here like a bread@@ cru@@ m@@ ff in my speech .
&quot; things that might wake up memories , because in all the inter@@ sections that makes our humanity like a story , where someone is made to another . &quot;
&quot; right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , will take place in the part of the 8th annual conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; more than hundred academ@@ ics speak about our problems with the &quot; &quot; other &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; structural rac@@ ism &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; American militar@@ ism &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , these are no terms with which we usually throw in our schools around us or which we read in our newspapers . &quot;

we all must ask ourselves why ?
&quot; why did I tell this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are led and people affected by the work of the &quot; other &quot; in public conception , four decades even the scientist of Stan@@ ford . &quot;
&quot; we have to ask ourselves in@@ convenient questions according to the role of what is aware of and un@@ consci@@ ously , &quot; others &quot; , &quot; as it &apos;s my girlfriend and I did in rain during the Women &apos;s March , as he did not bombar@@ ded into a new future where he already capit@@ ated to other countries and &quot; to others , &quot; goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion . &quot;
it starts with all of us .
initiative for narr@@ atives wants to preserve Urban Environments

&quot; can there be a way , here and now in spite of a language barrier to anyone ? &quot;
&quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Perry , founder of the initiative Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) is the yield of stories in their original language a possible answer to it . &quot;
&quot; global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative of Steven Bird , the transl@@ atable blog . &quot;
&quot; however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to get the language variety of great cities and to honour . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in Oak@@ land , where T@@ LS has already been carried out events since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite so small languages are not passed to the children there . &quot;
for the creators of the project apply :
&quot; the mass mort@@ ality of the languages of the world may be avoided when we are able to accept diversity - secure spaces , in which inhabitants do not need to forget who they are to be al@@ located . &quot;
&quot; while listening is often connected to this , understanding , &quot; understanding these events instead &quot; &quot; listen , to appreciate , to feel . &quot;
in this format we face their story first in their own language and translate or expl@@ aining them in English .
&quot; even if the participants are not a professional stor@@ yt@@ ellers , their dev@@ otion and their representation is that the listen@@ er is aimed at that time . &quot;
they call laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier .
&quot; the following video shows for example a traditional history from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round the stor@@ yt@@ eller ra@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou will also explain the opportunity to explain the typical country &apos;s typical customs of narrative . &quot;
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the F@@ abel from the Has@@ an and P@@ avian in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
&quot; after he has declared the meaning of his cable , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is that to speak to an audience that does not understand your language ? &quot; with a wide gr@@ in@@ sen he shares his sense of inclusi@@ veness : &quot;
you have heard !
you were attentive ...
you were very happy with me !
&quot; so far , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling have taken place in three cities and the organizers hope to extend this . all who are inspired by the project can get in contact with T@@ LS in order to organize their own lay@@ ered tours . &quot;

this is their demand :
&quot; the people of Puerto Rico calls for the politicians , politicians and government agencies responsible for the deb@@ ts to be held responsible for their cor@@ rupt . &quot;
&quot; we demand a financial test and a leadership committee without personal interests in public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions appropriate re@@ mun@@ er@@ ation , which acts in favor of the economy . &quot;
we will pressed and oppressed .
&quot; the people of Puerto Ric@@ os refused to pay a fault , which is not thei@@ rs . &quot;
we will not choose between education and health .
our pension@@ ers will not be able to decline .
we demand immediate measures .
the island - not to the State @-@ State of the United States - is suffering from a severe financial crisis .
&quot; thus , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a rule @-@ independent non @-@ profit organisation with a focus on the socio @-@ economic development , a law on the socio @-@ economic development , a law on public responsibility , as an alternative to existing state supervision . &quot;
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis in Puerto Ric@@ os requires a wide le@@ ver@@ turing of state infrastructure .
extern@@ ally imposed measures are imposed without the participation and conviction of the citizen of danger to be rejected by the people .

&quot; the Syrian @-@ Palestinian Web@@ development Bass@@ a Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year . &quot;
but he is not forgotten .
&quot; more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , he continued his supporters and members of the campaign for his freedom and remember the posts that he has done for an open network . &quot;
&quot; this year &apos;s re : public@@ a , the annual conference on digital culture , which is organized in Berlin , dedicated to an event of the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign . &quot;
&quot; Mé@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist in France based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , Managing Director of Book Spr@@ ints , a publisher of the book Cost of Freedom : a Coll@@ ective In@@ quiry ( The cost of freedom : a collective research ) . &quot;
&quot; the book , which was published last year and available for roy@@ alty , contains a number of papers that deal with free culture in the face of repression . &quot;
it is an hom@@ age to bass and his work .
in the introduction there is :
&quot; this book wants to discuss how movements are built for free knowledge and what the true cost is , with which this is connected . &quot;
&quot; activists , artists , designer , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge , have a side to check out about the fo@@ g that surround our news@@ fe@@ eds and to create some sense from our different experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to liber@@ ate Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and ac@@ coun@@ cils Internet volunteers , who started in Syria since 15 March 2012 . &quot;
his name was painted from the directory of the A@@ dra pris@@ oner in which he sat on 3 October 2015 .
&quot; since then , we have no information on his current state or location . &quot;
&quot; the intro@@ duc@@ tory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice that will push for his release , and want to know him back in his normal life and freedom . &quot;
&quot; to see how b@@ ass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us begin to think about their own dest@@ in@@ ies , deeds and decisions . &quot;
why are we here ?
what did we choose from ?
what have we given up in this process of time @-@ wise extreme beliefs ?
the Web@@ developer for Open Source and digital activ@@ ist has been in the cust@@ ody of Syrian government agencies .
&quot; in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was born from the A@@ dra @-@ prison , a non @-@ military establishment , an unknown place . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer , N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the &quot; military police b@@ ass@@ el were based on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military tri@@ bun@@ al of his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi reported , she was contacted on 12 November 2015 by people who presented themselves as an in@@ sider of the Assad government and put them knowledge of an alleged death part against their husband . &quot;
his wher@@ e@@ ab@@ outs and condition remain unknown .
&quot; a pioneer of the Creative Commons involved in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in which access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a Designer , Techn@@ ologist , and currently the leader of the head of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project called Bass@@ el , writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
&quot; maybe , none of Bas@@ sels cultural prot@@ otypes pre@@ conceived as the work that he started with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to re@@ constructed the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras . &quot;
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important arche@@ ological sites in the world , was the cross @-@ cross of numerous civi@@ lizations , and found Greek @-@ Roman architecture and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; b@@ ass@@ el could not know that ten years after he began working with this work , the IS all began to put all this architecture that is not only em@@ bo@@ died just the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world . &quot;
this ste@@ aming into the digital arche@@ ology and conservation has created a time @-@ kap@@ sel that will be in@@ valuable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
&quot; so , Bass@@ el could not yet close this project yet . &quot;
&quot; N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison : &quot;
&quot; I have spent my overall life to dream of liberty and bass , taught me to embrace her . &quot;
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
&quot; Bass@@ el brought me English at , even when he was in cust@@ ody . &quot;
&quot; I learned to read English well , write and speak . &quot;
&quot; he has always shared his knowledge with each one who asked him . he taught others who taught them in English , to write and speak . &quot;
Bass@@ el has opened the gate to the technology . he taught me to use both computer and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
&quot; he also brought other incar@@ nations as they use computer , at least theore@@ tically , without having held them in their hands . &quot;
G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( War@@ ten ) a pro@@ ver that she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 her husband when he was in prison .
Bass@@ el and N@@ oura have worked together for a year long in the book .
&quot; she sm@@ ug@@ ged the lyrics to him when she visited him , and he put them out of the Arabic into English . &quot;
the book is licensed .

here an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It happens &quot; :
it happens with every visit ;
&quot; that I have failed in the world of your charming eyes , &quot;
&quot; that I lose the reflection at the moment in which we embrace , &quot;
that any of the dangers are no matter of danger
each of the f@@ ences and guards
I forget the cr@@ ush of the prison
and I dr@@ ills in every detail your voice and words
whom I tr@@ age with passion for me
when your eyes are saying ?
and I will leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I swi@@ ft@@ ly return to my lon@@ eliness .
to return all the moments
and through your absence to we@@ ep and smile .
I survived myself that I will return soon ...
on the first anniversary of the b@@ ass@@ el of Bass@@ el wrote G@@ ha@@ zi :
&quot; one year passed , my soul &quot;

Bas@@ sels History is not unique in Syria .
&quot; since the beginning of the protests 2011 against the regime Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad , according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Sy@@ ris@@ ky network for human rights ) have disappeared more than 6@@ 5,000 people . &quot;
&quot; those who were arrested or pun@@ ished under violence through the regime were tort@@ ured , or even executed . &quot;
&quot; since 2011 , the international human rights organisation Am@@ nest@@ y International has died at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Sy@@ rer in Haf@@ t since 2011 . &quot;
the stories of many more people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ a since 2012 .
&quot; today , we repeat our call in hope that we must do this for the last time . &quot;
Mozambique : because of corruption made director of cust@@ ody and re@@ sign@@ ation .
Mozambique has re@@ acted with anger at a cor@@ rupt attack on which a government member after half of his sentence has returned to the workplace in the state apparatus on which the corruption was committed .
&quot; it is about Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , arrested in 2008 and in 2010 together with four other def@@ endants ref@@ us@@ hed by 54 million Me@@ tik@@ al ( about 800 000 Euro ) to 22 years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; the money was from public funds from the airports of Mozambique , whose advice was Cam@@ b@@ aza between 2005 and 2008 . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza has been released in 2016 for good guidance , and immediately called its re @-@ position into the company , which happened on 19 April at the end of April . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with the opinion of the General Office of the Republic , which grant the application , there would be no barriers to Cam@@ b@@ aza , again to refer to his old posts , as the company did not pro@@ gres@@ sed after its cust@@ ody . &quot;
&quot; however , many inhabitants are not good . &quot;
&quot; the Centre for Public integrity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution committed to public transparency , distributed in an interview with the Deutsche Welle made the decision of the company to address the director : &quot;
represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and decl@@ ined the lack of transparency and is even a retreat in relation to the efforts of our legal system so that C@@ IP .
what we need to know is that the company should have a discipl@@ ination against the dis@@ rup@@ tive procedure .
&quot; however , the firm were apparently and causes no proper legal steps for applying the relevant functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Mos@@ ambique of social media , this behavior also decl@@ ined and regards the case as &quot; contra@@ dic@@ tory &quot; : &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ b@@ aza would be a competent guy , he would be advis@@ er after he was sent@@ enced to a prison sentence and it was half away . &quot;
he might hold paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speech@@ es ; he could advise and be more polished .
&quot; but since he is in@@ competent , he has vent@@ ured to re@@ integrate into the company which he helped damage . &quot;
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza is to be paid for its silence .
contra@@ dic@@ tory !
&quot; Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mozambique and student of political sciences in Brazil says , the director poss@@ esses no mor@@ als : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza is rewarded by the state because he revi@@ ved it , I cannot believe that one rewards someone in such a way that the state has already been so massive . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza is missing the mor@@ als and serve the state , * he had already served a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead only served themselves by the state . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza used the state as a hand@@ ele , it has become a in@@ exhau@@ stible money source and the state itself has become tired of this man who has condemned and finally sent@@ enced to a long prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; honestly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded . &quot;
Fran@@ c@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te prefer to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique and Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el to remind you that a th@@ ief are heard in prison :
&quot; th@@ iev@@ es belong to the prison of Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , the Mozambique has not only be remembered as the first independent president , but also as a sharp , cut and next door - prophes@@ ied . &quot;
&quot; one of his most famous oral represent@@ ations was , when he was energetic , that &quot; an ambitious person is capable of being able to sell the fa@@ ther@@ land for its amb@@ itions , his own individual interest . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ora said , &quot; &quot; I do not know if an ambitious person changes , my experience reveals that it is not so . he changes the tactics , but it does not change from its amb@@ itions . &quot;
an ambitious man is at the same time criminal . &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also dis@@ appearing :
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza was sent@@ enced to 22 years in prison , he sat 10 years and came free . &quot;
&quot; and today it puts him the company , in which he was per@@ mis@@ erable , back under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ OM@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - Person@@ alized War@@ riors : ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) 12 May 2017

&quot; Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cen@@ sored many users to un@@ right
the Bur@@ mes@@ an word &quot; Kal@@ ar Pa@@ e &quot; means her@@ ed@@ itary or sp@@ age .
&quot; photo of San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Wikipedia Commons , Creative Commons Attri@@ bution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ port@@ ed &quot;
&quot; according to details of Facebook users in Myanmar , the popular social network took its posts from the net , because it contains the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; although the origin of the word is still unclear , it is usually used to refer to humans at the Eastern Indian origin or generally referred to as ad@@ j@@ ective . &quot;
&quot; Facebook cen@@ sored the word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; or do not use the word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; or a part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of the hate language in Burma in the social network . &quot;
in recent years the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements gave the word an extremely low @-@ value caus@@ ation .
&quot; in particular , it is a word which is usually used by Ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as a hate speech against Muslims , which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in an effort , fight @-@ hate speech in Myanmar , the company has a lot of sensu@@ al content on its platform cen@@ sored . &quot;
&quot; Kal@@ ar &apos;s is usually associated with rac@@ ism , but the word itself is not automatically forth @-@ hate speech . &quot;
&quot; the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that also po@@ sts in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts over the use of his usage . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there are several Bur@@ mes@@ an words with fundamental mean@@ ings that have the same letter @-@ sequence such as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , chair is written on Bur@@ mes@@ an even &apos; Kal@@ ar ht@@ a@@ ing &apos; , as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar Pa@@ e &apos; ( age ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar o@@ at &apos; ( Kam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the Fac@@ ebook@@ us@@ ability A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at declared the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of one of my friends today was er@@ ased because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; however , he had asked his friends in a spiritual way whether they might w@@ üs@@ st how he could re@@ lie@@ ve his back pain . &quot;
&quot; the phrase ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( la ) on Bur@@ mes@@ isch - resem@@ bles the r@@ acial expression very , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
&quot; Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is the opinion that they need to reduce hate @-@ language nation@@ alists , but also emphas@@ ised that Facebook must be analytical , before it all po@@ sts cr@@ ashes in suspic@@ ion of rac@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; Facebook Del@@ etes the word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; is not manually . &quot;
it fil@@ tered the word automatically .
autom@@ atism will not understand what you write to Fac@@ be@@ ook .
&quot; what it should be done instead , the post is carefully to analyse and control it by checking the next words . &quot;
for example &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar Pa@@ e &quot; ( age ) .
&quot; the good is that these three @-@ sto@@ rey nation@@ alists , spread the hate language , have received a pretty good lesson . &quot;
&quot; now , it is time to circum@@ cis@@ ed her nation@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; while the action may send a strong signal to all , the hate language may spread , the efficiency of this strategy does not last long . &quot;
&quot; the experiences of social networks in China like S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of keywords often will start a k@@ atz@@ e- and mouse game , whereby the users will start to use social networks to express a new word or an alternative writing of the cen@@ sored word to express their views . &quot;
&quot; the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to delete his po@@ sts as he wanted to tell his friends , that the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; is ban@@ ished from the social network : &quot;
&quot; when I was aware of this new directive by Facebook , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and me became the li@@ ken , post and parts of content for 24 hours , because the post &quot; Facebook Community standards has not been correspon@@ ded . &quot;
&quot; Facebook has a variety of po@@ sts away from people who have no negative intentions or those just try to show off their opinions against the hate , radi@@ cal@@ al nation@@ alists . &quot;
Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed that nothing has to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post the author shared his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
&quot; Chan My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have more to do before the beginning of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ mes@@ an Internet community ask for advice : &quot;
&quot; Facebook likes to have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intent to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma through their platform , but it does not work . &quot;
such words must be cen@@ sored only more hate within the various communities .
&quot; moreover , it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and so words as &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; inher@@ ited cur@@ ry &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even when they found out that they did not make mistakes , they did not tried to manip@@ ulate the dist@@ orted posts . &quot;
&quot; if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefit , which would sei@@ ze them a big sales , that would be great . &quot;
Fac@@ ebooks automatic c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship is provided for a lot of ridi@@ cu@@ le under the users .
&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users are talking about Facebook funny and write the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in the context of hate speech to see if their po@@ sts are taken from the network . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots from Facebook @-@ Po@@ sts , which contains no hate speech , but nevertheless they were still removed : &quot;
with permission .

&quot; just to try out if Facebook contains the post , which contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;

&quot; in the last five years , extreme nation@@ alistic ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists who have used social networks to expand their voices and their influence . &quot;
&quot; among other things , hate speech in social networks found violence in Burma in addition to domestic , especially in the area of R@@ akh@@ ine , where conflicts between Muslims and Budd@@ hist@@ s have forced thousands to escape . &quot;
&quot; Facebook was for his failure , the young @-@ flo@@ ating hate speak to his bur@@ ese sides under control , critic@@ ised . &quot;
&quot; but instead of addressing the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better running in context than on code focused initiatives and learned from them . &quot;
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tobago is end up with the children
a wedding ring on the sand .

the nur@@ sery is in Trinidad and Tobago now illeg@@ ally .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament adopted by the country un@@ anim@@ ously decided to ban this practice , so that the married age should now be at 18 . &quot;
&quot; in May 2016 , brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mahar@@ aja , and in May 2016 , brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mahar@@ aja , leader of the inter @-@ religious organization ( IR@@ O ) , a group , representatives of the various religious groups of the country that the state does not inter@@ ming@@ le , as this , age does not have the maturity . &quot;
&quot; this happened regardless of the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contrac@@ tual partner of the UN &apos;s rights law , the minority @-@ year @-@ old as , &quot; every human being under 18 years &quot; defined . &quot;
&quot; statistics from the UN for the year 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children who were already married , in Trinidad and Tobago 2.@@ 8 percent was , and with 18 were 8.@@ 1 percent . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 the statistical headquarters of the country was confirmed that from 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys under 19 were married . &quot;
&quot; online pet@@ itions and social media movements that were best to go to the children &apos;s before , followed in the foot and rejo@@ iced with great support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring this result . &quot;
&quot; nonetheless , not everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; for example , a Hind@@ u @-@ guide such had no concern to say the critics of the children &apos;s before they should say , dam@@ n &apos;t take care of their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition provided for tensions in this actually un@@ complicated cause , and at some point came doubts whether the opposition would not agree to the law . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of 2017 , the bill was decided against the children &apos;s before - despite 4 Sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent who could be discussed in the representative office where a simple majority would make him a law . &quot;
&quot; now only the president of the country agree , and the law must be pro@@ claim . &quot;
one of the Sen@@ ators of the country gave Facebook an status update which has again posted Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ ag@@ ram :
Mr Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence R@@ amb@@ har@@ at : the bill introduced against the children of children was decided in the representative office with 35 votes and no one other against it .
&quot; after having agreed in the Senate , the design can now become a law . &quot;
the majority of the Social @-@ Media User was enthusiastic because the laws had finally been changed to children &apos;s .
&quot; Facebook @-@ Member Lov@@ ell Francis , who was cl@@ ot@@ hed in the Ministry of Education , said : &quot;
&quot; it has too much time and un@@ necessary straight@@ ens needed to dev@@ ise the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the children &apos;s before is in Trinidad and Tobago now illegal , and this is almost any cost . &quot;
&quot; while Abel Jackson of the opinion , I was definitely long enough to create the practice , Lara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas survived that the day was finally come : &quot;
&quot; public status update on Facebook of Lara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , said , &quot;
the Eh@@ eg@@ es@@ etz has been decided .
&quot; minimum - 18 , voices - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WIN@@ AD ) , a civil society that said quite openly about it , how important the adoption of the law was , noted : &quot;
the married age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of the religious affili@@ ation of 18 years .
&quot; the design to change the sp@@ ouses was today , on 9 June 2017 , decided . &quot;
in the House of Represent@@ atives there are 41 members and it was here 35 at the vote .
&quot; all members , who were against them have voted for the law . &quot;
the nur@@ ture is in Trinidad and Tobago are no longer allowed .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # child@@ mar@@ ri@@ age@@ isch@@ au@@ ge .
many thanks to all activists who have challeng@@ ed him .
congratulations .
a thanks to our members .
&quot; but a potential h@@ ooks comes in the form of Sat Mahar@@ aja , the Secretary General of San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most known Hind@@ u organization of the country . &quot;
&quot; months ago Mahar@@ aja has announced its intention to undertake judi@@ cial steps , the law should be adopted , and he seems to be its promises now . &quot;
&quot; during the Secretary @-@ General Paris Al ra@@ wi , a supp@@ orter of the law , thought it would be quite just@@ ly , if Mahar@@ aja wants to move against the law , most social media users wish to approach the debate on the subject . &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ rell suggested :
&quot; dear Sat , if we , instead of discussion out of discussion , in a way that only panic and dis@@ grace may be assumed that the State , our daughters cannot talk about the problem that they may be of large , persistent males , which are against them in the advantage , they would be ready to continue the discussion ? &quot;
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
&quot; but if there is now a judi@@ cial procedure against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where the children &apos;s in different gra@@ d@@ ations legal or continue to be standard , although there are laws that they tell . &quot;

&quot; while the platform remains locked , there are now several mir@@ ror@@ pages ( pages , which reflect the contents of Wikipedia and frequently updated ) . &quot;
&quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform used all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centralized pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( i.e. PC calcul@@ ator ) , which does not base itself on the system of domain names and thus a complete c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship . &quot;
the content is available in spite of legal pro@@ hibition but .
in a blog@@ post IP@@ FS reports about its efforts :
&quot; after we have heard the messages ( on the block from Wikipedia ) , we put everything about snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , the possibility of reading the content on de@@ centralized and distributed manner . &quot;
&quot; this can help the users to see at least all Wikipedia content , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ en.@@ itself . &quot;
&quot; IP@@ FS was also present that this step has been performed independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and there are only screen@@ shots , and no live versions of the website . &quot;
&quot; however , Vik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to get the lock . &quot;
&quot; Crist@@ ian Con@@ son@@ ni from Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ o@@ .org , a mir@@ ror@@ page from Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mir@@ ror@@ page , if in the respective country Wikipedia is locked . &quot;
Con@@ son@@ ni told Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices member and members of Mozilla in the Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; Pod@@ cast :
&quot; it is not a complete copy of a proxy @-@ ad@@ ress , a mir@@ ror . &quot;
&quot; access to another URL , which is not the original one . that which one can see is from Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; essentially the server dire@@ cts the request to the right Wikipedia side , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia even then when they are locked in Turkey . &quot;
&quot; for this is executed by a server , which is not in Turkey . &quot;

&quot; Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photographs he saw around , never satisfied . they were bl@@ ur@@ ry with po@@ orly sent mot@@ ives and washed @-@ washed colors . &quot;
the motivated him yourself a camera to wear and try to walk the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
&quot; today , at the age of 28 years , Sag@@ ar , Nep@@ al@@ ese endeav@@ ors to bring to the international scene at the age of 28 . &quot;
&quot; and his hom@@ etown right next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offering it the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to Nep@@ al@@ dic animal world . &quot;
he described on Facebook as he helps him this first class position in his work :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Parks , a world heritage . what could there be better for a passionate wildlife photography ! &quot;
I just rested at home when I suddenly called to Navar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan Gai@@ da Lodge ) . he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rap@@ ti River was a le@@ op@@ ard .
the river dam@@ m is just a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran out with my camera and was there in a few minutes there .
&quot; my father has watched him and showed me the place on the other river , where the le@@ op@@ ard was found and I immediately began to cr@@ ush pictures ! ! &quot;
&quot; Sag@@ ar seeks cooperation with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for Nept@@ une Nature and want to deep@@ en understanding that wild animals are not so fright@@ ening , as they look . &quot;
&quot; and he should know , because he stood tiger already from face to face , &quot;
a tiger can not be disturbed by the opinion of sheep ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
&quot; also I was home because of the darkness on the way home , when suddenly the king of the Bu@@ he@@ ks appeared . he immediately felt , we see ourselves and he sti@@ ff me through the Sal trees ! &quot;
&quot; to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar the logo &quot; I click for &quot; &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos . &quot;
but his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ al@@ ese nature and wildlife is not always easy .
&quot; he wa@@ ited for 22 days long , and mostly lived in a tent to make in Bar@@ dia National Park recordings of Ot@@ tern . up to 12 days it lasted until he took a tiger photograph and six to seven days for the perfect picture of birds , which live close to the tourist accommodations . &quot;

&quot; this article was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on Video Volunte@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community organization from India . &quot;
a revised version was published here as part of a content sharing agreement .
&quot; in many parts of India , women avoid women with the utmost care , the name of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family . &quot;
instead they use a pron@@ oun or say &apos; father of my child .
&quot; from Ch@@ hatt@@ is@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ as@@ ht@@ ra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h give women to respect her to the social pressure of the husband , as well as fear of the consequences they should pay the norm in their lives . &quot;
&quot; last year Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was condemned from the Indian state of O@@ ham@@ a , and destroyed by her family and the village of the village , after they had raised a raised relative with names . &quot;
&quot; the tradition of their wives also does not call themselves on behalf of the name , is also common among men . however , they have far fewer assign@@ ments to fear if at all , they should not get this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ as@@ ht@@ ra , nine women , including health sper@@ son@@ al , as well as house@@ wives , a unique club , and thus quickly became the main theme of the city . &quot;
it is a place only for them alone when they discuss and discuss the int@@ ric@@ acies of the patri@@ archy .
&quot; as one of 56 clubs , which there are in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the Community Video Volunte@@ ers and advoc@@ ates the reduction of the patri@@ archy . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was has been working with the help of their video camera on the un@@ covering of practices such as children &apos;s hei@@ rs to the exile of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ In@@ infected , and leads these clubs . &quot;
&quot; they reported how these clubs have created a safe place for these women , and they made them at the same time as an amb@@ assador of change . &quot;
&quot; the first video , the Roh@@ ini showed in its discussion , acted by women who don &apos;t name their hus@@ bands . &quot;
she decided on this subject because she wanted to open talks about the patri@@ archy with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves .
&quot; he did not speak according to the name of their hus@@ bands , is a bre@@ aker he considers it to be inno@@ cent and never put into question . &quot;
Roh@@ ini writes :
this tradition demonstrates that a woman respected her husband and wish him a long life .
a woman who does not hold this is considered to be a post@@ eri@@ ous as a woman without mor@@ als .
the tradition is so deeply rooted in that we have never made thoughts up to this discussion .
&quot; at the beginning , Roh@@ ini wanted to have never called her husband so far in the name of how it was going to try at home as it runs . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband wei@@ gh for a long time after the video was at the end .
&quot; Pra@@ k@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said , I should name him from now on his name . &quot;
with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage the Roh@@ ini started its first discussion .
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; never before . some believed that there was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women . &quot;
at the beginning of the lap Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h .
&quot; after the vide@@ o@@ projection , the women attemp@@ ted to bring discussion with an exercise in motion . &quot;
&quot; sab@@ ini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with various feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on . &quot;
&quot; then she asked all , &quot; If we cannot say the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us how they want us , meaning that they do not respect us ? &quot;
should it not be equal ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when they brought the name of their hus@@ bands across the lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ as@@ ht@@ ra about the breaks of a centuries @-@ old tradition , in married women should never speak the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot;
Roh@@ ini tells :
&quot; a woman was so shy , that she went during the whole exercise just before himself ; another decided to let the whole rose frustration against him and his family by making him c@@ ursed . &quot;
the expression of their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; even in adren@@ alin on it , having broken down with an ancient br@@ ace , the women decided that they would actually try to name their hus@@ bands in the name . &quot;
and they held their word .
in the next days Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports .
&quot; the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini , and asked what ideas they sat down in the head : his wife could not stop his name . &quot;
another club member chose to do it for dinner before the entire family .
&quot; when her mother @-@ in @-@ law she was rigi@@ d , she got afraid and said that it was a mistake . &quot;
&quot; a different woman said , &quot; Roh@@ ini said , I should do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant in was less understanding and the situation art@@ ed in violence .
&quot; Roh@@ ini reports how women tries to stop other practices , such as the Tr@@ agen of the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot on the forehead that shows the spouse : &quot;
why do only women have to show that they are married ?
&quot; I said to my husband , that I would bear the van@@ ish red dot if he did . &quot;
&quot; he laugh@@ ed only and I listened to him to carry him . &quot;
&quot; the other women have not heard completely with it , but my , they are now in a better position to choose , even to bear it in some days . &quot;
&quot; for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we do a trip at any discussion club . &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; I do not want the women to worry , who could hear what could hear . &quot;
in the last few months they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes ; they d@@ anced and talking about things that they had never had thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have talked about some things , for example , like our ident@@ ities to our hus@@ bands , have never been so honest . &quot;
&quot; it feels great to say certain things according to , no matter how small they occur . &quot;
&quot; in a discussion , we talk about the concept of honor and how it is connected to the clothes . &quot;
some women in the group have borne only Sar@@ is in the group since their marriage .
&quot; for most of them the okay , but some wanted a sal@@ ist cur@@ ta , a wide shirt about a pants , wear ; they have not been dre@@ amed . &quot;
&quot; after much argument and discussion about the benefits of your own clos@@ eness , mor@@ ality associated with the Sar@@ is and much more , tasted Roh@@ ini its own pair of Kur@@ t@@ as ( Ober@@ inhibit@@ ing ) into a discussion lap so that the women could carry them . &quot;
&quot; next , they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can carry je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is certain that they can create it . &quot;
&quot; on the question , whether in the five months have already changed a little time in the five months since their first panel , Roh@@ ini confirms that things slowly get into roles : &quot;
we have so far taken small steps so far .
&quot; some women tried it a few times , but then listened to the name of her spouse . &quot;
&quot; some , including me , make it yet , but only if they are alone and no other family members . &quot;
only one or two shall continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now bear at any time Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their forehead .
the women in the disc@@ ussi@@ onist know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - as the f@@ aint of more freedom of movement or her own clos@@ ets - at the end of a difficult to navig@@ ate river .
&quot; by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they will be aware that they sit in the same boat . &quot;
how Roh@@ ini explained :
each of us is a victim of the patri@@ archy .
I am too .
&quot; but this club gives each of us confidence , that something will change . &quot;
&quot; and I know that it is not just limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction , when every woman goes home in the club and other people reported what we talk about and what we do . &quot;
we are all sitting in the same boat .

a photo of Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Liu X@@ ia which was probably just recently made .
this story was originally published on 8 July 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the pris@@ oned Chinese Dis@@ ci@@ dents Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has moved into the international community of attention after his lawyer at the end of June he had been delivered to hospital due to Leb@@ erk@@ re@@ bs at the end of June .
&quot; in 2009 Liu were sent@@ enced to eleven years in prison for &quot; &quot; Subversion &quot; &quot; after compl@@ eting himself on the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o which has requested the democratic reforms in China . &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; the Ministry of State in China has Li@@ us case referred to as &quot; an internal matter , &quot; and a spokes@@ man said it is not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot;
&quot; however , China will continue to receive calls from the international community , the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and his wife , poet Liu X@@ ia , free or give him a treatment abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of the pa@@ ares in Beijing , others are fully exploited . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
United Nations
&quot; Sel@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the High Commissioner of United Nations for Human Rights , met by the end of June Chinese officials to discuss the case of Liu . &quot;
&quot; however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment if the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure to allow Liu abroad . &quot;
Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ing have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
&quot; the relationship between China and Norway fell into the impact after the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 , although the Norwegian government dis@@ ap@@ ed that this is ultimately nothing to do with the decision . &quot;
&quot; the diplomatic relations have only been continued in December last year . only in June , Norway had signed an agreement , in order to go back to China , since the exports since 2010 were mostly blocked . &quot;
&quot; after the news was pre@@ valent , the Nobel Committee brought his hope for unconditional release to an expression and lu@@ d Liu , to pick up his prize in Oslo . &quot;
because of its det@@ ention he was unable to receive his prize .
&quot; during the ceremony , Liu was represented by an empty chair . &quot;
European Union
&quot; on July 6 , the European Parliament adopted a decision in which China was asked to liber@@ ate Liu and his wife immediately from the house arrest and allow him to seek medical support , where he wants . &quot;
&quot; the leading diplomatic city of the EU , Federica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for the release of Li@@ us , as described in an Declaration on 30 June : &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we expect China to lift all restrictions of Mr. Li@@ us wife and family . &quot;
&quot; you should meet all the visits and receive , who wish them , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world . &quot;
USA ( USA )
&quot; U.S. Ambassador Terry Bran@@ stad announced that the Americans wish him that he has the opportunity for treatment abroad , in@@ so@@ jour@@ ned with it in his satisfaction . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ person in the US Emb@@ assy in China , Mary Beth Poll@@ ey , announced the news agency AFP for June 27 , that the message will liber@@ ate the Chinese authorities , but also to liber@@ ate his wife Liu X@@ ia from her house arrest . &quot;
&quot; the call of US Emb@@ assy moved an angry response from China to itself , with the utter@@ ance of the foreign ministry that &quot; no country have the right to initi@@ ate and un@@ answer@@ able comments about Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Poll@@ ey shared with that China should offer the following couple :
&quot; protection and freedom such as free speech and access to the medical care of its choice , which they claim according to Chinese Constitution and legal system as well as international obligations . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Mer@@ kl@@ ey and Ted Cruz also introduced a decision in Congress to turn the Chinese government to pushing forward Liu and his wife un@@ conditi@@ onally . &quot;
&quot; I urge China to free the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ator # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ conditi@@ onally , so that he can move into a proper medical treatment . http : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o &quot;
Germany
&quot; the German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on 3 July , Berlin hope that Liu &quot; all the medical support he needed &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot;
the Chinese president Xi Jin@@ ping was published on 7 and 8 July at the G@@ 20 Summit in Hamburg .
&quot; previously reported diplomatic sources in Beijing of the news agency Reu@@ ters that China had great concerns , whether the vort@@ ex around Liu could be over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owing to the visit in Hamburg . &quot;
Canada
&quot; on 28 June , the Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um to give China to provide an adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to make himself from his family . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ us An@@ ouk told AFP that Li@@ us Ms , Liu X@@ ia who could visit him every day but the police are always monitored breakfast and that it is not permitted to speak with someone outside , including its lawyers , to speak and contact . &quot;
Mc@@ Call@@ um tells you about :
&quot; Canada calls on China to commit its international human rights violations , including freedom of expression , and the free movement for the exercise of these rights input . &quot;
France
France &apos;s Foreign Ministry requested China in a statement on 29 June to liber@@ ate Liu for humanitarian reasons :
&quot; all necessary measures have to be taken to ensure that Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o all treatments will receive , regardless of where , needed . furthermore , his wife and family have to contact him . &quot;
&quot; although the New@@ cht@@ ens@@ ender France Info reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was announced that there will be no further information out of France . &quot;
Taiwan
&quot; the Council of the festival in Taiwan called for China on 27 June , Liu , and to show a greater tolerance to those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development . &quot;
&quot; the tai@@ w@@ anese legislation , Yu Me@@ i @-@ nu from the ruling Democratic Pro@@ gress Party also called for China to allow the cran@@ ial intellectual Liu to deal in Taiwan . &quot;
the Dalai Lama
&quot; the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed themselves very concerned in an explanation on 28 June at Liu , and gave us that many have asked him to pray for Li@@ us wellness . &quot;
he said about Liu :
&quot; it is my belief that the initiatives that he took and for whom he had been sever@@ ely pun@@ ished , stable and aff@@ lu@@ ent China , which in turn would have contributed to a peaceful world . &quot;
&quot; I personally moved very moved and also encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectu@@ als and affected citizens inspired by Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the Charter 08 signed up for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China . &quot;
Singapore : city or country ?

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may appear stupid since Singapore is recognised as independent state as an independent state .
&quot; but according to the judi@@ cial minister , Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , Singapore was supposed to be seen as a city . &quot;
this remark has triggered a debate in the blog@@ osph@@ ere .
&quot; during the conference on the occasion of a meeting of the International Bran@@ ch Association of the State of New York , the Minister for many people noticed the domination of the only political party of Singapore , because they are compared to Singapore with other countries . &quot;
he endor@@ se that Singapore should be considered a city .
nobody asked whether New York is a democracy ...
that is the most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; the blog Caval@@ ier@@ io pra@@ ised the judi@@ cial minister , &quot; the logic to rot@@ ate &quot; to defend the existing author@@ it@@ arian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot;
&quot; and then , according to all our efforts and insur@@ ances , create this valuable land , you hear that we are ultimately no country . &quot;
&quot; it sound@@ ed so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of a escape from the responsibilities , a comp@@ assi@@ sting . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , where country is it then ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons for Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ an were not very pos@@ u@@ bel : he def@@ ended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; ordinary countries &apos; , given it seemed un@@ inev@@ it@@ ably un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; however , he has def@@ ends the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently led by a party . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; once you reach the core point of the subject , the good old ly@@ re comes from the author@@ it@@ arian powers that will be the democr@@ ats , as they fit better to their power . &quot;
&quot; in the final version , those last week of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am given answers to his American guests on our press , our Ju@@ di@@ ative , our political system really non @-@ answers . &quot;
relevant issues decl@@ ined with non @-@ answers rational way .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls for Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am to clear his opinion as they did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
&quot; when Singapore is not a country , but a city is to which country belongs to our city ... &quot;
&quot; briefly , I understand nothing . &quot;
&quot; I would be very grateful if our wer@@ ter K Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ an would take the effort to elu@@ ci@@ date this point , if he was paid high in order to be part of the government of the city of Singapore . &quot;
&quot; by being published on the blog his comment , he pointed out to the critics to read the whole co @-@ ordin@@ ator of the conference that in order to better understand the context of the statements of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , according to which Singapore was a city and not a country . &quot;
read the co @-@ ordin@@ ates .
&quot; when he said that Singapore was more of a &quot; city &quot; than a country , &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore was so un@@ equally important , even if we are looking free and fair elections . &quot;
he studied Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party in decades ? ) .
&quot; when he said , Singapore &quot; is not a country , &quot; he obviously does not mean it in this sense ! &quot;
Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his disappointment about Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am who does as a leader of a her@@ an@@ gling generation to make such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement .
I am talking about what the judi@@ cial minister of Singapore has said ...
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old clo@@ ister that I expect - if I agree with them or not , but this is another thing . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , a member of the new generation of political leaders from Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes that he is really associated and aware of what he def@@ ends . &quot;
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review t@@ ends the vulner@@ ability of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ ams :
&quot; did Mr. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am &quot; ben@@ ign a mistake , &quot; or was it a free speaker ? &quot;
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , we are only considered an independent and sovereign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , in which country go the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore ? &quot;
Singapore is unique ; it is equally land and city .
&quot; as it plays an important role within the ruling k@@ inet@@ ts , the statements of Mr Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am are of serious significance . &quot;
&quot; why do the Singapore authorities do their military service , but they only defend their city but not their country ? &quot;
who must pay our Prime Minister for invo@@ ices ?
what is the value of our pink work@@ force ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; the magazine Journey of a decade to affir@@ mation , Singapore and was always a city : &quot;
&quot; I did not say what I said ... &quot;
this sentence seems to have anno@@ yed many Singapur ...
nobody ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / archipelago .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; def@@ ending the country especially &quot; , &quot; but that is not quite true . &quot;
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .
the myth of the &quot; cute Can@@ adi@@ ers &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flanders .
screenshot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices asked his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect to your home or home country ?
your answers are published here as part of a continuing series with the ru@@ mo@@ urs of certain parts of the world un@@ covered and another fac@@ et is to be shown .
&quot; the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor of Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
&quot; the question which is put to me in Japan most , is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; no , sorry , I answered . &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live in Japan and again in Japan . &quot;
&quot; depending on the situation the conversation takes place , it is considered to be polite , interest in his inter@@ loc@@ ut@@ ors , asking personal questions . &quot;
&quot; then mostly the default answer : &quot; &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice @-@ hock@@ ey , nature . &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans cook perhaps in@@ war@@ dly before anger , if they are kept for Americans , but I don &apos;t distur@@ b it . &quot;
&quot; for someone who does not know , there is little that diff@@ ers from the Canadian of Americans . &quot;
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans bring a Canadian flag into their ruck@@ sack when they travel .
all love Can@@ adi@@ ans .
American on the other hand ...
&quot; so it was already when I started to travel through the world - before Donald Tru@@ mp , before the invasion of Iraq and September 11 . &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always worn little map@@ le leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care !
with us there is no weapons !
same @-@ sex mar@@ riages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
&quot; all seem to think , Canada is so great . &quot;
we are polite .
&quot; we obviously say very often &quot; &quot; sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is supposed to be considered to be the toler@@ ant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not like these types south of the border .
we Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
&quot; first , I have many American friends I admire very much . &quot;
&quot; I would have nothing to do if , for example with Johnny from Dallas . &quot;
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
&quot; first , considered &quot; &quot; nice &quot; , &quot; means that basically , to be fun - just as the ben@@ ign , gentle , but trag@@ ically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flanders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has its own Canadian double @-@ lon@@ ers ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada really would be a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flanders , this would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality . &quot;
&quot; there are no corners and edges , nothing in which you can encounter . &quot;
being harmless to be in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous and in@@ interesting to make and no attention to earn .
&quot; this can be something good , if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , far away from things that happen around one . &quot;
&quot; I would even go far as far as to say that the desire to be free and alone , a main one of the Can@@ adi@@ ans . &quot;
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
&quot; what out@@ standing as &quot; &quot; nice &quot; , &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy . &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans do not often talk about the fence with the neighbors .
&quot; we l@@ acks the warm , open kindness , which I now connect with my American friends . &quot;
thank@@ fully for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Just@@ in Tru@@ de@@ au the stage to show that Kan@@ adier are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our Prime Minister has made Canada almost sexy .
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ odi@@ ert Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
&quot; one in Thailand &apos;s famous pop @-@ band has released a music video , which re@@ produced the j@@ unta and restore the civil government in spite of their promises , the country continues to rule the country . &quot;
the new song &quot; D@@ IC@@ TA@@ TOR Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells about what rules makes him his girlfriend .
&quot; although not expressly politically , the music@@ video refers to the ongoing military domination of the j@@ unta . &quot;
the band was made up of many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video on the song was an amazing success .
&quot; within the first three days this was divided on Facebook up@@ loaded video 1.@@ 254 , and received 8.@@ 800 lip . &quot;
&quot; last month , the Charlie @-@ Chap@@ lin @-@ Video &quot; &quot; The dict@@ ator &quot; &quot; has been blocked in Thailand after a group of activists , invited the public to view this video . &quot;
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to the Thai politics as it relates to the situation of the country under the j@@ unta rule .
&quot; once a look at these recordings of the video , referring to some of the political issues , the Thailand has per@@ sec@@ uted in the past three years . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; 44 &quot; rules of the girls &quot; could possibly refer to the dra@@ stic section 44 of the preliminary Constitution , which has given an absolute decision @-@ making of the army as an important national issues . &quot;
&quot; the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the in@@ famous program for &quot; Settings &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other individuals who are regarded by the j@@ unta as critics . &quot;
&quot; the image above reflects the introduction of the law on computer criminal off@@ ense , whose v@@ age and un@@ clear rules often are used by the authorities to activists and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose a new unit was set up in the army , super@@ vised the online content and have been thrown , the monarchy is for@@ ged to have stra@@ ined . &quot;
Thailand continues to set up a strike against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( majest@@ y ) .
on 20 May 2014 in Thailand the war was established .
&quot; two days later , there came to a coup in the army . &quot;
&quot; one of the problems that the j@@ unta continue to purchase is their decision co@@ stly U boats , although security experts they warned that the purchase is un@@ necessary and a waste of tax revenues . &quot;
&quot; in the video there is even shown how people will be thrown into a black delivery , before you put them into an inter@@ locking stock , another problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists are sitting in prison , because they have supp@@ osedly cause &quot; confusion &quot; in society and the internet users will have long cast , they should ins@@ ult@@ ed the monarchy . &quot;
&quot; he showed the te@@ aser of the song members of the band , which has been used to the Sal@@ ut of &quot; The Tri@@ bute &quot; of Pan@@ em , &quot; which has already been used by Put@@ sch @-@ opponents during the protests of 2014 . &quot;

&quot; the following article written by Dmit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with friendly permission . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ war company reco@@ vered only very slowly in East @-@ East Asia , especially in the district T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al . &quot;
&quot; now over 20 years have passed since the Georgi@@ an @-@ ab@@ ian war was officially ended , but his sc@@ ars are still very visible in this part of the Republic . &quot;
the abandoned villages of the northern districts in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show distinctive images .
&quot; villages like D@@ zh@@ ant@@ uk@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ ht@@ a , Poly@@ ana and Khar@@ chil@@ ava are located on the carbon @-@ bas@@ ins of Ab@@ ch@@ asi@@ es . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , ref@@ ug@@ asi@@ es , Georgi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together in the region . &quot;
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
&quot; today , most Russians live in the area . &quot;
such settlements are also called residential @-@ Asia as well as spirits .
&quot; in the pre @-@ war period there were more than 10,000 people today , today there are only a few hundred people in these spirits . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic of t@@ ku@@ arch@@ al characteristic .
&quot; since 2011 the total population of the district 16.@@ 000 people , after they had barely risen over a decade . &quot;
1989 approximately 43.@@ 000 people lived in this district .

&quot; &quot; &quot; it all is a consequence of war &quot; &quot; &quot;
the empty five @-@ sto@@ rey housing of the Soviet Union from the early &apos; 60s that are called Chr@@ usch@@ t@@ schu@@ kow@@ kas are symbolic of the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are falling and very rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ zh@@ ant@@ uk@@ ha I met a native older man .
he begins a conversation and it falls him hard to end this .
&quot; it all is a consequence of war . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot;
it is still unique . &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
&quot; there were community centers , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens who served all of the community . &quot;
&quot; now , there are only paved road with infl@@ atable splend@@ or buildings . &quot;
&quot; the people who once lived in this place lived and their contribution to the central plan of the Soviet Union , have left the district in the meantime . &quot;
in the Spirit of D@@ zh@@ ant@@ uk@@ ha live approximately fifty inhabitants .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar . &quot;
&quot; K@@ hr@@ ush@@ cho@@ kas that are still one or two families can be seen at the balconies , where laundry . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house . &quot;
&quot; when they discover me with the camera in hand , they immediately attract them back . &quot;
&quot; our mother is forbidden to let us photograph , &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; she is simply forbidden that it is all . &quot;
the girl whis@@ pered away from her friend and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area are working for a small tur@@ quoise mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al@@ ug@@ ol .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( growing of land products for personal needs ) such as zo@@ otechn@@ ics , be@@ eke@@ eping and vegetables . &quot;
it is difficult to get over the rounds .
the district council provides free candles in winter and bread on the villages .

&quot; I do not know what will happen , but we will build Zu@@ cchini &quot;
about ten years ago an elderly woman named Gal@@ ina ( or a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a as it is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to J@@ h@@ ant@@ uk@@ ha .
&quot; despite her oldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina has not left before Ab@@ ch@@ Asia to live with her . &quot; &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ ch@@ fant@@ asi@@ es , &quot; she tells . &quot;
Gal@@ ina wants to accept no financial aid from her daughter and persist@@ ence that they are using her young grand@@ son instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly r@@ ents are just nine dollars .
&quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive . &quot;
a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a tells you that she and other vill@@ agers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman and a young family , and I live in this building . &quot;
&quot; if holidays are , we visit us . &quot;
&quot; but we cannot do so - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as she tells her story , a younger neigh@@ bor appears on the balcony . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; &quot; T@@ ante G@@ aly@@ a calls her to . &quot; &quot; they said , we could build Zu@@ cchini . &quot;
I have already prepared the ground .
&quot; I do not know what will happen , but we will make cour@@ gett@@ es . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything , &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as convers@@ ation@@ alist in Nat@@ asha has lived together with her husband and five common children in their house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when war began .
every day they remember the thor@@ ns before the war .
&quot; despite its relatives , who live in Central , Os@@ se@@ tien and Georgia ( the land of Ab@@ ch@@ fant@@ asi@@ es broke away ) , they did not leave the opportunity to leave it . &quot;

&quot; we have recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative settlement in Ab@@ ch@@ Asia ) .
&quot; we want to build a house there , but this will take a bit more , &quot; she explains to it . &quot;
Nat@@ ascha receives every child for about $ 9 children &apos;s prize money .
her husband is working in coal .
the young family has its own farm .
&quot; near the house where Nat@@ asch@@ as &apos;s kinder@@ garten was once found , they keep pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chickens . &quot;
it tells us that it was a very fright@@ ening situation than many people after the war left the village .
but over time she lost her fears .

&quot; &quot; &quot; we have no fear of the dark street or the few people . &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
&quot; indeed , it has something to do with lo@@ oting . &quot;
after the war there was barely work and all lived as it was right .
I remember every day like the city and the war once were .
&quot; when our conversation ends the end , a little boy is over to us . &quot;
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hidden .
a ball flew out of the window and another boy j@@ agt him .
he plays with the ball and then down the hill .
a group of children now pro@@ sec@@ uring the ball .
&quot; while they run , some of them throw stones on the exp@@ iry buildings . &quot;
these ruins are a part of their childhood who provide for in@@ consistency in their lives .
they do not know it differently .

this article by Amy Br@@ acken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and appears here with friendly permission .
&quot; cross on the path of migrants , Europe or Latin America will cross certain places for their hospitality . &quot;
&quot; I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located at the border to Guatemala . &quot;
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
&quot; it is managed by a 59@@ - year @-@ olds , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink Br@@ ill@@ en@@ gest@@ el and gold @-@ colored ear@@ rings in Ted@@ dy@@ b@@ ären form . &quot;
&quot; she is called Concep@@ ción , Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula . nevertheless , they know many under the name Mama Africa . &quot;
this nickname is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a target for Afri@@ cans and Ha@@ iti@@ ans who are travelling .
the hotel has no charm .
&quot; for about 2,50 dollar per night the guests sleep in simple rooms , with cold , cru@@ m@@ bling walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rots in a c@@ age .
there is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Haiti migrants are coming here .
&quot; sometimes , Ms Ram@@ í@@ rez , people also tell in full small bus@@ hes and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call : &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot;
where are you Mama Africa ? . &quot;
&quot; at the time it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some have also slept outside of cart@@ ons . &quot;
it does not want to reject anyone .
&quot; she helps them also and brings them to hospital when they are sick , they buy them medications that they cannot pay , she mass@@ aged them with a bal@@ m that did not beat them away from the long journey . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , is ahead of a short time ago . &quot;
I asked him if Mama Africa is an appropriate nickname for MS Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family Sebasti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i that has a yo@@ del @-@ beard ) posi@@ ert with Concep@@ ción Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Br@@ acken .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; reply with a smile . &quot; I really feel that it suits her , because African women are very nice women . &quot;
very affection@@ ate .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
&quot; Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister , who hopes to get to Boston to find their husband and the three children there . &quot;
&quot; you have lived in Brazil , however it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move towards north . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard of other for@@ ks from Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well known name on the track , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
he tells that the Ha@@ iti@@ ans and Afri@@ cans are often travelling together the route and that the Afri@@ cans are already talking on What@@ s@@ App by Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; as many of his companion , Michel@@ et has lived in Brazil before and worked as a building workers on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the football world championship . &quot;
&quot; when the Brazilian economy was we@@ aker , he began his journey to the United States . &quot;
he has been a guest at Mama Africa : he s@@ ells SI@@ M cards to save the necessary money in order to buy the Bust@@ ick@@ et to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him whether in the future he will contact Ms Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; Mama Africa is our Mother and we will never let them go again , &quot; &quot; reply : &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells you that their guests are often sending text messages , when they are gone to gr@@ ind them , or to tell you about the course of their journey . &quot;
they explained that their Christian faith was the power@@ train of her work .
&quot; she does not know much about Africa , but their guests have brought her to prepare chicken as in Ghana . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known , but she is not the only spark of hope for migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula . &quot;
at the other end of the city a dead end up to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
in this winter Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family are taken to migrants in their small house .
he is polic@@ eman and has found that the Bust@@ ick@@ ets be sold to many African migrants .
&quot; he began to help them to get a reasonable price , then he has offered them his house for one dollar off the night . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , 25 people are there , mainly Ha@@ iti@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; some sleep on ceilings on the ground , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a hob outside . &quot;
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests go through .
&quot; I lived in the United States , he tells . &quot; &quot; I have experienced what they experience . &quot;
I have crossed the border over the desert and we have suffered .
there are places where people help and others don &apos;t help . this is the reason why I give them my support .
&quot; after having lived for three years , he was transferred to a raid on his work place from the United States . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants traveling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their houses for them . &quot;
José Antonio Cord@@ ova Mel@@ én@@ dez tells me that he fled in Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to sque@@ eze about him without having a plan .
&quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he has asked for accommodation and a unknown , an all@@ uring , has offered him the roof . &quot;
&quot; some months later the family lives still there and she tries to decide where the next steps should go . &quot;
back to the house of Mama Africa is all again full of guests .
&quot; in the sounds , the travellers consult their tel@@ eph@@ ones . &quot;
a mini@@ bus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests to a large majority of Somalia .
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nost@@ alg@@ ically because of those who have gone away . &quot;
like a glorious grandmother bl@@ unted them in their album with numerous photos .
&quot; there is one of her daughter with African hair @-@ loving who has made her a customer in , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old . &quot;

China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang people are forced to install a monitoring app on their phones .
a Check @-@ Point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang from Twitter @-@ Users to be used for E@@ stim@@ uli
&quot; the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , a ethnic minorities region in the west of China , are forced to install a Spy@@ ware on their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; on July 10 the cell @-@ user received a cell phone in the Ti@@ an@@ shan district of the city of U@@ m@@ qi , a mobile notification in which it indicates the district council called Jing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; &quot; Web Cle@@ aning &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in the communication , it is said that the app will hin@@ dering to terror@@ ist information to terror@@ ist information . &quot;
&quot; however , the authorities should use the app for more than the fight against terrorism . &quot;
&quot; according to an exclusive report of Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonom@@ ous I@@ li Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ fecture , because they had been replaced shortly after they had replaced the app messages with a private We@@ chat group . &quot;
&quot; in the communication of the police that the app will determine sources and distribution of terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ books and documents . &quot;
Jing@@ h@@ ang@@ s website describes the app as follows :
Jing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ ang@@ su Tel@@ ecom . &quot;
&quot; the main function is the block porno@@ graphic web sites , from online fraud , Trojan and ph@@ ishing sites to make users aware of how much time they are spending online and to control your own home network . &quot;
this app with the filter@@ ing for minority children should help the children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can naturally be used in a variety of ways .
&quot; for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; state actors or even h@@ ackers can manip@@ ulate the home network of a person or ste@@ al from it . &quot;
this introduction is consistent with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
&quot; while reports on digital c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in China is mostly on the experience of users in the major cities in the east and south , the reality is very often dark for those who live in distant ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; to limit im@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in conflict @-@ areas , the authorities often arrange extreme ornam@@ ents and monitoring measures as well as rout@@ in@@ ous internet ab@@ sten@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; based on Twitter @-@ based media out@@ let &quot; Images from the China &quot; ( Polish ) , the zen@@ ved messages published in China , published photographs by a check@@ point , to the polic@@ emen , whether they had to check the monitoring app . &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ano make sure that people use the official Jing@@ w@@ ang App .
mobile not@@ ifications informed that people install the app within 10 days .
&quot; if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be det@@ ained up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
&quot; they have been forced to use the people , devices that are intended for older people . &quot;
this is a form of captivity by The Aw@@ ak@@ ening technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from the China &quot; ( Polish ) have also published a Jing@@ w@@ ang product description , from which the software can raise the pass@@ words of a Windows operating system , and thus att@@ acking un@@ restricted access to the computer &apos;s hard drive . &quot;
after installation by Jing@@ w@@ ang computers and Hand@@ ys in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
&quot; in Jing@@ w@@ ang , the provisions in Jing@@ w@@ ang may possibly be a response to the instructions of the City @-@ Party Council to minim@@ ize the distribution of illegal content . &quot;
&quot; all governmental entities , authorities and party related facilities including universities and research institutes are obliged to follow the instructions of Cyber@@ security Office during operation of their computer and communication devices . &quot;
&quot; a current report by Freedom House , a US @-@ American human rights organisation , also mentioned these new monitoring methods : &quot;
&quot; in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of U@@ h@@ qi . a regulation with the directive on all residents and entrepreneurs until 1 August their &quot; personal ID cards , mobil@@ es , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media @-@ storage cards . &quot;
&quot; the intention is to identify and destroy any &quot; terror@@ ist videos &quot; and destroy them . however , this action does not hurt the personality @-@ rights of U@@ m@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole range of other possible price , including those that relate to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot;
sleep or death - part 1 : all scre@@ ams after death
a single plot in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo of : Cor@@ rie Bar@@ kli@@ more ( CC BY 2.0 ) .
this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; sleep or death &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane is depic@@ ted his experiences in a Syrian prison .
&quot; far from our blue , virtual world you look at and imagination , that you are all alone in one place where everything is important . &quot;
&quot; everything has gradually solved and un@@ resolved , and un@@ veil@@ ed the truth which is clearly identi@@ fiable , both inside and outside . &quot;
one that makes their name all glory .
one that has defe@@ ated into a list of feelings and expressions which do not allow Met@@ aph@@ ors .
&quot; but if you get the reality again and you look behind the scenes - beyond the acting , the beautiful scenes and the performer - turn the characters into being of meat and blood , and all sh@@ it according to death . &quot;
&quot; any doubt solve yourself in smoke and you become aware of your existence , even if the Earth is caught on the axis of the un@@ belief that your parents , and before them have er@@ ected your grand@@ parents , stone around stone . &quot;
&quot; they have arrested me and my father three times , but what did not do so that I &quot; mean &quot; my lesson &quot; , &quot; as the chief of security , it form@@ ulated - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot;
he presented his power over us by using even the sim@@ pl@@ est concepts that we knew .
five young people were ri@@ pped during a peaceful protest like we@@ eds from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
it shows that the city brought the darkness of the night with &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; scre@@ ams .
&quot; all districts , only my own not . &quot;
&quot; for the first time it was quiet , un@@ conditi@@ onally , at the wrong time , even if I did not set high demands for a city that is up to the arteries with state safety issues and their ac@@ compli@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; in the third night the things had cal@@ med down , after the power supply to the quarter had to function . &quot;
&quot; I crossed the silence , by calling several times &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; from my home@@ work . &quot;
I heard my voice through the silence resi@@ du@@ es .
&quot; a few minutes later , some of my friends felt brave enough to find together . &quot;
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , true friends closed to me ; we made a magnificent picture , that my expectations full and completely filled . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment you become aware that you are liber@@ ated the spirit from the light , but it is simply not interested in the sp@@ ing@@ est . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my father , &quot; &quot; makes you ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot;
he put on .
&quot; then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low - nothing can give you your voice , after you made them all the way up to the office of the safety service . &quot;
I arrived there .
the Ober@@ st Gh@@ ass@@ an was there with several of his men ; my father has already been there as I am now .
&quot; the colon@@ el Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to speak : &quot; &quot; let me listen to me as you &apos;re &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; or you are only brave enough to cry when we are not nearby . &quot;
his h@@ asser@@ tive eyes were looking forward to me .
&quot; and you mo@@ urn thee what to look for me in the eyes , and not on the ground ! &quot;
what I did do have nothing to do with courage .
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood before this building . &quot;
&quot; perhaps it was on my fol@@ ly , van@@ ity ; perhaps at the revolution . &quot;
&quot; I was so sure of my thing as I rep@@ lied , &quot; I didn &apos;t think that you have already forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot;
&quot; and I think I have never heard to look into the eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I rep@@ ent no word of what I said . &quot;
&quot; put him in sol@@ itary and his father , with it . &quot;
&quot; his father is equal with it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this confused set lies down to me today in the nose .
&quot; he was exposed to a &quot; syndrome , &quot; a se@@ el@@ ic torture , which I was exposed to months . &quot;
I am scre@@ ams the farm .
at the first office I leave everything I carry with myself .
&quot; then again through the yard , and into the second office , which leads through a gear to the individual cells . &quot;
I took me all the details exactly before I took the room .
&quot; unlike anything else , they probably have shared a larger cell . &quot;
&quot; I have to share it with only one other pris@@ oner , and should immediately put me immediately , without waiting for their permission . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the officials left the cell , and I attacked on an old @-@ tested communication method : with the fist to beat the wall . &quot;
&quot; I learned that my cell @-@ fin was a &quot; &quot; help &quot; . &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he rep@@ lied to me finally .
&quot; apparently , in none of the surrounding cells was an aff@@ li@@ ent man middle age , which looks similar to me and called &quot; &quot; Doctor &quot; . &quot; &quot;
in the perfect darkness let me know no distinctive complex@@ es and doctors are not here ; we are all just numbers .
&quot; maybe someone , whose voice sounds similar to me ? &quot;
all the answers are connected to its existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the great cells .
maybe he will immediately listen .
&quot; investig@@ ators had assured me , they would fre@@ eze him if I stay . &quot;
li@@ ar .
&quot; I would like to have a scar@@ ec@@ row to exp@@ el all these crow@@ s , which lab@@ eled in the fruits in the garden of my head . &quot;
&quot; from the distance I hear them still &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it must be at least 10 am in the evening ; always in order to try this time the cry , every day . &quot;
the door opens up .
&quot; I was always convinced that black is the color of the ruin , until I saw the yellow light that gave us the Gre@@ ys in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; Thunder , &quot; assu@@ mp@@ ing to the 13th S@@ ure of the Koran ) . &quot;
they are here to be li@@ stens .
&quot; thus , the secret goes to us to protect the national security in front of us and prevent the terrorists in us , speak in the Al@@ a@@ wit@@ ian dialect - so they played their denomin@@ ational card and desp@@ ised the narrow focus of their world view . &quot;
&quot; this is not a house , which is here is not a country ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the crimin@@ als of their cl@@ an into a hero . &quot;
&quot; I took care of the hearing @-@ room and tre@@ ad on Abu I@@ mad , a slim and bur@@ ly man ; at least he comes to me . &quot;
&quot; he begins a &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , &quot; despite the facial expressions that you choose him : &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can join as much more important with your life to protest and protest on demonstrations that will soon be an end soon . &quot;
I rep@@ lied .
&quot; I am used to it , not to answer . &quot;
I can really no longer say when ins@@ ults and stro@@ kes have become a friendly conversation for me to become an ordinary communication .
&quot; when and how this happened , was inevitable . &quot;
&quot; any voice in me said that I probably had to get used to it , to be pun@@ ished , although I had done nothing to make this punishment away . &quot;
at punishment in all its diversity .
its command is to t@@ ear me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls the loving &quot; conf@@ ession . &quot;
it begins with a plastic tube that probably comes from the clo@@ ister .
your exec@@ ution@@ er is rejo@@ iced at your cry .
&quot; give him the pleasure , you cannot measure you with him and you can not hold your cry . &quot;
&quot; my cry did not fall him yet enough , which is why they ex@@ chang@@ ers the pipe through a cable . &quot;
&quot; in my first review , I asked if the investig@@ ators had worked once again as a gar@@ bage dump or whether it was one of the normal operation equipment . &quot;
&quot; they had four cables at each other , in order to present to us those from their point of view , great invention of a huge cable . &quot;
&quot; within a single hour , three of them rarely happened , while I was still in line . &quot;
&quot; I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I have to cry . &quot;
&quot; the hen noted the cooling , and found no cl@@ aws on it , which is why it took place as a neighbour to an electric @-@ packed rod . &quot;
&quot; electricity through my entire body , enough to store my entire district . &quot;
&quot; my half @-@ bare body , the stretched on the ground was the perfect power ladder . &quot;
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had met his duty for this night .
it probably must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep myself again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
some hours went out that came to me as minutes .
then the call to dawn .
&quot; the door opens and the light is filled with the room &quot; .@@ R@@ out with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fic@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; I answered with the voice of an exhaust@@ ive young , &quot; My Lord , my Father must be afraid . &quot;
&quot; be silent and get away you , you will be laid . &quot;
this was new .
otherwise they had always been released .
where do they guide me ? !
the Jord@@ anian Rap@@ e Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b talks about the rights of LGB@@ T@@ Q + -@@ community , freedom of expression and resistance &quot;
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b smoke a cigar@@ ette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b puts the bulk of his time inside ; sometimes he sli@@ pped to his canvas , sometimes to his computer , and again to his couch . &quot;
&quot; but what one can rely on , is a cigar@@ ette between his fingers or his with nic@@ otine clothing . &quot;
&quot; he lives in the top floor of his family house , which was founded in 1967 ; the year , in which Israel had forced his occupation of the west bank , and H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs family were forced to fle@@ e from their village in Palestine , where she had lived in fel@@ ah@@ y@@ een ( about : Farmer ) . &quot;
&quot; for now six years H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who faces the conservative majority and question@@ ed their old opinions about gender roles , sexuality , and freedom of expression by art and rap@@ music . &quot;
&quot; with his music , who often deal with topics like Oriental , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , but also calls for the core of the whole Arab world . all these issues do not only find in his hom@@ etown of Am@@ man Rel@@ ev@@ ance , but also in cities that range from Damascus to San@@ aa in Yemen . &quot;
&quot; with his 25 years H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees himself as someone who is limited in his mind , and he can feel according to his own statement with the people who suffer from the devast@@ ating consequences of foreign interventions in countries like Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if he does not open it openly , he fought against US foreign policy for a special tendency . &quot;
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b looks his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war zones , something with his identity as &quot; Palestinian ge@@ aring of the second generation , &quot; even though he was born in Jordan , and so far has never been in Palestine . &quot;
&quot; I do not think of my own life situations , &quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b emphas@@ ises . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; I think so because I am a human being , while he was sol@@ dered in water , Nes@@ café in two cups . it is the holy month Ram@@ adan ; in this time it is provided for Muslims , from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the law also states that public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
&quot; obviously H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee in a s@@ eng@@ ing hot young @-@ day has little to do with protest against Islam . &quot;
&quot; basically , the gap of lu@@ str@@ ate coffee and the pigs of the K@@ ent @-@ cigar@@ ette in the nose are first of freedom . &quot;
&quot; sometimes the Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky , especially if you throw a look into the neighbouring countries . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is simple to do basic things - as to drink in public during Ram@@ adan water - in order not to land in prison . &quot;
&quot; recently , the Interior Jord@@ anian Jordan placed an appearance of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a , already for the second time . &quot;
&quot; some parliament@@ arians who support the Islamic State of the Muslim Br@@ otherhood - argu@@ ed that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual Fron@@ ts@@ ar@@ oos Ham@@ ed sensu@@ al , the cultural and traditional nor@@ ms of the country and be the main reason for the concert hall . &quot;
the members and former press spokes@@ person in the Islamic coalition D@@ IMA Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert was cancelled due to the sexual orientation of the session .
&quot; many asser@@ tions that the commitment of the band in matters like the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is more dangerous acti@@ vism , which represents the old @-@ tested legitim@@ acy of authorized regime in the entire region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a the j@@ ord@@ an people as a &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; which continue to act &quot; for intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; this statement is probably not easy to sei@@ ze the rh@@ et@@ oric , but in fact an increasingly difficult @-@ cryst@@ all@@ uring reality in Jordan are clearly reflected in H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs work . &quot;
&quot; in the year 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b traditional sex rise to corp@@ ses by made his vision of the fate of Arab women , the vo@@ re@@ hel@@ i@@ chen sex . &quot;
&quot; the picture shows the skel@@ eton of a clearly lower @-@ known woman , whose arms and legs to stretch up to the corners of the canvas . &quot;
&quot; it is surrounded by a red lake , perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who are actually confidence . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , the number of &quot; hon@@ ors &quot; was taken in Jordan - the in@@ official outside is left . &quot;
&quot; human Rights Watch , according to the number of hon@@ ors in the year 2016 reached its peak ; however , that Jordan is lacking the institutional infrastructure to support the women who have tried to support the victims of domestic violence or domestic violence . &quot;
&quot; according to a law on inter@@ ruption control from the year 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of internal violence , &quot; and for their release is often a long @-@ term bureaucr@@ atic effort as well as the warranty on the part of the family necessary that the woman will be done nothing . &quot;
H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs &apos;s music enjoys great popularity and is well known for this reason to re@@ pu@@ rest in his country as a tab@@ u .
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b cont@@ ests that his work is political , however , is that he is full of his music , the full of explicit ass@@ inations on sexuality , freedom and expression , not from politics . &quot;
&quot; I come from the Middle , man . &quot;
&quot; I was accused of politics &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b takes the question of Palestinian identity in attack .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; the focus is on poverty .
&quot; the list of songs , which are in the core politically , can be continued . &quot;
in March 2016 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b released a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated often :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the song H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a kind of market , in which one can get what you want &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ faith , heter@@ o- or homosexu@@ ality . &quot;
he noticed that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of LGB@@ T and les@@ bi@@ ans and that comments on equality between LGB@@ T@@ Q + -@@ individuals were still in strong in 2014 .
&quot; in 2014 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b conducted an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ anic Onlin@@ e@@ program RO@@ Y@@ A , to notice that his comments have been removed from the context , and his opinion was cen@@ sored . &quot;
&quot; on Youtube it was up@@ loaded without cuts , but was only a edited version , &quot; he says . &quot;
today H@@ d@@ ai@@ b presents H@@ d@@ ai@@ b open for the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + -@@ community and represents the opinion that intoler@@ ance against homosexu@@ als do not speak to Islam .
&quot; he mentioned Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the eighth century , who still has remained in memory thanks to his hom@@ o@@ erotic poems . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks itself : if Abu Nu@@ what , who was later to work on behalf of the cali@@ ph@@ s , in the eighth century could be openly writing about homosexu@@ ality , why can Jord@@ an@@ ians not ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , so H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a or the fact that the concert was cancelled . &quot;
in the H@@ asch@@ ite Kingdom there is nothing new that the government attacks attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are brought to silence .
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian news service took place several former government agencies and members of the teaching association , with the reason they had expressed his comments on comments in social media who are related to the deep in the country . &quot;
&quot; given the concert H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs , according to what is the tip of the ic@@ eberg - the real challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jordan . &quot;
&quot; for him progress is a continuous giving and taking . Jordan , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a has gone for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - it is of slow , than@@ ked and internal changes . he is sure that these changes take place from day to day at the heart of the Jord@@ anian Society . &quot;
&quot; finally H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , as millions of other Arabs also dreams , from an Arab world without interventions from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he dreams , not only of it , his work until Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of it . &quot;
&quot; it is perhaps the region with music , art and literature of a genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bom@@ bs , disp@@ ens@@ itions and arti@@ fic@@ i@@ fic@@ i@@ fic@@ i@@ ores democr@@ acies . at least he hopes that . &quot;
&quot; until it is far as far , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b becomes wider and therefore also resistance . &quot;
this report was made by the Pul@@ itzer Center on Crisis Rep@@ orting by the A@@ man as a student Fellow .
Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the three largest festivals in Japan .
these great and extravag@@ ant war@@ fare are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
&quot; it is presum@@ ed that there is a variant of Tan@@ ab@@ ata festivals , which is usually used in August in many areas T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the strongh@@ olds , the drums and dancing over more than one thousand years have been handed over to the north @-@ east , in order to force the Indi@@ gen@@ ous inhabitants of the region , the E@@ mis@@ hi , to the knees . &quot;
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we were able to take a few great seats , so we have a great view . &quot;
one can imagine just as big these parts are ...
&quot; a joint centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , hosted a two @-@ month exhibition to W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally . ) &quot;
I have long been watching the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en : two festivals are just to be seen .
&quot; nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the neb@@ uta Festival has the only way to spend its summer : &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are &quot; &quot; ! &quot;
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and have looked at the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ festival .
the sight of a 18 meter high Fest@@ ive was incredible .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !

&quot; rarely were out@@ ward appearance and body care so important as in this history , as they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth from the crime and promote a legitim@@ ate profession like those of the hair@@ line . &quot;
&quot; El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of Lima , a region with a very high cid rate , where street smoke and illegal drugs are daily . &quot;
one in April 2017 published survey showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region did not feel secure .
at the same time Peru - how many other Central and South American countries - the rising demand for aesthetic services for men .
&quot; the trend , the appearance and the fallen hair@@ styles of famous athletes such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led to the most experienced hands of hair@@ styles that can make this elaborate hair@@ styles . &quot;
&quot; the un@@ preced@@ ented demand for hair@@ styles that go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity , even has inspired an annual event , the competition of hairdres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been held since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; there are experts against each other to show who you can create the ec@@ centric looks like you can see in the following video ( other videos on current competitions , on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) . &quot;
&quot; educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , who found himself in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to discuss their weapons against hair@@ styles and get a training in the hairdres@@ sing art that allows them to find jobs . &quot;
motivated by this activity and the pres@@ sive opportunities have seen do@@ z@@ ens of young people that they can take a job which is currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops in the March of March and reported about some of their achievements :
&quot; in 1995 , we were the only specialist school in the church and the district which we are very proud because of love for the children we have established this educational community . &quot;

&quot; exactly this question went to the two young Colom@@ bian activists , Leonardo P@@ ár@@ rag@@ a by the Young @-@ Youth Foundation and inspired her to the campaign Cart@@ as p@@ or la Recon@@ cili@@ ación ( letters to reconciliation ) , the young people encouraged to write letters . &quot;
&quot; only recently , their land was the venue of a historical event and they wanted to contribute to their part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace agreement with the Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ab@@ ew@@ ood F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary forces in Colombia ) , which forms the Schl@@ us@@ point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; international was considered the signat@@ ories of the peace agreement , as meant that the Colom@@ bian President José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; however , the Colom@@ bi@@ ans is still a long way until one can speak of a real reconciliation and of peace . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ err@@ illa war@@ riors , who lived for many years in illegal bearings , a war sr@@ et@@ oric were exposed and carried out their weapons around the clock , must now be integrated into the life as civilians . &quot;
&quot; the Colom@@ bian society in turn , who had acc@@ ust@@ omed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ak@@ ow@@ ers , they must now engage in their ranks and support them in establishing a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Crist@@ ian were convinced that young colum@@ bi@@ ans would have to close together with the integration process .
and this is exactly what they did : until now thousands of young people are written - love @-@ ships in former gu@@ err@@ illa war@@ riors to welcome them back in society .
the aim of the campaign are 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former gu@@ err@@ illa war@@ riors - who are to be handed over to personally .
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as an inspiration for the campaign
&quot; the idea for the letters to reconc@@ ile came on the world summit of the Nobel Peace Prize winner who took place in February 2017 in Bog@@ ot@@ á . there , Leonardo and Crist@@ ian had the opportunity to speak short with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ ar@@ thi , the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize . &quot;
&quot; this explained that we love the people we love , in Valent@@ ine &apos;s day thousands of love letters , but those who forget it much needed . &quot;
&quot; he plane , he told him continued to share his love with people this year , who needed the most urgent need . &quot;
&quot; so the plan was made to write letters of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC who now have to find their place in society and to build up a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the dis@@ course of a history of a history of peace , &quot; they say . &quot;
previously the campaign was collected more than 2000 letters within the framework of the campaign .
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Barran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á . &quot;
I never thought that someone would forgive me
the first 500 letters were transferred on 19 March at one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o Cau@@ ca region .
&quot; a group of 40 students from the University of J@@ aver@@ iana in Cal@@ i , two members of the Municip@@ ality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Stiftung Bog@@ ot@@ Art traveled to the camp to bring the letters personally . &quot;
the members of the F@@ ARC stood up as they had done earlier in order to receive the orders of their leaders .
&quot; but this time they received no orders , but letters from shel@@ tered people from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it is incredible how many different feelings can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything between lies , &quot; &quot; told the political scientific study Manuela Jim@@ é@@ nez Av@@ ila later . &quot;
Sandra Par@@ ra , a co @-@ worker of the Gover@@ nor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable experience : &quot;
&quot; after we passed the letter , a former fighter took me through the camp of gu@@ err@@ illa war@@ rior . &quot;
&quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; &quot; ( a kind of cottage in which the Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ak@@ fighters ) saw , I saw a gu@@ err@@ illa war@@ riors who wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid to go out , because in addition to him on the bed was a M@@ GL @-@ pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ cher , a fatal weapon in the thorn @-@ cham@@ ber@@ nation . &quot;
&quot; and I said to them nevertheless , and asked him , &quot; &quot; Hello , what do they say ? &quot; he answered , &quot; I answered him a letter I wrote to me . &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; never in my life someone has written something so beautiful , that &apos;s why I answered him . &quot; &quot; then I suddenly answered the tears over the che@@ eks . &quot;
I h@@ ug@@ ged him completely and sat down beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ cher .
&quot; maybe he was sorry to be the war , I was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this struggles , and wanted to help him to write this letter . &quot;
the man told me more about his life . he never had anything else of life than war . he had never imagined the F@@ ARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers before the Hung@@ er@@ to@@ d . &quot; I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes .
&quot; but now I know that there is a society outside there , which is waiting for us with open arms . &quot;
until now I only learned how to handle weapons .
&quot; but now where peace re@@ igns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
&quot; for the pre@@ l@@ ude , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC came together on a discussion . &quot;
the students were all grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC was already in secret .
&quot; therefore the leaders of the F@@ ARC said the history of the organization , its ide@@ als and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; many years , we have experienced the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party , we can help to create the society in this country . &quot;
&quot; for a purpose of this magn@@ itude , it is worth to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot;
Manuela was impressed :
&quot; these people listen to those who have never found hearing , and not to recognize that people who have seen often seen as Monster and even hate , even people with beautiful feelings were killed by their lives and their environment , was very painful for me . &quot;
&quot; the reality , in which the country lives , do me sore . &quot;
&quot; however , it comfort@@ ed me that all men - also who have killed and so much harm to us to give us something and a smile and a hug . &quot;
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
&quot; Gust@@ avo Gonz@@ á@@ lez , com@@ mander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Archbishop of the town Cal@@ i , the following letter : &quot;
colum@@ bi@@ ans was rep@@ elled that after the design of peace would rule peace .
but this is not the case .
&quot; as long as it gives inequality , hunger and a lack of education , health care and employment opportunities there will always be people who are ready to attack and protest and to protest for their rights . and that is also completely justified ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; we from the F@@ ARC now put on peace , on a policy without arms . &quot;
&quot; therefore we call upon all def@@ enders of peace - regardless of race , religion or ideology - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word to do our contribution and bring sacrifice , because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those among us who defend life as the basis of existence will be many difficulties . &quot;
&quot; on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them . &quot;

&quot; hom@@ os@@ exual and que@@ er people who live in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region , are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; with horror , activists have seen the reporting of the last months on the persecution of Sweden in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
but the threat that depends how a D@@ amo@@ kl@@ es@@ worth about the local LGB@@ T community is not only established by night .
&quot; OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a trans@@ sexual wife from Gros@@ ny who shared some of their experiences with us and talked about what is currently happening in the Republic . &quot;
&quot; the LGB@@ T legislation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has won the international headlines from several months ago , after reports were published , the deteri@@ oration , torture and killing of que@@ erer men in the Republic . &quot;
&quot; the first report was published by the journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Now@@ aya Gas@@ eta , she cast a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities , the suspic@@ ious que@@ er men ar@@ rests and they fell in secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun . &quot;
&quot; they have brought a mon@@ ster to the world &quot;
&quot; Sabrina , a trans@@ wife , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there . &quot;
&quot; since her childhood , she felt that she was in fact a woman . &quot;
&quot; when they grew , you became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for it , which is why they moved to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after a group of Tsch@@ et@@ sch@@ enen was experienced by the gender equality , the hunt was opened on Sabrina . &quot;
&quot; out of fear for her life , she moved the last end to the USA . &quot;
Sabrina : I was working as a volunteer assistant at a human rights organisation .
one day I told me that someone needed my help .
&quot; it was a familiar with Dag@@ est@@ an , a trans@@ wife who put in trouble . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help her to help her , he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it all over the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent them to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no men any more in Ch@@ echn@@ ya who can eliminate these shame ? &quot;
then the photos of my documents made by the whole What@@ s@@ App the round .
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
&quot; when I was doing it , a few shopping door , from the back@@ seat of my car , I heard a Male &apos;s say : &quot; here is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot;
&quot; when I turned , I felt something in my body , but I did not hurt . &quot;
&quot; then I heard a set , but this time on the Che@@ chen : &quot; how long do you want to escape the family , you d@@ and@@ fl@@ eck ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
&quot; I know only that it was a young man , not 30 years old . &quot;
then I lost the consciousness and wo@@ ke up the final end in the hospital again .
apparently some women had received everything and started writing .
the man was fled .
the women had an ambulance .
in the hospital I learned that I had to be two sam@@ pled in my right lungs .
OC Media : in which n@@ urses have you been laid - in the men or women ?
&quot; Sabrina : my documents are out@@ dated , there is still my male name dr@@ on ; but the doctor understood and put me into the women . &quot;
&quot; therefore , I am very grateful to him . &quot;
&quot; when I read his name for the first time in his burden , I got it with the fear of doing ; it was a Muslim name . &quot;
but he turned out to be a good man .
I am grateful to him that he was respect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than a month in hospital .
last February I got threats .
&quot; they sh@@ out@@ ed me , wrote me - relatives , stran@@ gers , some completely unknown . &quot;
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
&quot; the slow@@ ed down , send me to Ch@@ echn@@ ya in order to prove that all that was a lie . &quot;
&quot; they created absurd demands : some told me that I must prove it by the streets , but others wanted that I had not changed my sex in Gros@@ ny and I say that all my family had not been changed , and Photoshop . &quot;
I have a grain size C - what should I say in television ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sabrina : it is still hard for her .
some older people spoke once my mother on the street .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; You have brought a mon@@ ster to the world that not only your family , but the whole of the Republic . &quot;
&quot; we can not st@@ ir you because you are a dev@@ out woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot;
my mother was too much and she lay down a stri@@ ck around the neck .
luck@@ ily the neighbours and they saved them .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved into an apartment and a few hours later in the window stood a car with dra@@ fted windows and a number plate with a 95 dr@@ on .
&quot; after it happened for the third time , it was clear to me that there was somewhat lazy . &quot;
my human rights professionals re@@ vo@@ iced the numer@@ ology - it turned out that I was pursued .
OC Media : how are you engaged ?
Sabrina : with the help of activists .
&quot; for security reasons I want to not award their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with her help I left the country , but then something un@@ belief . &quot;
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SI@@ M card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
&quot; I bought them , without sign up without saying , without any credit card , without anything . &quot;
I sm@@ ashed my old SI@@ M card and cast them into the gar@@ bage .
arrived and checks in the hotel .
the number was registered on a stran@@ ger .
I put the SI@@ M card into my mobile phone .
&quot; in the moment I wanted to call my mother by What@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; &quot; you do not believe you in security , just because you left the country ? &quot;
&quot; our people know , in which hotel you st@@ ir . you even know your room number . &quot;
only to show it : it is the number 115 .
could you imagine it ? !
this actually was my room number .
OC Media : stand with your family in contact ?
Sabrina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; however , we do not talk about gender equality , but this is a tabby theme . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ si@@ cal elements I am still in me . &quot;
so much I would like to overcome this se@@ ab@@ ian barrier .
&quot; I am always saying that , as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt them . &quot;
&quot; when we chat with camera , I actually give to me trouble as the person likes to re@@ minds them out of her past - thus to my male form . &quot;
but this is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
&quot; what do your friends , those who have stayed here ? &quot;
Sabrina : I submitted a report in Washington last week .
I need current information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I spoke to anyone who had a half months in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; he told that during Ram@@ adan , no man were arrested , and tort@@ ured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he did not shut up a new wave . &quot;
most likely they will now focus on family and relatives .
&quot; for that I mean , they probably invite the relatives before , these take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end demand an evidence that the so @-@ called &quot; honour &quot; through blood gen@@ ug@@ tu@@ ation . &quot;
OC Media : are now still held g@@ ay men in these secrets ?
Sabrina : a acquain@@ t@@ ance with me says there was not very many .
&quot; if , then above all those who have no wealthy relatives or that were dropped by their relatives , to place Kad@@ y@@ row Court . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they are arrested there , so they can present them later as terrorists . &quot;
&quot; say : should they be converted , you will show your body on TV and claim , they would have attacked either a village or a military support point . &quot;
understand ?
&quot; as if these people were not simply disappeared , but targeted , to radi@@ ate themselves . &quot;
OC Media : is this only one mut@@ ation or do you have a source of information for this information ?
Sabrina : I just quote someone who was pris@@ oned for a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard has grown .
there have since been nothing new about them .
they just have taken them away .
&quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was even when these people were killed . &quot;
&quot; until now they were not presented as band@@ its , but there has been no reports until now . we susp@@ ect that such actions are not possible . &quot;
why else would you not have allowed these people to shave ?
do you know whether these per@@ sec@@ utions and ab@@ duc@@ tions of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation already in the past ?
Sabrina : I always carried my hair for long time .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think that before 2003 I was already known in Gros@@ ny when I still lived there - and I never had any problems .
in Ernst !
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 , when the shar@@ ia was considered , I never had any problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , at that time it was much safer than now . &quot;
&quot; Russia originally wanted to lead us to the &quot; &quot; civil@@ isation &quot; , &quot; but ultimately thrown back into the St@@ one@@ age . &quot;
OC Media : how is it possible under the shar@@ ia law ?
&quot; Sabrina : my eyebrows were ready , I had dy@@ ed eyelashes , carried the tube je@@ ans and short Tops . &quot;
the Security Ministry of Sh@@ aria has never decided to give me a hair .
&quot; in front of the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people met me . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several ben@@ ches stood , and the whole city knew ; they knew why men , young people , met there . &quot;
we have never been ins@@ ult@@ ed .
in the Che@@ chen language there is an expression : Khar@@ da ma Khar@@ da . this means : &quot; sp@@ otte not about the misery of another . &quot;
&quot; it is often said to children , if you have fun about sick . &quot;
&quot; OC Media : so they just have their eyes closed before you , because they believed , you were sick ? &quot;
Sabrina : yes .
&quot; they never dar@@ ed , never dar@@ ed and never be@@ aten . &quot;
OC Media : how long was this grace @-@ time spent ?
Sabrina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ row came to the plan .
&quot; when he was appointed to Prime Minister from 2005 , he began to talk on TV about mor@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; he is not talking about us by se , but primarily about the behaviour of women . &quot;
nevertheless - you could feel how the people began to change in the city .
&quot; he was weak@@ ened , and had taken care of at once with Ar@@ g@@ w@@ ohn . &quot;
in time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; but every time I came back home , I could feel how the situation in the Republic was ste@@ adily . &quot;
OC Media : what activity do you go now ?
Sabrina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I did not earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the USA not much .
&quot; beyond that , I am still active as activists . &quot;
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communic@@ ates with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we organize teac@@ ups , co @-@ arri@@ vals , I meet her to hospital and help them to get dining options . &quot;
I do not have a c@@ ents for this .
I discovered these people as I had a refuge .
I am Muslims and want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you have a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sabrina : this is al@@ igned .
&quot; thus , the nature , it has nothing to do with religion . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly the same as che@@ et@@ sch@@ enen , who want to do with foam in front of the mouth , that there are no thresh@@ old with them . &quot;
&quot; the Dag@@ est@@ aner have whom , the cab@@ ine have which Russians also have which ; on the whole planet there is it - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; I come from there , that &apos;s why it is unpleasant to hear it . &quot;
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go into the mosque and while Ram@@ adan fast live together with men .
&quot; you know many thinking about transc@@ end@@ identity to men who love men , and they believe that you change his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that is a tru@@ ck@@ le . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different types of sensation , to be accurate , different vital settings . &quot;
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not be ash@@ amed for my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
&quot; sorry to be so personal , but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago . &quot;
and I am not at all sad for this - I simply know that I am myself now .
local groups war@@ n in front of an increase of self @-@ mor@@ ants within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffer from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and ar@@ ach rate within the native Arab population .
&quot; since the last few months , there is a sharp rise in self @-@ mor@@ ality . &quot;
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
&quot; the self @-@ burning of a man called J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August , the des@@ perate situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi community in Iran , which is shaped by poverty and unemployment , into the spotlight . &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he dwelt in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the south @-@ west of Iran .
&quot; he suffered under anxiety , depression , and he sham@@ efully work for his own hel@@ pl@@ essness ; the in@@ ability for his family can come up , so Ah@@ w@@ azi @-@ human rights groups who want to work and remain anonymous in Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; a video commemor@@ ated video was holding the moments , after he had ign@@ ited himself , firm . &quot;
&quot; some people managed to delete the fl@@ ames back , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was put into the Tal@@ eg@@ h@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; according to local sources , the in@@ cin@@ ations were so strong that doctors could do nothing more . &quot;
he died a short time later .
&quot; it was not the only su@@ icide based in August within the Arab Ah@@ v@@ azi minority , and activists , in front of the place warned that even more men could take life . &quot;
&quot; the Ah@@ w@@ azi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab B@@ ani Tam@@ im . &quot;
&quot; their stories have one thing in common : there were all family fathers found themselves due to the persecution from the Iranian government , hel@@ pl@@ ess and un@@ fit , to feed their families and to pursue their safe work . &quot;
&quot; Arab@@ ian Ah@@ w@@ azi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot;
&quot; the region , in which a large part of the Arab ancestors of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi community is settled , was difficult to uph@@ old by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult to ride their livel@@ ih@@ oods . &quot;
&quot; in front of a century the Arab@@ ian Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predomin@@ antly autonom@@ ous region in Iran , until the P@@ ahl@@ avi monarchy the power took over and 1925 great efforts to finish ethnic autonomy throughout Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ v@@ z region , there are some of the largest in Iran &apos;s coming oil and gas fields , as well as some of the most developed and most valuable commercial areas for the Iranian agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite this valuable resources the regional economy develops only slowly , and the native population gets only little of that wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often victims of untreated disorders , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the Iranian regime denied the Ah@@ mad Arab@@ ian Arab@@ ian jobs in the local oil , gas , and petro@@ chemical industry . &quot;
&quot; the government also built a variety of dem@@ bs built by the waters of the Arab areas in the Persian areas where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ahan , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m are re@@ direct . &quot;
these dem@@ ons have only led to dis@@ cour@@ aging the devast@@ ation in the region by dr@@ y@@ ness and to destroy the local agriculture as well as the fishermen and palm @-@ industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ zi @-@ youth increased to 81 % .
&quot; NO@@ UR Moh@@ ammed P@@ ur , the Iranian Direct@@ orate @-@ General for cooperation , work and social welfare , noted that 5 % of the pedi@@ gree is completed , 55 % have finished school school , 55 % a further school gradu@@ ation and 45 % have a university degree . &quot;
a &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot;
&quot; Kar@@ im Doh@@ im@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ v@@ azi human rights activists living in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and r@@ acial ethnic discrimination &quot; , &quot; to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of self @-@ mor@@ ants under the young pedi@@ gree women . &quot;
Doh@@ im@@ i said that particularly unemployment has become worse . reason for this is a combination of a high number of in Ah@@ wa@@ z new an@@ coming ethnic Persian and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the setting process :
&quot; the officials and institutions prefer not to set the Arabic labour force , the local Arab Ah@@ v@@ azi will have access to work opportunities in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is a part of a systematic policy of the ruling classes , which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and to force them to make their livel@@ ih@@ oods outside their home . &quot;
&quot; there are people who had to change their first@@ - and sur@@ names to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ mad@@ azi and thus to become so called , as even Arabic names in the workplace are not toler@@ ated , so@@ lic@@ ally the speaking of the Arab language or the dreams of Arab@@ ian clothing . &quot;
&quot; given the given circumstances , which have to bear the Arab pedi@@ gree , propose human rights activists , before the situation is explosive . &quot;
it remains to be seen whether the world takes up and take note of this .
the main reason for su@@ icide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and su@@ icide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; why I do not identify with femin@@ ism , even with inter@@ s@@ ect@@ ism . &quot;
detail of a photo . recorded by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . published under the CC@@ 0 Creative Commons License .
the following article is a revised version of the opinion which was published by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the website Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as . the article was the subject of several discussions where many different positions came .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
&quot; when I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , many women react - especially white women who describe themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with frustration . &quot;
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put well @-@ thinking scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be femin@@ ist and why we should be in general all femin@@ ist * inside .
&quot; for example , women nowadays still earn less money in spite of the same education as men . &quot;
&quot; that women still stand under str@@ ingent observation , when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their body . &quot;
that violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
&quot; or that cultural and social nor@@ ms still ensure that women have sooner or later in various areas of life to a smooth blank@@ et , and that discrimination based on sex still attrac@@ ts across the many different countries and beliefs . &quot;
all this is aware and known .
I am convinced of this and I will be twice and thre@@ e@@ fold .
I am a black woman .
&quot; yet , when I speak on skin colour , on rac@@ ism , on black CIS women , on black male women , on black male women , on black women in the LGB@@ T community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention how we have always been employed under rac@@ ism and non @-@ verbal movement , there were many white femin@@ ists and white interactive femin@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; but nevertheless , all agree that women - all women should come together to lift their voices and sing &apos; Kum@@ b@@ aya , my lord &apos; to sing the equality ( some ) of women . &quot;
&quot; but they do not want to talk about it , that in addition to sexual violence there is an institutional form of rac@@ ist @-@ based violence that we are exposed to black women . &quot;
&quot; or , that black women and women of other eth@@ nic@@ ities and future @-@ care@@ ers earn less than white men and women . &quot;
that black girl and girls referred to as a migration background of the school are referred to as a white girl because of obvious integration problems .
&quot; or that women are exposed in black spher@@ es and women with mig@@ rational background to suffer a higher risk , domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand I want all women , all men and at all persons with no skin colour , the same rights ; but on the other hand I may not consider myself to be a movement in whose center the white woman stands , who refused to consider the gender equality as well as to the skin color of a person . &quot;
I am exhausted and will no longer fight my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ oriented spher@@ es that has always rejected me and countless other black women and always rejected .
&quot; So@@ jour@@ ner compl@@ ained 18@@ 51 in her speech , &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; and also I refuse to see an ideology in which the black woman is a human and margin@@ alised nature . &quot;
&quot; I refuse to conclude , group@@ ing through cultural ex@@ propri@@ ation of our customs and customs , to put forward their eg@@ oc@@ ent@@ ric program . &quot;
&quot; I will no longer try to paraly@@ ze white women the importance of tor@@ rent of skin colour and sex . for some of them will continue to keep the importance of black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to revi@@ ve them of a better . &quot;
&quot; although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded in order to give women of different herds , and set out from the white femin@@ ism , there is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in its name . &quot;
&quot; I prefer to get rid of me fully and completely from femin@@ ism , which was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman instead of being used for a white @-@ femin@@ ist paradig@@ m , which is so stub@@ born phenomenon to be celebrated as a new phenomenon . &quot;
&quot; now it is more important than ever before , that we define black women to define ourselves according to our own ideas and to give us to the spher@@ es that are created by us for us . &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book of Afri@@ cana wom@@ anism : rec@@ la@@ im@@ ing ourselves ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : how we can defend ourselves by ourselves in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural , mental , se@@ el@@ ic , physical and even the spiritual elements can be re@@ vered that the black woman can do . &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists are immediately calling for separ@@ atism and exclusion , after they read these lines , I ask you to inform themselves about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of femin@@ ist movement by which the black woman is affected . &quot;
in a wom@@ an@@ ist environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures because in this paradig@@ m I exist .
I will be recognized as part of this paradig@@ m due to my deep skin and due to my existence as part of this paradig@@ m .
&quot; I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment where my life has no over@@ taken , nor ignored . &quot;
p@@ addle against pollution : the mission of a man to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations
&quot; this article by To@@ dd Reu@@ b@@ old was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reported in@@ special about international efforts to solve environmental issues . &quot;
in the context of a content sharing agreement this article will be published again .
&quot; over the past 7 years , Nab@@ il Mus@@ a travelled throughout the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or in Kan@@ u - with a special concern due to the Kur@@ dist@@ an region in Iraq . his mission aimed to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations . &quot;
&quot; in this documentation of Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who tells us his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution in his church . &quot;
&quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was still a child , &quot; Mus@@ a . &quot;
&quot; scientists from the whole country feared that the decades of war , the construction of shr@@ ubs , the pollution and the un@@ controlled development , lead to a direct g@@ inal crisis in Iraq . &quot;
Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organization Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance - which is committed to this and to protect the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the video Mus@@ a takes up the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; &quot; if we would have no water more , how would we survive ? &quot;
&quot; this video was produced for En@@ sia by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , one in Er@@ bil , in Iraq and a multi @-@ media journalist , produced , fil@@ med and edited . &quot;
&quot; the focus of their work is on pro@@ sec@@ uted , little out@@ lined sub@@ cultures and is characterised by the use of co@@ operative vide@@ ography and new multi@@ medi@@ al techniques , with their help supp@@ res@@ sed communities who can tell their stories in their way . &quot;
Paragu@@ ays women and their difficult struggle against violence
a group of women poses &quot; The crying women &quot; to express their pain on women &apos;s mor@@ ass in the country and in the region to express their rejection .

the following article is the abbre@@ vi@@ ated and worked version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # white ) that reported on the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to the protection of the affected individuals .
&quot; a police com@@ mander said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez , that they had nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , their extr@@ as , who had become violent against violent . &quot;
&quot; since the end of her relationship was over time passed and the police said , their statement would be put to the files , but more could not do . &quot;
&quot; as another wife Bal@@ bu@@ ena shows because of mis@@ use , useful also the ac@@ claimed ad of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez . &quot;
a few days later the second woman returned to their display .
breaking the v@@ icious circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; if women do not even display any advertisement , they generally receive no support from the state . &quot;
&quot; in many cases the women are also dependent on the men who abuse them . this explains why only 20 % of all women who admit , victims of violence should be present at all at the pro@@ secution . &quot;
&quot; content 1 b@@ lows and statistics @-@ 2 Un@@ visible mist@@ re@@ acts and a legal system that is nothing under@@ part 3 Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , defic@@ i@@ ent implementation of b@@ lows and statistics &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to determine how many women really are mist@@ re@@ ated , My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ lez , researcher at gen@@ der@@ ación , in Paraguay de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ studios , a social @-@ operative research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various indications and reports , but they do not even set up the scale of gender violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
the available figures are al@@ ar@@ ming .
in 2015 the district of 9@@ 600 ads went over for domestic violence in 2015 . at 70 % of this we went to violence against women .
86 % of the view of the police came from women .
&quot; there were more than 5000 ads for domestic violence in the peace @-@ courts . also , 86 % of the indicators of women have come . &quot;
&quot; in the ads 40 % of women , that they have been toler@@ ated physically , 55 % of women said of mental abuse . &quot;
these statistics however do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
&quot; according to the par@@ agu@@ an Women &apos;s Minister Ana Bai@@ ardi will also be displayed in fact a few of these crimes . &quot;
&quot; in any woman who will be re@@ funded because of bodi@@ ly mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment display , two women who do not do this , &quot; &quot; explained to the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; since women &apos;s su@@ icide in Paraguay is not a personal off@@ ence , the enforcement authorities cannot be adequ@@ ately documented how many women are ass@@ ass@@ inated by their current or former partners . &quot;
only until August 2016 journalists have at least 12 cases of women in the country .
coordin@@ ator for human rights in Paraguay documents at least 37 cases where women were mur@@ dered by their current or former partners .
&quot; according to their estimates , in Paraguay every ten days a woman died due to violence through men . &quot;

invisible ini@@ qu@@ ities and a legal system that is nothing to do
&quot; before Mariana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z the solid friend of Carlos Vera was , he insi@@ sted that she called him the name of all their former friends . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning she did not want it , but then there was still . this should be her for ever rep@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; today Mariana was 28 years old and no more with Carlos together . but for two years she defe@@ ated the mental force of violence , one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time identi@@ fying the most severe recogni@@ z@@ able : &quot;
I never thought that I would once again be victims of abuse .
&quot; I have read earlier about it , I thought that only women happened to sub@@ mis@@ sive , because they dec@@ eive themselves by violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that it would never happen to me .
Mariana used social media to report about the mist@@ re@@ ated by Carlos Vera .
&quot; without name , she wrote posts on Facebook in which they described its ins@@ ults and several attacks during their two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated them isolated . &quot;
&quot; many people responded to their posts , including Carlos himself . he asked rh@@ et@@ oric , whether he ever raised the hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of failure . &quot;
&quot; other Facebook users asked Mariana , why she liked the so long run by Carlos and did not left him sooner . &quot;
&quot; it seemed almost the case , as if they wanted to say that victims of mist@@ re@@ acts at least a certain in@@ noc@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; Victoria Santos , which not from Paraguay comes , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner she was mist@@ re@@ ated . &quot;
Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o te CRE@@ O ( &quot; I think you &quot; ) that consists of women who are all victims of mist@@ re@@ acts .
&quot; in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other . &quot;
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as case everything started with psych@@ ic abuse .
&quot; finally , your aff@@ lu@@ ent partner did it even to convince them that she was worth@@ less . &quot;
then he started to beat .
Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as Advert@@ ise with the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives . she did not receive support .
&quot; it led a trial against its former partners who developed into an imper@@ ative legal fight between Paraguay and her native country , in which it was mainly about money , power and influence of their former partner . &quot;
Paragu@@ ays Law : good approach , defic@@ i@@ ent implementation &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good , but are not applied . &quot;
&quot; the message of mist@@ re@@ acts is a way full of resi@@ stances and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ciary , &quot; says Victoria Santos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN @-@ Organisation for Women in Paraguay , sees great problems with the application of the laws in the country . &quot;
on 10 August 2016 in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Parliament was a bill that was discussed under the has@@ ht@@ ag # Por@@ El@@ las ( # Für@@ th ) .
&quot; this has@@ ht@@ ag and the movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non @-@ Less ) are part of a campaign on Twitter , which is supported by Am@@ nest@@ y International . &quot;
the origin@@ ating of the law sees to explain Fem@@ icide in an independent crime @-@ continu@@ ance and tough@@ er to pun@@ ish as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
&quot; thus , the legislative text has changed in some points in order to also win the MEPs for the law that feared that the way for the de@@ crimin@@ alization of abor@@ tions are prohibited , which are prohibited in Paraguay up to five years and can be pun@@ ished with up to five years . &quot;
&quot; the original bill introduced , the majority of the ( bureaucr@@ atic and economic ) proce@@ eding who have to bear the victims of violence in the present time , if they simply wish to receive display and maintain a safe accommodation , the state . &quot;
&quot; Ech@@ au@@ ri argu@@ ed that the law is not effective , if the legislation does not provide sufficient financial resources to it : &quot;
in Paraguay is to be seen as a part of inter@@ personal relationships .
&quot; here , a re@@ thinking will take place so that violence is no longer considered to be somewhat Nor@@ mal . &quot;
&quot; who in the face of these facts are silent , mit@@ ig@@ ate himself and contributes to that the perpet@@ rators will be fir@@ mer . &quot;
&quot; we have to re@@ claim so long ad , until fail@@ ing is no longer considered to be normal . &quot;
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ic Sen@@ at . previously , parts of the law has been altered , however , among other things were a passage that the partners came up in cases of domestic violence . &quot;
the opinions about the changes go apart .
&quot; the section regarding reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity for the ag@@ gres@@ sor , to attack his victim again . &quot;
&quot; the string of words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political force &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ as@@ sm@@ ent &quot; from parts of the law is considered a great retreat . &quot;
this article is the short@@ ened and worked version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # white ) that reported on the violence against women in Paraguay .

independent media in Oman a year after ban on a newspaper continues un@@ exposed attacks
&quot; this website has been locked because of a resolution of the Information Ministry , is locked on the homepage of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n homepage . &quot;
more than one year ago the om@@ an authorities have closed the independent Arab @-@ speaking newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of their coverage about corruption in the Sultan .
&quot; You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison , where he hi@@ des a one year prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , Ibra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and put to trial later , but later came free . &quot;
&quot; Oman has been governed since 1970 by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us ib@@ n S@@ aid , who came to power after he had set his father , S@@ aid ib@@ n T@@ aim@@ ur . &quot;
&quot; since then , he cl@@ ot@@ hed in addition to his role as the only Sultan , the most important minist@@ ries in the country : Prime Minister , Defence Minister , Minister of Foreign Minister , Finance , Chairman of the Supreme Council for the planning and President of the Central Bank . &quot;
&quot; the rule of the sult@@ ans is marked by the per@@ sever@@ ance efforts of the security forces , in particular of domestic violence , public freedom , including freedom of press , restri@@ ct and human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ gger and other activists . &quot;
&quot; the authorities restri@@ ct peaceful and legitim@@ ate activities in human rights system@@ atically and hin@@ dering citizens , even activists , to express their views on the public affairs of the country like corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline . &quot;
the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , their closure and the imprisonment of three of their editors last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country . &quot;
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper in which was founded in 2007 in Oman since its inc@@ eption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was prohibited by the authorities in August 2016 .
&quot; on 28 July 2016 , security forces Ibra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , made an article published in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 . it was by corruption in the judi@@ ciary and the interference of high @-@ level officials in judi@@ cial decisions . &quot;
&quot; in the report , government officials were accused , judges of the Supreme Court in Oman under pressure to re@@ plen@@ ish the judgment in an inheritance . &quot;
&quot; the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , July 26 , 2016 with a report on the title page with the heading : &quot; high @-@ ranking parties tie hands of the judi@@ ciary . &quot;
source : fac@@ ing@@ side of Az@@ am@@ n
&quot; on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i was invited to a member of the Editorial Board , from ISS the special department and captured upon his arrival by the security agencies . &quot;
on 9 August 2016 the ISS awarded the dep@@ uty editor @-@ in @-@ chief You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j who acted after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is arrest as a editor @-@ in @-@ chief editor .
&quot; the paper was closed at un@@ certain time after the disclosure ister was given the statement that &quot; the publication and spread of the newspaper on any way , including online , from 9 August 2016 prohibited . &quot;
on 26 September 2016 the first trial was held in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i . &quot;
the Court condemned the three journalists to pris@@ ons and also ord@@ ained the final closing of the newspaper .
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both condemned by the disorder of the public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining of the pre@@ stige of the state . &quot; &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was also found guilty on the violation of an audience pro@@ hibition and ev@@ asion .
al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sent@@ enced to three @-@ year prison and fin@@ es in the amount of each 3000 om@@ an Ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) .
&quot; al @-@ Abr@@ i was sent@@ enced to a year prison and an ATM penalty in the amount of 1000 ri@@ al ( 2600 U.S. dollar ) , after he was a threat to the distribution of material that could be a threat to public order &quot; to be found guilty . &quot;
for Al @-@ Abr@@ i a deposit has been fixed in the amount of 5000 om@@ an Ri@@ al ( 13 000 US dollars ) and was released on 22 August 2016 in the imprisonment of prison .
&quot; the App@@ eals Court spoke to Al @-@ Abr@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , condemned Al @-@ Ha@@ j , however , to a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i to six months imprisonment . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i was released on 10 April 2017 by exile of his six@@ ties prison sentence from the central prison sentence in Mas@@ kat . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison where he hi@@ des his one @-@ year prison sentence .
the App@@ eals Court also raised the decision of the Department of Information to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; despite the decision of the court , Az@@ am@@ n again , the newspaper looks after the attacks by the Ottoman government . &quot;
&quot; on January 8 , the information of the informations by &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; by three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the information of the inform@@ ation@@ ist personally signed an additional statement in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; has been extended for three additional months and with which the Minister asks one more time against the decision of the App@@ eals Court to publish the publication of the newspaper again . &quot;
the continuous closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where in Oman during the recent time press freedom has been viol@@ ated .
&quot; further violations include the closing of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country . &quot;
&quot; due to the continuing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the det@@ ention of the journalist al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ an authorities are still not prepared to prepare the extensive violation of the press freedom . &quot;
&quot; the Golf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the om@@ an authorities : &quot;
1 . You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j will pro@@ mpt@@ ly free and un@@ conditi@@ onally ;
2 . a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n to create their journalists in their work ;
3 . freedom of the press in the country to protect and
&quot; under all circumstances to ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman their right@@ ful human rights work is un@@ divided and without fear of re@@ pris@@ als , including path@@ ologist . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization , the human rights def@@ enders ( also independent journalists , blo@@ gger , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and in the neighboring countries by promoting the opinion and association agreement as well as the right to gather peac@@ efully and protecting them . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia where it takes place with his consent
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media or not at all . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent .
&quot; for the demand on site , there are two reasons : there are many medicines and vaccines that cover the special medical need on the African continent . &quot;
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis and mal@@ aria have a major problem in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investment in the research of these diseases through the pharmaceutical firms are a big problem . &quot;
&quot; secondly , research , which is carried out by African researchers in Africa . a greater role in science and technology can only be con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Central Market in the Center for the research of infectious diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR@@ Z ) . &quot;
&quot; he grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epide@@ mic first gra@@ ving impact on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Sam@@ bia for studying in the United States , first in Louis@@ iana , later in Indiana . &quot;
&quot; as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he explo@@ red at the HIV virus before going to go back home to support the sam@@ ic health system . &quot;
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ conc@@ eptions of the media using this research . &quot;
( Disclaimer : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as private individual ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . thereby I support the sam@@ b@@ ische national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
&quot; furthermore , I just sti@@ ff a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ ogens . &quot;
G@@ V : what are your opinion about the important current science topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they distinguish themselves from those in Western countries ?
RW : there are no fundamental research . we only have solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
&quot; this has to change , otherwise we will always remain the benefici@@ ary instead of being myself . &quot;
&quot; the solutions we get are often used in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use it here . &quot;
G@@ V : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are very different and supported .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who come back or retreat from here , because funding and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot;
G@@ V : how is the research infrastructure ?
&quot; which obstacles are available in your routine research , which you did not have previously ? &quot;
RW : the basic infrastructure does not correspond to standards in developed countries . it cost a lot of money to have continuous supply of electricity , water and internet . &quot;
&quot; laboratory equipment is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries . &quot;
G@@ V : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
&quot; RW : there are already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods . &quot;
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; G@@ V : how big is your opinion the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it focus on , and how can we support the development ? &quot;
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
&quot; there is need for special scientific training , starting at any age . &quot;
&quot; social sciences , computer sciences , Big Data , research on the space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and cont@@ ag@@ ious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly . &quot;
G@@ V : can you describe the pros and cons of life as a scientist in Africa on western countries based on your experience ?
&quot; RW : often it is the limited speed , things to do , and the hard access to scientific expertise that represent here challenges . &quot;
&quot; the system that magazines only make articles accessible only against payment ( the so called &quot; &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; &quot; ) , too limited to the amount of availability information and the speed of research . &quot;
from the USA to India : such as &quot; open source &quot; -@@ seed producers can change worldwide food production
&quot; this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide . &quot;
Frank Mort@@ on has been bred in the US for the 1980s .
&quot; his company offers 114 varieties such as Out@@ red@@ dish , the first plant which were cultivated by NASA @-@ A@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space . &quot;
&quot; for nearly 20 years mort@@ ar &apos;s work was achieved only by its own in@@ genu@@ ity , and the question of how many sal@@ aries he can get boundaries . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he noticed that more and more sal@@ ads were pat@@ ented and that he could not use them further to the breeding . &quot;
&quot; patents can not only be used for individual varieties , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , a special rotation or green rac@@ ted leaves . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years more such patents have been log@@ ged in more and more plants like cer@@ eals or cards . due to this trends , plant @-@ cutting , environmental protection and expertise in food security for the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia of old tradition , Mort@@ on still does salad , but it is now a longer time because his work is increasingly difficult to continue with more restrictions . &quot;
it &apos;s as if there are a bou@@ l@@ der in a river which I have to sl@@ ain down .
&quot; so we have to do that now , but it is a fraction of the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think that these patents go far too far . &quot;
&quot; and when they stand before judgment , no one can breed a new sal@@ at@@ as , because all the features are pat@@ ented . &quot;
&quot; however , it is very careful and ende@@ avo@@ red to use no material which is being protected as intellectual property . &quot;
he is also connected to a movement that is getting bigger in the USA and everywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; ) .
&quot; ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space station ISS red Rö@@ mer@@ sal@@ at of the Sor@@ te Out@@ red@@ dish served in the &quot; &quot; greenhouse &quot; &quot; of the station bred and eaten . there will be tested whether plants are grown in space . &quot;

it is not a coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement out of the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( Initiative for &quot; Open Source &quot; -@@ Sa@@ at@@ gut ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software that provides alternatives to copy@@ right@@ ed software .
&quot; it was called into a life to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property , and are permanently used for pest@@ ici@@ des . &quot;
&quot; in the framework of the initiative , shortly Os@@ si , you can commit US bre@@ eders to commit themselves to be free from them seed . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and to sell it . open source &quot; &quot; bre@@ eders allow others to breed their seeds , and not immediately utter@@ ance - two aspects that are prohibited or prescribed by many plant pat@@ ents . &quot;
do@@ z@@ ens of do@@ z@@ ens and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its start in 2014 .
glo@@ omy prospects
&quot; for the emer@@ itus Professor of Wisconsin @-@ Madison and Os@@ si member of the University of Wisconsin @-@ Madison and Os@@ si member , Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg on seeds and the possibility of breeding new plants are important for food safety as well as for the environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; as well , seed will also play a role in greater cohesion such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control over food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eders would try to use the latter not or only little by using natural resistance . &quot;
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg empha@@ sizes that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement is not busy with gene@@ tically modified plants .

&quot; Os@@ si Supp@@ or@@ ers ar@@ gue that the future of the food supply is at risk since the available Gen@@ eve is due to the increasing intellectual property rights of plant material , which is thus always available to shr@@ ink . &quot;
&quot; Claire Lu@@ by , executive director of Os@@ si , has engaged in her doctor@@ al work with gene@@ alog@@ ical variation in car@@ rots and their availability . it found out that about a third of all Kart@@ ot@@ ten@@ ants are protected as intellectual property , which makes it un@@ usable for plant bre@@ eders either not or only terri@@ bly . &quot;
&quot; there are such estimates yet , but experts like Lu@@ by assume that mass @-@ built plants like wheat is pat@@ ented than salad or car@@ rots . &quot;
a question of view
&quot; plants are ins@@ ulated that they have targeted characteristics - of such , by which their taste or their colour improves up to those , due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments , and threats such as p@@ ests or diseases . &quot;
&quot; opponents of patents on plant characteristics point out that the available plant material for bre@@ eder by more and more patents decre@@ ases . genetic variety is currently under@@ necessary than ever , since the changing conditions are far worse by climate change . &quot;
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ Spe@@ aker Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ uto know that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial to Mon@@ san@@ tos activities . with a total of four co@@ res and cooperation with institutions such as the agricultural Department of the United States , the company presents itself for the preservation of genetic diversity . &quot;
&quot; it does not oppos@@ e the view that the intellectual property is familiar with other bre@@ eders , since &quot; patents and the protection of plant vari@@ et@@ res innovations promote &quot; &quot; a patent is essentially a plan that everyone can follow , as soon as the patent is ex@@ pi@@ red . &quot;
often these instructions are helping to come with another method to come to the same result .
such protection also in@@ hib@@ its innovations not but promotes it to be made available by the public more material and know @-@ how .
&quot; Mort@@ on sees the different from 20 years to wait until a patent force , has certainly no innovations . &quot;
&quot; and if you need to wait for so long , to breed plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , one would have lost the struggle . &quot;
&quot; the main thing for Mort@@ on is that genetic resources have always been a general good and should continue to remain : &quot; independent pl@@ anting , neither the time nor money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ eti@@ ze incentives are not attractive for us . &quot;
we want farmers to make their work easier .
&quot; this is what drives us , and it will make us impossible if we continue to use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot;
&quot; overall , Mort@@ on deals with the concept to pat@@ ented plants : &quot; we create the characteristics really itself . &quot;
the plants are formed by themselves and as bre@@ eders we ultimately have no idea of how the plants do .
a secret of nature . &quot;
&quot; for Carol Dep@@ pe , plant bre@@ eder in the US @-@ State of Oregon and Os@@ si member states , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; &quot; who would like to grow a variety , and also bear his own values in them . &quot;
&quot; who believes in industrial agriculture with large cour@@ ty@@ ards and mon@@ oc@@ ular cultures , for their cultivation of her@@ bic@@ ide her@@ bic@@ ide , would like to grow in its varieties of this concept of agriculture . &quot;
my concept is very important . &quot;
&quot; while some moderate @-@ sized companies ( such who are moving on international markets , but smaller than mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents have to survive the most smaller strings , even without patents - either refuse them or keep it for too expensive and therefore not rewar@@ ding or both is the case . &quot;
the independent pl@@ anting Frank Mort@@ on looks for in his breeding garden sal@@ ads .
photo by Karen Mort@@ on .
&quot; Mort@@ on is also the view that bre@@ eders would benefit from the prevention of plant pat@@ ented innovative : &quot; it looks like I am with my efforts to produce new , stronger than companies that are pat@@ ented . &quot;
&quot; I need to constantly ask new material for my catalogue , since I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a couple of years ago , he says . &quot; with a patent for 20 years it is protected from competition , how to make it very pretty simple to my opinion . &quot;
&quot; although the US seem to be a leader in the &quot; open source &quot; breeding world , the concept extends however quickly around the world . &quot;
&quot; in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) establ@@ ishes itself as a professional organization in the area resources , an &quot; open @-@ source &quot; seed programme works together with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain requirements . &quot;
&quot; it also supports them to come to &quot; open source &quot; seed , to sell their own . &quot;
&quot; the German organisation Agre@@ co@@ l is working on a &quot; open source &quot; license , which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the Os@@ si obligation for bre@@ eders in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; ( regulations for breeding &#93; differ from country to country , why the Os@@ si obligation cannot simply be taken at one in Europe or other parts of the world . ) &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of November 2016 the executive &apos;s role of the European Union , the European Commission , explains that conventional herb should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . &quot;
&quot; however , an explanation is not yet a law ; now it is to the governments of the Member States to bring the sponsor@@ ship to this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 the Dutch organization H@@ iv@@ os hosted a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; -@@ Sa@@ at@@ gut@@ systems in Ethiopia , on the farmer , operator of seed organisations and seed companies from across East Africa to learn something about the &quot; open source &quot; -@@ seed movement and the worldwide trend for pat@@ enting seeds . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for H@@ iv@@ os &apos; program for &quot; Open Source &quot; -@@ Sa@@ at@@ gut@@ systems explained that the organization is currently a global alliance for &quot; Open Source &quot; -@@ Sa@@ at@@ gut@@ systems based , for the planned next year of the official start of the start . &quot;
&quot; a con@@ sortium of environmental protection and development aid ( including H@@ iv@@ os , the international non@@ profit development aid US@@ C Canada and concentration ) has compiled a database to seeds and biodiversity worldwide in order to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global alliance for the future of the food - a con@@ federation consisting of aid agencies like the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - a report published , it represents the possibility to exchange and improve the seeds , to ensure a stable supply of food . &quot;
&quot; in the report also emphas@@ ises the importance of a diverse , local supply with seeds for sustainable food systems - a context that by Lu@@ by von Os@@ si hopes to realize him soon more people . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has grown mainly on where and as something cultivated , and seed systems have hardly played a role played , &quot; so Lu@@ by . &quot; we are trying to make people clear that even more behind their foods . &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest goals of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in Egypt
still un@@ locking the Egyptian authorities content on the Internet .
&quot; this time , it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ ni@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; on weekends by the 05.@@ August , the Egyptian government passed the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which reports human rights ab@@ uses in Egypt and the Arab world . &quot;
&quot; August released the network of an opinion on Facebook , where the Egyptian authorities would be sharp and critic@@ ized the work and efforts to continue human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information Crow@@ bt@@ - despite this attack and the Constitution of the Egyptian law and the Constitution of the Egyptian law to defend ones@@ elf , to overcome the freedom of freedom and human rights in the Arab world . even though it has never been so difficult to overcome these targets to overcome the block@@ ing and un@@ le@@ ep . we ins@@ ist to fulfill our task further . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ HR@@ I is regarded as the first cen@@ sored website of a human rights organization in Egypt , after the authorities block more than two months of 21 websites , such as bund@@ ling the independent news of MA@@ DA Mas@@ r , Arabic @-@ language issue of Al J@@ aze@@ era &quot; due to alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of the wave of web @-@ side@@ burns to the victims fell . @ an@@ hr@@ i is one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language https : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
&quot; beside AN@@ HR@@ I also exists on the blog of colum@@ ni@@ sts and human rights research , Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada , no access to Egypt . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada used his blog for the spread of Colum@@ ns and articles , which he writes for in Egypt not accessible sites and media . &quot;
&quot; now the blog , which he set up in order to deal with the z@@ ens@@ ory apparatus of the Egyptian government , even the goal of a attack . &quot;
&quot; Blo@@ gger , the provider of which is also home to Zi@@ ada &apos;s blog , however , is further accessible . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former Muslim journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity , after he reported in December 2013 by Egyptian guards who reported on the Stud@@ enten@@ werk and a video took out the police of physical violence against two students . &quot;
his articles are mainly about politics and human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada said to the pl@@ anting through the government and reflected , what this means for him : &quot;
&quot; however , the blogs to block is very old , however , has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even if the block@@ ing of the blog may not be significant for the world , so it is for two reasons for me : &quot;
&quot; 1 ) It has managed to convey me to give me the feeling of a reward ; a arrest , a attemp@@ ted murder , un@@ loading at the national Security Council , the block@@ ing blogs as well as any other website , for which I worked . &quot;
&quot; 2 ) You have proven that I did not wrote for free . in other words , my words have influence , if only on a small audience . &quot;
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
&quot; first I took advantage of the post of articles , in order to deal with the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship . &quot;
&quot; however , after they have locked it , and that they have fear of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the brave go the way up to the end .
&quot; according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Ex@@ pression ( AF@@ TE ) Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06 . August 133 websites . these have technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provider ( IS@@ P ) , including Orange , Vod@@ af@@ one and Et@@ is@@ al@@ at . &quot;
&quot; AF@@ TE documented also the block@@ ing of vend@@ ors , which was possible by re@@ juven@@ ation of intern@@ ship and private surfing , so called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ PN@@ s ) &quot;
AF@@ TE reported in their research :
&quot; on Monday , 12 June we marked how the block@@ ing of websites that offer V@@ PN@@ s . &quot;
&quot; such practice indicates the intention of the government to block contents and to filter , to which Egyptian users could have access . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the situation will be dis@@ cour@@ aged by closed doors which the Egyptian population has no legal basis , helping them to proceed with the judgment against these actions . &quot;
&quot; now , the question : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and who will attack them next attack ? &quot;
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants dispute .

&quot; day for day newspapers report newspapers with dark headlines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard . &quot;
some of these headlines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old in school shot , &quot; &quot; The second day is a police officer in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; th@@ iev@@ es harsh Ph@@ armacy with military weapons from , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , Marine and Lu@@ ftw@@ af@@ ee to Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation , the non@@ violence have reached the highest stand for 10 years . &quot;
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organisation Global Justice even called to access the United Nations .
opinions like these have been daily and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least the manager of a local newspaper .
&quot; for the detailed reporting on violence in Rio known newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; on 16 August the Editorial &quot; This is not normal , &quot; in which they proclaimed a new section called &quot; War in Rio &quot; . &quot; &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now published there .
the mot@@ ives for their decision declared the paper so :
&quot; extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in any major city on the world like murder , smoke , sex , etc . everything , which however happens from the civi@@ lized standard , and what happens in Rio , is not going to call in the category &quot; War in Rio &quot; . ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal ! &quot;
&quot; this is the only alternative , so that we as journalists don &apos;t close our eyes before the cru@@ el@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; in a four @-@ minute video that was shared on Facebook , Oct@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , that this decision was not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure : &quot;
extra is probably the only newspaper all around the world with a war@@ rest in a country that does not even recognise the war .
&quot; in the same video , a journalist of the newspaper explains that it has been controlled by the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 8@@ 43 territories that are controlled by criminal organisations . &quot;
in the Editorial the paper writes further :
&quot; us is aware that a war @-@ drama , if it is dist@@ orted , even to be used , gr@@ ati@@ sts of the police , which first sho@@ ots and then ask questions . &quot;
&quot; but we defend war based on information and fight against corruption in the police , whose objective is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the m@@ af@@ ia and their partners . &quot;
would the name &quot; war &quot; more than they do ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Brasi@@ l argu@@ ed the journalist of Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira against violence as a &quot; war . &quot; this is in her opinion a just@@ ification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it possible to account responsibility in the police to account .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as Extra as an analysis of military deployment in Rio itself - in combination with sufficient investment in personal , education and historical and self @-@ pleas@@ ing negl@@ ect of public service . &quot;
the memory : the State of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than its capital .

&quot; Rio de Janeiro is false to call the most violent place in Brazil : &quot; 22 of 30 non @-@ violent cities in Brazil are according to the statistics of 2015 in the north and north @-@ east of the country . these are the latest available data .
none of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .

&quot; in the beginning this resulted in a decrease of violent deaths . for several years the U@@ PP , however , according to several reports on Sch@@ ik@@ anen and repres@@ sions against poor communities who should protect the newly established police unit , increasingly under cust@@ ody . &quot;
&quot; on his Facebook page , journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux from one of his article published in 2010 , in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not comply with the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war &quot; . &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; besides legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war is also serious consequences for people after themselves . &quot;
&quot; for this calls on the state to use the means and paths , which are typical of a war . the penetration into the territory of an &quot; enemy , &quot; with which a civil is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and an object for &quot; coll@@ ater@@ als &quot; and &quot; ir@@ rig@@ ged balls . &quot; &quot;

source : Can@@ Do@@ Action
&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian Revolution in 2011 and subsequent civil war many Syrian cities suffer from brutal si@@ ege and block@@ ades , mainly by Assad regime against loyal troops . &quot;
&quot; according to Victory Watch , a joint initiative of the Peace organisation p@@ ax and the Forschungs@@ institut The Syria Institute , in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , D@@ ei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ lib are currently around one million Syri@@ ans in a state of reward . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the region of East Gh@@ out@@ a , where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 called the life of a hundred civilians . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition are based on the basis of investigations on the United Nations and other human rights organizations that the mass@@ acre was trained by the Assad regime . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , these from the rebels have been controlled areas outside of Damascus , which led to the fact that inhabitants are ret@@ ained by tunn@@ els , or through tunn@@ els and control points . &quot;
due to the lon@@ gl@@ ade block@@ ade are traditional foods such as meat un@@ reachable for large parts of the population .
&quot; in a counter@@ position a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and academ@@ ics have the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , as they can plant their own mushrooms as &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da and perform the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms are not part of conventional foods in Syria and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine . its food makes it an attractive food source for many residents of the bel@@ ated east Gh@@ out@@ a .
&quot; direct@@ ing of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AFP : &quot;
&quot; we decided to cultiv@@ ate mushroom cultivation , because they have a high nutritional value similar to meat , and because one can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ahmed L@@ eil@@ a , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been fighting for three years now , this project is known and op@@ pres@@ sive his relief that it is now more and more &quot; &quot; acquain@@ t@@ ance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to collect money for the initiative I use in consultation with the NGO Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ as the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do .
&quot; it is planned to convey 125 families knowledge to the pl@@ anting of mushrooms , Dr. L@@ eil@@ a to Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the Constitution of this article they have reached over 100 % of their expected target from around 12.@@ 700 , but to Monday , the 04 . September 2017 , continues to collect donations to Can@@ Do . &quot;
the initiative is dependent on generators that hold the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
&quot; because of fuel , locally made fuels are used from plastics in order to supply the generators with the necessary energy . &quot;
&quot; Dr. L@@ eil@@ a said Global Vo@@ ices , that they started with the &quot; production from the regions of stem the mushroom seed , before they tested their quality and whether they are suitable for eating . &quot;
&quot; then they planted a small mushroom yard in a tub . when this succeeded , they used a bigger tub . and so on . &quot;
now they have designed a &quot; teacher @-@ yard for the region . &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months they have distributed fung@@ i everywhere in East Gh@@ out@@ a free .
Dr. L@@ eil@@ a explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; we want to join the people of the mushroom breeding of various reasons &quot; : bre@@ ach of the si@@ ege .
providing a new food source on the market .
&quot; spread of a culture of self @-@ suff@@ iciency by the vin@@ e@@ remains ( such as paper , tea , coffee , carton , etc ) for the production of new food . &quot;
&quot; creating new jobs , especially for women who work home . &quot;
creating new jobs for people with disabilities that are tied to their homes .
he said : &quot; we hope this idea to spread all over the world so our success as well as our fight against hunger and the si@@ ege is visible .
we want our experience to be inspired in crisis @-@ areas and we can help humanity .

Portuguese calls for justice to the victims of the bridge of 2017
&quot; several hundred people protest on 21 October in many districts of towns in Portugal and called justice for the victims of the fi@@ res , who assi@@ mil@@ ated in the week before the north of Portugal . &quot;
forty @-@ two people died and about 70 were wo@@ unded as a result of the forest fi@@ res of 15 and 16 October . this led to the fact that the government called last week of solidarity with the victims of 3 days a leader .
bre@@ ads were also registered in the region of G@@ ali@@ cia in Spain where there were 4 dead .
it appreci@@ ates that there were more than 500 fire@@ bur@@ sts that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and around 250 million acres of forest and numerous villages reached .
&quot; in June , Pedr@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande is a similar tragedy , where there was 64 deaths and more than 200 attempts . &quot;
&quot; according to the European forest@@ ation scheme , super@@ vised the forest @-@ areas per satellite shots , are burned in Portugal for approximately 500,000 acres of forest , an area of the size of the district Lisbon . &quot;
&quot; to give you a better picture from the seri@@ ousness of the situation , there are only in 4 districts . &quot;

the goal of the protests from Saturday was the demand for better pre@@ ven@@ tiv@@ - and fire fighting measures by the state .
people asked why the civil protection was not able to en@@ ame the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ ão So@@ ver@@ al of the Con@@ federation of Portugal declared the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :

&quot; a far @-@ reaching proposal on the forest @-@ form , which had brought the government after the weight@@ y fi@@ res in the years 2003 and 2005 , was accepted by the municipalities that saw the new rules as an obstacle to investments . &quot;
&quot; the government led a sl@@ ing of the law that allowed the activity of case authorized by means of the applic@@ ant , if the applic@@ ant could be built on means of self @-@ protection - that was an open back@@ door so that everything could be build , leads Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val in the same article of the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot;

&quot; in addition to these problems , the website of the civil protection of Portugal on 15 and 16 October , as a resident information examined or tried to contact information , offline . &quot;
it was a private initiative that presented the population with information provided : it took advantage of the own civil protection data using the application f@@ og@@ os.@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of the br@@ ac@@ tures .
&quot; the project was launched in 2015 by the developers Jo@@ ão P@@ ina in order to simplify the work of fire brig@@ ade and was adopted at this fat@@ eful weekend in October , that the site followed the ons@@ lau@@ ght of the 40@@ 0.000 users , which dec@@ ayed the site more than half a million tension . &quot;

the way to the refuge@@ e from Afghanistan to successful entrepreneurs

&quot; in one night in the autumn 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban . &quot;
&quot; two years previously , a terrible war had been defe@@ ated between the various Mu@@ jah@@ edin group@@ ings that had defe@@ ated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus Afghanistan became a country of terror and despair . &quot;
&quot; at that time A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , which belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province G@@ haz@@ ni in central @-@ gh@@ an@@ istan last time with his family at dinner . &quot;
&quot; even if his mother did not say it back then , she knew that she would not see her son very long - maybe even more . &quot;
in the dawn the boy was supposed to break up .
&quot; his un@@ cle would pick him up , and bring it to the tow . &quot;

&quot; Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of Haz@@ ara domin@@ ate party Hez@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat was just been mur@@ dered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara felt suddenly en@@ vis@@ aged . &quot;
the Taliban for their hate to the Haz@@ ara @-@ known Taliban came closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
some days after his flight took place in Pakistan .
he worked for a couple of years working in a Koh@@ leg@@ ru@@ be . the work was heavy and made him sick .
&quot; then he took what was left of his small reward , and went in Iran . once again he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and drag@@ ged s@@ acks with mort@@ ar , who were severe than he himself , in order to make his livel@@ ih@@ oods . &quot;
&quot; at that time , as today , the life of Afgh@@ an refugees has been shaped by misery and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; A@@ shar@@ af in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in a building building on site , where we worked on . &quot;
there were no services there and no heating . we se@@ du@@ red n@@ ylon in front of the open windows so that we do not refresh@@ ed at night .
&quot; after four years A@@ shar@@ af his life left without papers in Iran behind and turned out to be ready for travel to Europe . &quot;
&quot; during the dangerous transition over the sea , he suffered ships and stran@@ ded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island . &quot;
&quot; after the Greek authorities had refused to his asylum , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy . &quot;
&quot; some time was A@@ shar@@ af @-@ hom@@ eless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church who shared twice a day of food . &quot;
&quot; true that Italy due to relatively high admir@@ ation quot@@ as is a kind of second chance for un@@ defined asylum seek@@ ers , but it is true also that the conditions that asylum seek@@ ers in the country can be found cat@@ astrop@@ hic . &quot;
the human rights organisation of Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes the system suff@@ ers under a general lack of transparency .
&quot; the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers will be housed in the more than 3000 &quot; special reception centers . &quot; this is impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot;
&quot; according to Italian law asylum seek@@ ers may only be shared with a recording centre , if they officially put an application for asylum , which can still be transferred to registration for asylum . &quot;
&quot; until then , people who have no money to look for accommodation , either on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the street . &quot;
so it also de@@ shar@@ per .
but his un@@ beli@@ ever life @-@ w@@ ille helped A@@ shar@@ af to set themselves from these conditions soon .
&quot; after spending several years several working in the construction sector , A@@ shar@@ ia had made his entire appearance in the creation of a hostel in Venice . &quot;
&quot; this went so well , that after a while he opened a second hostel and a snor@@ ing bar . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ at@@ is &apos;s success story is now a theme of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director of A@@ min Wah@@ id@@ i .
&quot; the film received the Venice City Award , which was launched in 2017 for the 24th time . &quot;

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Ital@@ ians - are very difficult .
&quot; much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just a few of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to in@@ official estimates about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
for many of them the country is a transition solution on the way to other European countries .
&quot; in recent years some of Afgh@@ ans @-@ company enterprises , including cutting , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even pun@@ ched in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice Ham@@ ed Ah@@ mad@@ i had the idea to his restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iter and chef mainly refugees from different parts of the world are . &quot;
&quot; the restaurant &apos;s menu is told by the various Afgh@@ an , Ira@@ qi , Turkish and Greek courts the history of their trip to Italy . &quot;
the Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Padua the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Pizzeria Cab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a Sushi Restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
&quot; however , A@@ shar@@ af@@ s aims are far beyond the Italian furniture and retail and aim back to the country , which he had to leave behind a teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; where a risk is , are also ways , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
I never forget my country and I cannot live happy when I know that my people are suffering .
&quot; I am planning a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country , especially for women . &quot;
they represent the half of society and have to get the same options as everyone else .
A@@ shar@@ af also plans to learn plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul that can learn about the people of packaging and conservation techniques . &quot; so they can sell their seri@@ ousness on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says . &quot;
the development of successful entrepreneurs was a journey through uncertainty and doubts , but at the end stand stability and prosperity . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey itself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .
&quot; Ne@@ ti@@ zen Report : legislative reports from Egypt enable ab@@ sten@@ tion social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , has been in cust@@ ody for more than 900 days . &quot;
&quot; he reported on the clear@@ ance of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , which Protest@@ ant the president of President Mohamed Mor@@ si . &quot;

the Egyptian Parliament checks on a bill that is occurr@@ ing that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook for registration at a government authority .
&quot; users would have to use the social networks to be able to use social networks , within six months after the successful leg@@ acies to submit their full name , as well as their out@@ sourcing number . &quot;
who missed this step could be sent@@ enced to up to six months imprisonment or the execution of a criminal .
&quot; the law , which was divided by sixteen members of the Parliament , is currently being deb@@ ated at the legislative as well as the constitutional Committee of the Parliament and shall be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; in May , another member of Parliament would have a legislative proposal for a legislative proposal to be introduced in the tough@@ ening of the president or a high officials . &quot;
&quot; under Egyptian law the ins@@ ult@@ ing of the President and state institutions have already been pun@@ is@@ hable . under the legislative proposal , such an act would be pun@@ ished with pris@@ ons and money , so the legal experts of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot;
&quot; should the law requ@@ iring , this can mean up to three years in prison for re@@ members . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , this would under@@ line a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and assembly freedom has been in danger for many years . &quot;
&quot; a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ id ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) which was arrested on 13 August 2013 , while he demonstrated violence against prot@@ esters who fought against the military coup of the elected President Moh@@ ammed Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan wa@@ ited for as much more than 700 Protest@@ ants who were arrested in the same incident , four years in cust@@ ody on a court . &quot;
&quot; recently , his trial was post@@ pon@@ ed to the 20 May of negotiations , because the pris@@ ons moved to human rights groups to the accused of the accused of prison in the cour@@ thouse . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agre@@ es to hypo@@ cris@@ y , illegal assembly , murder and tried to murder . &quot;
in another case a criminal law in G@@ iza spoke the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary freely . they were charged for their coverage to the pro @-@ Mor@@ si session block at Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya place in Cairo .
&quot; the Court reduced the pen@@ alties of the journalists Abdullah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the previously mentioned incident , from 25 years to 5 years . &quot;
Tunis@@ ian activists through inv@@ aded documents
&quot; in May , Tunis@@ ian authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , which is co @-@ founder of the independent media platform N@@ awa@@ at as well as the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy project . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia re@@ alis@@ es mainly to a passed action plan . animated plan dates from the President of the Republic , the according to the plan expressly provided a controversi@@ al legislative act , the busin@@ essm@@ ents and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali may give the corruption survi@@ ving money . &quot;
&quot; the document published on 21 April on the website of N@@ awa@@ it@@ at &apos;s website , raises a light on how the pre@@ emin@@ ence plans to support the legislation . &quot;
Ben G@@ har@@ bia decl@@ ined the denomin@@ ation of his sources under indication of Article 11 of the Tunis@@ ian press code which journalists have the right to protect their sources .
&quot; nevertheless , he joined the District Court in Tunis on 09 . May as a witness in the event . &quot;
will China force the users of social media to submit their credit cards ?
&quot; according to new regulations of the Information Office of the State Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , users need social media in China to write permission before they write messages in social media or share news . &quot;
&quot; in the regulations , the registration with the full recur@@ ring names will be required . &quot;
an@@ alyst@@ s assume that the elim@@ ination of anonymous comments in conversations within social networks are to be achieved . it is still unclear how the authorities should apply these regulations .
&quot; Chinese network citizens have proposed in the social media , these rules apply only sel@@ ective to protect civil liber@@ alism and its independence . &quot;
do we see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
May lock the state c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of Russia access to the latest Chinese Mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
&quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat , in the state Government to register as the &quot; organiz@@ er of the information processing . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this design@@ ation is part of a law dating back to 2014 , thanks to which the Russian Government manages a list of online services that allows the &quot; publication of information responsible for removing content and to force them on request to the suspension of user data . &quot;
&quot; these websites are currently websites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ xi@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service mail@@ .ru and inc@@ ub@@ ating other services . &quot;
tur@@ quoise dish has wi@@ red Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
&quot; a tur@@ quoise dish had the block@@ ing Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administ@@ rators refuse to delete two English @-@ language articles , the details that Turkey support the jiha@@ dists in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the Turkish Ministry for Transport , maritime affairs and communication was locked , the site was locked , because it works to &quot; a source of information that works together with groups in order to transfer a political de@@ fam@@ ation campaign against Turkey . &quot;
&quot; it is the first time Turkey is fully blocked from the website . it is thus , in addition to China , one of the few countries worldwide , in which access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot;
great Britain cannot stop drop @-@ off
&quot; after this week , the government of Great Britain is located in the midst of targeted consultation regarding increased monitoring programmes that would force the internet services to monitor communications in real time and control the backup programs . &quot;
&quot; the government has consult@@ ed telecommunic@@ ations companies and intelligence services regarding the proposal , but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside . &quot;
&quot; despite all , the consultation will still run until 19 May . reactions and proposals by members of the public can be forwar@@ ded to the Ministry of State . &quot;
