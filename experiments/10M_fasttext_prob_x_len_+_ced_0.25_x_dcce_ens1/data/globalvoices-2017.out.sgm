<seg id="1">"although I had visited the USA for at least once a year, I would now live there for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love of America is extremely big.</seg>
<seg id="4">"as many of my generation I grew up with American films, I have read American music, American authors have read and run its sport."</seg>
<seg id="5">"indeed, this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly due to a American film journalist."</seg>
<seg id="6">"when 14 years old I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a fearless reporters who danced with the help of Julia Roberts as a Jura student who had tried his interest in judges who were his interest."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was trapped.</seg>
<seg id="8">"free to Method One," I was as if that is absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"and the year, which I lived in Arizona, had only strengthened my admiration for the USA."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I always said," America is the only country where I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting you are always who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of equal people. "</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had a very fiery love connection about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much was written about xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me as he goes with his bottling.</seg>
<seg id="15">"he never stops behind the mountain, as one says so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="16">"he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague, and explains publicly his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, AfroAmerican and Women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, people have responded to his statements and tuned for him."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the 13 million votes, which he won in the Republican elections, was the highest number that had ever reached by the party nominate candidate."</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigotte person I asked me?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not get rid of Trump and his voters with people whom I met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">"for example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, Director of Journalists, the people from all over the world takes a deep believing person, with whom I could talk about Islam and his past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"iniquity did not agree with Peter Bhatia, the present editor of the" "Cincinnati Inquirer". ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"Bhatia and I met our common love for basketball and we spent many hours with it, the" Phoenix Suns "play in the game."</seg>
<seg id="25">"Trumps intolerance is also in contrast to the generosity which I lived in Sandy Bahr, which was fighting for the environment, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like her son."</seg>
<seg id="26">"it does not fit her to the commitment of Kristi Kappes, who always helped with lots of patience and grace to me and my colleagues helped us to get used to the complexity of the American life."</seg>
<seg id="27">"then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentor, whose wise advice has helped me a lot in my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the people they embodied out of my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"during the Trump its way to the nominee presidential race, she offered me a stop and the counterpart to its limited vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule."</seg>
<seg id="31">"on November 8th 2016 there are over 50 million Americans, mostly white, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps precisely because of its contempt to non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the examination of the idea that people voted for Trump, because they were either part of his racism and fanaticism, or because they were ready to overlook those things, broke me almost the heart."</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to describe the Trump voters as Rassists.</seg>
<seg id="34">"to arrange people, one of my friends, is exactly what has led to us to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficially and respectful and indicates a inability to understand those who act in another way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">"could it be that these voters, of which most white are tuned for Trump, because they want to regain control of a country that she has disappointed?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, they might want to say that in this America they are still important?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, you hardly forget the words of David Remnick who commented the cruel decision to look up a man who look with contempt for those who look different from him."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this" "Whitelash" "(Anm. and SC.: so much like" Eching of the whites against all other ethnicities "; pun from white in suits to the whites and whiplash as it was the great Van Jones, exactly what America did so magnificent."</seg>
<seg id="42">"millions of people across the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality, it is nonetheless a powerful idea - which belief or background you may have always welcome, America is welcome."</seg>
<seg id="43">"for this country voted as his president, twice the son of a Kenianers, whose history, as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible."</seg>
<seg id="44">"with the choice Donald Trumps, there is a huge part of the white America this promise to and says: to hell with diversity, religious freedom and the whole concept of pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="45">"in America after 9 / 11, the white man is back at the rod, they say."</seg>
<seg id="46">"with all that I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq and what he was on the eve of the election."</seg>
<seg id="47">At a manifestation for Hillary Clinton had Mr. Khan had a modestal change with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would have my son, Captain humayun Kahn, a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan. "</seg>
<seg id="49">"the crowd answered with a" "strong" "no!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"could Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" "crested the crowd."</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" answered them.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do you have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" "they called and their voices were louder."</seg>
<seg id="56">"would someone who is not like you, a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a mony and silent "NEIN"!</seg>
<seg id="58">"Mr. Khan concluded with the words:" "God is thanks, Mr. Trump, is not your America." 36 hours later he was corrected. "</seg>
<seg id="59">"the land, for which his son was fallen, sent him a message."</seg>
<seg id="60">"that is now Trumps Land, said the message."</seg>
<seg id="61">"and all the people who look like Mr. Khan, could not find a place in this new America."</seg>

<seg id="73">"for several years now, La banda de Música (Musikbande) has been playing in the municipality: one of children and adults of existing symphony Orchestra, which has found a possibility to overcome the surrounding poverty by their music instruments."</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become the central interest for the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">"the community, which is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its drugs abuse and gangs violence."</seg>

<seg id="86">"in an article in the Los Angeles Times Favio Chávez, a local economist and musician taught the children of Cateura, to the initial time:"</seg>
<seg id="87">"first, it was very difficult because we had no place to rehearsals and we had no room at the same place where children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact parents, because many of them do not live with their children."</seg>

<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that the wild illegal fishing fought.</seg>
<seg id="98">"this post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published by Ensia.com, a magazine that reports about international, practiced solutions for environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="99">Re-release happens within the framework of an agreement with Global Voices for joint use of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">"in West-Africa, it was then known that this ship was already engaged in liberal waters illegal fishing, before it was looking for the other coast of Africa."</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were raised so far and little geneives to welcome a legislative rebreaker of this kind on their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comoros, Mozambique and the Seychelles mobilised rapidly against the ship. they refuse to give him one of their ports and refuse to give him a fishing permit."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries who were simply denied, Benedict Kiilu, a leading employee of the Kenyan fisheries authority. he discovered a part of a team that discovered the ship at the time and followed. "</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013 the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: it was not managed to catch fish in there.</seg>
<seg id="105">"finally, it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars in Liberia, due to looting the fish stocks of the country."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the core of this initiative, the criminal practices protects and protect resources was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NRO Stop Illegal Fishing (Illegal fishing)."</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are adjacent to Somalia and Madagascar the six countries who had sold the prime minister of their waters at that time.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" so we have eight countries that are equated and working together. they exchange information and stand up each other when it comes to illegal fishing, "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trusts project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support."</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is by definition unregulated: what is caught is hidden because it is extremely difficult to reduce it because it is illegal fishing as a main cause of over-fisheries by regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">"by intentional disregard to existing laws, by which certain habitats and species are to be protected, the illegal fishing ecosystems can harm, which have a delicate balance."</seg>
<seg id="111">"but while actions against illegal fishing once were imposed by the bureaucratic barriers and also by the snail-empo, with the information between individual countries, the actions of today is done in real time, with traceable on FISH-i's digital communication platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"there can exchange individual countries with each other such as lists, news about suspicious activities or details that can be noticed during a port-inspection or experienced."</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very attentive when moving these at the open sea by satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">"this allows the authorities to mark ships that are fish in the bothered areas. also, there can be so suspicious rides such as such that hints that a ship loads his caught fish on other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"ideally, such investigations can show whether the ships involved have a fish-scale licence, where they were traveling and possibly whether they have a penguage."</seg>
<seg id="116">"countries that are opposed to illegal fishing, the adoption of such ships can then be denied by their ports. and that the ships could not sell its charge. and that they could even be forced to numbers of penalties as in the case of the prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "there is a significant financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="118">"and that is what we want to achieve," says Per Erik Bergh, leading Director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a Advisory company that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i. "</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">"the platform has been created to regained valued 20 million USD to the lost sales, which will lose the eight members of the HISH-i each year because of the illegal fishermen that penetrate into eastern African waters."</seg>
<seg id="121">East-Africa has become one of the most productive tuna fish-fish because of the region's commercial fishing from all over the world. among these also those illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">"among other practices such as actions include the sails under false flag, counterfeit licensing, information protected by Phantasienamen, fish protected species and fish in conservation areas."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" they use the lack of international co-operation and make the weaknesses of a non-crowned control system, "says Long." "previously, a ship could not be illegal and a country could then say" You do not get my port. "" "</seg>
<seg id="124">"but another country could say 'Come to me'." "and exactly this legal loopath tried to close FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its foundation FISH-i was involved in more than 30 investigations of suspects ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has left criminals being exposed to spread the fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has been prosecuted ships and found refugees.</seg>
<seg id="128">"due to its co-operation with INTERPOL, the international authority for combating crimes, FISH-i can share information about illegal fishing on large distances and preserved."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" some of our studies lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime, "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that is to help the FISH-i-proof ships precise and precise.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo with friendly permission of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">"Fish-i's satellite system, which will always be further developed, also helps to watch the illegal ships who would like to hide."</seg>
<seg id="133">"" the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position, "" says Duncan Copeland, chef at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO focusing on fishing data and FISH-i technical support. "</seg>
<seg id="134">"some of the ships also turn their automatic identification systems, with which they can no longer be fed by satellite."</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland helps to build a system that connects different information levels. it should help FISH-i to help criminal ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team can actually influence the fact global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that."</seg>
<seg id="139">"recently, SkyTruth has opened the platform Global Fishing Watch platform: a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed worldwide by using the position of every single traceable ship worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" together with the neighbors, to get a better picture of what is doing - that's simply meaning, "" he says. "" here's a chance for countries to unite and to bundle their resources to study. "</seg>
<seg id="141">"we should do this at a global level." "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project to run, where a global system prosecures the persecution of ships."</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities are not only incriminals but also asshoppers.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships which used to be fished without license and hardly count with consequences they know that they are observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i participating countries have now reached a 33% increase in fisheries sales, since fishing boats for more licenses."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after FISH-i Somalia had helped to hit Greko 1, the inspectors found there on board tow, whose use is forbidden."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo with friendly permission of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"other countries also notice that successes." "the effect is so strong that we have now also copy other countries", "says Kiilu." "in West Africa disappear several hundred million dollars annually by illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="148">"in 2015, six countries joined together in the West Africa Task Force. they are now fighting illegal fishing, according to the same model as FISH-i." "With safety, the goal is to make even more such initiatives and structures even in other regions," "says Copeland."</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently, FISH-i's youngest member state in Somalia with his first major triumph: in October it was Greko 1, a ship that was under wrong flag. and not only the ship was also without a license and were used for bullets that are now banned."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship was also penetrated as bothered waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "with the accepting of rules against Greko 1, the strong sign that they go against illegal fishing," "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="151">"for FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time evidence that such a special, collaborative approach to protect the oceans actually works throughout the world sea. Emma Bryce is freelance journalist and lives in London. there she writes on environment, technology and nutrition."</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translators are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">"to transfer you need two important skills: passive skills, in order to understand the text text and to transfer active language skills to transfer him into the target language."</seg>
<seg id="378">"the latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is in terms of mother tongue. generally, the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - mother tongue."</seg>
<seg id="379">This is how a French mother tongue should translate into French - not from French into English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr-user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">"many Japanese companies do not deal with English as mother tongue, which could be translations into English. this may be attributed to a lack of understanding of the survival, quota or the relatively small number of English speakers who can be Japanese."</seg>
<seg id="382">"some companies that even do not have foreign employees, can be used translations to build firing internally. then, the Japanese staff, whose English is made known to translators - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are."</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr-user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Mechanical translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">"the literal and puzzling phrases created by mechanical translations, show that this technique may not replace a human translator for a long time. this applies to some of the languages."</seg>
<seg id="386">"some of the strangest English phrases in Japan, including the mysterious prints, often used T-shirts or pockets, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or understood."</seg>

<seg id="388">"translation errors may be acceptable or harmless or at least harmless, but by large companies or from the government that have the means to guarantee higher standards, you can expect to have more careful translations."</seg>

<seg id="544">"in early March 2017, designed for the North-East Japanese daily Kahoku Shimpo, which were achieved in the last six years to rebuild the life of those who were triggered by the" triple disaster "of March 2011. a massive earthquake, a tsunami and an atom-accident in Fukushima had triggered the disaster."</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai that is located in Miyagi Prefecture. the prefecture of Miyagi was an etected Prefectures in Japan. the both of them had to experience the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighboring winectures Fukushima and Iwate became twined for the tsunami and the tsunami had to disappear all the coastal cities of the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">"Fukushima still lived in Fukushima a nuclear accident, already alone because of the fact 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes."</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows from local point of view which progress has been achieved for six years to rebuild the lives of local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper includes both the statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authorities as well as survey results of those affected themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">"residential construction in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate"</seg>
<seg id="551">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement houses ("</seg>
<seg id="552">"the largest success among the three Prefectures could mark Miyagi, here 80 percent of the planned spare houses were finished."</seg>
<seg id="553">"Iwate has 75 percent of such houses finished, whereas Fukushima forms at 70 percent of the closing."</seg>
<seg id="554">"still, they are still trying to move for six years after the catastrophe, evacuated by BehelfsesTrutaku (iridescent themes)."</seg>
<seg id="555">After the triple catastrophe almost 80 000 people were forced to live in homes with homes.</seg>
<seg id="556">"in December 2016 there are still 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate in such Behausungen."</seg>
<seg id="557">"nearly 40 per cent of the evacuated in 2011 evacuated from Fukushima still live in emergency, while Miyagi was a successful problem. more than 75 percent of the evacuated farms that have been inhabited in final homes."</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate the figure is here at 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">"how the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper was able to determine 1074 of 1100 schools, which were affected by the disaster, its doors until December 2016, which makes almost 98 percent of the schools of the three Prefectures."</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later stands firmly that industrial reconstruction in the three Prefectures are far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">"while almost 100 percent of the fisheries in Iwate and Miyagi are now back in operation, in Fukushima only 30 percent of the fisheries and reproduced their operation in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="563">"the tsunami and the atomic accident, have moved into the three Prefectures agrarian agricultural land in Mitillumery."</seg>
<seg id="564">"Miyagi could reproduce 93 percent of its agricultural areas, with only 66 percent of the Ackerland in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed Ackerland in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="565">"it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the atomic situation, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed Ackerland of Fukushima, lie in the" nuclear-nuclear-zone. "</seg>
<seg id="566">"in two of the three Prefectures, tourism has broadly recovered, but also here Fukushima remains far off-beaten."</seg>
<seg id="567">"the tourist figures in Miyagi and Iwate are again to 90 percent at the same level as before the disaster. Fukushima, however, can be found here only 75 percent."</seg>
<seg id="568">"however, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reported that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants, it was more difficult to earn their livelihoods."</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">"to determine a total picture, the paper led numerous surveys conducted among the native population and under the evacuation and also how their sensation has changed on the tsunami risk."</seg>
<seg id="571">In their introduction of the article the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey in order to bring more about the tsunami consciousness among the native population in experience.</seg>
<seg id="573">"the survey conducted that 83.1 percent of local residents, measures have taken to be taken to have in order to be prepared for the future earthquake and tsunamis."</seg>
<seg id="574">"however, 55,9 percent of the respondents can still be done enough in matters of disasters prevention."</seg>
<seg id="575">How it is to those who had to evacuated from the Fukushima Prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">"in their issue on the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has strengthened its attention to the position of the evacuated from Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="577">"Fukushima did not just have to experience the huge earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, the Fukushima prefecture, was also the witness of the worst, catastrophenolic, atomic fact, the Japan ever had to experience."</seg>
<seg id="578">"from 160 000 evacuated from Fukushima, nearly 63 000 people were transferred outside the prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="579">"early 2016 there were a little more than 23 000 people, back to Fukushima, in permanent replacement houses."</seg>
<seg id="580">"after the date of 2017 still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima still live outside of their home country prefecture."</seg>

<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">"because the workshops were so popular, the team worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian Province of British Columbia, and was invited to organise similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in the U.S. federal state Nebraska."</seg>

<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation will be sung the refrain is sung on Cree.</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan you can see almost every restaurant plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="719">"to show potential customers what exactly is on the menu, are located close to the entrance shokuhin santou (i.e.," "Plastic models of dishes") from each food that is served in this restaurant. "</seg>
<seg id="720">The customers see these sculptures and then decide whether to enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is an entire industry which is dedicated to the manufacture of these plastics.</seg>
<seg id="722">"in the Tokioter district Kappabashi there are a variety of these small companies that produce the German filmmaker Wim Wenders in his film Tokyo-Ga, over 20 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese these plastics are so usually not even more striking. a new trend is turning it today in showy cell accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">"with Naval Matome, the Blogger itinii published the blogger itinii series of social media links and photos, which show this unusual twist with the shokuhin santou."</seg>
<seg id="725">"now in special sales: new with plastic, decorated mobile bands such as they are shown in Kichijoji Tokyu Kaufhaus."</seg>
<seg id="726">"many of these artificial foods have been turned to kitschy collective-objective, as in this case, refrigeration magnets:"</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few Shocels coolers for a new exhibition at the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom of the Essentifications becomes increasingly more complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case a decisen-don (a popular travel package was turned into a cell-base.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we have found a good use as mobile support.</seg>
<seg id="731">Also this part we have made for the exhibition at the station Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that contains your cell phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">"designed to look like an apple, with a notch for mobile phone, this is already a great design."</seg>
<seg id="734">And that is just the beginning of an increasing approach.</seg>
<seg id="735">"some cell-stand and mobile designers allow you to manufacture your own artwork. in this case, ikura and salmon, is used, a popular Topping which is served with white rice."</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter some of the users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"can there be someone who would say," Wow, cool, now I can wash my mobile phone with salmon. "</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will probably be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">"this interest in plastic, can also take a less appetizing form to surprise my colleagues or family members."</seg>
<seg id="740">Our new mobile phone-stand has the form of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">"in addition, there are also a traveller (onigiri), earrings, and handyrings made of dried salmon."</seg>
<seg id="742">"for more scurrile plastic, you can see yourself at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter using the hashtag # skillary,"</seg>

<seg id="749">"in reports and foreign media over the notorious" fight against drug trade "in Mexico, the most contrasts and cereals are regularly reflected in statistics. however, these reflect not at all the extent of the human tragedy, that this struggle with itself brings."</seg>
<seg id="750">"the coverage about drug bosses such as El Chapo Guzmán, the head of the Sinaloa-Kartells, the stories of the victims of conflict is entirely in the background."</seg>
<seg id="751">"on the day after a violent incident, no one looks at the sadness or on the parishes who have learned to live with pain."</seg>
<seg id="752">"stand behind each corpse, behind each bone, in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories paid for parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners, whose wounds may never heal."</seg>
<seg id="753">"that is why the Mexican news portal Animal Político is called the digital project" Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco "(German:" with the drug, life) to give this sacrifice and stories of people that grated in the fight between prosecution and boxes. "</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project so:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime cannot only be afraid of our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are much deeper.</seg>
<seg id="757">"for example, if businesses are closing, because they are threatened by drug dealers and have to travel many kilometers in order to buy something such as milk."</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video entitled "vidas camespor el miedo" (German: "how fear life changes") tells exactly these stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">"a main character is Guadalupe, a father, who is searching for his son every weekend graves after his son."</seg>
<seg id="761">"or Emma Veleta Rodríguez, who lost in just one day her father, her four siblings, her husband and two of her nephew."</seg>
<seg id="762">"priest:" "as every Sunday we prepare ourselves again to the task that we have provided us, go and to the graves, according to the people we loved, to seek."</seg>
<seg id="763">Guadalupe Contreras: "my son is called Antonio Ivan Contreras Mata.</seg>

<seg id="767">On 13 October he left the house.</seg>
<seg id="768">"on October 15th he should be back again, but he never came again." Emma Veleta: "it is very hard for me, for I am now alone with three children who need a training."</seg>
<seg id="769">"there is also my mother, which is also here with me."</seg>
<seg id="770">At the moment it has no income.</seg>
<seg id="771">"you are the insurance of my Father, but she does not pay it because they demand a mortal customer."</seg>
<seg id="772">Where should we get it? "</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprender a vivir con el narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">We don't just have to show the faces of those who are fear. we have to show the international community the conflicts, the fragility and governance. "</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">"KYHB, a reader of Animal Político, wrote this post from taxco, in the state of Guerrero in central mexico."</seg>
<seg id="778">"your contribution reminds us that one should never consider violence as normal, no matter what form it occurs:"</seg>
<seg id="779">Disease and sensitivity journalism do I know now for several years.</seg>
<seg id="780">I am coming over every day and see the cover-pages with images that actually can only come from a textbook for criminal.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">"sometimes I have the feeling as if I am the only one who is disputed, or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body."</seg>
<seg id="783">I can not be indifferent or consider it as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She writes further:</seg>
<seg id="785">"no, it is not normal that my 10 years old cousin thinks that he is great. and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the" "heroism" "of offenders, when they go through the streets."</seg>
<seg id="786">"for me this is, when would they fail those who have lost someone and those who have fear that they have something like that."</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories are going to bloc numbers in a statistics.</seg>
<seg id="788">The inomnia of men is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students become justified in a neighboring village that they are being settled.</seg>
<seg id="789">"I think they are trying to conceive that they remain spared by such tragedies, if they are not stiring and silent."</seg>
<seg id="790">"Maribel L. from Mexico-Stadt wrote the post" Four-month Erpressings in the main city district. "in this she describes how armed criminals was destroyed for month money from their business, until the end not only destroyed the business, but also their family apart."</seg>
<seg id="791">"you think of everything you have lost, and how many people can change your whole life in just a few days."</seg>
<seg id="792">"the pain of it never goes, the trauma remains, the fear comes back again when you are alone."</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers too. "</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">"the more we are removed from each other, the better."</seg>
<seg id="796">She closed her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">"we want the others to be arrested, for you don't know when they will guide you or kill you."</seg>
<seg id="798">"I asked me in these terrible days if wines are dissolve my deepest feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how you weep. I must learn to live with pain."</seg>
<seg id="799">The journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the article "The Lost Children of Ciudad Juárez: one of the victims of violence."</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions like: who takes care of the child of a missed woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement at the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexicos?</seg>
<seg id="802">"he is not like other boys of his age, whose parents worry about them."</seg>
<seg id="803">"bryan is a Waise and he tells us that he had to teach himself as a egg is cooks, Tortillas warm and" Chichi "for the babies who live with him. this is his name for preparing the bottles with water, sugar and milk powder."</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for the whole life of violence and who had to learn to live.</seg>
<seg id="806">"when he was five years old, he told him that his mother is gone."</seg>
<seg id="807">"but this was not the day, in which his childhood ended."</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was over two years ago when he was only a few blocks away from his home to the bloody corpses of his father had been shot by armed men from a pre-driving car.</seg>
<seg id="809">"when Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez looked like this:"</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 as a force by organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">"2008, 2009 and 2010 Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders for public safety and the government of the United States Government."</seg>
<seg id="812">"in 2010, the Prosecutor of 3103 Morde. this is equivalent to 8,5 Morden per day."</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of the hundreds of thousands of stories that organised organised crime in Mexico and invade the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories live in the face of getting new headlines further. this project we reminds us of those who we are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">"in addition to the project" Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco "has established the data journalism project Narcodata in which the complex information has been tortured behind the failed fight against drug trade, which has produced the country over the last four decades, in intelligible manner."</seg>

<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for pictures to messages.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">"in 2010 a petrol station passed the village of Sange in the east of the DR Congo, kippte and exploded."</seg>
<seg id="826">"after the civil war, Africa's largest country had been neglected and thereby devastated, the streets in the region have become dangerous paths of paws that were difficult to drive."</seg>

<seg id="835">"over the years the same photo was conducted several times on social media, blogs and other platforms and may not be attributed to real tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>

<seg id="838">Witnesses reported drastically of atrocities they had to flee.</seg>

<seg id="840">"there were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred."</seg>
<seg id="841">"but the numbers could not be confirmed." nobody remained back to count corpses, "said a resident to Human Rights Watch."</seg>
<seg id="842">"many have been dismembered, shot or burnt."</seg>
<seg id="843">"only on the basis of satellite images, the folktime could be depicted."</seg>
<seg id="844">The occasion for the attack remained unsolved but the armies in Baga has been a permanent conflict between the military Nigerias and the attempt by the Boko Haram to win country (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">"and here the picture of the DR Congo has again on, as it wrongly been presented as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack:"</seg>

<seg id="1138">"global Voices reported recently about another initiative of Steven Bird, the translatable blog."</seg>
<seg id="1139">"however, the focus of TLS is not on the written, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to get the language variety of great cities and to honour."</seg>

<seg id="1195">"the introductory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice that will push for his release, and want to know him back in his normal life and freedom."</seg>
<seg id="1196">"to see how bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us begin to think about their own destinies, deeds and decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose from?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of time-wise extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The Webdeveloper for Open Source and digital activist has been in the custody of Syrian government agencies.</seg>
<seg id="1201">"in October 2015, Bassel was born from the Adra-prison, a non-military establishment, an unknown place."</seg>
<seg id="1202">"his wife, the writer and lawyer, Noura Ghazi, reported that the" military police bassel were based on the basis of a "strictly secret" command of the military tribunal of his cell in Adra. "</seg>

<seg id="1206">"Barry Threw, a Designer, Technologist, and currently the leader of the head of New Palmyra, a project called Bassel, writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book:"</seg>
<seg id="1207">"maybe, none of Bassels cultural prototypes preconceived as the work that he started with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to reconstructed the ancient ruins of Palmyras."</seg>
<seg id="1208">"Palmyra, one of the most important archeological sites in the world, was the cross-cross of numerous civilizations, and found Greek-Roman architecture and Persian influences."</seg>
<seg id="1209">"bassel could not know that ten years after he began working with this work, the IS all began to put all this architecture that is not only embodied just the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world."</seg>
<seg id="1210">This steaming into the digital archeology and conservation has created a time-kapsel that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">"so, Bassel could not yet close this project yet."</seg>
<seg id="1212">"Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:"</seg>
<seg id="1213">"I have spent my overall life to dream of liberty and bass, taught me to embrace her."</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">"Bassel brought me English at, even when he was in custody."</seg>
<seg id="1216">"I learned to read English well, write and speak."</seg>
<seg id="1217">"he has always shared his knowledge with each one who asked him. he taught others who taught them in English, to write and speak."</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel has opened the gate to the technology. he taught me to use both computer and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">"he also brought other incarnations as they use computer, at least theoretically, without having held them in their hands."</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Warten) a prover that she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 her husband when he was in prison.</seg>

<seg id="1254">Mozambique: because of corruption made director of custody and resignation.</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mozambique has reacted with anger at a corrupt attack on which a government member after half of his sentence has returned to the workplace in the state apparatus on which the corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">"it is about Diodino Cambaza, arrested in 2008 and in 2010 together with four other defendants refushed by 54 million Metikal (about 800 000 Euro) to 22 years imprisonment."</seg>
<seg id="1257">"the money was from public funds from the airports of Mozambique, whose advice was Cambaza between 2005 and 2008."</seg>
<seg id="1258">"Cambaza has been released in 2016 for good guidance, and immediately called its re-position into the company, which happened on 19 April at the end of April."</seg>
<seg id="1259">"in accordance with the opinion of the General Office of the Republic, which grant the application, there would be no barriers to Cambaza, again to refer to his old posts, as the company did not progressed after its custody."</seg>
<seg id="1260">"however, many inhabitants are not good."</seg>
<seg id="1261">"the Centre for Public integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, short CIP), a local institution committed to public transparency, distributed in an interview with the Deutsche Welle made the decision of the company to address the director:"</seg>
<seg id="1262">Represents a setback in the fight against corruption and declined the lack of transparency and is even a retreat in relation to the efforts of our legal system so that CIP.</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we need to know is that the company should have a disciplination against the disruptive procedure.</seg>
<seg id="1264">"however, the firm were apparently and causes no proper legal steps for applying the relevant functions."</seg>
<seg id="1265">"Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the Mosambique of social media, this behavior also declined and regards the case as" contradictory ":"</seg>
<seg id="1266">"if Cambaza would be a competent guy, he would be adviser after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and it was half away."</seg>
<seg id="1267">He might hold paid lectures and motivating speeches; he could advise and be more polished.</seg>
<seg id="1268">"but since he is incompetent, he has ventured to reintegrate into the company which he helped damage."</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza is to be paid for its silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Contradictory!</seg>
<seg id="1271">"Bitone Viage, young Mozambique and student of political sciences in Brazil says, the director possesses no morals:"</seg>
<seg id="1272">"Cambaza is rewarded by the state because he revived it, I cannot believe that one rewards someone in such a way that the state has already been so massive."</seg>
<seg id="1273">"Cambaza is missing the morals and serve the state, * he had already served a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead only served themselves by the state."</seg>
<seg id="1274">"Cambaza used the state as a handele, it has become a inexhaustible money source and the state itself has become tired of this man who has condemned and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence."</seg>
<seg id="1275">"honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded."</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey Zeúte prefer to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique and Samora Machel to remind you that a thief are heard in prison:</seg>

<seg id="1289">"according to details of Facebook users in Myanmar, the popular social network took its posts from the net, because it contains the word" Kalar "." "</seg>
<seg id="1290">"although the origin of the word is still unclear, it is usually used to refer to humans at the Eastern Indian origin or generally referred to as adjective."</seg>
<seg id="1291">"Facebook censored the word" "Kalar" "or do not use the word" "Kalar" "or a part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of the hate language in Burma in the social network."</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years the rise of radical nationalist movements gave the word an extremely low-value causation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">"in particular, it is a word which is usually used by Ultra-nationalists as a hate speech against Muslims, which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"but in an effort, fight-hate speech in Myanmar, the company has a lot of sensual content on its platform censored."</seg>
<seg id="1295">"Kalar's is usually associated with racism, but the word itself is not automatically forth-hate speech."</seg>
<seg id="1296">"the context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that also posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts over the use of his usage."</seg>
<seg id="1297">"in addition, there are several Burmesan words with fundamental meanings that have the same letter-sequence such as' Kalar '."</seg>
<seg id="1298">"for example, chair is written on Burmesan even 'Kalar htaing', as well as other words like 'Kalar Pae' (age), 'Kalar oat' (Kamel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain)."</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebookusability Aung Kaung Myat declared the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends today was erased because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">"however, he had asked his friends in a spiritual way whether they might wüsst how he could relieve his back pain."</seg>
<seg id="1302">"the phrase ku la -" healing "(la) on Burmesisch - resembles the racial expression very, but the context is completely different."</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"Zin Win Htet is the opinion that they need to reduce hate-language nationalists, but also emphasised that Facebook must be analytical, before it all posts crashes in suspicion of racism."</seg>
<seg id="1305">"Facebook Deletes the word" "Kalar" "is not manually."</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filtered the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automatism will not understand what you write to Facbeook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">"what it should be done instead, the post is carefully to analyse and control it by checking the next words."</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar Pae" (age).</seg>
<seg id="1310">"the good is that these three-storey nationalists, spread the hate language, have received a pretty good lesson."</seg>
<seg id="1311">"now, it is time to circumcised her nationalism."</seg>
<seg id="1312">"while the action may send a strong signal to all, the hate language may spread, the efficiency of this strategy does not last long."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"the experiences of social networks in China like Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that the censorship of keywords often will start a katze- and mouse game, whereby the users will start to use social networks to express a new word or an alternative writing of the censored word to express their views."</seg>
<seg id="1314">"the author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook began to delete his posts as he wanted to tell his friends, that the word" Kalar "is banished from the social network:"</seg>
<seg id="1315">"when I was aware of this new directive by Facebook, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked."</seg>
<seg id="1316">"ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and me became the liken, post and parts of content for 24 hours, because the post" Facebook Community standards has not been corresponded. "</seg>
<seg id="1317">"Facebook has a variety of posts away from people who have no negative intentions or those just try to show off their opinions against the hate, radicalal nationalists."</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed that nothing has to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post the author shared his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have more to do before the beginning of the initiative, for example the Burmesan Internet community ask for advice:"</seg>
<seg id="1322">"Facebook likes to have a benevolent intent to reduce racism in Burma through their platform, but it does not work."</seg>
<seg id="1323">Such words must be censored only more hate within the various communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"moreover, it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and so words as" "chair" "or" "inherited curry". ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">"even when they found out that they did not make mistakes, they did not tried to manipulate the distorted posts."</seg>
<seg id="1326">"if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefit, which would seize them a big sales, that would be great."</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks automatic censorship is provided for a lot of ridicule under the users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">"instead of taking it seriously, users are talking about Facebook funny and write the word" Kalar "in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the network."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"here you can see some screenshots from Facebook-Posts, which contains no hate speech, but nevertheless they were still removed:"</seg>

<seg id="1470">A revised version was published here as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">"in many parts of India, women avoid women with the utmost care, the name of their husbands or even older men in the family."</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead they use a pronoun or say 'father of my child.</seg>
<seg id="1473">"from Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh give women to respect her to the social pressure of the husband, as well as fear of the consequences they should pay the norm in their lives."</seg>

<seg id="1475">"the tradition of their wives also does not call themselves on behalf of the name, is also common among men. however, they have far fewer assignments to fear if at all, they should not get this practice."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"in the small village Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health spersonal, as well as housewives, a unique club, and thus quickly became the main theme of the city."</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone when they discuss and discuss the intricacies of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1478">"as one of 56 clubs, which there are in 13 Indian states, he is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, which is operated by the Community Video Volunteers and advocates the reduction of the patriarchy."</seg>
<seg id="1479">"Rohini Pawas has been working with the help of their video camera on the uncovering of practices such as children's heirs to the exile of HIV- and AIDS-Ininfected, and leads these clubs."</seg>
<seg id="1480">"they reported how these clubs have created a safe place for these women, and they made them at the same time as an ambassador of change."</seg>
<seg id="1481">"the first video, the Rohini showed in its discussion, acted by women who don't name their husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1482">She decided on this subject because she wanted to open talks about the patriarchy with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"he did not speak according to the name of their husbands, is a breaker he considers it to be innocent and never put into question."</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini writes:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition demonstrates that a woman respected her husband and wish him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not hold this is considered to be a posterious as a woman without morals.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted in that we have never made thoughts up to this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"at the beginning, Rohini wanted to have never called her husband so far in the name of how it was going to try at home as it runs."</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband weigh for a long time after the video was at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said, I should name him from now on his name."</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in the luggage the Rohini started its first discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"many women had never heard the word" patriarchy "never before. some believed that there was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women."</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the lap Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">"after the videoprojection, the women attempted to bring discussion with an exercise in motion."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"sabini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with various feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"then she asked all," If we cannot say the name of our husbands, but they can call us how they want us, meaning that they do not respect us? "</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equal? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when they brought the name of their husbands across the lips," says Rohini Pawas from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra about the breaks of a centuries-old tradition, in married women should never speak the name of their husbands. "</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1502">"a woman was so shy, that she went during the whole exercise just before himself; another decided to let the whole rose frustration against him and his family by making him cursed."</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression of their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"even in adrenalin on it, having broken down with an ancient brace, the women decided that they would actually try to name their husbands in the name."</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they held their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next days Rohini received a variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">"the husband of a woman called Rohini, and asked what ideas they sat down in the head: his wife could not stop his name."</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member chose to do it for dinner before the entire family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"when her mother-in-law she was rigid, she got afraid and said that it was a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"a different woman said," Rohini said, I should do it. "</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant in was less understanding and the situation arted in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"Rohini reports how women tries to stop other practices, such as the Tragen of the zinnoberred dot on the forehead that shows the spouse:"</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do only women have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"I said to my husband, that I would bear the vanish red dot if he did."</seg>
<seg id="1516">"he laughed only and I listened to him to carry him."</seg>
<seg id="1517">"the other women have not heard completely with it, but my, they are now in a better position to choose, even to bear it in some days."</seg>
<seg id="1518">"for many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals."</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "we do a trip at any discussion club."</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"I do not want the women to worry, who could hear what could hear."</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last few months they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes; they danced and talking about things that they had never had thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">"I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have talked about some things, for example, like our identities to our husbands, have never been so honest."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels great to say certain things according to, no matter how small they occur."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"in a discussion, we talk about the concept of honor and how it is connected to the clothes."</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have borne only Saris in the group since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for most of them the okay, but some wanted a salist curta, a wide shirt about a pants, wear; they have not been dreamed."</seg>
<seg id="1529">"after much argument and discussion about the benefits of your own closeness, morality associated with the Saris and much more, tasted Rohini its own pair of Kurtas (Oberinhibiting) into a discussion lap so that the women could carry them."</seg>
<seg id="1530">"next, they decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can carry jeans and Rohini is certain that they can create it."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"on the question, whether in the five months have already changed a little time in the five months since their first panel, Rohini confirms that things slowly get into roles:"</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have so far taken small steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"some women tried it a few times, but then listened to the name of her spouse."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some, including me, make it yet, but only if they are alone and no other family members."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two shall continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now bear at any time Zinnoberred on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussionist know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - as the faint of more freedom of movement or her own closets - at the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">"by giving each other self-confidence, they will be aware that they sit in the same boat."</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explained:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"but this club gives each of us confidence, that something will change."</seg>
<seg id="1542">"and I know that it is not just limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction, when every woman goes home in the club and other people reported what we talk about and what we do."</seg>
<seg id="1543">We are all sitting in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may appear stupid since Singapore is recognised as independent state as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">"but according to the judicial minister, Shanmugam, Singapore was supposed to be seen as a city."</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"during the conference on the occasion of a meeting of the International Branch Association of the State of New York, the Minister for many people noticed the domination of the only political party of Singapore, because they are compared to Singapore with other countries."</seg>
<seg id="1688">He endorse that Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">Nobody asked whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">That is the most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"the blog Cavalierio praised the judicial minister," the logic to rotate "to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore."</seg>
<seg id="1695">"and then, according to all our efforts and insurances, create this valuable land, you hear that we are ultimately no country."</seg>
<seg id="1696">"it sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of a escape from the responsibilities, a compassisting."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"Singapore, if you are not my country, where country is it then?"</seg>
<seg id="1698">"the reasons for Shanmugan were not very posubel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'ordinary countries', given it seemed uninevitably undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"however, he has defends the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently led by a party."</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"once you reach the core point of the subject, the good old lyre comes from the authoritarian powers that will be the democrats, as they fit better to their power."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"in the final version, those last week of Shanmugam given answers to his American guests on our press, our Judiative, our political system really non-answers."</seg>
<seg id="1703">Relevant issues declined with non-answers rational way.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls for Shanmugam to clear his opinion as they did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">"when Singapore is not a country, but a city is to which country belongs to our city..."</seg>
<seg id="1707">"briefly, I understand nothing."</seg>
<seg id="1708">"I would be very grateful if our werter K Shanmugan would take the effort to elucidate this point, if he was paid high in order to be part of the government of the city of Singapore."</seg>
<seg id="1709">"by being published on the blog his comment, he pointed out to the critics to read the whole co-ordinator of the conference that in order to better understand the context of the statements of Shanmugam, according to which Singapore was a city and not a country."</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the co-ordinates.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"when he said that Singapore was more of a" city "than a country," he explained why the elections in Singapore was so unequally important, even if we are looking free and fair elections. "</seg>
<seg id="1712">He studied Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party in decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"when he said, Singapore" is not a country, "he obviously does not mean it in this sense!"</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam who does as a leader of a herangling generation to make such a polemical statement.</seg>

<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old cloister that I expect - if I agree with them or not, but this is another thing. "</seg>
<seg id="1717">"but with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of political leaders from Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes that he is really associated and aware of what he defends."</seg>
<seg id="1718">The Temasek Review tends the vulnerability of Shanmugams:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"did Mr. Shanmugam" benign a mistake, "or was it a free speaker?"</seg>
<seg id="1720">"if Singapore is not a country, we are only considered an independent and sovereign state?"</seg>
<seg id="1721">"if not, in which country go the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore?"</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique; it is equally land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">"as it plays an important role within the ruling kinetts, the statements of Mr Shanmugam are of serious significance."</seg>
<seg id="1724">"why do the Singapore authorities do their military service, but they only defend their city but not their country?"</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must pay our Prime Minister for invoices?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink workforce?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">"the magazine Journey of a decade to affirmation, Singapore and was always a city:"</seg>
<seg id="1729">"I did not say what I said..."</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have annoyed many Singapur...</seg>
<seg id="1731">Nobody ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / archipelago.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"I can understand that we often hear statements like" defending the country especially "," but that is not quite true. "</seg>

<seg id="1899">"I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, it is located at the border to Guatemala."</seg>

<seg id="1901">"it is managed by a 59- year-olds, a small woman with a coral-pink Brillengestel and gold-colored earrings in Teddybären form."</seg>
<seg id="1902">"she is called Concepción, González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula. nevertheless, they know many under the name Mama Africa."</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a target for Africans and Haitians who are travelling.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">"for about 2,50 dollar per night the guests sleep in simple rooms, with cold, crumbling walls and beds made of metal."</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Haiti migrants are coming here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">"sometimes, Ms Ramírez, people also tell in full small bushes and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call:" Mama Africa! "</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">"at the time it is rather quiet, but this year Ramírez has received 200 guests at the same time."</seg>

<seg id="1924">"you have lived in Brazil, however it is for some Africans who are on the way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move towards north."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"the family had heard of other forks from Mama Africa." Mama Africa is a well known name on the track, "explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti."</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that the Haitians and Africans are often travelling together the route and that the Africans are already talking on WhatsApp by Mrs Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">"as many of his companion, Michelet has lived in Brazil before and worked as a building workers on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the football world championship."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"when the Brazilian economy was weaker, he began his journey to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa: he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money in order to buy the Busticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him whether in the future he will contact Ms Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our Mother and we will never let them go again," "reply:" "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">"Mrs. Ramírez tells you that their guests are often sending text messages, when they are gone to grind them, or to tell you about the course of their journey."</seg>
<seg id="1933">They explained that their Christian faith was the powertrain of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">"she does not know much about Africa, but their guests have brought her to prepare chicken as in Ghana."</seg>

<seg id="1943">"I lived in the United States, he tells." "I have experienced what they experience."</seg>
<seg id="1944">I have crossed the border over the desert and we have suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others don't help. this is the reason why I give them my support.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"after having lived for three years, he was transferred to a raid on his work place from the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"the majority of migrants traveling through Tapachula comes from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their houses for them."</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he fled in Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to squeeze about him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"in Tapachula he has asked for accommodation and a unknown, an alluring, has offered him the roof."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"some months later the family lives still there and she tries to decide where the next steps should go."</seg>

<seg id="1953">A minibus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests to a large majority of Somalia.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian Rape Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + -community, freedom of expression and resistance "</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smoke a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">"the photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"Emsallam Hdaib puts the bulk of his time inside; sometimes he slipped to his canvas, sometimes to his computer, and again to his couch."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"but what one can rely on, is a cigarette between his fingers or his with nicotine clothing."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"he lives in the top floor of his family house, which was founded in 1967; the year, in which Israel had forced his occupation of the west bank, and Hdaibs family were forced to flee from their village in Palestine, where she had lived in felahyeen (about: Farmer)."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"for now six years Hdaib has been a passionate activist who faces the conservative majority and questioned their old opinions about gender roles, sexuality, and freedom of expression by art and rapmusic."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"with his music, who often deal with topics like Oriental, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, but also calls for the core of the whole Arab world. all these issues do not only find in his hometown of Amman Relevance, but also in cities that range from Damascus to Sanaa in Yemen."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"with his 25 years Hdaib sees himself as someone who is limited in his mind, and he can feel according to his own statement with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries like Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"even if he does not open it openly, he fought against US foreign policy for a special tendency."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib looks his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war zones, something with his identity as" Palestinian gearing of the second generation, "even though he was born in Jordan, and so far has never been in Palestine."</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I do not think of my own life situations," Hdaib emphasises. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">"then he adds:" I think so because I am a human being, while he was soldered in water, Nescafé in two cups. it is the holy month Ramadan; in this time it is provided for Muslims, from sunrise to sunset. "</seg>
<seg id="2105">The law also states that public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">"obviously Hdaib has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee in a senging hot young-day has little to do with protest against Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2107">"basically, the gap of lustrate coffee and the pigs of the Kent-cigarette in the nose are first of freedom."</seg>
<seg id="2108">"sometimes the Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky, especially if you throw a look into the neighbouring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"therefore, it is simple to do basic things - as to drink in public during Ramadan water - in order not to land in prison."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently, the Interior Jordanian Jordan placed an appearance of the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"some parliamentarians who support the Islamic State of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual Frontsaroos Hamed sensual, the cultural and traditional norms of the country and be the main reason for the concert hall."</seg>
<seg id="2112">The members and former press spokesperson in the Islamic coalition DIMA Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert was cancelled due to the sexual orientation of the session.</seg>
<seg id="2113">"many assertions that the commitment of the band in matters like the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is more dangerous activism, which represents the old-tested legitimacy of authorized regime in the entire region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement Mashrou'Leila the jordan people as a" progressive supporters of human rights, "which continue to act" for intellectual and cultural pluralism. "</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement is probably not easy to seize the rhetoric, but in fact an increasingly difficult-crystalluring reality in Jordan are clearly reflected in Hdaibs work."</seg>
<seg id="2116">"in the year 2016, Hdaib traditional sex rise to corpses by made his vision of the fate of Arab women, the vorehelichen sex."</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the picture shows the skeleton of a clearly lower-known woman, whose arms and legs to stretch up to the corners of the canvas."</seg>
<seg id="2118">"it is surrounded by a red lake, perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who are actually confidence."</seg>
<seg id="2119">"over the past few years, the number of" honors "was taken in Jordan - the inofficial outside is left."</seg>
<seg id="2120">"human Rights Watch, according to the number of honors in the year 2016 reached its peak; however, that Jordan is lacking the institutional infrastructure to support the women who have tried to support the victims of domestic violence or domestic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a law on interruption control from the year 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of internal violence," and for their release is often a long-term bureaucratic effort as well as the warranty on the part of the family necessary that the woman will be done nothing. "</seg>
<seg id="2122">Hdaibs's music enjoys great popularity and is well known for this reason to repurest in his country as a tabu.</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib contests that his work is political, however, is that he is full of his music, the full of explicit assinations on sexuality, freedom and expression, not from politics."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle, man."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"I was accused of politics", "he says."</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed" Hdaib takes the question of Palestinian identity in attack.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and in "ghareeb" the focus is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the list of songs, which are in the core politically, can be continued."</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib released a song with the title "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market, in which one can get what you want" - be it faith or non-faith, hetero- or homosexuality. "</seg>
<seg id="2133">He noticed that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of LGBT and lesbians and that comments on equality between LGBTQ + -individuals were still in strong in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014 Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular jordanic Onlineprogram ROYA, to notice that his comments have been removed from the context, and his opinion was censored."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but was only a edited version," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today Hdaib presents Hdaib open for the Arab LGBTQ + -community and represents the opinion that intolerance against homosexuals do not speak to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentioned Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, who still has remained in memory thanks to his homoerotic poems."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib asks itself: if Abu Nuwhat, who was later to work on behalf of the caliphs, in the eighth century could be openly writing about homosexuality, why can Jordanians not?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the Haschite Kingdom there is nothing new that the government attacks attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are brought to silence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian news service took place several former government agencies and members of the teaching association, with the reason they had expressed his comments on comments in social media who are related to the deep in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"given the concert Hdaibs, according to what is the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jordan."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"for him progress is a continuous giving and taking. Jordan, Mashrou'Leila has gone for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - it is of slow, thanked and internal changes. he is sure that these changes take place from day to day at the heart of the Jordanian Society."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"finally Hdaib, as millions of other Arabs also dreams, from an Arab world without interventions from abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he dreams, not only of it, his work until Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of it."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"it is perhaps the region with music, art and literature of a genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, dispensitions and artificificificiores democracies. at least he hopes that."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"until it is far as far, Hdaib becomes wider and therefore also resistance."</seg>

<seg id="2150">These great and extravagant warfare are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it is presumed that there is a variant of Tanabata festivals, which is usually used in August in many areas Tohokus. another theory states that the strongholds, the drums and dancing over more than one thousand years have been handed over to the north-east, in order to force the Indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emishi, to the knees."</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">"we were able to take a few great seats, so we have a great view."</seg>

<seg id="2156">"a joint centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, hosted a two-month exhibition to Wa no Akari (literally.)"</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have long been watching the Meguro Gajoen: two festivals are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">"nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the nebuta Festival has the only way to spend its summer:"</seg>
<seg id="2159">"" "Yattemare" "!"</seg>

<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">With friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">The following article is the revised version of the contributor "lovemaking news" to guerrilla warriors who published the international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">"is it not yet much more important, people who feel outlined, affection?"</seg>
<seg id="2185">"exactly this question went to the two young Colombian activists, Leonardo Párraga by the Young-Youth Foundation and inspired her to the campaign Cartas por la Reconciliación (letters to reconciliation), the young people encouraged to write letters."</seg>
<seg id="2186">"only recently, their land was the venue of a historical event and they wanted to contribute to their part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had concluded a peace agreement with the Guerillabewood FARC (German: revolutionary forces in Colombia), which forms the Schluspoint of the longest armed conflict in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"international was considered the signatories of the peace agreement, as meant that the Colombian President José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits."</seg>
<seg id="2188">"however, the Colombians is still a long way until one can speak of a real reconciliation and of peace."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"Guerrilla warriors, who lived for many years in illegal bearings, a war sretoric were exposed and carried out their weapons around the clock, must now be integrated into the life as civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"the Colombian society in turn, who had accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards Guerillakowers, they must now engage in their ranks and support them in establishing a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that young columbians would have to close together with the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And this is exactly what they did: until now thousands of young people are written - love-ships in former guerrilla warriors to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign are 6900 letters - one for each former guerrilla warriors - who are to be handed over to personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as an inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">"the idea for the letters to reconcile came on the world summit of the Nobel Peace Prize winner who took place in February 2017 in Bogotá. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to speak short with Kailash Satyarthi, the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"this explained that we love the people we love, in Valentine's day thousands of love letters, but those who forget it much needed."</seg>
<seg id="2197">"he plane, he told him continued to share his love with people this year, who needed the most urgent need."</seg>
<seg id="2198">"so the plan was made to write letters of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC who now have to find their place in society and to build up a new life." the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of a history of peace, "they say."</seg>
<seg id="2199">Previously the campaign was collected more than 2000 letters within the framework of the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá."</seg>
<seg id="2201">I never thought that someone would forgive me</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were transferred on 19 March at one of the UN camps in the Caldono Cauca region.</seg>
<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the Municipality of Cali and Leonardo from the Stiftung BogotArt traveled to the camp to bring the letters personally."</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC stood up as they had done earlier in order to receive the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">"but this time they received no orders, but letters from sheltered people from all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it was a very moving moment for everyone involved." it is incredible how many different feelings can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything between lies, "" told the political scientific study Manuela Jiménez Avila later. "</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a co-worker of the Governor of the province of Valle del Cauca described this unforgettable experience: "</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after we passed the letter, a former fighter took me through the camp of guerrilla warrior."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I saw in one of the" "Cambuches" "(a kind of cottage in which the Guerillakfighters) saw, I saw a guerrilla warriors who wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I was afraid to go out, because in addition to him on the bed was a MGL-pomegrancher, a fatal weapon in the thorn-chambernation."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"and I said to them nevertheless, and asked him," "Hello, what do they say?" he answered, "I answered him a letter I wrote to me."</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"never in my life someone has written something so beautiful, that's why I answered him." "then I suddenly answered the tears over the cheeks."</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him completely and sat down beside the pomegrancher.</seg>
<seg id="2215">"maybe he was sorry to be the war, I was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this struggles, and wanted to help him to write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never had anything else of life than war. he had never imagined the FARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers before the Hungertod. "I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">"but now I know that there is a society outside there, which is waiting for us with open arms."</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now I only learned how to handle weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">"for the prelude, students and some leaders of the FARC came together on a discussion."</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war and the FARC was already in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"therefore the leaders of the FARC said the history of the organization, its ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process:" many years, we have experienced the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party, we can help to create the society in this country. "</seg>
<seg id="2224">"for a purpose of this magnitude, it is worth to overcome all obstacles," "said one of them."</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"these people listen to those who have never found hearing, and not to recognize that people who have seen often seen as Monster and even hate, even people with beautiful feelings were killed by their lives and their environment, was very painful for me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">"the reality, in which the country lives, do me sore."</seg>
<seg id="2228">"however, it comforted me that all men - also who have killed and so much harm to us to give us something and a smile and a hug."</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"Gustavo González, commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Darío de Jesús Monsalve, the Archbishop of the town Cali, the following letter:"</seg>
<seg id="2231">Columbians was repelled that after the design of peace would rule peace.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"as long as it gives inequality, hunger and a lack of education, health care and employment opportunities there will always be people who are ready to attack and protest and to protest for their rights. and that is also completely justified (...)."</seg>
<seg id="2234">"we from the FARC now put on peace, on a policy without arms."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"therefore we call upon all defenders of peace - regardless of race, religion or ideology - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"we give you our word to do our contribution and bring sacrifice, because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. those among us who defend life as the basis of existence will be many difficulties."</seg>
<seg id="2237">"on our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them."</seg>

<seg id="2247">"the LGBT legislation in Chechnya has won the international headlines from several months ago, after reports were published, the deterioration, torture and killing of queerer men in the Republic."</seg>
<seg id="2248">"the first report was published by the journalist Elena Milaschina in the Nowaya Gaseta, she cast a light on the methods of the Chechen authorities, the suspicious queer men arrests and they fell in secret prisons in Argun."</seg>
<seg id="2249">"they have brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">"Sabrina, a transwife, was born in Grosny and grew up there."</seg>
<seg id="2251">"since her childhood, she felt that she was in fact a woman."</seg>
<seg id="2252">"when they grew, you became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for it, which is why they moved to Moscow."</seg>
<seg id="2253">"after a group of Tschetschenen was experienced by the gender equality, the hunt was opened on Sabrina."</seg>
<seg id="2254">"out of fear for her life, she moved the last end to the USA."</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I was working as a volunteer assistant at a human rights organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day I told me that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">"it was a familiar with Dagestan, a transwife who put in trouble."</seg>
<seg id="2258">"she had no money, so I took her without hesitation."</seg>
<seg id="2259">"while I tried to help her to help her, he would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread it all over the internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. he sent them to his Chechen friends, with the following message:" then there are no men any more in Chechnya who can eliminate these shame? "</seg>
<seg id="2260">Then the photos of my documents made by the whole WhatsApp the round.</seg>

<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>

<seg id="2267">Then I lost the consciousness and woke up the final end in the hospital again.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had received everything and started writing.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had an ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital I learned that I had to be two sampled in my right lungs.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which nurses have you been laid - in the men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">"Sabrina: my documents are outdated, there is still my male name dron; but the doctor understood and put me into the women."</seg>

<seg id="2275">"when I read his name for the first time in his burden, I got it with the fear of doing; it was a Muslim name."</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good man.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him that he was respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I got threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">"they shouted me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown."</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">"the slowed down, send me to Chechnya in order to prove that all that was a lie."</seg>
<seg id="2284">"they created absurd demands: some told me that I must prove it by the streets, but others wanted that I had not changed my sex in Grosny and I say that all my family had not been changed, and Photoshop."</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have a grain size C - what should I say in television?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it is still hard for her.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older people spoke once my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"they said to her," You have brought a monster to the world that not only your family, but the whole of the Republic. "</seg>
<seg id="2290">"we can not stir you because you are a devout woman, but you have to disappear from here."</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother was too much and she lay down a strick around the neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbours and they saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved into an apartment and a few hours later in the window stood a car with drafted windows and a number plate with a 95 dron.</seg>
<seg id="2295">"after it happened for the third time, it was clear to me that there was somewhat lazy."</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights professionals revoiced the numerology - it turned out that I was pursued.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how are you engaged?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">"for security reasons I want to not award their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"with her help I left the country, but then something unbelief."</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"I bought them, without sign up without saying, without any credit card, without anything."</seg>
<seg id="2304">I smashed my old SIM card and cast them into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checks in the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"in the moment I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message:" "you do not believe you in security, just because you left the country?"</seg>
<seg id="2309">"our people know, in which hotel you stir. you even know your room number."</seg>
<seg id="2310">Only to show it: it is the number 115.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Could you imagine it?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This actually was my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: stand with your family in contact?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"however, we do not talk about gender equality, but this is a tabby theme."</seg>
<seg id="2316">"" "some traditional Caucasical elements I am still in me."</seg>
<seg id="2317">So much I would like to overcome this seabian barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">"I am always saying that, as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to hurt them."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"when we chat with camera, I actually give to me trouble as the person likes to reminds them out of her past - thus to my male form."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But this is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">"what do your friends, those who have stayed here?"</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">I need current information on the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I spoke to anyone who had a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">"he told that during Ramadan, no man were arrested, and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not shut up a new wave."</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"for that I mean, they probably invite the relatives before, these take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end demand an evidence that the so-called" honour "through blood genugtuation."</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are now still held gay men in these secrets?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a acquaintance with me says there was not very many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">"if, then above all those who have no wealthy relatives or that were dropped by their relatives, to place Kadyrow Court."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"as far as I know, they are arrested there, so they can present them later as terrorists."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"say: should they be converted, you will show your body on TV and claim, they would have attacked either a village or a military support point."</seg>
<seg id="2334">Understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"as if these people were not simply disappeared, but targeted, to radiate themselves."</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this only one mutation or do you have a source of information for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was prisoned for a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard has grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There have since been nothing new about them.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They just have taken them away.</seg>
<seg id="2341">"and this so-called Lord, this person was even when these people were killed."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"until now they were not presented as bandits, but there has been no reports until now. we suspect that such actions are not possible."</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else would you not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know whether these persecutions and abductions of people who belong to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation already in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always carried my hair for long time.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think that before 2003 I was already known in Grosny when I still lived there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">"even from 1998 to 1999, when the sharia was considered, I never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"on the contrary, at that time it was much safer than now."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"Russia originally wanted to lead us to the" "civilisation", "but ultimately thrown back into the Stoneage."</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is it possible under the sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">"Sabrina: my eyebrows were ready, I had dyed eyelashes, carried the tube jeans and short Tops."</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Security Ministry of Sharia has never decided to give me a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"in front of the Russian theatre in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people met me."</seg>
<seg id="2356">"it was a small place where several benches stood, and the whole city knew; they knew why men, young people, met there."</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been insulted.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is an expression: Kharda ma Kharda. this means: "spotte not about the misery of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">"it is often said to children, if you have fun about sick."</seg>
<seg id="2360">"OC Media: so they just have their eyes closed before you, because they believed, you were sick?"</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">"they never dared, never dared and never beaten."</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long was this grace-time spent?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrow came to the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">"when he was appointed to Prime Minister from 2005, he began to talk on TV about morality."</seg>
<seg id="2366">"he is not talking about us by se, but primarily about the behaviour of women."</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could feel how the people began to change in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">"he was weakened, and had taken care of at once with Argwohn."</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">"but every time I came back home, I could feel how the situation in the Republic was steadily."</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you go now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I did not earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the USA not much.</seg>
<seg id="2374">"beyond that, I am still active as activists."</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicates with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"we organize teacups, co-arrivals, I meet her to hospital and help them to get dining options."</seg>
<seg id="2378">I do not have a cents for this.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people as I had a refuge.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslims and want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you have a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: this is aligned.</seg>
<seg id="2383">"thus, the nature, it has nothing to do with religion."</seg>
<seg id="2384">"this is exactly the same as cheetschenen, who want to do with foam in front of the mouth, that there are no threshold with them."</seg>
<seg id="2385">"the Dagestaner have whom, the cabine have which Russians also have which; on the whole planet there is it - but" not in Chechnya. "</seg>
<seg id="2386">"I come from there, that's why it is unpleasant to hear it."</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go into the mosque and while Ramadan fast live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">"you know many thinking about transcendidentity to men who love men, and they believe that you change his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that is a truckle."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"these are two different things - two different types of sensation, to be accurate, different vital settings."</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not be ashamed for my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"sorry to be so personal, but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago."</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not at all sad for this - I simply know that I am myself now.</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why I do not identify with feminism, even with intersectism."</seg>
<seg id="2434">Detail of a photo. recorded by: Pixabay. published under the CC0 Creative Commons License.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the opinion which was published by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on the website Afroféminas. the article was the subject of several discussions where many different positions came.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">"when I say that I am not a feminist, many women react - especially white women who describe themselves as intersectional feminists - with frustration."</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put well-thinking scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be feminist and why we should be in general all feminist * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for example, women nowadays still earn less money in spite of the same education as men."</seg>
<seg id="2441">"that women still stand under stringent observation, when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their body."</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women have sooner or later in various areas of life to a smooth blanket, and that discrimination based on sex still attracts across the many different countries and beliefs."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is aware and known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced of this and I will be twice and threefold.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">"yet, when I speak on skin colour, on racism, on black CIS women, on black male women, on black male women, on black women in the LGBT community or on black women from the Diaspora; if I mention how we have always been employed under racism and non-verbal movement, there were many white feminists and white interactive feminists."</seg>
<seg id="2448">"but nevertheless, all agree that women - all women should come together to lift their voices and sing 'Kumbaya, my lord' to sing the equality (some) of women."</seg>
<seg id="2449">"but they do not want to talk about it, that in addition to sexual violence there is an institutional form of racist-based violence that we are exposed to black women."</seg>
<seg id="2450">"or, that black women and women of other ethnicities and future-careers earn less than white men and women."</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girl and girls referred to as a migration background of the school are referred to as a white girl because of obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">"or that women are exposed in black spheres and women with migrational background to suffer a higher risk, domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women."</seg>
<seg id="2453">"on the one hand I want all women, all men and at all persons with no skin colour, the same rights; but on the other hand I may not consider myself to be a movement in whose center the white woman stands, who refused to consider the gender equality as well as to the skin color of a person."</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight my affiliation in a white-feminist-oriented spheres that has always rejected me and countless other black women and always rejected.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"Sojourner complained 1851 in her speech," "am I not a woman?" and also I refuse to see an ideology in which the black woman is a human and marginalised nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2456">"I refuse to conclude, grouping through cultural expropriation of our customs and customs, to put forward their egocentric program."</seg>
<seg id="2457">"I will no longer try to paralyze white women the importance of torrent of skin colour and sex. for some of them will continue to keep the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to revive them of a better."</seg>
<seg id="2458">"although the intersectional feminism was founded in order to give women of different herds, and set out from the white feminism, there is still the word" feminism "in its name."</seg>
<seg id="2459">"I prefer to get rid of me fully and completely from feminism, which was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman instead of being used for a white-feminist paradigm, which is so stubborn phenomenon to be celebrated as a new phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2460">"now it is more important than ever before, that we define black women to define ourselves according to our own ideas and to give us to the spheres that are created by us for us."</seg>
<seg id="2461">"Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book of Africana womanism: reclaiming ourselves (about: Africa-Womanism: how we can defend ourselves by ourselves in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural, mental, seelic, physical and even the spiritual elements can be revered that the black woman can do."</seg>
<seg id="2462">"although some white and intersectional feminists are immediately calling for separatism and exclusion, after they read these lines, I ask you to inform themselves about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement by which the black woman is affected."</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanist environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures because in this paradigm I exist.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I will be recognized as part of this paradigm due to my deep skin and due to my existence as part of this paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2465">"I, a black woman, can flourish in an environment where my life has no overtaken, nor ignored."</seg>

<seg id="2467">"this article by Todd Reubold was originally published on Ensia.com, a magazine that reported inspecial about international efforts to solve environmental issues."</seg>
<seg id="2468">In the context of a content sharing agreement this article will be published again.</seg>
<seg id="2469">"over the past 7 years, Nabil Musa travelled throughout the past 7 years - mostly with surfboard or in Kanu - with a special concern due to the Kurdistan region in Iraq. his mission aimed to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations."</seg>
<seg id="2470">"in this documentation of Emily Kinskey we follow Musa, who tells us his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution in his church."</seg>
<seg id="2471">"I absolutely wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was still a child," Musa. "</seg>
<seg id="2472">"scientists from the whole country feared that the decades of war, the construction of shrubs, the pollution and the uncontrolled development, lead to a direct ginal crisis in Iraq."</seg>

"</seg>
<seg id="2474">"at the end of the video Musa takes up the urgency and importance of his work in a question:" "if we would have no water more, how would we survive?"</seg>
<seg id="2475">"this video was produced for Ensia by Emily Kinskey, one in Erbil, in Iraq and a multi-media journalist, produced, filmed and edited."</seg>
<seg id="2476">"the focus of their work is on prosecuted, little outlined subcultures and is characterised by the use of cooperative videography and new multimedial techniques, with their help suppressed communities who can tell their stories in their way."</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the abbreviated and worked version of the article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay." the article belongs to the series # PorSerMujer (# white) that reported on the violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to the protection of the affected individuals.</seg>
<seg id="2482">"a police commander said Ada Báez, that they had nothing against Luis Balbuena, their extras, who had become violent against violent."</seg>
<seg id="2483">"since the end of her relationship was over time passed and the police said, their statement would be put to the files, but more could not do."</seg>
<seg id="2484">"as another wife Balbuena shows because of misuse, useful also the acclaimed ad of Ada Báez."</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later the second woman returned to their display.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">"if women do not even display any advertisement, they generally receive no support from the state."</seg>
<seg id="2488">"in many cases the women are also dependent on the men who abuse them. this explains why only 20% of all women who admit, victims of violence should be present at all at the prosecution."</seg>
<seg id="2489">"content 1 blows and statistics-2 Unvisible mistreacts and a legal system that is nothing underpart 3 Paraguays laws: good approach, deficient implementation of blows and statistics"</seg>
<seg id="2490">"it is difficult to determine how many women really are mistreated, Myrian González, researcher at genderación, in Paraguay de Documentación y Estudios, a social-operative research institution in Paraguay." there are various indications and reports, but they do not even set up the scale of gender violence against women in Paraguay. "</seg>
<seg id="2491">The available figures are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015 the district of 9600 ads went over for domestic violence in 2015. at 70% of this we went to violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the view of the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">"there were more than 5000 ads for domestic violence in the peace-courts. also, 86% of the indicators of women have come."</seg>
<seg id="2495">"in the ads 40% of women, that they have been tolerated physically, 55% of women said of mental abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2496">These statistics however do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">"according to the paraguan Women's Minister Ana Baiardi will also be displayed in fact a few of these crimes."</seg>
<seg id="2498">"in any woman who will be refunded because of bodily mistreatment display, two women who do not do this," "explained to the end of 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2499">"since women's suicide in Paraguay is not a personal offence, the enforcement authorities cannot be adequately documented how many women are assassinated by their current or former partners."</seg>
<seg id="2500">Only until August 2016 journalists have at least 12 cases of women in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">Coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documents at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">"according to their estimates, in Paraguay every ten days a woman died due to violence through men."</seg>

<seg id="2505">"before Mariana Brítez the solid friend of Carlos Vera was, he insisted that she called him the name of all their former friends."</seg>
<seg id="2506">"in the beginning she did not want it, but then there was still. this should be her for ever repent."</seg>
<seg id="2507">"today Mariana was 28 years old and no more with Carlos together. but for two years she defeated the mental force of violence, one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time identifying the most severe recognizable:"</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought that I would once again be victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"I have read earlier about it, I thought that only women happened to submissive, because they deceive themselves by violent men."</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that it would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report about the mistreated by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">"without name, she wrote posts on Facebook in which they described its insults and several attacks during their two-year relationship and told how he had isolated them isolated."</seg>
<seg id="2513">"many people responded to their posts, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetoric, whether he ever raised the hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of failure."</seg>
<seg id="2514">"other Facebook users asked Mariana, why she liked the so long run by Carlos and did not left him sooner."</seg>
<seg id="2515">"it seemed almost the case, as if they wanted to say that victims of mistreacts at least a certain innocence."</seg>
<seg id="2516">"Victoria Santos, which not from Paraguay comes, fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner she was mistreated."</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the Yo te CREO ("I think you") that consists of women who are all victims of mistreacts.</seg>
<seg id="2518">"in the group, they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other."</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case everything started with psychic abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">"finally, your affluent partner did it even to convince them that she was worthless."</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he started to beat.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victorias Advertise with the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives. she did not receive support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">"it led a trial against its former partners who developed into an imperative legal fight between Paraguay and her native country, in which it was mainly about money, power and influence of their former partner."</seg>
<seg id="2525">Paraguays Law: good approach, deficient implementation "</seg>
<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good, but are not applied."</seg>
<seg id="2527">"the message of mistreacts is a way full of resistances and a fight against corruption in the judiciary," says Victoria Santos. "</seg>

<seg id="2602">How do they distinguish themselves from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there are no fundamental research. we only have solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">"this has to change, otherwise we will always remain the beneficiary instead of being myself."</seg>

<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: such as "open source" -seed producers can change worldwide food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">"this article by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been bred in the US for the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"his company offers 114 varieties such as Outreddish, the first plant which were cultivated by NASA-Astronauts in space."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"for nearly 20 years mortar's work was achieved only by its own ingenuity, and the question of how many salaries he can get boundaries."</seg>
<seg id="2632">"but at the beginning of the 2000s, he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use them further to the breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2633">"patents can not only be used for individual varieties, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, a special rotation or green racted leaves."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"over the past few years more such patents have been logged in more and more plants like cereals or cards. due to this trends, plant-cutting, environmental protection and expertise in food security for the future of food production."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as a passionate representative of a millennia of old tradition, Morton still does salad, but it is now a longer time because his work is increasingly difficult to continue with more restrictions."</seg>
<seg id="2636">It's as if there are a boulder in a river which I have to slain down.</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we have to do that now, but it is a fraction of the breeding tradition," he says. "I think that these patents go far too far."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and when they stand before judgment, no one can breed a new salatas, because all the features are patented."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, it is very careful and endeavored to use no material which is being protected as intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">He is also connected to a movement that is getting bigger in the USA and everywhere in the world: open source Breeding ("Open Source").</seg>
<seg id="2641">"astronauts of the International Space station ISS red Römersalat of the Sorte Outreddish served in the" "greenhouse" "of the station bred and eaten. there will be tested whether plants are grown in space."</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is not a coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement out of the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (Initiative for "Open Source" -Saatgut) can be inspired by the movement for free "open source" software that provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">"it was called into a life to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property, and are permanently used for pesticides."</seg>
<seg id="2646">"in the framework of the initiative, shortly Ossi, you can commit US breeders to commit themselves to be free from them seed."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"however, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and to sell it. open source" "breeders allow others to breed their seeds, and not immediately utterance - two aspects that are prohibited or prescribed by many plant patents."</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of dozens and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its start in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">"for the emeritus Professor of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi member of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi member, Jack Kloppenburg on seeds and the possibility of breeding new plants are important for food safety as well as for the environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"as well, seed will also play a role in greater cohesion such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by using natural resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg emphasizes that the "open-source" movement is not busy with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all kinds of plants might be patented whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not." "to help our goal of ecological sustainability," "he's most recent examples are offered by the cooperations of ChemChina and Syngenta and Monsanto and Bayer, which is most recent examples, such as such vegetables are bred, it should also know that the way is bred as such vegetables are bred."</seg>
<seg id="2654">"dietary, without seed-good reasons is not possible."</seg>
<seg id="2655">"the members of the open source seed initiative is committed to providing support to others their seeds. thus, in contrast, the members of the Open Source Seed Initiative will continue to be patented in contrast, seed-good and plant-features."</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">"Ossi Supporers argue that the future of the food supply is at risk since the available Geneve is due to the increasing intellectual property rights of plant material, which is thus always available to shrink."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, executive director of Ossi, has engaged in her doctoral work with genealogical variation in carrots and their availability. it found out that about a third of all Kartottenants are protected as intellectual property, which makes it unusable for plant breeders either not or only terribly."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"there are such estimates yet, but experts like Luby assume that mass-built plants like wheat is patented than salad or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">"plants are insulated that they have targeted characteristics - of such, by which their taste or their colour improves up to those, due to which they thrive in certain environments, and threats such as pests or diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2662">"opponents of patents on plant characteristics point out that the available plant material for breeder by more and more patents decreases. genetic variety is currently undernecessary than ever, since the changing conditions are far worse by climate change."</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an e-mail, Monsanto-Speaker Carly Scaduto know that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial to Monsantos activities. with a total of four cores and cooperation with institutions such as the agricultural Department of the United States, the company presents itself for the preservation of genetic diversity."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"it does not oppose the view that the intellectual property is familiar with other breeders, since" patents and the protection of plant varietres innovations promote "" a patent is essentially a plan that everyone can follow, as soon as the patent is expired. "</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions are helping to come with another method to come to the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Such protection also inhibits innovations not but promotes it to be made available by the public more material and know-how.</seg>
<seg id="2667">"Morton sees the different from 20 years to wait until a patent force, has certainly no innovations."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"and if you need to wait for so long, to breed plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, one would have lost the struggle."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"the main thing for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a general good and should continue to remain:" independent planting, neither the time nor money for such formalities, and monetize incentives are not attractive for us. "</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"this is what drives us, and it will make us impossible if we continue to use the best and latest genetic resources."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"overall, Morton deals with the concept to patented plants:" we create the characteristics really itself. "</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants are formed by themselves and as breeders we ultimately have no idea of how the plants do.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol Deppe, plant breeder in the US-State of Oregon and Ossi member states, there is another important aspect of plant breeding:" "who would like to grow a variety, and also bear his own values in them."</seg>
<seg id="2676">"who believes in industrial agriculture with large courtyards and monocular cultures, for their cultivation of herbicide herbicide, would like to grow in its varieties of this concept of agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is very important. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some moderate-sized companies (such who are moving on international markets, but smaller than monsanto are) patents have to survive the most smaller strings, even without patents - either refuse them or keep it for too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case."</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent planting Frank Morton looks for in his breeding garden salads.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">"Morton is also the view that breeders would benefit from the prevention of plant patented innovative:" it looks like I am with my efforts to produce new, stronger than companies that are patented. "</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I need to constantly ask new material for my catalogue, since I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a couple of years ago, he says." with a patent for 20 years it is protected from competition, how to make it very pretty simple to my opinion. "</seg>
<seg id="2683">"although the US seem to be a leader in the" open source "breeding world, the concept extends however quickly around the world."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (" Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ") establishes itself as a professional organization in the area resources, an" open-source "seed programme works together with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain requirements."</seg>
<seg id="2685">"it also supports them to come to" open source "seed, to sell their own."</seg>
<seg id="2686">"the German organisation Agrecol is working on a" open source "license, which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the Ossi obligation for breeders in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2687">"(regulations for breeding] differ from country to country, why the Ossi obligation cannot simply be taken at one in Europe or other parts of the world.)"</seg>
<seg id="2688">"at the beginning of November 2016 the executive's role of the European Union, the European Commission, explains that conventional herb should not be patentable."</seg>
<seg id="2689">"however, an explanation is not yet a law; now it is to the governments of the Member States to bring the sponsorship to this new line."</seg>
<seg id="2690">"in October 2016 the Dutch organization Hivos hosted a conference on" Open Source "-Saatgutsystems in Ethiopia, on the farmer, operator of seed organisations and seed companies from across East Africa to learn something about the" open source "-seed movement and the worldwide trend for patenting seeds."</seg>
<seg id="2691">"Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos' program for" Open Source "-Saatgutsystems explained that the organization is currently a global alliance for" Open Source "-Saatgutsystems based, for the planned next year of the official start of the start."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"a consortium of environmental protection and development aid (including Hivos, the international nonprofit development aid USC Canada and concentration) has compiled a database to seeds and biodiversity worldwide in order to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"in September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the global alliance for the future of the food - a confederation consisting of aid agencies like the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others - a report published, it represents the possibility to exchange and improve the seeds, to ensure a stable supply of food."</seg>
<seg id="2694">"in the report also emphasises the importance of a diverse, local supply with seeds for sustainable food systems - a context that by Luby von Ossi hopes to realize him soon more people."</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement for regional and ecological foods has grown mainly on where and as something cultivated, and seed systems have hardly played a role played," so Luby. "we are trying to make people clear that even more behind their foods."</seg>

<seg id="2890">"at that time, as today, the life of Afghan refugees has been shaped by misery and exploitation."</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," Asharaf in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in a building building on site, where we worked on."</seg>
