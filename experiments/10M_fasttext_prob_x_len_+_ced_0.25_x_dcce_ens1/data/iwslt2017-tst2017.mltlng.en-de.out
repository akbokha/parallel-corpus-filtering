this is James R@@ isen .
you might know him perhaps because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize in the New @-@ York Times .
&quot; long before somebody heard from Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book in which he announced spectacular that the N@@ SA was illegal tel@@ eph@@ ones of Americans . &quot;
&quot; but it is another chapter , which should leave a permanent impression . &quot;
&quot; in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic U.S. intelligence , in which the CIA was literally overclock@@ ing for a nuclear bom@@ b . &quot;
&quot; if that sounds crazy , read it . &quot;
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who the chapter did not fall at all ?
the US government .
almost 10 years the government fought against R@@ isen and promp@@ ted him to name its alleged springs .
&quot; in this turn , he became a symbol of the pattern of the government , wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lowers and to acc@@ entu@@ ate to journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to the first constitutional review , the media have the right to publish secret information . &quot;
&quot; but it is impossible to use this right , if media cannot get these information and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave one . &quot;
&quot; so when the government came with R@@ isen , he did something that many cour@@ ageous rep@@ or@@ ters did before him : he refused , and said that he would rather go to the prison . &quot;
&quot; so , from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen lived with the risk to go into prison . &quot;
&quot; but then , only days before the process , happened something extraordinary . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , although they were lon@@ ge@@ vity for years that it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government were dropped . &quot;
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring the rep@@ orter and resources can hide less .
&quot; rather than fail to fail , this could also make his digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; and so the investig@@ ators chose , without its consent , his phone @-@ wise secret@@ ly concerned , &quot;
&quot; just like his e @-@ mail data , financial and banking information , its credit card , and even traveling @-@ wise with the list of its flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information they found evidence that they took advantage of Jeffrey Ster@@ ling , a CIA @-@ wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower and cr@@ ack . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is only one of many cases . &quot;
&quot; President Obama promised to protect his appearance , wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lowers . but instead , the judi@@ ciary has condemned more than all U.S. governments before him . &quot;
&quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government comes too much of their work as a secret . &quot;
&quot; since September 11 , nearly every article on national security has been the result that a wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lowers became a journalist . &quot;
&quot; so we put the press work on the game , which is supposed to be protected by the first constitutional review , because the government has more and more possibilities to show all of them . &quot;
&quot; but just as technology of the government allows to handle the rights of rep@@ or@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources better . &quot;
&quot; and indeed they can get up from the moment when they contact , instead of in the neighbour , in the stuff . &quot;
&quot; today , there are communication software that had not yet been written when R@@ isen wrote his book and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or telephone calls . &quot;
&quot; such a technology is Sec@@ ure@@ drop , an open source revision for wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lowers , which was originally developed by the internet of famous Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation by which I work . &quot;
&quot; instead of send an e @-@ mail , go to a news website , just like the Washington Post . &quot;
&quot; here you can upload documents up@@ loading or information , just as with any ordinary contact form . &quot;
these are then encrypted and stored on a server according to which only the particular news agency has access .
&quot; so the government can no longer describe information secret@@ ly , and many of the information they would call on would not be available from pre@@ n@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; but Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole , to protect freedom of the press in the 21st century . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , governments around the world develop new es@@ pi@@ on@@ ment technologies , all of us end@@ anger . &quot;
&quot; it is to us to make sure that not only technology burner like Edward Snow@@ den have a way to get mis@@ deeds , it is just as important that we protect the next wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lowers . &quot;
the ab@@ normalities when suppl@@ ying soldiers is modest to care and from crowded hospitals . or the next environmental care that strikes the alarm regarding the poll@@ uted water of Fl@@ int . or a Wall@@ street insi@@ sts that war@@ ns us before the next financial crisis .
&quot; after all , these technologies have not only been made for those who want to im@@ pose a crime , but to protect our constitutional rights . &quot;
thank you .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 the largest data set of data was released . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; reveal that King@@ doms and powers are hidden in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &#93; &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; we b@@ ate Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness to have a statement . &#93; This week we were based on messages about a le@@ ak of 11 million documents in Panama &apos;s commercial law firm Mos@@ o Fon@@ sec@@ a .
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers to companies like Mos@@ o Fon@@ sec@@ a go and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . &quot;
&quot; in fact , we actually see e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works , how it works . &quot;
this has already led to the first very direct consequences .
Islands Prime Minister is re@@ signed .
&quot; also , there are reports that a exile of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator is Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad @-@ Assad @-@ firms in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; it is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russian President Vladimir Putin will lead to a close friend of kinder@@ gart@@ ens , a famous cell@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; now there will be a lot of rich people and others who are nervous about the next release , and the next enth@@ used documents . &quot;
&quot; now , that like the p@@ lot of a agencies or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham @-@ Romans . &quot;
&quot; it seems crying from you , me , ordinary people . &quot;
why should this be that ?
&quot; but the truth is : if the rich and mighty in the position are to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not all their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , streets . &quot;
and this concerns us all .
&quot; for my organisation , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenomen@@ al . &quot;
&quot; all over the world discuss media and leading politicians , such as secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens of some few to be used to hide their assets and eng@@ aging -- something that we have been discuss@@ ing for ten years and reveal . &quot;
&quot; I think many people this whole world seems very confusing , and it is difficult to understand how these controls function . &quot;
I am always present to me like a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
&quot; so you have a company in another company , in another company that makes it nearly impossible to understand who is behind these prayers . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult for pro@@ secution and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what matters . &quot;
I find it interesting that in the US there are less reports on this matter .
&quot; presum@@ ably , because there were so far no prominent Americans who occurred in these revel@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; now , it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; however , by principle according to which these tax ha@@ v@@ ens function , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers . &quot;
&quot; if we had a backup of the Cayman Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would have much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it is so that in some U.S. states you need to provide less information about a company to start a company than to obtain a libr@@ arians . &quot;
this kind of in@@ transparency in the USA has allowed employees from deb@@ ug@@ ist@@ les to cover school children .
it allows sc@@ ams to cover particularly sus@@ cep@@ tional investors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this in practice looks like .
how does this actually work ?
&quot; so , we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan . &quot;
&quot; our investig@@ ator gave herself as African minister , who wanted to bring the suspic@@ ious money to the USA to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot;
&quot; we really shock@@ ed that all up to one of our investig@@ ator proposals made suggestions , how he could transfer his money . &quot;
&quot; these were all pre@@ dictions . none of these lawyers took us as a client , and of course nobody was handed over to anyone . but it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important to consider this not as an inci@@ dents .
it is not about a single lawyer , who has reas@@ sured our investig@@ ators proposals . &quot;
&quot; it is not about a single peak , wr@@ apped in a sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; it is about how the system works , through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; and to cope with this , we must change the rules . &quot;
we must change the rules to make this kind of behavior .
&quot; this may sound very melanchol@@ y as if we could do nothing against it , as if nothing could ever change ; as if there is always the rich and powerful . &quot;
&quot; but as born optim@@ ist , I see quite a lot to change . &quot;
&quot; over the last few years we have already seen more transparency in the past few years , which concerns the owners of firms . &quot;
the issue found political attention through British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 Summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
&quot; since then , the EU is in central regist@@ ers at the national level , who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them . &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is behind .
&quot; representatives of both parties have brought a bill in both parliament@@ arians , but this does not make progress we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how this Panama Dis@@ closure , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , used as a means to ensure more transparency in the U.S. and global . &quot;
for us at Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for change . &quot;
&quot; we need ordinary people who are angry , when they see how other people can hide their true identity and their true identity . &quot;
we need leaders in the economy coming up and say : &quot; in@@ transparency is not good for business . &quot;
we need leading politicians who recognize the issue and to end it through laws to end this kind of in@@ transparency .
&quot; together we can end the in@@ transparency , which now allow this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; this is the story , as I was almost kid@@ n@@ apped and in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das . &quot;
&quot; one day after I had completed my design studies , I made a back@@ side sale . &quot;
a guy in the red Maz@@ da remained and looked at my things .
he purchased one of my art work .
he was alone in the city and made just a road@@ trip all the country . afterwards he would go to peace .
I invited him on a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; as we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him , &quot; Where are you busy today ? &quot;
&quot; he made the whole matter worse : &quot; &quot; I do not know it yet . &quot;
&quot; and I thought , &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what do I know now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place ?
&quot; but I had just got to know him again ! he says he would go to peace @-@ cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really is planning that . I will not escape in the trunk of a Maz@@ that land ! &quot;
this is a small trunk !
then I heard myself : &quot; I have an air @-@ rate . you can sleep in my living room .
&quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; Are , how please ? &quot;
&quot; at night I was in bed , I rigi@@ d to the blank@@ et and thought : &quot; &quot; Oh man ! what have I lost there ? &quot;
a wild stran@@ ger in my living room .
what if he is crazy ?
&quot; I got such a fear that I went out of the bed , at the door of the door , and shut my bedroom door . &quot;
but he was not mad .
we are still in contact .
the artwork that he had bought from me today is in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
it was my first experience as a host . it has changed my view .
&quot; maybe people who were sold to me in childhood as a stran@@ ger , actually friends who wa@@ ited only waiting to be discovered ? &quot;
&quot; when I went to San Francisco , I was used for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air @-@ lift . &quot;
&quot; make a journey , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I am un@@ employed , almost pl@@ ess , my ro@@ omm@@ ates draws up and the rent is increased . &quot;
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
&quot; I think creativity can make it , anxiety in fun to transform . &quot;
&quot; I wrote my best friend and new ro@@ omm@@ ates Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could make a difference . our apartment is available to a designer @-@ bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk , including a mattress and every morning breakfast . &quot;
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and established so &quot; air @-@ rats and breakfast &quot; &#91; AI@@ R@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were able to sleep with us for 20 dollars at the air @-@ rate on wooden flooring .
&quot; they found it super , and we too . &quot;
&quot; I am sure to decor@@ ate our cheese @-@ ham O@@ mel@@ et , completely different because we made it for our guests . &quot;
&quot; we tou@@ red with them all the city . when we passed our last guest and liked the door into the castle , star@@ ed Brian and I call . &quot;
had we just discovered that we find new friends at the same time and could pay our rent at the same time ?
the things came into the re@@ els .
&quot; my former fellow @-@ inhabitants , N@@ ate Bl@@ ech@@ arc@@ zy@@ k , joined us as a developer . &quot;
we wanted to find out whether you could make a business concept .
&quot; we presented to the investors : &quot; &quot; we would like to create a website where people post their private pictures from their private rooms , their bedrooms , their baths -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closing when visit . &quot;
over the Internet they can then invite those strange people to stay with them .
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we wa@@ ited that the missi@@ le would like .
indeed they do not .
&quot; nobody who is still in sol@@ ace , would invest in a store , the stran@@ ger allows , in apartments of other people to sleep . &quot;
why ?
because we all learned as children that stran@@ gers are dangerous .
&quot; if one has a problem , one refers to the things that can be good . we could design@@ ate . &quot;
at the Kunst@@ akademie we learned that design much more is than just appearance and h@@ ap@@ tics -- it &apos;s the overall experience .
&quot; we learned how to create objects design@@ ates , but now we wanted to create through design imm@@ enses , between people who had never met before . &quot;
can design make a difference ?
is it possible to create with design confidence ?
&quot; I would like to give you a tasting tasting , which degree trust we are committed . &quot;
it is a 30 @-@ seconds experiment . it will force you out of your comfort .
thum@@ bs up high when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
&quot; now , I would like to un@@ lock your mobile phone . &quot;
give your entsp@@ ly mobile phone to your left bench .
&quot; this quiet excursion of panic , which you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts sense when they open the door for the first time . &quot;
the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
&quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , you will see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to keep the un@@ block mobile of a fore@@ igner in your hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
so most guests feel when they stay somewhere else .
only for this reason our company can exist .
&quot; only once , who is now actually Al Go@@ res mobile ? &quot;
could you announce it on Twitter that he can can@@ des for the Office of the President ?
you can now return the mobile phones now .
you now have experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I would like to tell you of some discoveries .
what if we had changed a small detail at this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neighbour have only been presented with his name only , if he would tell , how his dog or his children are called ? &quot;
&quot; imagine you would have 150 jud@@ gements , which all say , &quot; he can really hold very well un@@ lock bra@@ ys ! &quot;
how would you feel when you would have to leave your mobile phone ?
because a well @-@ out feedback system rein@@ forces confidence .
in the beginning we have made some things wrong .
&quot; it was hard for the people , negative jud@@ gements . &quot;
&quot; in the end , we decided to wait until both hosts and guest gave their testim@@ onies before we met them online . &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
&quot; we examined a study with Stan@@ ford a study . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how similar they are at age and location . &quot;
little surprising we can trust the people most that are most similar to us .
&quot; the more differences we find , the less we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social balance .
&quot; exciting , it will be exciting when you add the call of a person -- in our case through jud@@ gements . &quot;
&quot; if you have less than three jud@@ gements , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; but one has more than ten , changes everything . &quot;
a good reputation for comm@@ on@@ alities .
the correct design can thus help us to overcome some of our deep rooted ones .
&quot; furthermore , we learned that trust is dependent on how much you can buy from . &quot;
here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; if you tell too little about how &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; &quot; you get rather no answer . &quot;
&quot; one tells you much , as for example : &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- &quot; -- it is also not thought of the request . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , such as &quot; &quot; T@@ olle art@@ works in your home ! I am doing with my family vacation . &quot;
how can I create it with design to establish this degree of openness ?
&quot; we use the size of the text area to recommend the right amount text . we also give tips , to which topics you should write something . &quot;
&quot; our whole company builds on the hope that the correct design can help to overcome our prejudi@@ ces against stran@@ gers . &quot;
&quot; with which we were not reck@@ oned , the great amount of people who were more than ready to locate these prejudi@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; here , you can see how many people take our offer . &quot;
one can recognize three things .
&quot; first , incredibly good luck . &quot;
&quot; second , the ti@@ reless work of our team . &quot;
&quot; third , a need that has not been covered before . &quot;
for us the business runs very well .
&quot; of course , there are also times when not everything is smooth . &quot;
there were guests who have un@@ allowed parties celebrated or apartments devast@@ ated .
hosts have guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I have worked on customer service . all calls arrived directly to my mobile phone .
&quot; I stood at the front front , when trust was broken . &quot;
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts when I only think of it .
&quot; the disappointment that you hear in the voice of the call@@ ers , and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve ourselves . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , of 123 million people had only a fraction of a problem . &quot;
because people trusted each other too right .
&quot; if trust works , there can be mar@@ vel . &quot;
one of our guests made holiday in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his hosts brought him to the hospital .
he even ended blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his assessment :
perfect house for travellers who tend to be filled due to se@@ wage activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with plenty of hospitals .
&quot; Javier and Alej@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels who save life , even though they are not at all right . &quot;
they drive your own car to the hospital when you die and wait while you get a b@@ yp@@ ass .
&quot; because they do not want you feel lonely , they bring books past . &quot;
they can even longer stay longer without calculate the extra @-@ night .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
and of course it does not run every stay .
but this relationship behind pure money @-@ reaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
&quot; when I stum@@ bled upon this term , I asked myself : &quot;
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions come together ?
it is an economic trade .
&quot; but now it is simply &quot; &quot; ten@@ ant &quot; &quot; to name , the thing is not righteous . &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people lay a part of themselves and this changes everything .
&quot; when you travel nowadays , this is possible to compare with Fast Food . it is efficient and reliable , but for this is less authentic . &quot;
what if traveling would be a rich buffet from local impressions ?
&quot; what if in every place you visited , a group would be waiting to wait a group there , a thoroughly complete and one in a pub or neighborhood of which one has never heard before ; &quot;
or if you might learn cooking from a five @-@ star cook ?
&quot; nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy . &quot;
what if we would like to shape apartments from the ground up to the co @-@ operation ?
how would this look like ?
what if cities would accept the thoughts of common share ?
&quot; I imagine cities that allow us to make society and relationships , instead of lon@@ eliness and down@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; in South Korean capital Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking places , which were the government , &quot;
students are now offered to residents . students who were looking for a place ;
were given to people whose children were drawn . there were inc@@ ub@@ ator programs started .
&quot; to finance new start @-@ ups in the share Economy . through our platform alone , night 7@@ 85 000 people will be guests at a fore@@ igner or even host . &quot;
the idea seems to be not as crazy as it was brought to us .
we have not re@@ invented the wheel .
hospitality received it even before .
there were already similar websites in front of us .
why so did our work ?
&quot; apart from happiness and timing , we realize that you can find the correct design with the invent@@ ory of the trust . &quot;
design can help us overcome deeper prejudi@@ ces .
I think that amazing !
straight to overwhelming .
&quot; I have to think about it , when a red Maz@@ da passes over me . &quot;
we know of course that design can not solve any problem .
&quot; but if it could help us when it had such great influence , I ask myself what we can use design soon . &quot;
thank you .
what do you think when you see me ?
a Beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
&quot; or supp@@ res@@ sed , a bra@@ in@@ la@@ under@@ ing , a terror@@ ist ? &quot;
or simply a delay in the vulner@@ ability at the airport .
this is actually true .
I do not give you blame for your negative impressions .
thus the media people represent the same as me .
a study concluded that 80 % of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative .
&quot; studies show : the Americans mean , most of them would have no Muslims . &quot;
probably people do not talk to their che@@ ek drivers .
&quot; for all those who have never met such a Muslim : it is great , you get to know . &quot;
I say to you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee maker -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with Sah@@ ne extra . &quot;
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted
a Mo@@ or @-@ Fan@@ ati@@ cian
&quot; and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim min . &quot;
&quot; but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , For , Baby , I was not so born . &quot;
I decided that .
&quot; when I was 17 years old , I met the decision to ou@@ ten me . &quot;
&quot; no , not as a hom@@ os@@ exual person , as some of my friends , but as Muslim min . I decided to wear the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover . &quot;
&quot; my femin@@ ist girl@@ friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; why are you supp@@ res@@ sed yourself ? &quot;
&quot; the L@@ ust@@ ige was : then it was for me a femin@@ ist independence of independence , and in relation to the pressure I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old , to adapt to a perfect and un@@ reachable beauty . &quot;
I have not only believed the faith of my parents .
I have with the Koran .
&quot; I read it , thought , turned into question , dou@@ b@@ ted and believed . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was confidence and slow dedication that deep@@ ened with every reading of the coral .
the beauty of the rhyth@@ mi@@ k sometimes brings me to tears .
I perceive myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
&quot; had you ever feel that someone you perc@@ ei@@ ves you completely understand , and yet somehow loves ? &quot;
so it feels like that .
&quot; later I married and started , like all good Egyptians , my career as engineering . &quot;
&quot; later I had later , according to my marriage , a kid , and basically lived the &quot; &quot; Egyptian @-@ American dream . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then came the terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember where they were there .
&quot; I was sitting in my kitchen , had had an end to the end , looked on the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; rush &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was smoke , planes flew in buildings , people escap@@ ed from the buildings . &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock transformed itself fast into rebellion .
why should you do something ?
&quot; I changed the television channel and heard : &quot; ... Muslim terrorists &quot; ... &quot; ... in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; bom@@ b Mec@@ ca ! &quot;
&quot; Oh , my God . &quot;
&quot; it is not only my country attacked , but in the N@@ u , the deeds of others turned me from another citizen into a susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , we had to drive through the Middle West of the USA to move into a new city and start studying . &quot;
&quot; I remember how I st@@ epp@@ ed me -- as we went to silence -- so deep it went into my seat , and I was the first time feared to be recognized as a Muslim . &quot;
&quot; we moved this night into our apartment , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world . &quot;
&quot; and then I heard , saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations that said : &quot; be vig@@ il@@ ant , &quot; &quot; Sei@@ d cau@@ ti@@ ous , &quot; &quot; lead in well illuminated areas , &quot; &quot; conc@@ eal you not . &quot;
I stayed the whole week inside .
&quot; then it was added to Friday in that week -- the day , in which Muslims con@@ greg@@ ate to the prayers . &quot;
&quot; and again the warnings : &quot; &quot; do not go on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot;
I saw the full coverage of reporting .
&quot; the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ fil@@ tered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or by people who kept for Muslims in the Free , and struck . &quot;
there were truly bran@@ ded on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay home .
but something felt not really felt .
&quot; because people who attacked this country , have attacked our country . &quot;
I have conqu@@ ered the che@@ ut of people to the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly expl@@ aining itself .
I have nothing against questions I love questions .
these are the alleg@@ ations that are tough .
nowadays we can actually say people : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims .
when will we go on it ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church as of a tum@@ or in the body of the USA .
it only presents the question : are we v@@ icious or ben@@ ign ?
you know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tum@@ or remo@@ ves you as a whole and a ben@@ ign tum@@ or you can only see under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is incorrect .
&quot; Muslims are like all other Americans , no tum@@ or in the body of the US , but a vital organ . &quot;
thank you !
Muslims are inventor and teachers , Er@@ sth@@ ers and Olympi@@ oni@@ ans . &quot;
will the closing of mos@@ ques of America make safer ?
&quot; perhaps there will be some parking places , but not stop terror . &quot;
&quot; the regular visit of a mosque leads to people other faith toler@@ ant , and to show larger civil participation . &quot;
&quot; and as a leader of the police in the Washington , DC recently told : people are actually not radical in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they are radi@@ ated in their cellar or in bed before a computer .
&quot; in the radio process , one has found that it starts online . as First , the person is cut off their church , even by their family , so that the person believes the terrorists are the true Muslims , and anyone who desp@@ ises their behavior and their ideology is a tra@@ itor , or by faith . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent radi@@ cal@@ ization , we must stop people to go to the mosque . &quot;
some will still maintain the Islam is a violent religion .
&quot; finally , a group like the IS constit@@ uted its brut@@ ality with the Koran . &quot;
&quot; as Muslim , as a Muslim , as a person , I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot;
&quot; but we would add to their imagination , if one recogni@@ zes them as representatives of 1,6 billion believers . &quot;
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Kl@@ ux Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups maintain their ideology on their &quot; Holy book . &quot;
&quot; but if one thro@@ ws a look at them , it is not driving what they did in their &quot; Holy Scrip@@ ture . &quot; &quot;
it is her brut@@ ality that they can read these things into scrip@@ ture .
an outstanding I@@ mam told me recently an amazing story :
&quot; a girl came to him , because she could have imagined to the IS . &quot;
I was really surprised and asked him whether they had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; he said , the problem was exactly the opposite . every Spirit , with whom she had spoken , brought her to silence , and said to her that her anger would bring her sense of in@@ justice in the world , they would only bring in trouble . &quot;
&quot; inspired by nothing and something that had given sense to their anger , it was a main goal for the instrument@@ alization by extrem@@ ists who spoke of a solution . &quot;
this I@@ mam made the link to God and her community .
&quot; instead of descri@@ bing them for her anger , he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world . &quot;
&quot; learned what she learned in the mosque , they kept it before the IS . &quot;
it was an insight into the Islam@@ opho@@ bia and my family .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect anyone ?
&quot; how is the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear everyday to our democracy , to our minds ? &quot;
one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : when we fear that at least three things happen .
we accept rather an author@@ it@@ arian government system , con@@ form@@ ance and prejudi@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; a study reveals : when you have a trial news in which negative about Muslims was reported that they were rather military attacks on Muslim countries , as well as the circum@@ cision of the rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not just an academic problem .
when you look when the mood against Muslims after the above -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times but never in connection with terror@@ ist attacks .
it happened in the advance of Iraq war and during two choices .
&quot; so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Mos@@ lem @-@ terror , as I expected it . &quot;
&quot; it can actually be a tool to manip@@ ulation the public , to run the foundation of free society , the rational and well informed citizens . &quot;
the handling of Mos@@ l@@ ems is an early sign .
we may sense it as the first but the tox@@ ic@@ onic air of fear is nar@@ row@@ ed to all of us .
&quot; in the assignment of collective school , it is not just about to explain itself . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was a athl@@ ete .
&quot; he was very promising at the dental fac@@ ulty , talented , much promising ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , generous person who knew . &quot;
she visited him there and he showed her his life . she was stun@@ ned and said :
&quot; when is such a sealed young man ? &quot;
&quot; just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne on her brother and his wife , her neighbour , Craig Stephen H@@ icks , she was mur@@ dered as well as the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an who had posted an afternoon on the afternoon after he posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page . &quot;
he fi@@ red eight times to De@@ ah .
Fan@@ ati@@ cism can not only be imm@@ oral but also fatal .
&quot; so , back to the beginning . &quot;
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
are we gone to the mosque or have we been safe at home ?
&quot; we were pra@@ ised it and for us it was not an easy decision , as it was about to leave us to our children : one that would control us through fear , or one where we can exercise our religion freely . &quot;
we decided to the mosque .
&quot; with our son in the children &apos;s headquarters , we headed off with high pressure on the mosque . &quot;
&quot; I took it out , my shoes went out , went into the prayer hall , and what I saw , left me . &quot;
the hall was rest@@ less filled .
&quot; then the I@@ mam made an announcement , than@@ ked themselves and was our guests welcome , as half of the gathered were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hist@@ s , A@@ thei@@ sts , believers , and non @-@ believers who were not at us . &quot;
in that moment I am coll@@ ap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had the courage and compassion of panic and prejudi@@ ces .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you certainly go on number ?
or will you join those who mean : we are better than that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; hello , &quot;
thank you beautiful !
&quot; Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have made a min@@ v . &quot;
&quot; but I wonder what do you say those that may perhaps claim that you are having a TE@@ D@@ Talk to work a mind @-@ in with dr@@ au@@ ght , thus an exception and not the rule . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say that you can dec@@ eive themselves . I am perfectly normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
&quot; when one looks onto the Muslims all over the world , and I did so with the greatest ever carried out study on the whole world , people want to normal things . &quot;
they want prosperity for the family they want jobs and they want to live in peace .
&quot; so , in no way I am an exception . &quot;
&quot; if people seem like an exception to the rule , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to the rule . &quot;
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what started as a platform for Bast@@ ler is about to become a milli@@ ar@@ den@@ shop .
&quot; control , environmental surveillance , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . it is made possible in research institutions worldwide . &quot;
&quot; before air conditioning , a autonom@@ ous fleet of aircraft in the F@@ RAC Centre in France live a six meter high tower from 1 500 bricks . a few years ago , they began to fly with rop@@ es . &quot;
through inc@@ ub@@ or@@ ators you reach a high speed and acceler@@ ation at the same time .
you can also build self @-@ constantly changing structures .
they have learned to carry loads with tur@@ mo@@ il and generally react to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
&quot; our objective is to exceed the limits of the possible in the autonom@@ ous flight . &quot;
&quot; thus , a system autonom@@ ously works , it must be collective to know where in the room the mobile objects are located . &quot;
&quot; in our laboratory at the E@@ TH Zurich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this allows us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic Tas@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; for today &apos;s Dem@@ os we use a new loc@@ alization technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , an off@@ set of our laboratories . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
&quot; each aircraft has internal sensors in order to determine the position in the room , calculations on board what the machine should do . &quot;
&quot; external orders exist at the highest image . &quot; &quot; e.g. &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; land . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a so @-@ called tail@@ starter , &quot;
&quot; a flight device , that tries to beat two flies with a cap . &quot;
&quot; like other star@@ gates , it is efficient in advance @-@ flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ter in all its variations . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to most starter @-@ fl@@ yers , it can be s@@ wollen , and therefore have a great advantages at start and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
however there is always a down@@ side .
a restriction of hed@@ geh@@ og@@ s is that they are sensitive to turbul@@ ence such as wind turbin@@ es .
we develop new controls and algorith@@ ms to improve this .
the idea behind is that the air device does not affect the optimal position and can be improved by practicing the performance by practicing .
okay .
&quot; during our research , we often introduce basic abstract questions that advance to the heart of the matter . &quot;
such a question would be for example : what is the smaller number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for making the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ter are known about as machines with a thousand movable parts that meet you to hurt you .
several decades ago the pilots could fly remote @-@ controlled air machines that only had two event@@ ful parts : a prop@@ eller and a tail@@ gate .
&quot; recently , we discovered that flies with just one works . &quot;
&quot; this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically ultra @-@ minded aircraft . it was recently invented . &quot;
&quot; it only has a movable part , a prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no fl@@ ank , hing@@ es and cross @-@ sections , no further actu@@ ator or controllers , only a prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechan@@ ically simple , happens in the interior life very much , so that it can fly stable and move in space . &quot;
&quot; however , it does not have the elegant algorith@@ m of the h@@ edge . to bring it to fly , I have to throw it right . &quot;
&quot; the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood to throw it exactly when to see , is low , therefore I &apos;ll show you a video that was shot yesterday evening . &quot;
&quot; if the mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in co @-@ use , this machine is here , the Omni@@ cop@@ ic with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance . &quot;
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that he is not a balanced .
therefore he is ambi@@ valent in his alignment .
&quot; by doing so , he receives the proper capability : &quot;
&quot; moving in the room into all directions , no matter what direction he is fil@@ med or even as he rot@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the field of interactive rivers from the eight prop@@ ellers . &quot;
&quot; some is adjustable in models , the rest will learn directly at flying . &quot;
let &apos;s see that .
&quot; if flights are to be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reli@@ ably . &quot;
this machine consists of two separate two @-@ prop@@ ellers air@@ planes .
this is reflected in the clock@@ wise
and the other against clock@@ wise .
&quot; when one builds them together , they beh@@ ave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; however , a bit goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller falls off , electronics or a battery -- can fly the machine if restricted . &quot;
we will now demonstrate that by making a half of the air@@ plane .
the last demonstration examined syn@@ thetic s@@ war@@ ms .
&quot; the large number of autonom@@ ous , co @-@ ordin@@ ated units allows a range of aesthetic expression . &quot;
we assumed the usual micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ter -- every single weighs less than a sli@@ ce of bread -- and stat@@ utes them with loc@@ alization technology and algorith@@ ms .
each unit knows where in the room she is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no ceiling .
hopefully they motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly secure machine there it wants to be a flyer on Broadway a flyer .
&quot; of course , it is difficult to pre@@ dict the influence of this technology . &quot;
for types such as us lies the reward in development and creation .
&quot; it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and magical our universe is , and that it is creative , smart creatures allow it to form in such a spectacular way . &quot;
the fact that this technology has such massive and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; hello , &quot;
&quot; prior to 1.3 billion years ago , in a very distant galax@@ ies two black holes are becoming more and faster , you turned so the mass tri@@ bul@@ bs in a ti@@ thes in pure energy around . &quot;
these short moment sh@@ aded them bri@@ ghter than all stars together in all galax@@ ies of the whole of us known universe .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they did not put your energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy has been handed down into the space @-@ time @-@ run and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we arrange the events at first time .
3 billion years ago it has been made several multi @-@ zel@@ liges life on Earth .
&quot; since then , the earth has brought forth a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , SA@@ U@@ RI@@ ER , People and -- God even stand for us -- even the internet . &quot;
&quot; for about 25 years ago , a group of particularly cour@@ ageous -- R@@ ai Weiss from MIT , K@@ ip Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ Tech -- to find a huge laser det@@ ector that arise for the gra@@ vit@@ ational black holes . &quot;
most they thought for ins@@ ane .
&quot; but enough people recognized her as a crazy gen@@ ies , so that the U.S. National Science Foundation has financed their idea . &quot;
&quot; after decades of development , construction , conception and extremely hard work they built the Det@@ ector LI@@ GO : the Laser @-@ Inter@@ fer@@ om@@ eter@@ - gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ Observ@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; in the following time , the precision of LI@@ GO could substantially increased considerably , which increases the recognition performance . &quot;
therefore it is now called Advanced LI@@ GO .
at the beginning of September 2015 LI@@ GO was started for a last test run by some minor , persistent issues . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September 2015 , just a few days after the start @-@ up of the det@@ ector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two col@@ li@@ ating black holes through the earth . &quot;
they went through you and me
and also by the det@@ ector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the f@@ arewell to my daughter &apos;s father .
basically they were the fruits of my life .
&quot; all this , which I had worked , is no longer science @-@ fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ c@@ ists at MIT . he studied for 23 years of gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves from black holes and their due to observ@@ atories such as LI@@ GO meas@@ urable signals . what are gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves ? &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a c@@ gra@@ vation of space and time .
&quot; when temporarily the wave , the space and its clust@@ ered content is stretched in a direction and is inserted into the other . &quot;
to illustrate fac@@ ulty in courses for the Rel@@ ativity @-@ theory often have a really bad dance .
&quot; stretching and shr@@ ink , stretching and storage . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves are extremely weak , even ridicul@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September , for example , each of us have been stretched and sm@@ oked . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average person was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; that is , 20 N@@ ul@@ len after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1st Dar@@ um , you explained the LI@@ GO staff for ins@@ ane . &quot;
&quot; with a five kilometers long laser det@@ ector , and that is absurd , this length would have to be measured on less than a thou@@ s@@ addle of the radius of a nuclear power . that &apos;s gr@@ ot@@ es@@ k . &quot;
at the end of his classic text about gra@@ v@@ itation
&quot; K@@ ip Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder LI@@ GO@@ s , the hunt for the waves : &quot; &quot; the technical difficulties in the construction of such det@@ ectors are enormous . &quot;
&quot; but physi@@ cist are inv@@ ading and with the support of the public , all obstacles will be overcome . &quot;
&quot; Thor@@ ne released this 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot;
&quot; back to LI@@ GO . Scott holds , LI@@ GO is more an ear than an eye . &quot;
I would like to explain what this means .
visible light has a wav@@ el@@ ength which is much smaller than the things around us : facial hair the size of your mobile phones .
that is quite practical . because so you can make a picture or a map of things by taking advantage of several points coming in light around you .
at killing it is different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wav@@ el@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
&quot; therefore it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean you particularly much : &quot;
the face of your child about .
&quot; instead , we listen to certain properties like pitch and height , rhythm and volume , to close the story behind it . &quot;
&quot; now , just Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob inter@@ rup@@ ts her . &quot;
&quot; du@@ mmer Bob . &quot;
the same applies to vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot take with them any simple pictures of objects in space .
&quot; but as we consider changes in am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot;
at least lie for LI@@ GO the measured frequencies in audi@@ ble areas .
&quot; so if we convert break@@ down patterns in Sch@@ all , we can listen to all literally . &quot;
gra@@ v@@ itation to lau@@ er can tell us about much about the coll@@ ision of two black holes in which my colleague Scott has been employed quite a long time .
&quot; SH : 2 black , not rotating holes , cir@@ cuits simple : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
turning the two body very fast . you can hear the same cir@@ cu@@ le with an additional key change . it sounds like this : Wu @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u
it is a kind of movement that defines the wav@@ e@@ form .
&quot; AA : on 14 September 2015 -- a date that is at least I never forget -- heard LI@@ GO Fol@@ ders : &#91; Sur@@ ren@@ dering noise &#93; Jem@@ and , who knows what he has to hear , recognize this as noise from -- SH : ... two black holes with each 30 @-@ fold paras@@ ite , which are about as fast as the sticks of your Mix@@ ers . &quot;
AA : let us think about what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the dense body in all , one with a mass of 29 Sun , the other with a mass of 36 prob@@ es , revol@@ ve himself a hundred times per second before they col@@ li@@ de . &quot;
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know it because we heard it .
therein lies the permanent significance of LI@@ GO .
LI@@ GO has an entirely new way to study the Al@@ ls as never before it was possible .
on this way we can listen to the All l@@ ad and the invisible .
much in All we can -- virtually or basically -- not see .
&quot; a super @-@ nova , for example . I would like to know why was explo@@ de stars in Super@@ nov@@ ae . &quot;
they are very useful . we have learned a lot about all of them .
&quot; the exciting physical processes are happening in the core , hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and si@@ licon . &quot;
we will never pass through since these op@@ ak are .
&quot; gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves penet@@ rate iron , as if it would be more transparent glass . the urine test would be happy to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see them because the urine is covered by his own night . &quot;
gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves should be possible to back up until the beginning .
&quot; and most importantly : I am optim@@ istic that we have never seen in all things that we have never seen , and of which we do not have any idea what we can only discover what we listen . &quot;
&quot; in fact , LI@@ GO found right in the first lap that we did not expect . &quot;
&quot; my colleague at MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the LI@@ GO project , says on this subject : me : the kind of stars , the black holes , as LI@@ GO , they are observed , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe . &quot;
they are enormous , ancient body from prehistoric times . the black holes are so far to speak for our arche@@ ological work . &quot;
&quot; LI@@ GO enables us to make a completely different angle of view on the events at all , on the emergence of the stars and ultimately on how we went out of this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge now is to be as cour@@ ageous as possible .
&quot; thanks to LI@@ GO , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the rus@@ hing and circle of the cosmos . &quot;
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a brand new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in all .
&quot; for what could be more beautiful , than the urine of self ? &quot;
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thank you .
some time I tried an experiment .
&quot; for a year I would say unto all &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; before which I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; no matter if it made me nervous , brought me into uncomfortable situations , I forced myself to say &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
wanted to talk to the public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
I wanted to be live on TV ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to start playing with the sw@@ amp ?
&quot; no , no , no , but yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a crazy thing happened : just what to do , w@@ ov@@ or I feared , man laid out my fear . &quot;
&quot; my fear , speech@@ es to hold , my social fear -- pu@@ ff , away . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes &quot; has changed my life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; changed me . &quot;
&quot; but there was a certain Yes that changed my life , on an un@@ expect@@ edly . it started with a question of my youngest . &quot;
&quot; I have three unbelievable daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the youngest , calls for in@@ explic@@ able reasons all &quot; estimate &quot;
as if they were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; estimate , I need milk for my be@@ ck@@ yards . &quot;
&quot; she once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go , and I said , &quot; yes . &quot; &quot;
this yes was the beginning
&quot; from there I swe@@ ar to my family . from there I swe@@ ar to me always with them as soon as you are calling me . no matter what I just do , or wherever I go , I say yes -- every single time . &quot;
&quot; almost . I am not perfect , but I am trying very much . &quot;
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , my children , to our family . &quot;
but it also has an ast@@ o@@ unding side @-@ effect : only recently I understood that the &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; to play with my children my career ret@@ ained .
I have a real dream job .
I am author . I think things I aw@@ aken you to life .

I Cre@@ ire TV . I create television .
&quot; I do television , in great style . &quot;
&quot; in this TV season , I am responsible for playing 70 hours of program in the world . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production . &quot;
&quot; each program offers hundreds of jobs , which previously did not exist . &quot;
the budget for a episode of a television program can be between three and six million dollars .
let us know five .
&quot; a new episode all nine days times four Shows , so all nine days 20 million dollar TV , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three episodes , while at the same time : 24 episodes : Grey &apos;s , 21 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours television , &quot;
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my TV series will run on Thursday night .
my series are running in 256 regions in 67 countries for 30 million spect@@ ators .
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broad@@ casts that I have created themselves , and not only produced , so I must find time , really silent , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and to tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four TV series , 70 hours television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fire all around the world . &quot;
do you know who that is still doing ?
&quot; no one , that &apos;s why I am a tit@@ anium . &quot;

I would not like to im@@ press you with it .
&quot; I say it , because I know what you think when the word &quot; author . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I say it to you , so that all of you who work so hard , whether you are talking about a company , a country or a classroom to take me seriously when I am talking about work , so you understand that I am not only on the computer , and imagin@@ ative , and it is true when I say , I understand that it is not the dream with a dream . &quot;
&quot; it is all a job , all the work , all the reality , all swe@@ at -- no tears . &quot;
&quot; I work a lot , hard and I love it . &quot;
when I am deep@@ ened into the work there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country from nowhere .
it &apos;s when I put troops on when I was on a screen .
&quot; for example , you have a high tone , provided a mar@@ athon . &quot;
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work it .
&quot; it is creative , mechan@@ ically and in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ating , funny and distur@@ bing , clin@@ ically and maternal , cruel and reasonable . and the best thing about it is the bu@@ zz@@ ing . &quot;
there is such a change in me when working well runs .
&quot; a bu@@ zz begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz@@ ing sounds like a animated road , I could always go on it . &quot;
&quot; many people take to them , when I talk to them the su@@ ms that I talk about writing , that writing gave me joy . &quot;
&quot; don &apos;t understand me wrong , that does it . &quot;
&quot; but the su@@ ms -- when I began working with the television production , when I began to work and to work and collabor@@ ate , I discovered this thing , this bu@@ zz , this energy . &quot;
the bu@@ zz is more than writing .
the su@@ ms is action and activity . the bu@@ zz is a drug .
the su@@ ms is music . the su@@ ms is light and air .
the su@@ ms is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
&quot; and if you have such a bu@@ zz@@ ing , then you cannot wait any other than after size . &quot;
&quot; feeling not to be different than looking for size , no matter what price . &quot;
this is called the bu@@ zz .
or perhaps it also means a work@@ ah@@ olic .
perhaps it is genius .
perhaps it is ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I know not .
&quot; I know only that I am not for the failure , and I only know that I love the su@@ ms . &quot;
&quot; I will only say , I am a tit@@ anium , and I know that I will not ask that question . &quot;
&quot; to make a clear set : the more successful I will , the more broad@@ casts , the more work there , the more work there , the more things there , the more I do , the more I write history , the more expectations there are . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work . &quot;
and what do I say about work ?
&quot; I love work , not true ? &quot;
&quot; the country that I sc@@ monkey , the mar@@ athon , the army , the army , the linen , the su@@ ms , the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the bu@@ zz@@ ing . &quot;
I like this sw@@ amps . I love the sw@@ amps .
I need the bu@@ zz . I am the bu@@ zz@@ ing .
am I only this bu@@ zz ?
and then stops the bu@@ zz .
&quot; over@@ hau@@ led , over@@ hau@@ led , exagger@@ ated . &quot;
the bu@@ zz@@ ing stops .
&quot; now , my three daughters are acc@@ ust@@ omed to the truth that their m@@ um is a single working title . &quot;
&quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; &quot; my mom will not be there , but you can write my n@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; estimate , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da Land . &quot;
there are the children of a tit@@ ans .
you are Baby @-@ Tit@@ ans .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the su@@ ms ce@@ ased . &quot;
the bu@@ zz@@ ing of the engine stopped .
I did not love my work anymore . the engine was off .
the su@@ ms came not back .
my su@@ ms was broken .
&quot; I made the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ days , no re@@ mor@@ als , did not imp@@ ly , a tit@@ le@@ ep does not exist , with all the heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no mar@@ sh .
in me was silence .
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously ... &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a lecture @-@ Titan .
&quot; everything was grey , I just had no fun anymore . &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the su@@ ms and the su@@ ms was me .
&quot; so what makes you do if what you do , the work that you love , suddenly f@@ aded ? &quot;
&quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; Heu@@ l you out , the author @-@ Titan . &quot;
&quot; but you know you do it , you do , you love to be a teacher , a ban@@ ker , a mother to be a mother , you love one another , and knows how the bu@@ zz@@ ing feels when the bu@@ zz@@ ing stops , who is then you then ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; when the song of my heart is listening , I can survive in silence ? &quot;
and then I gave me my &quot; southern states @-@ wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; a question .
&quot; I am out of the way out , late and she says , &quot; Mama , do you play ? &quot;
and I will say no say when I am aware of two things :
&quot; first , I have to say Yes to all and secondly , they did not called me . &quot;
it does not call anyone any more &quot; estim@@ ation . &quot;
when is this happening ?
&quot; I hate it , when I came to Titan and my su@@ ms , and here everything changes my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; Mama , do you like to play ? &quot;
and I say : &quot; yes . &quot;
this is nothing special .
we play and her sisters come into account we laugh a lot and I read completely dramatically from the book &quot; everybody Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic , in the lon@@ eliness and absence of the bu@@ b , I cannot do anything except . &quot;
I am focused .
I am quiet .
&quot; the country that I sc@@ monkey , the mar@@ athon , the army , the army , the linen , the high sound , they no longer exist anymore . &quot;
&quot; all that exists , stick@@ y finger and dam@@ p kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax crayon and the song , in which it comes to slogan , or whatever the girl in &quot; &quot; The Ice Queen &quot; . &quot; &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so scar@@ ce that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
play is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something inside me breaks .
a mental door goes on and an energy club comes in .
&quot; and not immediately , but it happens . &quot;
I feel it .
the bu@@ zz comes slowly back .
&quot; no full volume , hardly there , it is quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there . &quot;
&quot; not the bu@@ zz , but a bu@@ zz . &quot;
&quot; and now I feel , I would know a magical secret . &quot;
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . this is all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we forget .
&quot; the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the work@@ amount , the tit@@ anium @-@ consume , which is only the replacement . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you , who you are , when I tell you who I am when I describe myself with broad@@ casts and television hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real bu@@ zz is . &quot;
the bu@@ zz@@ ing is not a force and it is not work @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real bu@@ zz depends on love .
&quot; the su@@ ms is the stream , which comes from li@@ festyles . &quot;
the real su@@ ms is self @-@ confidence and peace .
&quot; the real su@@ ms igno@@ res the pressure of history , which are dedicated to erle@@ ant tasks , the expect@@ ation and pressure . &quot;
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
&quot; true su@@ ms of God is the voice in my ear , but perhaps I whis@@ pered with God the wrong words , for which God said to me that I am a tit@@ anium ? &quot;
it is just love .
&quot; we all need a bit more love , much more love . &quot;
&quot; as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes . &quot;
I make this as a permanent rule so that I can free myself as a work@@ ah@@ olic from any gu@@ ilt .
&quot; it is law , I have no choice . I have no other choice , if I want to hear the su@@ ms again . &quot;
&quot; wish it would be so simple . I am not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
play not guar@@ di@@ ly as they work .
the truth does hurt
but I do not like to play .
I am always working because I love it .
I prefer my workplace than home .
&quot; this ent@@ ails is painful , because what a person rather than to be home ? &quot;
&quot; yes , I . &quot;
&quot; time honestly , I call myself &quot; &quot; Titan &quot; &quot; -- &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of them .
&quot; we ras@@ en in the garden around and back , back and forth . &quot;
we make small dance parties
we sing and play ball .
we bur@@ nis@@ hing soap bub@@ bles .
I mainly feel sti@@ ff , ab@@ sent and confused . &quot;
I have always been playing after my mobile phone .
but it is OK .
&quot; my children show me how to live , and the su@@ ms of the universe filled me . &quot;
&quot; I play and play , until I ask myself , Why have we ever heard with playing ? &quot;
you can also say it ! say it always Yes if your child wants to play with you .
&quot; maybe you keep me for nai@@ ve , for a day@@ dre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; you probably have right , but you can do it too ! &quot;
you have time !
and do you know why ? you are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
&quot; my little ones want to play at most 15 minutes with me , until they can catch something else . &quot;
&quot; they are wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
after 15 minutes you get a lad@@ y@@ bug or bis@@ cuit .
&quot; and speak my teen@@ ager @-@ daughter of a whole 15 minutes with me , I am the mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; they are only 15 minutes , more it does not need . &quot;
&quot; everyone can bring about 15 minutes in a piece , even on a bad mood day ! &quot;
15 minutes in a piece !
&quot; no mobile , no laundry , no dist@@ r@@ action . &quot;
the day is short : dinner the children bet@@ t@@ done .
but 15 minutes are in !
&quot; my children are my wellbeing , my world . it does not have to be the children . it is considered to feel the su@@ ms , a place for his soul peace . &quot;
it is not about playing with their own children . it is about joy
in order to play &quot; play &quot; in general .
treat yourself the 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
find out and keep it yourself .
I am not perfect in it . I fail and I si@@ ege . friends meet books to read the day --
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; stands for everything I have given up when I got my first TV show when I wanted to get myself more and more . &quot;
15 minutes in the piece why not full 15 minutes walk ?
what can it be wrong ? nothing !
the su@@ ms came back in my spare time . the su@@ ms seems to return if I am not working .
working is not working without games .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months a door opens up , and I find myself again in my office . I hear a well @-@ known melody , she filled me and my soul . I desp@@ ises me to new ideas . I don &apos;t let me away his way . I sei@@ ze it in full si@@ ps and love my work again . &quot;
&quot; I like the su@@ ms , but I don &apos;t love it . &quot;
I do not need it .
&quot; I am not the bu@@ zz , the su@@ ms is not me ... not anymore . &quot;
&quot; soap and stick@@ y finger , dinner with friends . &quot;
this is my bu@@ zz .
the su@@ ms of life .
the su@@ ms of love .
&quot; the su@@ ms of the work is part of me , but just one part . and I am so grateful . &quot;
&quot; it is sn@@ u@@ ppe that I am a tit@@ anium . I have never seen a Titan , the trip to Jerusalem . &quot;
I said Yes to less work and to more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functional .
&quot; the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more clear is my head . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the su@@ ms . the country that I am fright@@ ened , the mar@@ athon , the mar@@ es , the su@@ ms , the su@@ ms , the su@@ ms , the su@@ ms , the su@@ ms of life . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this bu@@ zz , the more makes this unusual , be@@ zz@@ ling , naked and new life @-@ esteem in me wide . less Titan -- more I ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel exactly this bu@@ zz , the more I know who I am . &quot;
I am author . I think things I aw@@ aken you to life .
&quot; this belongs to the job , which means to live his dream . &quot;
&quot; this is the dream of this jobs , &quot;
because a dream job should be a bit dre@@ amy .
&quot; yes , I said &quot; Yes &quot; to have less work and to play more games . &quot;
tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thanks beautiful .
I am Neuro@@ surgical .
how most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human trag@@ e@@ dies .
&quot; I know how your life can change from one second to the other , after a serious stroke , or after an accident . &quot;
&quot; for us neuro@@ surgeon , it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other bodi@@ ly organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing . &quot;
&quot; after a severe injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a lasting , serious disability . &quot;
this is probably the reason why I functional neurolog@@ ist .
what is a working neurolog@@ ist ?
a doctor who tries to improve nerve functions through various surgical measures .
&quot; sure , they have heard of one of the most well known , the &quot; deep @-@ car stimulation . &quot; there is also a electro@@ de deep inside the brain , to influence the cir@@ cuits of the neur@@ ons so that the neurological function has improved . &quot;
it really is an amazing technology . it has been improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s suffering from fier@@ ce trem@@ bling and heavy pain .
Neuro@@ mod@@ ulation but does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream functional neuro@@ surgeon is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to you .
with something help the brain can help themselves .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was conduc@@ tive over@@ seas and worked day and night in the emergency .
often I also showed people with sk@@ ull @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
you have to imagine that at sk@@ ull @-@ deer trau@@ ma the brain can be counter@@ s@@ will@@ ed and cran@@ ial pressure .
&quot; to save life , you have to dimin@@ ish the cran@@ ial pressure . &quot;
&quot; to do this , sometimes one must remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass . &quot;
&quot; instead of throwing bra@@ zen mass , we decided to analyze us with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist , the brain @-@ mass . &quot;
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted cells to grow from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
&quot; cells from a tissue which grow to grow , is comparable to very small children that will be taken out of your families . &quot;
&quot; you have to find the correct nutrition , temperature , moisture and the environments to thri@@ ve them . &quot;
precisely that we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts to make it Jean @-@ François .
this he saw under his micro@@ scope .
this was a great surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked like a tri@@ bal culture . with large green cells , surrounded by small , un@@ mature cells . &quot;
perhaps you are still aware of the biblical teaching that stem cells un@@ ripe cells are that can turn into every cell type of the organism .
&quot; the adult brain has tri@@ bal cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising to obtain this sort of stem cells from the surface of the stags of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made a further fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast .
they never die ; they are immort@@ al .
but these cells turned out differently .
they shared slowly and after a few weeks they died even .
&quot; so we saw a new , strange cell population that looked like tri@@ bal cells but was different . &quot;
&quot; we needed for a long time to understand , where they came . &quot;
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ bl@@ ec@@ ort@@ ine @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our grand@@ parents .
you play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the fet@@ us they provide for the design of the brain .
but why remain they preserved ?
we do not know that .
&quot; we believe they take part in the healing of the brain , since we find them in higher concentr@@ ations close to brain injury . &quot;
but this is not so certain .
one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells .
&quot; we stand in front of a potential cell source , the brain @-@ healing . &quot;
this we had to prove .
&quot; so , we decided to develop an experiment . &quot;
we wanted to remove a piece of brain mass on the non @-@ speaking area and then the cells just as cultiv@@ ate as it did Jean @-@ François
&quot; and they are far@@ ther to mark them , in order to follow her in the brain . &quot;
in the last step we impl@@ anted them to the det@@ ach@@ ment of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ ologist Tran@@ splant@@ ation -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splant@@ ation .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we re@@ implant these cells in norm@@ ative tissue tissues ? and what will happen when we re@@ implant the same cells in damages ?
thanks to Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we were able to work with monkeys .
&quot; in the first scenario we re@@ impl@@ anted the cells into a healthy brain , and we watched that they were taken after a few weeks as if they were taken back home . the space is already occupied , so they will not disappear . &quot;
in the second scenario we added a violation to and re@@ impl@@ anted exactly the same cells and now the cells remained to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that have been re@@ im@@ plan@@ ed .
&quot; evidence that they show are these small points . these are the cells we are in vit@@ ro , in the culture . &quot;
here we could not stop .
&quot; do these cells also help a monkey , to recover from a brain injury ? &quot;
&quot; so , we trained monkeys with a manual work@@ man@@ ship . &quot;
they had to take food pell@@ ets from a tablet .
they made them very good .
&quot; when they had reached a stable base level , last we had in the motor@@ ic Cort@@ ex the hand @-@ mot@@ ori@@ k area . &quot;
&quot; then the monkeys were paraly@@ sed , they could no longer move their hand . &quot;
&quot; just as it would happen with people , they rested spont@@ aneously up to a certain degree , just like after a stroke . &quot;
&quot; the patients are paraly@@ sed , and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover a certain degree , just as with the monkey . &quot;
&quot; when we were sure that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we impl@@ anted his own cells . &quot;
&quot; on the left side they see the monkeys , which spont@@ aneously re@@ tired . &quot;
it can bring about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from injury .
it is not as precise and not so fast .
&quot; now see when we re@@ directed the cells : the same monkey , two months after the friction plant@@ ation . &quot;
I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can fre@@ eze them and use later .
&quot; we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson . &quot;
but our dream is still to implant themselves to implant .
I really hope that I can show you soon as the human brain gives the means to heal yourself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; hello , &quot;
&quot; Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ yne , this is wonderful , I am sure that right now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who need it . &quot;
I definitely .
&quot; of course , the question of what is the greatest obstacles before you can start clinical trials at the human being . &quot;
J@@ oc@@ el@@ yne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from this great results you have to fill about two kil@@ ograms of papers and forms to run this kind of studies .
&quot; BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team . &quot;
&quot; BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get the permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years takes it until someone will come to hospital , and this therapy will be available . &quot;
J@@ B : this is difficult to say .
&quot; first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial . &quot;
will it allow us to allow the authority to start it soon ?
then it is necessary to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
&quot; it has been a long time to select patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment . &quot;
&quot; after that , one must apply this to a multi @-@ centric study . &quot;
&quot; first , one has to make sure that it is useful before you can offer this treatment anyone . &quot;
BG : and that it is safe . J@@ B : natural .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ yne , thank you for visiting the TED and that you have told us about it . &quot;
BG : many thanks .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them as a matter of course .
&quot; we do not see democracy as the fragile plant that it is in reality , but as the invent@@ ory of our society . &quot;
we tend to look at them as un@@ changeable circumstances .
we believe capitalism is inev@@ it@@ ably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
&quot; Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his large noc@@ ence in Beijing have dou@@ bt@@ lessly proved that it is quite possible to have a blo@@ oming capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains fully un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; in fact , democracy comes with us , in Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was made to me as a financial minister in the Euro@@ group un@@ mis@@ understood that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- do not affect the austerity programs in Greece . &quot;
&quot; in that moment I thought that there could be no better just@@ ification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , or the Communist Party of China , or some of my aff@@ lic@@ ted friends who would reiter@@ ate me that democracy would change anything . &quot;
at this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy .
&quot; I ask you to believe together with me again to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of a mistake , we could save the democracy but that we need a true and def@@ ective democracy . &quot;
&quot; for without democracy our societies are committed to our future , and our great , new technologies are w@@ asted . &quot;
&quot; on the subject of w@@ ast@@ age , I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction , which is currently being threatened by our economies . &quot;
I call it the &quot; tw@@ ings@@ gi@@ pfel @-@ Parad@@ ox . &quot;
&quot; a summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the Schul@@ den@@ berg , who thro@@ ws its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
we all recognize the Schul@@ den@@ berg .
but only a few recognize its kenn@@ el .
&quot; a mountain of un@@ used cash , which is to be an@@ x@@ ious , however , which could be too an@@ x@@ ious to invest in where it would be productive and income to produce all the things that humanity urgently needed , for example &quot; Green &quot; Energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; over the past 3 months in the United States , in England and in the eurozone , 3.4 tr@@ illion dollars invested in all the wealth of producing goods , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , gifts , equipment and so on and so forth . &quot;
&quot; 3.4 tr@@ illion dollars sounds like a lot of money until one is compar@@ es with the 5,@@ 1 Bil@@ li@@ onen of US dollars that were at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing but the stock exchange rates and the property prices . &quot;
&quot; thus , deb@@ ts and un@@ productive capital are the tw@@ ins peaks , which are not the same with the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result are stag@@ nat@@ ing wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 year @-@ olds in the US , Japan and Europe are un@@ employed , which would not invest in a final demand for the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , who would not invest in which they should not invest . just like econom@@ ist father , who would not invest in which they would not invest . just like econom@@ ist father , who would not invest in which they would not invest . just like econom@@ ist father , who would not invest in which they would not invest . just like econom@@ ist father , who would not invest in which they would not invest . just like econom@@ ist father , who would not invest in which they should not invest . just like econom@@ ist father , who would not invest in which they should kill him , when he will grow him , &quot;
&quot; invol@@ unt@@ ary the circumstances will bring about it , that cause the body to kill him . &quot;
this is my ha@@ dern with capitalism --
&quot; its extremely w@@ asted capital , All the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives to further develop human talents and especially all the technologies , &quot; Green &quot; technologies that are crucial to saving the Earth . &quot;
is democracy the solution ?
I think so . but before we continue : what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ el@@ es defined democracy as the social form in which the free and poor as a majority control the government .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy closed too many of course --
&quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , it would be a mistake , the place of the ath@@ en@@ ian democracy due to these closures . &quot;
&quot; the decision @-@ making of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that they were working with the working poor , and not only the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , which they give them the right to political co @-@ determination with equal stimulation in issues of the state . &quot;
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not been held long --
&quot; like a cand@@ le , which sh@@ ines very bright , it is also quickly burned . &quot;
&quot; however , our current liberal democr@@ acies have not present its roots in the ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution . &quot;
&quot; while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on the free citizens concentrated and the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for the ruling class . &quot;
&quot; for the liberal democracy was only possible , when a full separation of politics and economy is possible and the democratic process of politics was introduced into politics , while the economy - the world of corporations -- a democratic @-@ free zone . &quot;
&quot; in our present democr@@ acies has existed since the time , in which this separation of politics and economy began to under@@ go a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two by taking the economy gradually the policy and destroyed them . &quot;
are you wonder why politicians are no longer like this ?
it is not up to de@@ generation of their DNA .
it is because it cannot be in the government today and not at power because the power from politics into the economy is isolated and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my ha@@ dern with capitalism .
&quot; if you think about it , it is like a herd of car@@ ni@@ vo@@ res that so sustain@@ ing the animals of which they nour@@ ished at the end therefore . &quot;
&quot; similarly , it is similar to the economy that politics gets so far can@@ ni@@ b@@ alized , that it grows through the self @-@ created economic crisis itself . the power of corporations will grow , political parties is increasing , the overall economic demand falls and the managing directors of companies are too an@@ x@@ ious to invest the cash of their companies . &quot;
&quot; the more successful the capitalism leaves the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; &#91; the people &#93; out of democracy , the higher the tw@@ ins peaks , and the greater the w@@ ast@@ age of human labour power and the welfare of humanity . &quot;
&quot; if this is true , it is obvious that we have to bring politics and the economy back together , and it would be better if the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; ret@@ ains control , just as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot;
by the way this is not a new idea .
the Marx@@ ian left had this idea already 100 years ago and it was not very strange .
the teaching from the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only reflects through a wonder of such a position as in the ancient Athens without creating new types of brut@@ ality and w@@ ast@@ age .
but there is a solution : to set up the working arms !
capitalism is doing it by replacing low @-@ wage employment through automation and robots .
&quot; the problem is , such as long economy and politics are separate areas , autom@@ ating the tw@@ ins summit will be higher , the w@@ ast@@ age , and the social conflicts deeper , just as I believe -- in countries like China will come . &quot;
&quot; so we have to re@@ shaping the economy and unite the areas of economy and politics , and pay attention to the re@@ united area , otherwise we end the film &quot; Matrix &quot; like a documentation . &quot;
&quot; so the question is not whether capitalism has the technical achievements , which he has brought to , -- &quot;
&quot; the most interesting question is whether capitalism is similar to capitalism through a D@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the &quot; &quot; Star Trek &quot; , &quot; in the machines serve the human being , or into a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ en@@ ians &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long conversations the meaning of life . &quot;
I think we can be optim@@ istic .
&quot; so what would it be , how could it look like this &quot; Star Trek &quot; -@@ good utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; Matrix &quot; -@@ similar D@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot;
&quot; in practical implementation , I want to give you a few examples . &quot;
&quot; in the area of companies : ask a capitalist market in which you earn money while you are working and in which your capital will follow you from a job to next , and the company -- regardless of which one is currently working -- is property of those who are currently working in the company . &quot;
then all the income from capital and rede@@ em@@ ing and the concept of wage works is completely out@@ dated .
&quot; no distinction between those who belong to the company , but who do not work in it , and employees who work there , but no exchange between capital and labour , no major g@@ aps between investment and spo@@ ols , and ultimately no emp@@ lo@@ ins tw@@ ins summit . &quot;
&quot; in the field of global political economy , please imagine that our national currencies would have a free fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , that will be issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interest of all humanity . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , imagine that the entire world trading in this currency will be acted -- we call it &quot; the cosmos , &quot; in units of &quot; cosmos &quot; -- and each government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade defic@@ it or the trade over@@ flow of the respective country into a common fund . &quot;
&quot; imagine that these funds are investing in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world , in which investments are rare . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes was proposed at the Bret@@ ton Woods Conference in 1944 .
the problem was that one was not the technical means at that time .
&quot; today , we have them , particularly in front of the background of a re@@ united politics and business . &quot;
&quot; the world , which I describe you is at the same time as liberal individuals preferred , and Marxist because it is buried in the separation of capital and work in the du@@ st@@ bin of history , and key@@ n@@ esi@@ astic , global key@@ n@@ esi@@ astic . &quot;
but above all others it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy .
will we aw@@ aken in such a world
or will we reconc@@ ile into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar D@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide to make political decisions .
it is in our hands and we do it better democratic .
thank you .

how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
&quot; Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something of what I &apos;ve just said is , then Marx is relevant . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and business is ... do we do not , technological development will generate such a massive decline in the overall economic demand that Larry Sum@@ mers is called &quot; &quot; long term st@@ agn@@ ation &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; by transfer@@ ring this crisis from a part of the earth to the next , as we experience it , it will not only dest@@ ab@@ ili@@ ze our democr@@ acies but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is true , Marx is quite relevant . &quot;
&quot; also , as Hay@@ ek , that &apos;s why I am a liberal Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and therefore I am also perfect . &quot;
&quot; BG : indeed , and now we are at ease . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ V : if one is not s@@ wir@@ r , one thinks not enough . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosoph@@ ical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein that told that . BG : in your talk , you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you have made very clearly what you keep from the view of the West to China . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great level of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democr@@ acies we have the gift of a democracy .
&quot; as I said in my lecture , we have limited the democracy on policy while the area where most of the economy is , -- the area of the economy -- a completely democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in a certain way , when I must say so pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is similar to China today in the UK of the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; for -- remember -- we tend to combine liber@@ alism with democracy -- that is a mistake , historically . &quot;
liber@@ alism and Liber@@ als like John Stuart Mill --
he was particularly skep@@ tical about what democratic development concerns .
&quot; what one can now watch in China is similar to the development , which we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
&quot; now I propose to do what the West in the 19th century has done , smells huge to hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
BG : I am sure that many listen@@ ers are curious about your experiences as a financial minister in the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I fores@@ ee that that comes .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later on the first half @-@ year ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal point of view , and very dis@@ appoint@@ ing , because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the eurozone . &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the euro zone , &quot;
&quot; namely , from self @-@ suff@@ iciency to adopt , and the per@@ sever@@ ance den@@ ial that a massive ver@@ age line through the eurozone continues , and continues to expand the development of the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity to open on the basis of the Greek proposal -- by the way , the first proposal was den@@ ial the den@@ ial . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro zone , within the European group , continues to be denied the den@@ ial . &quot;
but you know what is coming .
this is the experience from the Soviet Union --
&quot; if one tries to get an economic system that is not transfer@@ able , by political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism in life , it will perhaps be a while , but when the change occurs , he happens ab@@ rupt and destruc@@ tive . &quot;
BG : what change do you see ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone does not have a future if we do not change its construction .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as a financial minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who look back -- seriously ...
&quot; if there is a finance minister , or any minister , who after 6 months in office , especially in such a tense situation , he made no mistakes , then this is a dangerous person . &quot;
&quot; of course , I made mistakes . &quot;
the greatest fail@@ ing was to sign the application for the extension of the Schul@@ the@@ program at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on the sides of the don@@ ors to find a common solution .
but that was not .
&quot; they only wanted to get our government to the case , only because they did not want to deal with the re@@ visions taken by the eurozone . &quot;
they did not want to conc@@ ede that she had passed a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; there &apos;s worse than during &quot; &quot; Great Depression &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; none of the Troika &apos;s don@@ ors who has imposed us this policy , and a : &quot; that was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot;
&quot; BG : despite all that , and despite the aggressive templates of the conversations , you seem to be quite a European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is coming from someone who lives and loves .
my greatest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive .
&quot; for if they do not survive , the shared fli@@ ers will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot;
&quot; this will not be disast@@ rous for Europe alone , but for the entire global economy . &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; if we admit ourselves the way of a post @-@ modern 1930 , when it appears to me , it will be as well toler@@ ated for the future of Europeans as well as the non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope you are wrong in this point .
&quot; Yan@@ is , thank you so much for you at TED . &quot;
Y@@ V : thank you .
Roy Price have never heard of the most people even though he is probably responsible for 22 @-@ moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013 .
&quot; probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for many of you . &quot;
this goes back to the decision that Roy was met three years ago .
Roy Price is leading at Amazon Studios .
the TV @-@ manufacturing company at Amazon .
&quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has a I@@ gel@@ ol@@ is@@ ur and describes on Twitter as &quot; films , TV , technology , tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for how to produce the shows and content of the Amazon .
&quot; of course , this is a highly competitive industry . &quot;
there are already so many TV series that Roy cannot be selected .
&quot; he has to find shows , which are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he must find shows that are very right on this curve . &quot;
this curve is the review of over 2500 TV series on the website IM@@ DB . the rating runs from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this review .
&quot; if your show is rated with nine and higher , this is a winner . &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; these are shows like &quot; Breaking Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that ad@@ dic@@ ted where , after having a season , your brain asks , &quot; Where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left side , here at this end , shows how &quot; To@@ d@@ dl@@ ers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should tell you what is going on at that end of the curve . &quot;
Roy Price is not about to get on the left side of the curve because I think one needs special intelligence in order to under@@ go &quot; To@@ d@@ dl@@ ers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
&quot; he makes more thoughts about the mean cur@@ ation , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply inspire . &quot;
&quot; so , he must make sure that he is really on the right side . &quot;
&quot; the pres@@ su@@ res is present and of course it is the first time that Amazon makes something , therefore Roy Price is not going to risk anything . &quot;
he wants to create successes .
&quot; he needs guaranteed success , so he keeps a competition . &quot;
&quot; he takes many ideas for TV shows and choose by an evaluation eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and make them online where they can watch everyone for free . &quot;
&quot; and if Amazon can be out for free things , you get it right ? &quot;
millions of spect@@ ators look at these episodes .
&quot; however , they do not know that they will be observed at the watching of these shows . &quot;
you will be observed by Roy and his team who take all of them .
&quot; you capture when to start the show , when one gets p@@ aus@@ ed , which parts one comes up or check again . &quot;
&quot; you collect millions of data , to decide with these data and then what show they should produce . &quot;
&quot; in fact , they collect the data , process these and resulting in the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com about four rep@@ ubli@@ can U.S. Sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many of these show could remember because they were not so good . &quot;
&quot; it is only an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7,@@ 4 , and Alpha House lands with 7,5 -- so something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked . &quot;
&quot; about at the same time when another company has placed another manager a top show by data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy it is always searching for this a super show and he also uses data for it , but he does it somewhat different . &quot;
&quot; instead of organizing a competition , he and his team will face the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x viewer , so the reviews they give the shows , their course , what shows them like etc . &quot;
&quot; then use these data to find these little details about the spect@@ ators : what shows they like , which producers , which actors . &quot;
&quot; when they had all the parts together , they entered a car and decided not to make a sit@@ com about four Sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a Sen@@ ator . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards &quot; . Net@@ fli@@ x has had a hit , at least for the first two s@@ quad@@ rons . &quot;
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9,@@ 1 review on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go . &quot;
&quot; of course , now is the question : what happened here ? &quot;
&quot; one has two very know@@ led@@ itive , data sealed . &quot;
&quot; they combine these many data with each other and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company . &quot;
why is this ?
because the logic goes somehow it should work with everything .
&quot; if you coll@@ ects millions of data , for a decision that you meet , then you should make a good decision . &quot;
it has 200 years of statistics than Back @-@ up .
one optimized it with very powerful computer .
&quot; the least thing you can expect is good TV , or ? &quot;
&quot; if data analysis is not working , this is a little start@@ ling because we are living in a time when we reach more and more statistics to meet serious decisions , far beyond television . &quot;
does anybody know here the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
&quot; nobody . OK , that is even good . &quot;
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that nobody comes in touch with this software . come in touch with this software you are in prison .
&quot; if anyone is here in the US in prison and ask for relief , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dism@@ is@@ sal is done or not . &quot;
&quot; just like at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of decide whether a show is good or bad , it is decided whether a person will be good or bad . &quot;
&quot; mid @-@ season television , 22 minutes , which can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data , &quot;
not always creates the best results . this is not what a company like multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
also the data sealed companies are sometimes wrong .
&quot; yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Google announced that they can pre@@ dict through data analysis out@@ breaks of flu , the nar@@ row@@ est species , predic@@ ted -- by data analysis of the Google research . &quot;
it worked wonderful and was a big message . success in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked fl@@ aw@@ less , year round year , until it suddenly did no longer work , &quot;
and no one could say why .
&quot; it simply didn &apos;t work , this was once again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even the data is sav@@ vy companies like Amazon and Google mis@@ understand , sometimes . &quot;
&quot; despite all of these errors , data flows in decisions of life - in the workplace , in the law enforcement , in medicine . &quot;
&quot; so , we should rather make sure that data are helpful . &quot;
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ assisted gen@@ etics -- an area where some very smart people un@@ imagin@@ able many data to make serious decisions such as the decision for a cancer treatment
or the development of a drug . over the years I recognized some samples about the difference between successful decisions on the basis of data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
&quot; if you have to solve a complex problem , you can mainly do two things : &quot;
&quot; as First , you attach this problem into its parts , so you can analyze the items ; as second you put the items together to put an un@@ lock . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : apart and put together again . &quot;
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are just good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help create a problem and understand its parts . &quot;
they are not suitable to res@@ et the parts again and then come to a dischar@@ ge .
&quot; for this , there is another tool and we have it all : our brain . &quot;
&quot; when there is something in which the brain is good , it is parts and pieces to collapse again , even if the information is incomplete , especially when the brain is an expert . &quot;
&quot; therefore , I believe that Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they have used data and understanding , where they are also dedicated to the process . &quot;
&quot; they use data to better understand their audience , why not otherwise they would have been capable of . but the decision how to put all these parts again and make it a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; that did not stand in the data . &quot;
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show what meant that they entered a huge personal risk with this decision .
Amazon however this did in the wrong way .
&quot; they used to control all their decisions , first when they were talking about television ideas then when they chose &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; . &quot; &quot;
it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; they tell us the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; data are helpful for better decisions , but I believe that things go wrong when data will start running our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and in order not to forget that this device is rather useful . &quot;
many of you will ...
&quot; before there was data , this was the device for decisions . &quot;
many know it .
&quot; it is also called &quot; &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; . &quot; it is amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or no , you only need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; highly prob@@ able &quot; -- exactly here at that moment . &quot;
I will later ask it later with a technical demo .
&quot; so far I met some decisions in my life , while I should have heard in the ball on the ball . &quot;
&quot; but , as you know of course , if you want to have the data available , you would like to replace it through a bit of cl@@ adding , such as data analytics , in order to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not change the basic building .
&quot; so maybe the ball cl@@ ever@@ er and wis@@ er , and cl@@ ever@@ er . ultimately it is up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right corner . &quot;
&quot; and I feel this as a very encouraging message that in spite of the great amount of data still pays off , an expert in what you do is doing and risks . &quot;
&quot; in the end , it is not the data but the risks , with which you end up at the right end of the curve . &quot;
thanks beautiful .
