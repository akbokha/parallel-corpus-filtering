<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him perhaps because he won the Pulitzer Prize in the New-York Times.</seg>
<seg id="3">"long before somebody heard from Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he announced spectacular that the NSA was illegal telephones of Americans."</seg>
<seg id="4">"but it is another chapter, which should leave a permanent impression."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in this he describes a catastrophic U.S. intelligence, in which the CIA was literally overclocking for a nuclear bomb."</seg>
<seg id="6">"if that sounds crazy, read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who the chapter did not fall at all?</seg>
<seg id="9">The US government.</seg>
<seg id="10">Almost 10 years the government fought against Risen and prompted him to name its alleged springs.</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this turn, he became a symbol of the pattern of the government, whistleblowers and to accentuate to journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to the first constitutional review, the media have the right to publish secret information."</seg>
<seg id="13">"but it is impossible to use this right, if media cannot get these information and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave one."</seg>
<seg id="14">"so when the government came with Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters did before him: he refused, and said that he would rather go to the prison."</seg>
<seg id="15">"so, from 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk to go into prison."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, only days before the process, happened something extraordinary."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, although they were longevity for years that it would be essential for their case, the demands of the government were dropped."</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring the reporter and resources can hide less.</seg>
<seg id="19">"rather than fail to fail, this could also make his digital footprints for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"and so the investigators chose, without its consent, his phone-wise secretly concerned,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"just like his e-mail data, financial and banking information, its credit card, and even traveling-wise with the list of its flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of this information they found evidence that they took advantage of Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA-whistleblower and crack."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, this is only one of many cases."</seg>
<seg id="24">"President Obama promised to protect his appearance, whistleblowers. but instead, the judiciary has condemned more than all U.S. governments before him."</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government comes too much of their work as a secret."</seg>
<seg id="26">"since September 11, nearly every article on national security has been the result that a whistleblowers became a journalist."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so we put the press work on the game, which is supposed to be protected by the first constitutional review, because the government has more and more possibilities to show all of them."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but just as technology of the government allows to handle the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources better."</seg>
<seg id="29">"and indeed they can get up from the moment when they contact, instead of in the neighbour, in the stuff."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today, there are communication software that had not yet been written when Risen wrote his book and it is much safer than normal e-mails or telephone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"such a technology is Securedrop, an open source revision for whistleblowers, which was originally developed by the internet of famous Aaron Swartz, and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation by which I work."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of send an e-mail, go to a news website, just like the Washington Post."</seg>
<seg id="33">"here you can upload documents uploading or information, just as with any ordinary contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server according to which only the particular news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">"so the government can no longer describe information secretly, and many of the information they would call on would not be available from prenment."</seg>
<seg id="36">"but SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole, to protect freedom of the press in the 21st century."</seg>
<seg id="37">"unfortunately, governments around the world develop new espionment technologies, all of us endanger."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it is to us to make sure that not only technology burner like Edward Snowden have a way to get misdeeds, it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblowers."</seg>
<seg id="39">The abnormalities when supplying soldiers is modest to care and from crowded hospitals. or the next environmental care that strikes the alarm regarding the polluted water of Flint. or a Wallstreet insists that warns us before the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">"after all, these technologies have not only been made for those who want to impose a crime, but to protect our constitutional rights."</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on 3 April 2016 the largest data set of data was released.] [the "Panama Papers" reveal that Kingdoms and powers are hidden in tax havens.] [what does that mean?] [we bate Robert Palmer of Global Witness to have a statement.] This week we were based on messages about a leak of 11 million documents in Panama's commercial law firm Moso Fonseca.</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers to companies like Moso Fonseca go and say:" okay, we need an anonymous company. "</seg>
<seg id="45">"in fact, we actually see e-mails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works, how it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Islands Prime Minister is resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">"also, there are reports that a exile of the brutal Syrian dictator is Bashar al-Assad-Assad-firms in tax havens."</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russian President Vladimir Putin will lead to a close friend of kindergartens, a famous cellist."</seg>
<seg id="50">"now there will be a lot of rich people and others who are nervous about the next release, and the next enthused documents."</seg>
<seg id="51">"now, that like the plot of a agencies or a John-Grisham-Romans."</seg>
<seg id="52">"it seems crying from you, me, ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should this be that?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is: if the rich and mighty in the position are to hide their assets in tax havens and not all their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, streets."</seg>
<seg id="55">And this concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organisation, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"all over the world discuss media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens of some few to be used to hide their assets and engaging -- something that we have been discussing for ten years and reveal."</seg>
<seg id="58">"I think many people this whole world seems very confusing, and it is difficult to understand how these controls function."</seg>
<seg id="59">I am always present to me like a Matrjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">"so you have a company in another company, in another company that makes it nearly impossible to understand who is behind these prayers."</seg>
<seg id="61">"it can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what matters."</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it interesting that in the US there are less reports on this matter.</seg>
<seg id="63">"presumably, because there were so far no prominent Americans who occurred in these revelations."</seg>
<seg id="64">"now, it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax havens."</seg>
<seg id="65">"however, by principle according to which these tax havens function, Mossack Fonseca has less American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"if we had a backup of the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would have much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, it is so that in some U.S. states you need to provide less information about a company to start a company than to obtain a librarians."</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of intransparency in the USA has allowed employees from debugistles to cover school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It allows scams to cover particularly susceptional investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this in practice looks like.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does this actually work?</seg>
<seg id="73">"so, we sent a covert investigator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan."</seg>
<seg id="74">"our investigator gave herself as African minister, who wanted to bring the suspicious money to the USA to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet."</seg>
<seg id="75">"we really shocked that all up to one of our investigator proposals made suggestions, how he could transfer his money."</seg>
<seg id="76">"these were all predictions. none of these lawyers took us as a client, and of course nobody was handed over to anyone. but it shows the problem with this system."</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as an incidents.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer, who has reassured our investigators proposals. "</seg>
<seg id="79">"it is not about a single peak, wrapped in a scandal."</seg>
<seg id="80">"it is about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"and to cope with this, we must change the rules."</seg>
<seg id="82">We must change the rules to make this kind of behavior.</seg>
<seg id="83">"this may sound very melancholy as if we could do nothing against it, as if nothing could ever change; as if there is always the rich and powerful."</seg>
<seg id="84">"but as born optimist, I see quite a lot to change."</seg>
<seg id="85">"over the last few years we have already seen more transparency in the past few years, which concerns the owners of firms."</seg>
<seg id="86">The issue found political attention through British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 Summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">"since then, the EU is in central registers at the national level, who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them."</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">"representatives of both parties have brought a bill in both parliamentarians, but this does not make progress we would like to see."</seg>
<seg id="90">"we would really like to see how this Panama Disclosure, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, used as a means to ensure more transparency in the U.S. and global."</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness, this is a moment for change. "</seg>
<seg id="92">"we need ordinary people who are angry, when they see how other people can hide their true identity and their true identity."</seg>
<seg id="93">We need leaders in the economy coming up and say: "intransparency is not good for business."</seg>
<seg id="94">We need leading politicians who recognize the issue and to end it through laws to end this kind of intransparency.</seg>
<seg id="95">"together we can end the intransparency, which now allow this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering."</seg>
<seg id="96">"this is the story, as I was almost kidnapped and in the trunk of a red Mazdas."</seg>
<seg id="97">"one day after I had completed my design studies, I made a backside sale."</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda remained and looked at my things.</seg>
<seg id="99">He purchased one of my art work.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and made just a roadtrip all the country. afterwards he would go to peace.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him on a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"as we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him," Where are you busy today? "</seg>
<seg id="104">"he made the whole matter worse:" "I do not know it yet."</seg>
<seg id="105">"and I thought," Oh, man! "</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I know now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place?</seg>
<seg id="109">"but I had just got to know him again! he says he would go to peace-corps, but I don't know if he really is planning that. I will not escape in the trunk of a Mazthat land!"</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard myself: "I have an air-rate. you can sleep in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="112">"a voice in my head said," "Are, how please?"</seg>
<seg id="113">"at night I was in bed, I rigid to the blanket and thought:" "Oh man! what have I lost there?"</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild stranger in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I got such a fear that I went out of the bed, at the door of the door, and shut my bedroom door."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not mad.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The artwork that he had bought from me today is in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">It was my first experience as a host. it has changed my view.</seg>
<seg id="121">"maybe people who were sold to me in childhood as a stranger, actually friends who waited only waiting to be discovered?"</seg>
<seg id="122">"when I went to San Francisco, I was used for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air-lift."</seg>
<seg id="123">"make a journey, two years later..."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I am unemployed, almost pless, my roommates draws up and the rent is increased."</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">"I think creativity can make it, anxiety in fun to transform."</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote my best friend and new roommates Brian Chesky:" Brian, I thought about how we could make a difference. our apartment is available to a designer-bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk, including a mattress and every morning breakfast. "</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and established so "air-rats and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were able to sleep with us for 20 dollars at the air-rate on wooden flooring.</seg>
<seg id="131">"they found it super, and we too."</seg>
<seg id="132">"I am sure to decorate our cheese-ham Omelet, completely different because we made it for our guests."</seg>
<seg id="133">"we toured with them all the city. when we passed our last guest and liked the door into the castle, stared Brian and I call."</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we find new friends at the same time and could pay our rent at the same time?</seg>
<seg id="135">The things came into the reels.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former fellow-inhabitants, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out whether you could make a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">"we presented to the investors:" "we would like to create a website where people post their private pictures from their private rooms, their bedrooms, their baths -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closing when visit."</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the Internet they can then invite those strange people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the missile would like.</seg>
<seg id="142">Indeed they do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">"nobody who is still in solace, would invest in a store, the stranger allows, in apartments of other people to sleep."</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we all learned as children that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">"if one has a problem, one refers to the things that can be good. we could designate."</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie we learned that design much more is than just appearance and haptics -- it's the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">"we learned how to create objects designates, but now we wanted to create through design immenses, between people who had never met before."</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design make a difference?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create with design confidence?</seg>
<seg id="151">"I would like to give you a tasting tasting, which degree trust we are committed."</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-seconds experiment. it will force you out of your comfort.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up high when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">"now, I would like to unlock your mobile phone."</seg>
<seg id="156">Give your entsply mobile phone to your left bench.</seg>
<seg id="157">"this quiet excursion of panic, which you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts sense when they open the door for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="158">The only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">"visitors can not only read your SMS, you will see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet."</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the unblock mobile of a foreigner in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most sense the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So most guests feel when they stay somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">"only once, who is now actually Al Gores mobile?"</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you announce it on Twitter that he can candes for the Office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the mobile phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You now have experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I would like to tell you of some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a small detail at this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">"what if your neighbour have only been presented with his name only, if he would tell, how his dog or his children are called?"</seg>
<seg id="170">"imagine you would have 150 judgements, which all say," he can really hold very well unlock brays! "</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you would have to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-out feedback system reinforces confidence.</seg>
<seg id="173">In the beginning we have made some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">"it was hard for the people, negative judgements."</seg>
<seg id="175">"in the end, we decided to wait until both hosts and guest gave their testimonies before we met them online."</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">"we examined a study with Stanford a study. we examined how likely it is that people trust each other, depending on how similar they are at age and location."</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprising we can trust the people most that are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">"the more differences we find, the less we trust."</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social balance.</seg>
<seg id="181">"exciting, it will be exciting when you add the call of a person -- in our case through judgements."</seg>
<seg id="182">"if you have less than three judgements, nothing changes."</seg>
<seg id="183">"but one has more than ten, changes everything."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation for commonalities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The correct design can thus help us to overcome some of our deep rooted ones.</seg>
<seg id="186">"furthermore, we learned that trust is dependent on how much you can buy from."</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"if you tell too little about how" "Hi!" "you get rather no answer."</seg>
<seg id="189">"one tells you much, as for example:" "I have problems with my mother" -- "-- it is also not thought of the request."</seg>
<seg id="190">"so there is an optimal degree of openness, such as" "Tolle artworks in your home! I am doing with my family vacation."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can I create it with design to establish this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">"we use the size of the text area to recommend the right amount text. we also give tips, to which topics you should write something."</seg>
<seg id="193">"our whole company builds on the hope that the correct design can help to overcome our prejudices against strangers."</seg>
<seg id="194">"with which we were not reckoned, the great amount of people who were more than ready to locate these prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="195">"here, you can see how many people take our offer."</seg>
<seg id="196">One can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">"first, incredibly good luck."</seg>
<seg id="198">"second, the tireless work of our team."</seg>
<seg id="199">"third, a need that has not been covered before."</seg>
<seg id="200">For us the business runs very well.</seg>
<seg id="201">"of course, there are also times when not everything is smooth."</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have unallowed parties celebrated or apartments devastated.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I have worked on customer service. all calls arrived directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">"I stood at the front front, when trust was broken."</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurts when I only think of it.</seg>
<seg id="207">"the disappointment that you hear in the voice of the callers, and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="208">"fortunately, of 123 million people had only a fraction of a problem."</seg>
<seg id="209">Because people trusted each other too right.</seg>
<seg id="210">"if trust works, there can be marvel."</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holiday in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His hosts brought him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even ended blood for the necessary surgery!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">Perfect house for travellers who tend to be filled due to sewage activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with plenty of hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">"Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save life, even though they are not at all right."</seg>
<seg id="218">They drive your own car to the hospital when you die and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">"because they do not want you feel lonely, they bring books past."</seg>
<seg id="220">They can even longer stay longer without calculate the extra-night.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">And of course it does not run every stay.</seg>
<seg id="223">But this relationship behind pure money-reaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">"when I stumbled upon this term, I asked myself:"</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money transactions come together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is an economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"but now it is simply" "tenant" "to name, the thing is not righteous."</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People lay a part of themselves and this changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">"when you travel nowadays, this is possible to compare with Fast Food. it is efficient and reliable, but for this is less authentic."</seg>
<seg id="231">What if traveling would be a rich buffet from local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">"what if in every place you visited, a group would be waiting to wait a group there, a thoroughly complete and one in a pub or neighborhood of which one has never heard before;"</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you might learn cooking from a five-star cook?</seg>
<seg id="234">"nowadays, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy."</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to shape apartments from the ground up to the co-operation?</seg>
<seg id="236">How would this look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the thoughts of common share?</seg>
<seg id="238">"I imagine cities that allow us to make society and relationships, instead of loneliness and downing."</seg>
<seg id="239">"in South Korean capital Seoul, this project has already begun. many parking places, which were the government,"</seg>
<seg id="240">Students are now offered to residents. students who were looking for a place;</seg>
<seg id="241">Were given to people whose children were drawn. there were incubator programs started.</seg>
<seg id="242">"to finance new start-ups in the share Economy. through our platform alone, night 785 000 people will be guests at a foreigner or even host."</seg>
<seg id="243">The idea seems to be not as crazy as it was brought to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We have not reinvented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality received it even before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were already similar websites in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="247">Why so did our work?</seg>
<seg id="248">"apart from happiness and timing, we realize that you can find the correct design with the inventory of the trust."</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deeper prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I think that amazing!</seg>
<seg id="251">Straight to overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">"I have to think about it, when a red Mazda passes over me."</seg>
<seg id="253">We know of course that design can not solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">"but if it could help us when it had such great influence, I ask myself what we can use design soon."</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think when you see me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A Believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">"or suppressed, a brainlaundering, a terrorist?"</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in the vulnerability at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is actually true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I do not give you blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">Thus the media people represent the same as me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study concluded that 80% of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">"studies show: the Americans mean, most of them would have no Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people do not talk to their cheek drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">"for all those who have never met such a Muslim: it is great, you get to know."</seg>
<seg id="268">I say to you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">"I am a mother, a coffee maker -- double espresso, with Sahne extra."</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted</seg>
<seg id="271">A Moor-Fanatician</seg>
<seg id="272">"and I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim min."</seg>
<seg id="273">"but not like Lady Gaga sings, For, Baby, I was not so born."</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided that.</seg>
<seg id="275">"when I was 17 years old, I met the decision to outen me."</seg>
<seg id="276">"no, not as a homosexual person, as some of my friends, but as Muslim min. I decided to wear the Hijab, my head cover."</seg>
<seg id="277">"my feminist girlfriends were horrified:" "why are you suppressed yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">"the Lustige was: then it was for me a feminist independence of independence, and in relation to the pressure I felt as 17-year-old, to adapt to a perfect and unreachable beauty."</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only believed the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have with the Koran.</seg>

<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>

<seg id="289">"later I had later, according to my marriage, a kid, and basically lived the" "Egyptian-American dream." ""</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came the terrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"I was sitting in my kitchen, had had an end to the end, looked on the screen and saw the word" "rush". ""</seg>
<seg id="293">"there was smoke, planes flew in buildings, people escaped from the buildings."</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disorder?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock transformed itself fast into rebellion.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should you do something?</seg>
<seg id="299">"I changed the television channel and heard:"... Muslim terrorists "..."... in the name of Islam... "..."... "..." bomb Mecca! "</seg>
<seg id="300">"Oh, my God."</seg>
<seg id="301">"it is not only my country attacked, but in the Nu, the deeds of others turned me from another citizen into a suspects."</seg>
<seg id="302">"on the same day, we had to drive through the Middle West of the USA to move into a new city and start studying."</seg>
<seg id="303">"I remember how I stepped me -- as we went to silence -- so deep it went into my seat, and I was the first time feared to be recognized as a Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="304">"we moved this night into our apartment, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world."</seg>
<seg id="305">"and then I heard, saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations that said:" be vigilant, "" Seid cautious, "" lead in well illuminated areas, "" conceal you not. "</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week inside.</seg>
<seg id="307">"then it was added to Friday in that week -- the day, in which Muslims congregate to the prayers."</seg>
<seg id="308">"and again the warnings:" "do not go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the full coverage of reporting.</seg>
<seg id="310">"the feelings were understandably unfiltered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or by people who kept for Muslims in the Free, and struck."</seg>
<seg id="311">There were truly branded on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something felt not really felt.</seg>
<seg id="314">"because people who attacked this country, have attacked our country."</seg>
<seg id="315">I have conquered the cheut of people to the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to constantly explaining itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing against questions I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">These are the allegations that are tough.</seg>
<seg id="320">Nowadays we can actually say people: "there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we go on it? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church as of a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">It only presents the question: are we vicious or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malignant tumor removes you as a whole and a benign tumor you can only see under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is incorrect.</seg>
<seg id="327">"Muslims are like all other Americans, no tumor in the body of the US, but a vital organ."</seg>

<seg id="332">"the regular visit of a mosque leads to people other faith tolerant, and to show larger civil participation."</seg>
<seg id="333">"and as a leader of the police in the Washington, DC recently told: people are actually not radical in mosques."</seg>

<seg id="335">"in the radio process, one has found that it starts online. as First, the person is cut off their church, even by their family, so that the person believes the terrorists are the true Muslims, and anyone who despises their behavior and their ideology is a traitor, or by faith."</seg>

<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux Klan with Christianity.</seg>

<seg id="345">It is her brutality that they can read these things into scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam told me recently an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">"a girl came to him, because she could have imagined to the IS."</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him whether they had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">"he said, the problem was exactly the opposite. every Spirit, with whom she had spoken, brought her to silence, and said to her that her anger would bring her sense of injustice in the world, they would only bring in trouble."</seg>
<seg id="350">"inspired by nothing and something that had given sense to their anger, it was a main goal for the instrumentalization by extremists who spoke of a solution."</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam made the link to God and her community.</seg>
<seg id="352">"instead of describing them for her anger, he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world."</seg>
<seg id="353">"learned what she learned in the mosque, they kept it before the IS."</seg>
<seg id="354">It was an insight into the Islamophobia and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect anyone?</seg>
<seg id="357">"how is the 24-hour consumption of fear everyday to our democracy, to our minds?"</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: when we fear that at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We accept rather an authoritarian government system, conformance and prejudices. "</seg>
<seg id="360">"a study reveals: when you have a trial news in which negative about Muslims was reported that they were rather military attacks on Muslim countries, as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">When you look when the mood against Muslims after the above -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the advance of Iraq war and during two choices.</seg>
<seg id="364">"so Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Moslem-terror, as I expected it."</seg>
<seg id="365">"it can actually be a tool to manipulation the public, to run the foundation of free society, the rational and well informed citizens."</seg>
<seg id="366">The handling of Moslems is an early sign.</seg>

<seg id="407">What started as a platform for Bastler is about to become a milliardenshop.</seg>
<seg id="408">"control, environmental surveillance, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. it is made possible in research institutions worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="409">"before air conditioning, a autonomous fleet of aircraft in the FRAC Centre in France live a six meter high tower from 1 500 bricks. a few years ago, they began to fly with ropes."</seg>
<seg id="410">Through incuborators you reach a high speed and acceleration at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-constantly changing structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to carry loads with turmoil and generally react to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">"our objective is to exceed the limits of the possible in the autonomous flight."</seg>
<seg id="415">"thus, a system autonomously works, it must be collective to know where in the room the mobile objects are located."</seg>
<seg id="416">"in our laboratory at the ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to find objects. this allows us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic Tasks."</seg>
<seg id="417">"for today's Demos we use a new localization technology of Verity Studios, an offset of our laboratories."</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">"each aircraft has internal sensors in order to determine the position in the room, calculations on board what the machine should do."</seg>
<seg id="420">"external orders exist at the highest image." "e.g." "and" "land." ""</seg>
<seg id="421">"this is a so-called tailstarter,"</seg>
<seg id="422">"a flight device, that tries to beat two flies with a cap."</seg>
<seg id="423">"like other stargates, it is efficient in advance-flight, much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations."</seg>
<seg id="424">"in contrast to most starter-flyers, it can be swollen, and therefore have a great advantages at start and landing, and is very versatile."</seg>
<seg id="425">However there is always a downside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A restriction of hedgehogs is that they are sensitive to turbulence such as wind turbines.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind is that the air device does not affect the optimal position and can be improved by practicing the performance by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">"during our research, we often introduce basic abstract questions that advance to the heart of the matter."</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be for example: what is the smaller number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for making the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopter are known about as machines with a thousand movable parts that meet you to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Several decades ago the pilots could fly remote-controlled air machines that only had two eventful parts: a propeller and a tailgate.</seg>
<seg id="435">"recently, we discovered that flies with just one works."</seg>
<seg id="436">"this is the monospinner, the mechanically ultra-minded aircraft. it was recently invented."</seg>
<seg id="437">"it only has a movable part, a propeller,"</seg>
<seg id="438">"no flank, hinges and cross-sections, no further actuator or controllers, only a propeller."</seg>
<seg id="439">"although it is mechanically simple, happens in the interior life very much, so that it can fly stable and move in space."</seg>
<seg id="440">"however, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the hedge. to bring it to fly, I have to throw it right."</seg>
<seg id="441">"the likelihood to throw it exactly when to see, is low, therefore I'll show you a video that was shot yesterday evening."</seg>
<seg id="442">"if the monospinner is an exercise in co-use, this machine is here, the Omnicopic with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance."</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that he is not a balanced.</seg>
<seg id="445">Therefore he is ambivalent in his alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">"by doing so, he receives the proper capability:"</seg>
<seg id="447">"moving in the room into all directions, no matter what direction he is filmed or even as he rotated."</seg>
<seg id="448">"of course, it is complex, mainly in the field of interactive rivers from the eight propellers."</seg>
<seg id="449">"some is adjustable in models, the rest will learn directly at flying."</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's see that.</seg>
<seg id="451">"if flights are to be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliably."</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine consists of two separate two-propellers airplanes.</seg>
<seg id="453">This is reflected in the clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">"when one builds them together, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter."</seg>
<seg id="456">"however, a bit goes wrong -- a motor or propeller falls off, electronics or a battery -- can fly the machine if restricted."</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate that by making a half of the airplane.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration examined synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">"the large number of autonomous, co-ordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression."</seg>
<seg id="460">We assumed the usual micro-quadcopter -- every single weighs less than a slice of bread -- and statutes them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where in the room she is and is self-controlled. therefore there is no ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully they motivate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly secure machine there it wants to be a flyer on Broadway a flyer.</seg>
<seg id="464">"of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology."</seg>
<seg id="465">For types such as us lies the reward in development and creation.</seg>
<seg id="466">"it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and magical our universe is, and that it is creative, smart creatures allow it to form in such a spectacular way."</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">"" "hello,"</seg>
<seg id="469">"prior to 1.3 billion years ago, in a very distant galaxies two black holes are becoming more and faster, you turned so the mass tribulbs in a tithes in pure energy around."</seg>
<seg id="470">These short moment shaded them brighter than all stars together in all galaxies of the whole of us known universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they did not put your energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy has been handed down into the space-time-run and the universe exploded in gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">We arrange the events at first time.</seg>
<seg id="476">3 billion years ago it has been made several multi-zelliges life on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">"since then, the earth has brought forth a lot: corals, fish, plants, SAURIER, People and -- God even stand for us -- even the internet."</seg>
<seg id="478">"for about 25 years ago, a group of particularly courageous -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from CalTech -- to find a huge laser detector that arise for the gravitational black holes."</seg>
<seg id="479">Most they thought for insane.</seg>
<seg id="480">"but enough people recognized her as a crazy genies, so that the U.S. National Science Foundation has financed their idea."</seg>
<seg id="481">"after decades of development, construction, conception and extremely hard work they built the Detector LIGO: the Laser-Interferometer- gravitational-Observatory."</seg>
<seg id="482">"in the following time, the precision of LIGO could substantially increased considerably, which increases the recognition performance."</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is now called Advanced LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015 LIGO was started for a last test run by some minor, persistent issues. "</seg>

<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell to my daughter's father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically they were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">"all this, which I had worked, is no longer science-fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicists at MIT. he studied for 23 years of gravitational-waves from black holes and their due to observatories such as LIGO measurable signals. what are gravitational-waves?"</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a cgravation of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">"when temporarily the wave, the space and its clustered content is stretched in a direction and is inserted into the other."</seg>
<seg id="495">To illustrate faculty in courses for the Relativity-theory often have a really bad dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and shrink, stretching and storage."</seg>
<seg id="497">"the problem is that gravitational-waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="498">"on 14 September, for example, each of us have been stretched and smoked. the elongation of an average person was 10 high -21."</seg>
<seg id="499">"that is, 20 Nullen after the comma, followed by a 1st Darum, you explained the LIGO staff for insane."</seg>
<seg id="500">"with a five kilometers long laser detector, and that is absurd, this length would have to be measured on less than a thousaddle of the radius of a nuclear power. that's grotesk."</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text about gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">"Kip Thorne, a co-founder LIGOs, the hunt for the waves:" "the technical difficulties in the construction of such detectors are enormous."</seg>
<seg id="503">"but physicist are invading and with the support of the public, all obstacles will be overcome."</seg>
<seg id="504">"Thorne released this 1973, 42 years before his success."</seg>
<seg id="505">"back to LIGO. Scott holds, LIGO is more an ear than an eye."</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength which is much smaller than the things around us: facial hair the size of your mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="508">That is quite practical. because so you can make a picture or a map of things by taking advantage of several points coming in light around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">At killing it is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">"therefore it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean you particularly much:"</seg>
<seg id="512">The face of your child about.</seg>
<seg id="513">"instead, we listen to certain properties like pitch and height, rhythm and volume, to close the story behind it."</seg>
<seg id="514">"now, just Alice."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts her."</seg>
<seg id="516">"dummer Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to vitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot take with them any simple pictures of objects in space.</seg>
<seg id="519">"but as we consider changes in amplitude and frequency of waves, we can listen to their stories."</seg>
<seg id="520">At least lie for LIGO the measured frequencies in audible areas.</seg>
<seg id="521">"so if we convert breakdown patterns in Schall, we can listen to all literally."</seg>
<seg id="522">Gravitation to lauer can tell us about much about the collision of two black holes in which my colleague Scott has been employed quite a long time.</seg>
<seg id="523">"SH: 2 black, not rotating holes, circuits simple: wupp!"</seg>
<seg id="524">Turning the two body very fast. you can hear the same circule with an additional key change. it sounds like this: Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement that defines the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">"AA: on 14 September 2015 -- a date that is at least I never forget -- heard LIGO Folders: [Surrendering noise] Jemand, who knows what he has to hear, recognize this as noise from -- SH:... two black holes with each 30-fold parasite, which are about as fast as the sticks of your Mixers."</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let us think about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">"two black holes, the dense body in all, one with a mass of 29 Sun, the other with a mass of 36 probes, revolve himself a hundred times per second before they collide."</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know it because we heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the permanent significance of LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="533">LIGO has an entirely new way to study the Alls as never before it was possible.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to the All lad and the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in All we can -- virtually or basically -- not see.</seg>
<seg id="536">"a super-nova, for example. I would like to know why was explode stars in Supernovae."</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we have learned a lot about all of them.</seg>
<seg id="538">"the exciting physical processes are happening in the core, hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon."</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never pass through since these opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gravitational-waves penetrate iron, as if it would be more transparent glass. the urine test would be happy to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see them because the urine is covered by his own night."</seg>
<seg id="541">Gravitational-waves should be possible to back up until the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">"and most importantly: I am optimistic that we have never seen in all things that we have never seen, and of which we do not have any idea what we can only discover what we listen."</seg>
<seg id="543">"in fact, LIGO found right in the first lap that we did not expect."</seg>
<seg id="544">"my colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO project, says on this subject: me: the kind of stars, the black holes, as LIGO, they are observed, are the dinosaurs of the universe."</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient body from prehistoric times. the black holes are so far to speak for our archeological work. "</seg>
<seg id="546">"LIGO enables us to make a completely different angle of view on the events at all, on the emergence of the stars and ultimately on how we went out of this chaos."</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now is to be as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">"thanks to LIGO, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the rushing and circle of the cosmos."</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a brand new generation of observatories on Earth and in all.</seg>
<seg id="550">"for what could be more beautiful, than the urine of self?"</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time I tried an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"for a year I would say unto all" "Yes!" "before which I was afraid."</seg>
<seg id="556">"no matter if it made me nervous, brought me into uncomfortable situations, I forced myself to say" Yes. ""</seg>

<seg id="602">"I say it to you, so that all of you who work so hard, whether you are talking about a company, a country or a classroom to take me seriously when I am talking about work, so you understand that I am not only on the computer, and imaginative, and it is true when I say, I understand that it is not the dream with a dream."</seg>
<seg id="603">"it is all a job, all the work, all the reality, all sweat -- no tears."</seg>
<seg id="604">"I work a lot, hard and I love it."</seg>
<seg id="605">When I am deepened into the work there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country from nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">It's when I put troops on when I was on a screen.</seg>
<seg id="608">"for example, you have a high tone, provided a marathon."</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work it.</seg>
<seg id="612">"it is creative, mechanically and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and reasonable. and the best thing about it is the buzzing."</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when working well runs.</seg>
<seg id="614">"a buzz begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzzing sounds like a animated road, I could always go on it."</seg>
<seg id="615">"many people take to them, when I talk to them the sums that I talk about writing, that writing gave me joy."</seg>
<seg id="616">"don't understand me wrong, that does it."</seg>
<seg id="617">"but the sums -- when I began working with the television production, when I began to work and to work and collaborate, I discovered this thing, this buzz, this energy."</seg>
<seg id="618">The buzz is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums is action and activity. the buzz is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sums is music. the sums is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The sums is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">"and if you have such a buzzing, then you cannot wait any other than after size."</seg>
<seg id="623">"feeling not to be different than looking for size, no matter what price."</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or perhaps it also means a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I know not.</seg>
<seg id="630">"I know only that I am not for the failure, and I only know that I love the sums."</seg>
<seg id="631">"I will only say, I am a titanium, and I know that I will not ask that question."</seg>
<seg id="632">"to make a clear set: the more successful I will, the more broadcasts, the more work there, the more work there, the more things there, the more I do, the more I write history, the more expectations there are."</seg>
<seg id="633">"the more I work to be successful, the more I have to work."</seg>
<seg id="634">And what do I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">"I love work, not true?"</seg>
<seg id="636">"the country that I scmonkey, the marathon, the army, the army, the linen, the sums, the buzzing, the buzzing, the buzzing."</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this swamps. I love the swamps.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the buzz. I am the buzzing.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only this buzz?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then stops the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="641">"overhauled, overhauled, exaggerated."</seg>
<seg id="642">The buzzing stops.</seg>
<seg id="643">"now, my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mum is a single working title."</seg>
<seg id="644">"Harper tells people:" "my mom will not be there, but you can write my nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"and Emerson says:" "estimate, I want to go to Shonda Land."</seg>
<seg id="646">There are the children of a titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">You are Baby-Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">"they were 12, 3 and 1, when the sums ceased."</seg>
<seg id="649">The buzzing of the engine stopped.</seg>
<seg id="650">I did not love my work anymore. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums came not back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sums was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">"I made the same things as always: the same Titans work, 15 hours-days, no remorals, did not imply, a titleep does not exist, with all the heart, clear eyes, whatever."</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no marsh.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four."</seg>
<seg id="657">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously..."</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a lecture-Titan.</seg>
<seg id="660">"everything was grey, I just had no fun anymore."</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sums and the sums was me.</seg>
<seg id="664">"so what makes you do if what you do, the work that you love, suddenly faded?"</seg>
<seg id="665">"I know some may think:" "Heul you out, the author-Titan."</seg>
<seg id="666">"but you know you do it, you do, you love to be a teacher, a banker, a mother to be a mother, you love one another, and knows how the buzzing feels when the buzzing stops, who is then you then?"</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">"when the song of my heart is listening, I can survive in silence?"</seg>
<seg id="671">And then I gave me my "southern states-waitress" a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"I am out of the way out, late and she says," Mama, do you play? "</seg>
<seg id="673">And I will say no say when I am aware of two things:</seg>
<seg id="674">"first, I have to say Yes to all and secondly, they did not called me."</seg>
<seg id="675">It does not call anyone any more "estimation."</seg>
<seg id="676">When is this happening?</seg>
<seg id="677">"I hate it, when I came to Titan and my sums, and here everything changes my own eyes."</seg>
<seg id="678">"and so she says," "Mama, do you like to play?"</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say: "yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">This is nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play and her sisters come into account we laugh a lot and I read completely dramatically from the book "everybody Poops."</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">"but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic, in the loneliness and absence of the bub, I cannot do anything except."</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">"the country that I scmonkey, the marathon, the army, the army, the linen, the high sound, they no longer exist anymore."</seg>
<seg id="687">"all that exists, sticky finger and damp kisses, delicate voices, wax crayon and the song, in which it comes to slogan, or whatever the girl in" "The Ice Queen". ""</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so scarce that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Play is the opposite of work.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something inside me breaks.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes on and an energy club comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">"and not immediately, but it happens."</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The buzz comes slowly back.</seg>
<seg id="698">"no full volume, hardly there, it is quiet, hardly audible, but it is there."</seg>
<seg id="699">"not the buzz, but a buzz."</seg>
<seg id="700">"and now I feel, I would know a magical secret."</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. this is all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we forget.</seg>
<seg id="705">"the buzzing, the workamount, the titanium-consume, which is only the replacement."</seg>
<seg id="706">"if I ask you, who you are, when I tell you who I am when I describe myself with broadcasts and television hours and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real buzz is."</seg>
<seg id="707">The buzzing is not a force and it is not work-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real buzz depends on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">"the sums is the stream, which comes from lifestyles."</seg>
<seg id="711">The real sums is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">"the real sums ignores the pressure of history, which are dedicated to erleant tasks, the expectation and pressure."</seg>
<seg id="713">The real buzz is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">"true sums of God is the voice in my ear, but perhaps I whispered with God the wrong words, for which God said to me that I am a titanium?"</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">"we all need a bit more love, much more love."</seg>
<seg id="717">"as soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes."</seg>
<seg id="718">I make this as a permanent rule so that I can free myself as a workaholic from any guilt.</seg>
<seg id="719">"it is law, I have no choice. I have no other choice, if I want to hear the sums again."</seg>
<seg id="720">"wish it would be so simple. I am not good in playing, I don't like it."</seg>
<seg id="721">Play not guardily as they work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth does hurt</seg>
<seg id="723">But I do not like to play.</seg>
<seg id="724">I am always working because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer my workplace than home.</seg>
<seg id="726">"this entails is painful, because what a person rather than to be home?"</seg>
<seg id="727">"yes, I."</seg>
<seg id="728">"time honestly, I call myself" "Titan" "--"</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">"we rasen in the garden around and back, back and forth."</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burnishing soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">I mainly feel stiff, absent and confused. "</seg>
<seg id="736">I have always been playing after my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is OK.</seg>
<seg id="738">"my children show me how to live, and the sums of the universe filled me."</seg>
<seg id="739">"I play and play, until I ask myself, Why have we ever heard with playing?"</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also say it! say it always Yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">"maybe you keep me for naive, for a daydreamer."</seg>
<seg id="742">"you probably have right, but you can do it too!"</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? you are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">"my little ones want to play at most 15 minutes with me, until they can catch something else."</seg>
<seg id="748">"they are wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes."</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes you get a ladybug or biscuit.</seg>
<seg id="750">"and speak my teenager-daughter of a whole 15 minutes with me, I am the mother of the year."</seg>
<seg id="751">"they are only 15 minutes, more it does not need."</seg>
<seg id="752">"everyone can bring about 15 minutes in a piece, even on a bad mood day!"</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes in a piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">"no mobile, no laundry, no distraction."</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner the children bettdone.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are in!</seg>
<seg id="757">"my children are my wellbeing, my world. it does not have to be the children. it is considered to feel the sums, a place for his soul peace."</seg>
<seg id="758">It is not about playing with their own children. it is about joy</seg>
<seg id="759">In order to play "play" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you are doing well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and keep it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="763">I am not perfect in it. I fail and I siege. friends meet books to read the day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"do you want to play?" "stands for everything I have given up when I got my first TV show when I wanted to get myself more and more."</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes in the piece why not full 15 minutes walk?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can it be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums came back in my spare time. the sums seems to return if I am not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working is not working without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">"it takes time, but after a few months a door opens up, and I find myself again in my office. I hear a well-known melody, she filled me and my soul. I despises me to new ideas. I don't let me away his way. I seize it in full sips and love my work again."</seg>
<seg id="770">"I like the sums, but I don't love it."</seg>
<seg id="771">I do not need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">"I am not the buzz, the sums is not me... not anymore."</seg>
<seg id="773">"soap and sticky finger, dinner with friends."</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my buzz.</seg>
<seg id="775">The sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sums of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">"the sums of the work is part of me, but just one part. and I am so grateful."</seg>
<seg id="778">"it is snuppe that I am a titanium. I have never seen a Titan, the trip to Jerusalem."</seg>
<seg id="779">I said Yes to less work and to more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still functional.</seg>
<seg id="781">"the more I play, the happier I and my children."</seg>
<seg id="782">"the more I play, the more I feel as a good mother."</seg>
<seg id="783">"the more I play, the more clear is my head."</seg>

<seg id="786">"the more I feel this buzz, the more makes this unusual, bezzling, naked and new life-esteem in me wide. less Titan -- more I!"</seg>
<seg id="787">"the more I feel exactly this buzz, the more I know who I am."</seg>
<seg id="788">I am author. I think things I awaken you to life.</seg>
<seg id="789">"this belongs to the job, which means to live his dream."</seg>
<seg id="790">"this is the dream of this jobs,"</seg>
<seg id="791">Because a dream job should be a bit dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">"yes, I said" Yes "to have less work and to play more games."</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thanks beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am Neurosurgical.</seg>
<seg id="797">How most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">"I know how your life can change from one second to the other, after a serious stroke, or after an accident."</seg>
<seg id="799">"for us neurosurgeon, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other bodily organs, has a very low ability to self-healing."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after a severe injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a lasting, serious disability."</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I functional neurologist.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a working neurologist?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve nerve functions through various surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">"sure, they have heard of one of the most well known, the" deep-car stimulation. "there is also a electrode deep inside the brain, to influence the circuits of the neurons so that the neurological function has improved."</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has been improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's suffering from fierce trembling and heavy pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation but does not mean Neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream functional neurosurgeon is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to you.</seg>
<seg id="810">With something help the brain can help themselves.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was conductive overseas and worked day and night in the emergency.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I also showed people with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">You have to imagine that at skull-deer trauma the brain can be counterswilled and cranial pressure.</seg>
<seg id="815">"to save life, you have to diminish the cranial pressure."</seg>
<seg id="816">"to do this, sometimes one must remove a part of swollen brain mass."</seg>
<seg id="817">"instead of throwing brazen mass, we decided to analyze us with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, the brain-mass."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted cells to grow from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">"cells from a tissue which grow to grow, is comparable to very small children that will be taken out of your families."</seg>
<seg id="822">"you have to find the correct nutrition, temperature, moisture and the environments to thrive them."</seg>
<seg id="823">Precisely that we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts to make it Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">This he saw under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">This was a great surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked like a tribal culture. with large green cells, surrounded by small, unmature cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you are still aware of the biblical teaching that stem cells unripe cells are that can turn into every cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain has tribal cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this sort of stem cells from the surface of the stags of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made a further fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die; they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells turned out differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They shared slowly and after a few weeks they died even.</seg>
<seg id="836">"so we saw a new, strange cell population that looked like tribal cells but was different."</seg>
<seg id="837">"we needed for a long time to understand, where they came."</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortine-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our grandparents.</seg>
<seg id="842">You play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of the fetus they provide for the design of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why remain they preserved?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">"we believe they take part in the healing of the brain, since we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injury."</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so certain.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">"we stand in front of a potential cell source, the brain-healing."</seg>
<seg id="850">This we had to prove.</seg>
<seg id="851">"so, we decided to develop an experiment."</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to remove a piece of brain mass on the non-speaking area and then the cells just as cultivate as it did Jean-François</seg>
<seg id="853">"and they are farther to mark them, in order to follow her in the brain."</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step we implanted them to the detachment of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologist Transplantation -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we reimplant these cells in normative tissue tissues? and what will happen when we reimplant the same cells in damages?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to Prof. Eric Rouiller we were able to work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario we reimplanted the cells into a healthy brain, and we watched that they were taken after a few weeks as if they were taken back home. the space is already occupied, so they will not disappear."</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we added a violation to and reimplanted exactly the same cells and now the cells remained to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been reimplaned.</seg>
<seg id="862">"evidence that they show are these small points. these are the cells we are in vitro, in the culture."</seg>
<seg id="863">Here we could not stop.</seg>
<seg id="864">"do these cells also help a monkey, to recover from a brain injury?"</seg>
<seg id="865">"so, we trained monkeys with a manual workmanship."</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take food pellets from a tablet.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made them very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">"when they had reached a stable base level, last we had in the motoric Cortex the hand-motorik area."</seg>
<seg id="869">"then the monkeys were paralysed, they could no longer move their hand."</seg>
<seg id="870">"just as it would happen with people, they rested spontaneously up to a certain degree, just like after a stroke."</seg>
<seg id="871">"the patients are paralysed, and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recover a certain degree, just as with the monkey."</seg>
<seg id="872">"when we were sure that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells."</seg>
<seg id="873">"on the left side they see the monkeys, which spontaneously retired."</seg>
<seg id="874">It can bring about 40% to 50% of its original performance from injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not as precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">"now see when we redirected the cells: the same monkey, two months after the friction plantation."</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and use later.</seg>
<seg id="880">"we can use them in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson."</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implant themselves to implant.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can show you soon as the human brain gives the means to heal yourself.</seg>
<seg id="883">"" "hello,"</seg>
<seg id="884">"Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, this is wonderful, I am sure that right now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think:" I know someone who need it. "</seg>

<seg id="886">"of course, the question of what is the greatest obstacles before you can start clinical trials at the human being."</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from this great results you have to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to run this kind of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">"BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc."</seg>
<seg id="889">"JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team."</seg>
<seg id="890">"BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get the permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years takes it until someone will come to hospital, and this therapy will be available."</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: this is difficult to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">"first, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial."</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it allow us to allow the authority to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then it is necessary to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">"it has been a long time to select patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment."</seg>
<seg id="896">"after that, one must apply this to a multi-centric study."</seg>
<seg id="897">"first, one has to make sure that it is useful before you can offer this treatment anyone."</seg>

<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider them as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">"we do not see democracy as the fragile plant that it is in reality, but as the inventory of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to look at them as unchangeable circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe capitalism is inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">"Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his large nocence in Beijing have doubtlessly proved that it is quite possible to have a blooming capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains fully undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="908">"in fact, democracy comes with us, in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">"at the beginning of the year, when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was made to me as a financial minister in the Eurogroup unmisunderstood that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- do not affect the austerity programs in Greece."</seg>
<seg id="910">"in that moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew, or the Communist Party of China, or some of my afflicted friends who would reiterate me that democracy would change anything."</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">"I ask you to believe together with me again to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup of a mistake, we could save the democracy but that we need a true and defective democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"for without democracy our societies are committed to our future, and our great, new technologies are wasted."</seg>
<seg id="914">"on the subject of wastage, I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction, which is currently being threatened by our economies."</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "twingsgipfel-Paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">"a summit is known to you. you know and recognize him as the Schuldenberg, who throws its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the Schuldenberg.</seg>
<seg id="918">But only a few recognize its kennel.</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of unused cash, which is to be anxious, however, which could be too anxious to invest in where it would be productive and income to produce all the things that humanity urgently needed, for example" Green "Energy."</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"over the past 3 months in the United States, in England and in the eurozone, 3.4 trillion dollars invested in all the wealth of producing goods, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, gifts, equipment and so on and so forth."</seg>
<seg id="922">"3.4 trillion dollars sounds like a lot of money until one is compares with the 5,1 Billionen of US dollars that were at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing but the stock exchange rates and the property prices."</seg>
<seg id="923">"thus, debts and unproductive capital are the twins peaks, which are not the same with the usual market mechanisms."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the result are stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54 year-olds in the US, Japan and Europe are unemployed, which would not invest in a final demand for the pessimism of investors, who would not invest in which they should not invest. just like economist father, who would not invest in which they would not invest. just like economist father, who would not invest in which they would not invest. just like economist father, who would not invest in which they would not invest. just like economist father, who would not invest in which they would not invest. just like economist father, who would not invest in which they should not invest. just like economist father, who would not invest in which they should kill him, when he will grow him,"</seg>
<seg id="925">"involuntary the circumstances will bring about it, that cause the body to kill him."</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my hadern with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"its extremely wasted capital, All the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives to further develop human talents and especially all the technologies," Green "technologies that are crucial to saving the Earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I think so. but before we continue: what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristoteles defined democracy as the social form in which the free and poor as a majority control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy closed too many of course --</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, foreigners, and of course slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">"however, it would be a mistake, the place of the athenian democracy due to these closures."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the decision-making of the Athenian democracy was and is that they were working with the working poor, and not only the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive, which they give them the right to political co-determination with equal stimulation in issues of the state."</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy has not been held long --</seg>
<seg id="936">"like a candle, which shines very bright, it is also quickly burned."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, our current liberal democracies have not present its roots in the ancient Athens,"</seg>
<seg id="938">"but in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while the Athenian democracy concentrated on the free citizens concentrated and the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for the ruling class."</seg>
<seg id="940">"for the liberal democracy was only possible, when a full separation of politics and economy is possible and the democratic process of politics was introduced into politics, while the economy - the world of corporations -- a democratic-free zone."</seg>
<seg id="941">"in our present democracies has existed since the time, in which this separation of politics and economy began to undergo a relentless struggle between the two by taking the economy gradually the policy and destroyed them."</seg>
<seg id="942">Are you wonder why politicians are no longer like this?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not up to degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because it cannot be in the government today and not at power because the power from politics into the economy is isolated and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hadern with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"if you think about it, it is like a herd of carnivores that so sustaining the animals of which they nourished at the end therefore."</seg>
<seg id="947">"similarly, it is similar to the economy that politics gets so far cannibalized, that it grows through the self-created economic crisis itself. the power of corporations will grow, political parties is increasing, the overall economic demand falls and the managing directors of companies are too anxious to invest the cash of their companies."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the more successful the capitalism leaves the" Demos "[the people] out of democracy, the higher the twins peaks, and the greater the wastage of human labour power and the welfare of humanity."</seg>
<seg id="949">"if this is true, it is obvious that we have to bring politics and the economy back together, and it would be better if the" Demos "retains control, just as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="950">By the way this is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxian left had this idea already 100 years ago and it was not very strange.</seg>
<seg id="952">The teaching from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only reflects through a wonder of such a position as in the ancient Athens without creating new types of brutality and wastage.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: to set up the working arms!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism is doing it by replacing low-wage employment through automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem is, such as long economy and politics are separate areas, automating the twins summit will be higher, the wastage, and the social conflicts deeper, just as I believe -- in countries like China will come."</seg>
<seg id="956">"so we have to reshaping the economy and unite the areas of economy and politics, and pay attention to the reunited area, otherwise we end the film" Matrix "like a documentation."</seg>
<seg id="957">"so the question is not whether capitalism has the technical achievements, which he has brought to, --"</seg>
<seg id="958">"the most interesting question is whether capitalism is similar to capitalism through a Dystopia, similar to the" "Star Trek", "in the machines serve the human being, or into a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians" Agora, "in long conversations the meaning of life."</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we can be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">"so what would it be, how could it look like this" Star Trek "-good utopia instead of the" Matrix "-similar Dystopia?"</seg>
<seg id="961">"in practical implementation, I want to give you a few examples."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the area of companies: ask a capitalist market in which you earn money while you are working and in which your capital will follow you from a job to next, and the company -- regardless of which one is currently working -- is property of those who are currently working in the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all the income from capital and redeeming and the concept of wage works is completely outdated.</seg>
<seg id="964">"no distinction between those who belong to the company, but who do not work in it, and employees who work there, but no exchange between capital and labour, no major gaps between investment and spools, and ultimately no emploins twins summit."</seg>
<seg id="965">"in the field of global political economy, please imagine that our national currencies would have a free fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, that will be issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging countries], in the interest of all humanity."</seg>
<seg id="966">"furthermore, imagine that the entire world trading in this currency will be acted -- we call it" the cosmos, "in units of" cosmos "-- and each government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade overflow of the respective country into a common fund."</seg>
<seg id="967">"imagine that these funds are investing in" green "technologies, especially in parts of the world, in which investments are rare."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes was proposed at the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that one was not the technical means at that time.</seg>
<seg id="971">"today, we have them, particularly in front of the background of a reunited politics and business."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world, which I describe you is at the same time as liberal individuals preferred, and Marxist because it is buried in the separation of capital and work in the dustbin of history, and keynesiastic, global keynesiastic."</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all others it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we awaken in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we reconcile into a "matrix" - similar Dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide to make political decisions.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better democratic.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You descriptive you in your biography itself as a liberal Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">"Yanis Varoufakis: if something of what I've just said is, then Marx is relevant."</seg>
<seg id="983">"the reason for the reunification of politics and business is... do we do not, technological development will generate such a massive decline in the overall economic demand that Larry Summers is called" "long term stagnation". ""</seg>
<seg id="984">"by transferring this crisis from a part of the earth to the next, as we experience it, it will not only destabilize our democracies but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low."</seg>
<seg id="985">"if this analysis is true, Marx is quite relevant."</seg>
<seg id="986">"also, as Hayek, that's why I am a liberal Marxist, and like Keynes, and therefore I am also perfect."</seg>
<seg id="987">"BG: indeed, and now we are at ease."</seg>
<seg id="988">"YV: if one is not swirr, one thinks not enough."</seg>
<seg id="989">"BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein that told that. BG: in your talk, you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you have made very clearly what you keep from the view of the West to China."</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great level of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the gift of a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">"as I said in my lecture, we have limited the democracy on policy while the area where most of the economy is, -- the area of the economy -- a completely democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="994">"in a certain way, when I must say so provocative, China is similar to China today in the UK of the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="995">"for -- remember -- we tend to combine liberalism with democracy -- that is a mistake, historically."</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism and Liberals like John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly skeptical about what democratic development concerns.</seg>
<seg id="998">"what one can now watch in China is similar to the development, which we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second."</seg>
<seg id="999">"now I propose to do what the West in the 19th century has done, smells huge to hypocrisy."</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as a financial minister in the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I foresee that that comes.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later on the first half-year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">"YV: very exciting, from personal point of view, and very disappointing, because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the eurozone."</seg>
<seg id="1005">"not only Greece, but the euro zone,"</seg>
<seg id="1006">"namely, from self-sufficiency to adopt, and the perseverance denial that a massive verage line through the eurozone continues, and continues to expand the development of the whole European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1007">"we had the opportunity to open on the basis of the Greek proposal -- by the way, the first proposal was denial the denial."</seg>
<seg id="1008">"unfortunately, the powers within the euro zone, within the European group, continues to be denied the denial."</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience from the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">"if one tries to get an economic system that is not transferable, by political will and authoritarianism in life, it will perhaps be a while, but when the change occurs, he happens abrupt and destructive."</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what change do you see ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone does not have a future if we do not change its construction.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as a financial minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who look back -- seriously...</seg>
<seg id="1017">"if there is a finance minister, or any minister, who after 6 months in office, especially in such a tense situation, he made no mistakes, then this is a dangerous person."</seg>
<seg id="1018">"of course, I made mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1019">The greatest failing was to sign the application for the extension of the Schultheprogram at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest on the sides of the donors to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not.</seg>
<seg id="1022">"they only wanted to get our government to the case, only because they did not want to deal with the revisions taken by the eurozone."</seg>
<seg id="1023">They did not want to concede that she had passed a catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost a third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">"there's worse than during" "Great Depression". ""</seg>
<seg id="1026">"none of the Troika's donors who has imposed us this policy, and a:" that was a colossal mistake. "</seg>
<seg id="1027">"BG: despite all that, and despite the aggressive templates of the conversations, you seem to be quite a European."</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">My criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is coming from someone who lives and loves.</seg>
<seg id="1030">My greatest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">"for if they do not survive, the shared fliers will be demonic and destroy the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1032">"this will not be disastrous for Europe alone, but for the entire global economy."</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">"if we admit ourselves the way of a post-modern 1930, when it appears to me, it will be as well tolerated for the future of Europeans as well as the non-Europeans."</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope you are wrong in this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">"Yanis, thank you so much for you at TED."</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">Roy Price have never heard of the most people even though he is probably responsible for 22-moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">"probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for many of you."</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that Roy was met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is leading at Amazon Studios.</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV-manufacturing company at Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"he is 47 years old, slim, has a Igelolisur and describes on Twitter as" films, TV, technology, tacos. "</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for how to produce the shows and content of the Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">"of course, this is a highly competitive industry."</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are already so many TV series that Roy cannot be selected.</seg>
<seg id="1047">"he has to find shows, which are very, very good."</seg>
<seg id="1048">"in other words, he must find shows that are very right on this curve."</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the review of over 2500 TV series on the website IMDB. the rating runs from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this review.</seg>
<seg id="1050">"if your show is rated with nine and higher, this is a winner."</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"these are shows like" Breaking Bad, "" Game of Thrones, "" The Wire "-- all the shows that addicted where, after having a season, your brain asks," Where are there more of these episodes? "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"on the left side, here at this end, shows how" Toddlers and Tiaras "-- -- that should tell you what is going on at that end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price is not about to get on the left side of the curve because I think one needs special intelligence in order to undergo "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">"he makes more thoughts about the mean curation, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply inspire."</seg>
<seg id="1057">"so, he must make sure that he is really on the right side."</seg>
<seg id="1058">"the pressures is present and of course it is the first time that Amazon makes something, therefore Roy Price is not going to risk anything."</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">"he needs guaranteed success, so he keeps a competition."</seg>
<seg id="1061">"he takes many ideas for TV shows and choose by an evaluation eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and make them online where they can watch everyone for free."</seg>
<seg id="1062">"and if Amazon can be out for free things, you get it right?"</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of spectators look at these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">"however, they do not know that they will be observed at the watching of these shows."</seg>
<seg id="1065">You will be observed by Roy and his team who take all of them.</seg>
<seg id="1066">"you capture when to start the show, when one gets paused, which parts one comes up or check again."</seg>
<seg id="1067">"you collect millions of data, to decide with these data and then what show they should produce."</seg>
<seg id="1068">"in fact, they collect the data, process these and resulting in the answer, and this is:" Amazon should make a sitcom about four republican U.S. Senators. "</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anybody know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"yes," Alpha House, "but it seems that not many of these show could remember because they were not so good."</seg>
<seg id="1072">"it is only an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7,4, and Alpha House lands with 7,5 -- so something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked."</seg>
<seg id="1073">"about at the same time when another company has placed another manager a top show by data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming of Netflix. just like Roy it is always searching for this a super show and he also uses data for it, but he does it somewhat different."</seg>
<seg id="1074">"instead of organizing a competition, he and his team will face the existing data on the Netflix viewer, so the reviews they give the shows, their course, what shows them like etc."</seg>
<seg id="1075">"then use these data to find these little details about the spectators: what shows they like, which producers, which actors."</seg>
<seg id="1076">"when they had all the parts together, they entered a car and decided not to make a sitcom about four Senators, but a drama series about a Senator."</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"yes," House of Cards ". Netflix has had a hit, at least for the first two squadrons."</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9,1 review on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go. "</seg>
<seg id="1080">"of course, now is the question: what happened here?"</seg>
<seg id="1081">"one has two very knowleditive, data sealed."</seg>
<seg id="1082">"they combine these many data with each other and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company."</seg>
<seg id="1083">Why is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because the logic goes somehow it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">"if you collects millions of data, for a decision that you meet, then you should make a good decision."</seg>
<seg id="1086">It has 200 years of statistics than Back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">One optimized it with very powerful computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">"the least thing you can expect is good TV, or?"</seg>
<seg id="1089">"if data analysis is not working, this is a little startling because we are living in a time when we reach more and more statistics to meet serious decisions, far beyond television."</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anybody know here the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">"nobody. OK, that is even good."</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that nobody comes in touch with this software. come in touch with this software you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">"if anyone is here in the US in prison and ask for relief, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dismissal is done or not."</seg>
<seg id="1094">"just like at Amazon and Netflix. but instead of decide whether a show is good or bad, it is decided whether a person will be good or bad."</seg>
<seg id="1095">"mid-season television, 22 minutes, which can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse."</seg>
<seg id="1096">"unfortunately there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,"</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always creates the best results. this is not what a company like multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Also the data sealed companies are sometimes wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">"yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1100">"in 2009, Google announced that they can predict through data analysis outbreaks of flu, the narrowest species, predicted -- by data analysis of the Google research."</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderful and was a big message. success in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">"it worked flawless, year round year, until it suddenly did no longer work,"</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"it simply didn't work, this was once again a sensation, including the revocation of publication in the magazine" Nature. ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">"even the data is savvy companies like Amazon and Google misunderstand, sometimes."</seg>
<seg id="1106">"despite all of these errors, data flows in decisions of life - in the workplace, in the law enforcement, in medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1107">"so, we should rather make sure that data are helpful."</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-assisted genetics -- an area where some very smart people unimaginable many data to make serious decisions such as the decision for a cancer treatment</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I recognized some samples about the difference between successful decisions on the basis of data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">"if you have to solve a complex problem, you can mainly do two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">"as First, you attach this problem into its parts, so you can analyze the items; as second you put the items together to put an unlock."</seg>
<seg id="1112">"sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: apart and put together again."</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are just good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help create a problem and understand its parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to reset the parts again and then come to a discharge.</seg>
<seg id="1116">"for this, there is another tool and we have it all: our brain."</seg>
<seg id="1117">"when there is something in which the brain is good, it is parts and pieces to collapse again, even if the information is incomplete, especially when the brain is an expert."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"therefore, I believe that Netflix was so successful because they have used data and understanding, where they are also dedicated to the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"they use data to better understand their audience, why not otherwise they would have been capable of. but the decision how to put all these parts again and make it a show like" House of Cards "that did not stand in the data."</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show what meant that they entered a huge personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon however this did in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they used to control all their decisions, first when they were talking about television ideas then when they chose" "Alpha House". ""</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a safe decision because they could always say: "they tell us the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data are helpful for better decisions, but I believe that things go wrong when data will start running our decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and in order not to forget that this device is rather useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">"before there was data, this was the device for decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"it is also called" "Magic 8 Ball". "it is amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or no, you only need to shake the ball to get an answer." highly probable "-- exactly here at that moment."</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will later ask it later with a technical demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">"so far I met some decisions in my life, while I should have heard in the ball on the ball."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"but, as you know of course, if you want to have the data available, you would like to replace it through a bit of cladding, such as data analytics, in order to make better decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic building.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"so maybe the ball cleverer and wiser, and cleverer. ultimately it is up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right corner."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I feel this as a very encouraging message that in spite of the great amount of data still pays off, an expert in what you do is doing and risks."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"in the end, it is not the data but the risks, with which you end up at the right end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thanks beautiful.</seg>
