Munich 1856 : four maps showing your views to the city
a Ir@@ ren @-@ Anst@@ alt where young people should meet .
a Gru@@ ft@@ kap@@ elle where is now excav@@ ated for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small gar@@ den@@ ers manage the most common cause of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich is supporting exciting stories about days .
there is N@@ ER@@ VT if maps are not currently up @-@ to @-@ date .
&quot; this knows everyone who had to u@@ pri@@ ght , because the auto @-@ Nav@@ i takes place on a green meadow . &quot;
&quot; the historical maps of the digital Bavaria At@@ las@@ es , an offer of Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als of the State Government , everything else is up @-@ to @-@ date - but precisely very reve@@ aling . &quot;
especially when you compare them to the current online cards .
then the cities and communities in the spread @-@ area of the mun@@ ich Merk@@ ur have changed since the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria @-@ Atlas is a pat@@ ch@@ ures that can be seen as such .
&quot; a large over@@ postcard have been in detail for cities and communities in detail , so @-@ called Ur@@ positi@@ onal blades . &quot;
these were origin@@ ated according to the Bav@@ arian survey@@ ing administration between 18@@ 10 and 1864 and jump to the first survey of Bay@@ ers .
your Client : Napoleon .
the French army leaders occupied Bavaria since the spring 1800 during the Second coalition of war with Austria .
Napoleon took an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographic recording of Bavaria in order - of course for military purposes .
&quot; even if French troops picked up with the peace of L@@ UN@@ É@@ VILLE from 9 February 18@@ 01 , there were today &apos;s neighbours that created the idea of a surface @-@ capped Bavaria card . &quot;
&quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV . Joseph was driving the project ahead , founded the &quot; &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; &quot; - and thus the Bav@@ arian survey@@ ing administration . &quot;
the certificate &apos;s document dates back to Munich from the year 1856 and is like all other on the website of the Bay@@ erische Landes@@ bibliothek .
the comparison of Ear@@ lier / Today is the example of the state capital of the most impressive .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown up .
&quot; an example of this is sub@@ sen@@ dling , which appears in the map of 1856 relatively isolated . &quot;
&quot; Sen@@ dling was posted 21 years after creation of the map , so 1877 . &quot;
&quot; today , Sub@@ sen@@ dling is in the middle of the city . &quot;
&quot; the houses of Unter@@ sen@@ dl@@ ings focus on 1856 along today Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after 1878 after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ ans@@ er , a leader of the Bav@@ arian peasants against Austria 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where today the West@@ park is , you see nothing but fields - at first glance : with the hin@@ der lines and numbers : hand @-@ signed ads are derived from the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Ur@@ ges &quot; &quot; from which the basic tax was derived . &quot;
&quot; small plots do not show farmers there today , but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; land in Sun . &quot; &quot;
a large green space stands north of Unter@@ sen@@ dling .
&quot; the Ther@@ es@@ ien@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 locations of the Okto@@ ber@@ f@@ ests , was in fact a meadow - and no concrete bust . &quot;
on the other side of the Is@@ ar there is an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
&quot; in the Ur@@ positi@@ onal blatt , one reads in the area of today &apos;s Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , not only the street names &quot; &quot; at the Gast@@ eig &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; On the ventilation &quot; &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ fel@@ straße you once used people with mad@@ ness . &quot;
there was 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich circle @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anst@@ alt &quot; On the Au@@ er Lü@@ der .
&quot; from 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von G@@ ud@@ der led the furnishings - that psych@@ i@@ atr@@ ist who is associated with the death of King Ludwi@@ gs . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and ended for example the purchase of the so called Ir@@ ren . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , he is forbidden to apply violence against the passengers , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , Director of the Museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who is employed for an exhibition with the institution . &quot;
&quot; for 280 patients had first place , later was extended to 500 places . &quot;
&quot; some@@ time , this capacity is no longer used - the reason for the construction of the cir@@ cu@@ ren@@ anst@@ alt in hair 1905 . &quot;
&quot; since 2006 , the Is@@ ar @-@ Am@@ per Klin@@ t Munich @-@ East has been one of Germany &apos;s largest psych@@ i@@ atri@@ cal Germany since 2006 . &quot;
on the area of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt now meet young people in the Munich Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um .
the Order er@@ war@@ b the building complex 1920 and turned him into a youth with appren@@ tic@@ eship .
&quot; located west is the football field of the TS@@ V Munich East , east of the 1980s from the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 the children &apos;s house &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bosco &quot; &quot; - in architectural approach to the origins of Ir@@ ren@@ anst@@ alt , who had been destroyed during the Second World War at Bom@@ ben@@ ang@@ alt . &quot;
&quot; the Marien@@ platz was at 1856 as &quot; &quot; The main square &quot; , &quot; the department named &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a decisive change brought up the Second World War in the heart of Munich .
the bom@@ bs of the Al@@ lies ris@@ ings in December 1944 many holes in the city center .
a large remained until today - at the Marien@@ hof .
&quot; the English Institute , small business buildings and a Gru@@ ft@@ kap@@ elle from the Middle Ages were once again the Marien@@ hof , where this day work and on 5 April 2017 of the Sp@@ at@@ enst@@ ich for the second S @-@ Bahn platform . &quot;
&quot; with the sli@@ der , the old Munich card can be compared to the a@@ erial photograph of today - and fill the hole in the Marien@@ hof . &quot;
civil Group released Reis@@ ew@@ ar@@ age for Missouri
the National Association for promoting colored has issued a warning for colored people who are travelling to Missouri because of the discrimin@@ atory policy and the rac@@ ist attacks of the State to Missouri .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the federal state Missouri , which should enter into force until 28 August 2017 , calls for af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ aner , as a series of frag@@ mentary , r@@ acial re@@ cases occur in recent times throughout the state and here , &quot; says it in the opinion of the group . &quot;
&quot; a recently adopted law from Missouri , which makes people more difficult to gain discrimination , as well as the pro@@ secution of the state , the disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ate of minorities , the group , the rice no@@ bility , said the NA@@ AC@@ P . &quot;
they have violations of civil rights that happen people .
&quot; they are stopped because of their skin colour , they are mer@@ ged or killed , &quot; said the president of the Missouri NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , the K@@ ansas City Star . &quot;
&quot; we listen to complaints in such a frequency , which we have not yet heard . &quot;
it is the first such warning that has issued the organisation for a state in the US .
&quot; the Group quoted as r@@ acial re@@ bel against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee . &quot;
&quot; S@@ anders also died in the circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had taken no pet@@ rol during the journey through the state and was taken away from the police of Missouri in cust@@ ody without being accused of a crime . &quot;
&quot; the Council has also pointed to a recent announced report by the office of the General Office , in which it is shown that black drivers in the state are raised by 75 percent more common than wh@@ ites . &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and their families , friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri , &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot;
people need to be ready if there is no tension @-@ money or the relatives know that they are traveling through the state .
Missouri signed in 2015 100 Has@@ ak@@ ver@@ break after the latest figures from the Al @-@ Sp@@ icy Sp@@ ain@@ ment program of the F@@ BI that respect the state in relation to the number of such violations on the 16th scale of the country .
&quot; the rice is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult , a company for housing or employment discrimination . &quot;
&quot; previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union had published the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ LU ) , after the states adopted immigration legislation to commit people because of immigration policy , leading to the opinion of AC@@ LU for further seg@@ reg@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; rice ings are usually issued by the Ministry for other countries , but in recent times , stakeholders have employed the measure as a reaction to certain laws and trends within the US . &quot;
Wei@@ dez@@ v@@ project is elementary
the her@@ ed@@ acher Wei@@ dez@@ aun project is a success project and will continue in the coming year .
the CD@@ U @-@ Bun@@ dest@@ ag@@ it@@ ator Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac have given a picture on the ground .
&quot; at the rect@@ angle of the Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann family , representatives of the her@@ ed@@ acher CD@@ U @-@ Loc@@ ated together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members . &quot;
&quot; Markus Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann gave me an insight into his operation , in which he is 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of woods , 40 mil@@ king and also houses many k@@ ittens and also houses up in five apartments vacation guests . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Black @-@ milk &quot; &quot; is for him the ag@@ onal mark@@ eters for the milk of his cows , so Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
on the table of the holiday guests come exclusively with regional .
&quot; since he is also called B@@ LH@@ V Chairman of the fisher@@ man , he called the Wei@@ dez@@ v@@ project as &quot; elementary project . &quot; &quot;
I can not engage in such steep areas .
&quot; green spaces for a lot of work , much of it must be processed with the Motor@@ sense . &quot;
&quot; we have to fight here with the conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; said Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 he took over the par@@ ental operation and put this without chemical pl@@ anting protection and ferti@@ liz@@ ers , even if there is no bio @-@ operation . &quot;
&quot; for Mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; the Commun@@ e has recognised the importance of the Wei@@ rd project , and is pleased with the leader of the leader . &quot;
&quot; at the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hect@@ are , the farmer would have to be supported . &quot;
hope that the forest@@ ation of the areas could still be out for quite a while .
&quot; the biggest treasure that we have , are the people who work in agriculture and make thoughts about how they continue their operation , &quot; emphas@@ ised the Mayor . &quot;
the farmers are often due to promoting often in criticism
&quot; over the inc@@ under@@ ing promotion , a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced . &quot;
the disclosure surface is about 40 hectares which are not allowed until at least 2023 .
&quot; from the overall cost of 71 500 euros the half over Leader was promoted , a quarter carried the municipality of Fis@@ her@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; thus , the farmers remained 12 610 euros , they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of turn@@ key . &quot;
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; explained Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac stressed : &quot; you are doing a really good job , without farmers and farmer . &quot;
&quot; also for Peter white stood firm , &quot; &quot; here the best food is produced . &quot;
the Land@@ scape shooting range ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg allows the state to promote past@@ f@@ ences .
the goal is the reve@@ aling of the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald .
prerequis@@ ite is the presence of one of the L@@ PR clim@@ bers .
&quot; in addition , the expan@@ sion@@ ing area must not be slender . ( Hang@@ ing over 35 percent ) and must be threatened by forest@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; for the her@@ ed@@ acher Wei@@ dez@@ v@@ project 2018 it is currently running for eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build nearly 16 kilometers fence . &quot;
&quot; the disclosure surface corresponds 35 hectares , the calculated cost of over 112 000 euros . &quot;
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tru@@ mp is taking the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is it when they begin to att@@ ain the statues .
the Americans also appreciate these as any other - hence the careful overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos place in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tru@@ mp @-@ regime , surely knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heat dispute with Jim A@@ co@@ sta by CN@@ N on the proposals of the President to the dra@@ stic restriction of the legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to stay fair , Miller access not the statue itself . &quot;
a hor@@ de of boat owners and liberty @-@ im@@ it@@ ators should have suffered him if he had done it .
&quot; but he took hold of their importance , and in particular the meaning that it was written , when the famous poem of Emma Laz@@ arus 1903 , 17 years after completion of the monument was added . &quot;
&quot; as Miller A@@ co@@ sta , I will not go here to a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that the world illuminated . &quot;
the poem that you relate to which later was added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty .
&quot; Miller is obj@@ ectively true , but as he formed it himself , it is not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is about the contemporary reson@@ ance on the emerging words of Laz@@ arus , the only ones in which a state invites not just any old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : &quot; &quot; your poor , your poor , and your aff@@ lic@@ ed masses , who want to breathe free , to ex@@ hal@@ low off your rich co@@ asts . &quot;
&quot; there was never a time , in which the &quot; &quot; waste &quot; &quot; was better to see on our screen . &quot;
Miller did not join in liter@@ al criticism - he clearly made that these people are not welcome in Tru@@ mp@@ s USA .
this conflict due to the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural examination : it is in fact a conflict around the importance of America .
Laz@@ arus - and their friends who sat down to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they completed a high @-@ political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American rep@@ ublic@@ an@@ ism in an ab@@ used classical portra@@ yal of freedom @-@ em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom .
Laz@@ arus changed this meaning : in their poem the female figure is no more abstract - she has got a voice .
and she herself gives herself a very different name : mother of the ex@@ il@@ ant .
the combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist cou@@ p and a devast@@ ating attack on the American N@@ ati@@ vism .
&quot; and just like Laz@@ arus did the meaning of the statue changed , people from right wing wanted to change it for a long time . &quot;
&quot; the great cry of the Rush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a sort of John the Baptist for the coming of Tru@@ mp , argu@@ ed 2010 that the Statue of Liberty doesn &apos;t have one another , but rather an early Ne@@ o@@ conserv@@ atives that bring the American flame into the surrounding world : &quot; &quot; Lady Liberty goes forward . &quot;
it is supposed to bear the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch should not en@@ ligh@@ ten the way to the United States . &quot;
quite unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh here on a bit engraved .
the significance of the statue is quite and certainly a question of the point of perception .
&quot; the great imagin@@ ative action of Laz@@ arus insi@@ sted to see how they were seen by the exhaust@@ ive , mis@@ erable , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible trips on the de@@ cks of ships had been seen . &quot;
&quot; it is in the tru@@ est sense to see the world from the perspective of people , seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives . &quot;
her statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they must listen .
and this is of course not the perspective that Miller and Tru@@ mp ever want to recognize .
&quot; her tor@@ ch is not to en@@ ligh@@ ten the path , but the hatred , which is the only source of power . &quot;
World Championships 2017 : Neil Black lo@@ ises Scottish members of the team of Britain
E@@ ili@@ dh Do@@ yle is located at a time when only two Sc@@ ots belonged to the team of Britain
&quot; the performance of the Athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom , Neil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent of the World Championships &quot; will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 which will start Friday .
&quot; black believes that &quot; being developed something special in Scotland , &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it . &quot;
&quot; we welcome it , and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find it out , &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot;
&quot; I speak with people at the Scottish Institute of Sports , and think that it has something to do with what they have done . &quot;
the Scottish athletes think that it has something to do with what they have done .
British Athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type at the corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is it is absolutely brilliant .
&quot; several of the Scottish athletes , medals are medals , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - who will join Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m circuit while E@@ ili@@ dh Do@@ yle was elected by the team at the team of team . &quot;
&quot; E@@ ili@@ dh is quite modest .
&quot; your captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; says Black . &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot;
&quot; the passion and the genuine feeling , the E@@ ili@@ dh was quite natural , were great . &quot;
&quot; the Common@@ wealth of silver medals , which will compete with their fifth world champion@@ ships at 400 @-@ m hur@@ dles , says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 sho@@ ots are at the British crew . &quot;
&quot; Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 . &quot;
the Medi@@ c@@ er Mu@@ ir runs on this path and has set up five British and two European records last year .
&quot; it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m run@@ ners . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , the 1,500 m runs , is another car@@ rot , which you should be observed after a great season , which included the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games . &quot;
Do@@ yle is reminded of her first World Championship as the only other car@@ rot in Team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell .
&quot; the Mann@@ es chapters in says that they are &quot; very proud &quot; on the fact that many of their land@@ ers are not only part of the team , but in some cases the medals and the fin@@ alists . &quot;
&quot; what is special about the team of his team , is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honour for me but knowing that my team m@@ ates voted for me and have chosen to make me something special for me , &quot; she added . &quot;
&quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team . &quot;
it shows just how far we came .
&quot; and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to rise to po@@ e@@ dies . &quot;
what my speech is concerned about chapters ?
&quot; yes , I think she went well . &quot;
I have only pointed out that in this situation we are very happy since we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to put forward to this hom@@ eg@@ rap@@ ture and benefit from that we are back at the Olympiast@@ adion .
I get a second chance to go there and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there .
&quot; block critics on Facebook : do not ask for a public office , if you cannot toler@@ ate the heating of voters . &quot;
the Father of our country knew something of bad news .
&quot; the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him because of all , from internal policies to its political principles . &quot;
he imp@@ lied with criticism .
but he did not have his critics to silence .
&quot; for in 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; &quot; freedom of expression can be taken away - and , stupid , and m@@ ute we are led as the sheep to the s@@ laughter . &quot;
&quot; this brings me to Maryland to Gover@@ nor Larry H@@ og@@ an , who needs to work more like Washington . &quot;
Ho@@ gans employees have been blocked by the contributions of at least 450 people and have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union de@@ pl@@ ened him at the beginning of this week .
&quot; the rod of the Gover@@ nor did the law@@ suit as fri@@ v@@ ol , and the online comment was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is only Facebook , &quot; said many people . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is particularly important when it is a guy like H@@ og@@ an .
this is a rep@@ ubli@@ can Gover@@ nor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazing .
he has the two @-@ highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a reactionary heat @-@ head .
he showed a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict compliance with the principles .
he was also very sent to use Facebook as a pri@@ ma@@ iden means to connect with his elect@@ ors and play his ha@@ ired head to chemotherapy on his side .
&quot; therefore , the block@@ ing of persons coming to the site of the Gover@@ nor - which is a public forum that is officially referred to as officially and by employees working with public tax dollars - need@@ less and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gans spokes@@ person Amel@@ ia Ch@@ asse the actions of the Gover@@ nor and argu@@ ed that the comments of the comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; but it is too easy to use the image of con@@ ciliation , or sp@@ amm@@ ers or h@@ asser@@ tive people , which vibr@@ ate online the wh@@ ip . &quot;
the post spoke to some of the real people that were blocked from H@@ og@@ an .
&quot; and these are just real people who speak with their chosen leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a priest , no Tro@@ l@@ le . &quot;
&quot; they all said that their comments are respect@@ ful , thought@@ ful and not prof@@ ane . &quot;
the pastor z@@ iti@@ zed the Bible in his post and app@@ endi@@ ces to Ho@@ gans ca@@ tho@@ lic faith .
&quot; lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani from Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not crowded , but she asked to break down . &quot;
&quot; I commented that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate relationship and other latest news , &quot; wrote in the comment section of the message &quot; The Post . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea if a number of people on the same subject takes position , then it is more likely to be used as a so @-@ called coll@@ ectiv@@ ist use and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
what the employees of the Gover@@ nor is called &quot; focused Spam @-@ attack &quot; would most likely call &quot; inter@@ ces@@ sion . &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocked a cr@@ itic or a negative comment .
it is much more clean@@ er than in past time when you have done the same that employees were sent to collect newspapers with critical tails and to burn prot@@ esters or to keep prot@@ esters .
but just this just happens digital .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public official that he critic@@ ised for it on Facebook and other social media .
President Tru@@ mp is em@@ ented by Twitter users that were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question was last week in Virginia .
&quot; the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County is the last the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. district , James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when she met a voters of her Facebook page . &quot;
and in K@@ entu@@ cky he received Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) a visit from the AC@@ LU because of its use on Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so hard .
&quot; at the time of Wash@@ ing@@ tons , the time of affordable porn had a similar effect as the Internet . &quot;
&quot; the number of newspapers multip@@ lies between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letters hit his guidance . &quot;
and even at that time Washington anonymous tro@@ ll@@ s at that time .
&quot; the people , the pseud@@ ony@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Valeri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote all the letters of newspapers , the Washington &apos;s decisions made . &quot;
&quot; pet@@ itions that have collected his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and boat trip with Britain , according to the historical documents , collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project . &quot;
but he has not brought them to silence .
&quot; speech , freedom of speech and classes are the foundation of our nation . &quot;
and true leadership means that to accept .

former Europeans no . 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for the next three days on domestic comfort since the Renaissance Club in East Lot@@ hi@@ an hosts the issue of the Scottish Senior Open .

&quot; I have not def@@ ended the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open as it was in the year , after I had won them out of the program . &quot;
back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; the memories from the last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on , last year here . &quot;
it was a really special time and one which we always appreciated .
Gary Or@@ r who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50@@ th birthday coming back to the European Senior Tour .
this event will be his first Scottish performance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; &quot; said Or@@ r , the man of Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this additional pressure . &quot;
I really enjoyed playing it again and I played a solid golf .
I am glad how far it has gone .
&quot; with the trio at the field , the former Masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam , and Senior Major Champions Paul Broad@@ ra@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ ulty . &quot;
&quot; Or@@ r and the former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ rance are among the six sho@@ ots in the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Al@@ lies , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dru@@ m@@ mond . &quot;
&quot; entrance is free , the parking lot will cost £ 5 per car with a occup@@ ants and £ 10 per car with two or more occup@@ ants . &quot;
all proce@@ eds go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less lung in Passi@@ ve
in the past two decades less people died in the lung cancer in the past two decades .
this result is the scientists at the University of Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ ke ) in a study .
&quot; according to our estimates a year of 167 lung , due to Passi@@ v@@ smoke , &quot; &quot; said study der@@ ko m@@ ug . &quot;
&quot; as a comparison , he moved his own study on the subject of 1994 . &quot;
&quot; at that time , there were still 400 lung cancer due to Passi@@ v@@ smoking a year in Germany . &quot;
the new study is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
sli@@ ppers prove to be very complex
&quot; the building work in the Vill@@ inger street are in full swing and &quot; &quot; half@@ way in time &quot; , &quot; thus the head of the building Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the household , the situation is more complicated than suspected , because there is much more betra@@ yed in the bottom of the plans . &quot;
&quot; the traffic , which is over and over again the building work , represents a big problem for the Bau@@ tru@@ pp of the company St@@ ump@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the ignorance of the motor@@ ists in front of red lights and lock@@ out is already huge , &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot;
the road is closed and only the bus buses were justified .
&quot; Angelo Car@@ uso , Marvin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from the company St@@ ump@@ p have been busy for weeks with the work on the bridge . &quot;
&quot; the hot days were very nice ti@@ ring .
&quot; but fortunately , we were told by our friend Fritz Matt with cooler mineral water , &quot; &quot; tells Marvin Ko@@ stor@@ z . &quot;
poverty and death in the Indon@@ esian Gol@@ dland
if Bar@@ dina &apos;s Deg@@ ei took the dinner they did not use a stove .
it is used even rarely a pot .
&quot; in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ ent@@ ele in the un@@ quiet ind@@ on@@ esian province of Papua , the house@@ wife usually places a Sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; &quot; - right in the fireplace . &quot;
&quot; after half an hour the cro@@ oked tu@@ bers is taken with di@@ lig@@ ently , un@@ washed hands and sle@@ epy . &quot;
&quot; Deg@@ ei s@@ its on the lo@@ am - it has no furniture - where they perform their daily work , such as dresses with cloudy water from the nearby sw@@ amp . &quot;
a bu@@ cket is used in a hom@@ eless space as lat@@ rine .
the youngest of the four wives of her husband were not assigned to their fields .
poly@@ gam@@ y is here common .
&quot; of course , late to work is dangerous : most vill@@ men are un@@ employed , and many drink heavily , and there are the soldiers . &quot;
&quot; no one dar@@ es to go in the village at 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into the daily life in the highlands of Papua , a former Dutch colony that was recorded in 1969 after a controversi@@ al referendum in Indonesia than just 1,0@@ 26 el@@ der prior to the occup@@ ying forces . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement focusing on independence against the Dutch rule , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , who under@@ mines control over the region and ex@@ clude foreign journalists or legal guar@@ ded . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 the province officially launched in Papua and West Papua , whereby the independent part of Papua New Guinea was involved in the eastern part of the island . &quot;
&quot; En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as secluded as it is o@@ iled . the journey includes a 90 minute flight from the province capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura , to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the car . &quot;
there are no public transport .
&quot; the city with approximately 19.@@ 000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses , that are surrounded by bam@@ boo ro@@ oft@@ ops , and from cor@@ rug@@ ated roofs that have been converted by rust in various gel@@ brown tones . &quot;
only very few Indon@@ es@@ ians have made their journey here because journalists and practically no foreigners .

there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wear these clothing , &quot; says Deg@@ ei and points to her alive , handmade Tur@@ ban , you dar@@ ker shirt and her bright rock . &quot;
&quot; earlier we had only leaves on our bodies . &quot;
Papua is Indon@@ esi@@ poorest province where 28 % of men living under the poverty border and have some of the worst leg@@ ality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indon@@ esi@@ as Gol@@ dland .
&quot; the biggest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high @-@ country skiing area in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , Fre@@ ep@@ ort is built in the value of 3,@@ 1 billion US dollars gold and copper . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Papua with wood resources has a value of estimated 78 billion US dollars . &quot;
&quot; however , these ri@@ ches are a source of misery for the Papua that ensure that Indon@@ esi@@ as are powerful as a former presence . &quot;
&quot; an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort will count local mil@@ iti@@ ques and units between 1998 and 2004 nearly 20 million US dollars , among them up to 150,000 US dollars a single officer . &quot;
Pap@@ ic demands for greater autonomy and thre@@ aten these golden g@@ ans and are mer@@ cil@@ essly treated .
&quot; according to activists , more than 500,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed since 1969 by the Indon@@ esian military , tort@@ ured and det@@ ained . &quot;
mass@@ ages in Pap@@ u@@ as reg@@ es@@ hoch@@ land in 1970 @-@ he became in accordance with the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission for genocide .
&quot; alone in the region , the Indon@@ esian police last year more than 3.@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; we commerci@@ alize it in a report by the Erz@@ di@@ oc@@ ese Brisbane from year 2016 , in the reports about atro@@ cities of the previous year , such as un@@ law@@ ns and torture - rape and electrical attacks are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal precip@@ itation of peaceful demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims as every week it happen , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researchers for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; the screws are reinforced , since Pap@@ u@@ as resources will bring a influ@@ x of settl@@ ers from other parts of Indonesia . &quot;
&quot; the population of 3,5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % christ@@ ally , but the demo@@ graphic development is changing since Muslim economic migrants are coming from the pop@@ ulous islands Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ aw@@ esi . &quot;

&quot; the Indon@@ esian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , in the crowd and as Jok@@ ow@@ i , spoke during his election campaign in 2014 the ine@@ qualities and the infr@@ ing@@ ement in Papua . &quot;
the former car@@ penter su@@ erte 27 of the total 29 areas of Papua including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the Presidential Palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Papua has little changes and today the locals feel che@@ ated .
&quot; our hearts are broken because we have voted in 2014 for Jok@@ ow@@ i , with the expect@@ ation that he will fulfil our hopes that justice is re@@ established , &quot; says You . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is Initi@@ ation in October a deep point . &quot;
&quot; on 7 December 2014 a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas songs in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indon@@ esian soldiers jour@@ ne@@ yed by the darkness . &quot;
the fright@@ ened children told them that they should turn their head@@ lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers took an imp@@ etus to her tone , and later came back with four soldiers , the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers who had dr@@ unk , h@@ unted , and sm@@ ote the group with their ro@@ bes , said sacrifice and witnesses . &quot;
then one of the soldiers in the group of children .
&quot; a child , the 16 @-@ year old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so hard struck that he fell into coma . &quot;
a few hours later the building of the nearby government Commission was set up in Brand and put things on the next day .
&quot; about 1,000 young Papua men , women and children gathered themselves on a football ground in front of the local police station and the military al@@ mond center to call justice . &quot;
they carried out cerem@@ onial in@@ spec@@ tions and led the Wa@@ ita @-@ dance - in the circle and a Vogel@@ s@@ ang im@@ itable - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe .
some prot@@ esters began stones on polish and military posts .
&quot; when the atmosphere was heated , the soldiers was sent a command of an internal funk : &quot; &quot; if the masses had more than three times resistance , they shoot them dead , &quot; it means that it was not released in an official document of TIME , which was not released by the local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , director of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ Vier@@ t@@ els of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the dro@@ pping danger and called for rest and called the crowd to return home . &quot;
nobody was to listen to the mood .
&quot; when I turned , I was suddenly shot in my left wr@@ ist wr@@ ist , &quot; &quot; he pointed out at the porch of his colorful wooden house . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ ame does not still know who has folded , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered . &quot;
&quot; it was over@@ crowded , many shots were fil@@ tered , &quot; adds . &quot;
&quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin , the witness of aston@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; I ran to him and investigate his body to make sure he was , &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who like many Indon@@ es@@ ians only bear a name , the TIME in ble@@ ak mood . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I have kis@@ sed it .
&quot; the cheer@@ spec@@ tor of the Papua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said Rep@@ or@@ ters that his officers would only secure their stop , because they become attacked . &quot;
&quot; we must defend ourselves if people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Papua police , Commissioner Pud@@ jo Su@@ li@@ sti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young prot@@ esters were killed and many more wo@@ unded . &quot;
the news about the k@@ ill@@ ings were only fil@@ tered on the following day &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
&quot; three weeks he held Jok@@ ow@@ i in Jay@@ ap@@ ura , a passionate speech , in which he vo@@ iced sympath@@ ies for the families of the victims and sw@@ am , the historical ab@@ ilia in Papua . &quot;
&quot; I want this case immediately , so that in the future it will no longer happen &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot;
security Minister Wir@@ anto told in October 2016 that he had an extra @-@ judi@@ cial mechanism of the En@@ closure of historical human rights violations .
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; most inj@@ uries have been performed a long time ago .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ er years .
&quot; the point is that we are obliged to approach these violations , but there are processes that need to go through , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; when he made a retreat when he spoke on June 5th in Jak@@ arta with TIME and said , he did not have any plans to set up in Papua . &quot;
&quot; instead , everything is defined by law , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; Wir@@ anto , who was indic@@ ted by the UN because of &quot; crimes against humanity , &quot; the more than 1,000 deaths in East tim@@ ors , said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Papua have already been consult@@ ed , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims were contrary to such claims with fier@@ y dis@@ believers .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed in the last three years , but there was no progress in recent three years , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear .
&quot; I am afraid , &quot; says he . &quot;
&quot; I am afraid to become arrested by the military , I fear to be shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repet@@ itive the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
&quot; he says that he was be@@ aten by the military after he helped , buried four of the victims . &quot;
&quot; after I buried the corp@@ ses , he sought the military to me , &quot; he says . &quot;
the sk@@ e@@ wers have not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indon@@ esian police on vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighbourhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
&quot; during a confrontation between the village inhabitants and the manager of a Bau@@ firm , which refused to bring an unconscious man to the hospital , died a person and 17 others were in@@ ju@@ red , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , the 24 @-@ year old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was dr@@ unk when he conf@@ isc@@ ated in a nearby river , died on the way to hospital . &quot;
infl@@ ated vill@@ agers prot@@ ested in front of the company office .
&quot; the police said that the vill@@ agers had stones upon officers , who re@@ acted on them by filling warnings . &quot;
but locals say that the mobile brig@@ ade ( Indon@@ esian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot and kill a kill .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that it will give reven@@ ge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Badi@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witness , as the last here were introduced quickly , so the TIME . &quot;
&quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called to withdraw the officers involved and withdraw the mobile brig@@ ade of police from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an un@@ ru@@ de for the Indon@@ esian government .
&quot; the lack of sensu@@ al development strength@@ ens the dis@@ satisfaction of the tri@@ bes@@ men &apos;s oceans , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and Dam@@ al , which live in the green highlands of Papua . &quot;
&quot; many closed the &quot; Free Papua movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the re@@ bel army , which claims to defend the rights of Papua by putting spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and ab@@ duc@@ tions of Indon@@ esian soldiers . &quot;
&quot; some of the top @-@ O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das K@@ og@@ o@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; in response to the last few years , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were arrested and arbitr@@ ary in cust@@ ody , under the pre@@ text of &quot; sec@@ uring national sovereignty . &quot; &quot;
some dive never again .
&quot; among the people in Papua Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as a trag@@ ic , forgotten town . &quot;
poverty strength@@ ens the dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice that is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is for locals too expensive .
bread is as well as range .
people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women that can work with four or five fields of fresh potato .
they keep most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
&quot; ten pieces of not@@ a precious only 10,000 Indon@@ esian Rup@@ iah ( 75 C@@ ents ) . &quot;
&quot; over time , economic inequality between the native Papua and the new migrants are grown up since opening new routes to the airport of Nab@@ ire in larger numbers . &quot;
&quot; the few jobs that are in the region , usually go to the better educated and aff@@ lu@@ ent migrants . &quot;
Papua rarely has the capital or necessary skills to make their own companies competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John G@@ ob@@ ai , the Chairman of the headquarters of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot;
isolation stops the eyes of the world from Papua .
&quot; in addition , restrictions of the coverage of international media are tense . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , the French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ die and Basi@@ l@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were prepared for lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua , despite them the rare permission to run . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ in K@@ ine , the dep@@ uty Asia @-@ Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is campaigns , the limitations of the reporting to raise transparency and development , not realised . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists who try to report from Indon@@ esi@@ as peac@@ eless provinces of Papua and West@@ pap@@ ua . visa den@@ ial and a black list , &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot;
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indon@@ esian government has largely limited to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
&quot; in March six paci@@ fish states - Tong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Sal@@ om@@ ons Islands - the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widely used inj@@ uries &quot; in Papua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai Sch@@ mitt@@ erei . &quot;
the same countries have historically been the O@@ PM .
&quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indon@@ esian Foreign Minister Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r pointed out the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there is free media so it is difficult to waste the evidence of human rights . &quot;
local governments want to know more foreign governments to know this .
&quot; as an official delegation from the Netherlands , headed by the human right @-@ bot@@ ters K@@ ees Van B@@ aar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura began on 4 May , they removed their silence and troubled him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the meeting , but remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia has a further presidential election , but the Papua say that they are likely to be right again for Jok@@ ow@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a person who has good intentions , but it is surrounded by people who are involved in the pan@@ i@@ ai jack@@ ers , &quot; says G@@ ob@@ ai , the chairman of the trunk Council . &quot;
&quot; he wants that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from that it is under the constant threat of a r@@ ussi@@ an army , is located in arm@@ rest and health services . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Papua , their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; gu@@ ilt &quot; must be paid back . &quot;
&quot; they do not need money , they just want justice &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; despite the threats and inti@@ mid@@ ations , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Sch@@ uss@@ ants led a last symbolic act of the Des@@ p@@ ite : the body of a victim was buried in a complex against the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they know that they might never come to justice , but at least let those responsible have not forgotten their crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with soci@@ etal head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; skyscrap@@ ers from Dubai for the second time
&quot; a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest residential towers of the world in Dubai , his transit and forced hundreds of inhabitants , from the 3@@ 37 meters high , 79 @-@ sto@@ rey building . &quot;
&quot; it is the second brand , which takes place in just two years by the skyscrap@@ er , which is called the Tor@@ ch @-@ Tower ( tor@@ ch @-@ tower ) . &quot;
&quot; the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , inj@@ uries were not reported , and there was no direct word on the cause of the flame . &quot;
&quot; we slept , and we are at the fire of fire and at the cry of the people . &quot;
&quot; we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50@@ th floor to the bottom , told a resident that his name as George ang@@ ab , Reu@@ ters . &quot;
Dubai &apos;s civil protection authorities said that the units of the fire fighting against 4.00 p.m. local time ( 0@@ 0.00 GMT ) the fire extingu@@ ished and the building cooler .
&quot; the government said , she is working on providing accommodation for those affected . &quot;
&quot; the incident can be asked questions about the safety of materials , which are used in outer areas of skyscrap@@ ers all over the world . &quot;
&quot; an examination by the management of the Tor@@ ch @-@ building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the largest part of the damage is from the disgu@@ ise , the outer covering for decoration or insulation . &quot;
&quot; in the UK the police , they believe that the system of plates to isol@@ ate and disgu@@ ise on the London Gren@@ ade Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid expansion of a Bran@@ des in which about 80 people died . &quot;
no Davis Cup Reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International tennis court ( IT@@ F ) is through his great Davis Cup Cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
&quot; at the meeting in Ho @-@ Chi @-@ Min@@ h City , the Commission was only supported for this sport @-@ revolutionary proposal , Davis Cup single only on two winners , hau@@ ch@@ thin not supported by the necessary two @-@ third majority . &quot;
&quot; although often very long , but it is also very estimated five @-@ sentence classics remain to the traditional accompl@@ ish . &quot;
&quot; 6@@ 3,@@ 54 percent of member countries voted for reform , the aim of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only lacking . &quot;
&quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members are not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot;
&quot; we need a change to secure the long term future of these ik@@ onic and historical cont@@ ests , &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot;
we will continue to work on this .
&quot; at all , it was not only a vote before the vote had already come to a neutral place before the final . &quot;
new from 2018 are only compar@@ atively minor details : thus the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will be in the first round the host law in the first round .
&quot; to reduce the costs of organis@@ er , the requirements will be facilit@@ ated in terms of training data , etc . and players will need to pass on the Davis Cup less official media dates . &quot;
&quot; more than 1 out of 5 US trav@@ eler brings back objects into the air@@ plane , a survey &quot;
&quot; a survey conducted in flight passengers revealed that more than 20 percent are aware or un@@ aware of the control points of U.S. Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent that bet@@ ray the aircraft while they acci@@ dentally bore blades or other items with blades . &quot;
&quot; less than 1 per cent asser@@ ted , they would have been del@@ ayed , that they have traveled up with sliding ons , am@@ mun@@ ition or explo@@ sives . &quot;
&quot; the survey with more than 1,000 persons - that was conducted by a jet char@@ ter@@ service , the Strat@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , performed - also noted that younger travellers are more ab@@ sent to the rules . &quot;
&quot; by respon@@ dents , the enco@@ res that they are know@@ ingly temp@@ ted to fly with something that was prohibited by the T@@ SA were 19.@@ 7 percent Mill@@ enni@@ als , compared with less than 15 percent , the members of the generation X were . &quot;
&quot; the most common objects , which were inten@@ tionally designed to T@@ SA agents , foods and liquids . &quot;
&quot; more than 3 per cent gave , know@@ ingly objects with blades are carried by the safety control , while 2,@@ 2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.7 percent of the male respon@@ dents also confirmed that they are inten@@ tional drugs down into the plane . &quot;
&quot; the company said , I have asked travelers throughout the country to find out how many reconc@@ iles sm@@ ug@@ ged sm@@ ug@@ es by the airport security , and how many it would have done . &quot;
&quot; it is not a surprise that people who most often fly sm@@ ug@@ g@@ ware - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - through safety , those were most commonly flying . &quot;
&quot; however , the company suggests that the T@@ SA guidelines are a bit complicated and confusing . &quot;
people are often uns@@ ure which liquids may take them or how much of them .
so it is not a surprise that the largest quantity of the T@@ SA are conf@@ isc@@ ated objects .
&quot; for a period of time the people , the T@@ SA could see books as sm@@ ug@@ g@@ ware . &quot;
flu@@ ids are allowed on domestic flights but not on international flights .
&quot; El@@ on Mus@@ k , it is no matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la @-@ Customer . &quot;
&quot; Electr@@ on Mus@@ k @-@ Tr@@ on Mus@@ k , a huge number of pre@@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 &quot; . &quot; &quot;
yet he has now under@@ lined that some of the customers have already with@@ drawn their non @-@ binding reservation again .
&quot; in addition to the always tri@@ ump@@ ed figures about sales , Tes@@ la @-@ chief El@@ on Mus@@ k has first betra@@ yed a different , less smooth number : the cancellation of the new mass market model . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ k had often endor@@ sed with the more than 500,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car in the past few months . &quot;
&quot; now Mus@@ k : from the total of 5@@ 18.@@ 000 pre @-@ orders are 6@@ 3,000 has been with@@ drawn again . &quot;
critics have always pointed out that there is only a non @-@ binding reservations .
&quot; during a cancellation , Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the US 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds ) . &quot;
&quot; currently , 45@@ 5.000 of such non @-@ binding reservations are currently available in a telephone conference . &quot;
&quot; if the cancellation of so far has been around twelve per cent of all orders to be a problem , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe . &quot;
&quot; his argument : the challenge with the ambitious growth aim is not in demand , but on the production side . &quot;
&quot; in the past year , Tes@@ la 8@@ 4,000 vehicles delivered . &quot;
&quot; 2018 should it - all models put together - 50@@ 0.000 , 2020 a million . &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k there are currently a day 1800 reservations on this occasion .
&quot; if Tes@@ la has ordered a &quot; &quot; Model 3 &quot; &quot; at the ear@@ liest , in the second half of 2018 by delivery - if Tes@@ la creates its brand new ones , never in the practice tested production streets without larger inter@@ rup@@ tions with maximum load . &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
&quot; but it comes to bigger del@@ ays , then the non @-@ binding of the reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la . &quot;
&quot; for then , the company can not go on un@@ satisfied customers in crowds . &quot;
&quot; EPA boss Pru@@ itt moved to reducing the rules of Obama &apos;s rules to reduce emissions
&quot; one day after having had ended by 15 states , Scott Pru@@ itt , the head of the environmental protection authorities , his former decision returns to reduce the implementation of the rules of Obama &apos;s era to reduce emissions smo@@ g . &quot;
Pru@@ itt presented the change when his agency proved to be the needs of state environmental authorities as opposed to current administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the law@@ suit that was raised against its previous place in a federal state .
&quot; it is about a deadline , which ran on 1 October for states to keep the standards of 2015 for ground @-@ time o@@ zone . &quot;
&quot; Pru@@ itt announced in June that he will release the compliance with a year to study their authority and to avoid taking care of in local decisions , or to disability economic growth . &quot;
&quot; Pru@@ itt , who was in front of his appointment by President Donald Tru@@ mp Pro@@ secutor of Okl@@ ah@@ oma , has long been a reliable opponent of demanding environmental protection regulations . &quot;
&quot; since its arrival in Washington it is Pru@@ itt repeatedly over@@ thrown , block or del@@ aying the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels . &quot;
the sudden conversion from Wednesday is the most recent legal set@@ back for the Pru@@ cal regular wheel@@ back agenda .
&quot; last month a federal court in Washington decided that the EPA @-@ administ@@ rators has passed his authority as he tried to undertake the implementation of a rule of Obama administration , the oil and gas companies for monitoring and reducing meth@@ ane management . &quot;
&quot; in one on the Wednesday night , Pru@@ itt suggested that his can@@ st@@ ice st@@ ice at Oz@@ on@@ standards simply simply put forward the willingness of EPA to cooperate with the countries through the complex process of timely ful@@ fill@@ ment of new standards . &quot;
&quot; under previous administr@@ ations , EPA often has not met the dead@@ lines for conduc@@ ting and then waiting to be indic@@ ted by activists and others , and in an agreement reached the appointment for the implementation , &quot; said Pru@@ itt , who compl@@ ained the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in regulation by trial , and we take dead@@ lines seriously . &quot;
we also accept the law and authority that gives us serious .

Association wants to check approval from Wind@@ wheels
Bo@@ is@@ heim wo@@ unds &quot; does not see legal requirements for the construction and has therefore applied to the Council .
&quot; the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; has been called &quot; Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) , to reg@@ ain his approval for the establishment of planned wind turbin@@ es in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette . &quot;
it is illegal .
&quot; the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 at Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette no wind turbin@@ es could have been approved , as at the time in Vier@@ sen just exist on the boundary line to the Schwal@@ m@@ tal @-@ concentration camp . &quot;
&quot; within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbin@@ es basically possible , at the same time causes the concentr@@ ations of wind @-@ development for the rest of the city area . &quot;
der@@ lei zones are intended to prevent a &quot; saving &quot; of the landscape .
the town of Vier@@ sen had a few days before due to a change in the use of a second wind turbin@@ es in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette - but the district of Düsseldorf did not have approved because of a form of form .
&quot; due to the lack of planning legal requirements , the author@@ itative per@@ missions is still illegal , and therefore said again , &quot; said Christopher Erk@@ ens , Chairman of &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot;
current state of affairs : the city of the city joined the wind @-@ concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette ; a approval of the district council is still standing .
&quot; col@@ ens : &quot; thus , in this place the issu@@ ance of a permit for the construction of wind turbin@@ es are not excluded . &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the challenge .
&quot; the corresponding writing has been made since last week of the district Vier@@ sen , &quot; declared a spokes@@ man . &quot;
the circle takes her to the occasion to check the matter again .
they do not likely to lead the procedure is stopped .
&quot; with a view to the ongoing trial in the Board of Directors , the district on Thursday is not allowed in content to the argum@@ entation of the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , is planning an area on the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette construction of four per 200 meters high wind wheels . &quot;
&quot; in the past year the company had the company in which the city was indirectly involved , pas@@ sports agreements with the owner of about 65 hectares of large ground . &quot;
&quot; with the construction of the four wind turbin@@ es , the electricity needs to be covered by around 11 400 households - this is equivalent to approximately one @-@ fifth of the electricity generation of all quarters . &quot;
the NEW Re wants to invest around 20 million euros .
in the last summer Vier@@ sen Stad@@ sen joined the green light for the purchase of three wind turbin@@ es at Aachen and a stake in a wind turbin@@ es in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district Hein@@ sberg .
car and tractor trucks together : woman dies at terrible accident
one horri@@ ble traffic accident has occurred on the Friday morning at 10 am on the L 333 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bog@@ el ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn district ) .
a woman was in@@ ju@@ red here .
two more people were slightly viol@@ ated .

city and dealers plan &quot; Home &quot; Sp@@ ych@@ owo
bad Langen@@ sal@@ za@@ he and people from the region are to discover the shopping opportunities in the city in September .
the Gewer@@ bever@@ ein and the city administration want to use the weekend on 8th and 9th of September to attract the inhabitants into the shopping center .
&quot; as the Chairman of the Gewer@@ bever@@ ein , Christian King , than@@ ked the &quot; &quot; home &quot; &quot; weekend to raise the customers for this which offers the own city away from the usual supermarket commodity . &quot;
&quot; as planned , there is a market with regional suppliers , similar to the weekly market . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the companies are to present themselves with their appren@@ tic@@ eship . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the shops of the city centre are to shop &quot; &quot; midnight shopping &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the action does not only exist on the inhabitants of the city and the nearby region . &quot;
&quot; in preparation , commerci@@ als in the radio , an internet video and printed bag , indicate the action weekend , so Christian King . &quot;
city administration and workshop is co @-@ operation with the industrial and Chamber of Commerce .
&quot; thus , the Gewer@@ bever@@ ein goes down and the city into another stage of the project &quot; &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive city center . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these include new offers as the first &quot; &quot; active day &quot; &quot; to the Brun@@ nen@@ fest with the sold @-@ in Sunday , conversations with all the busin@@ ess@@ men and hosts to move them to active participation . &quot;
attractive offers for Saturday and delay on parking charges on this day are part of the concept .
&quot; furthermore , customer potential should be new or opened again . &quot;
among these include tourist guests and tourists .
&quot; but also many locals had lost the city downtown , shopping from the ga@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; at the end they would have to contribute to the city downtown - up to land@@ lords , the factories around the whole city and clubs . &quot;
&quot; managed to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network that did partly spread , king in spring had said . &quot;
&quot; Bir@@ git Stre@@ ich , Head of the I@@ HK @-@ Center in Mühl@@ hausen divided the third &quot; &quot; home shopping &quot; &quot; day , for the first time five Thur@@ ing@@ ian cities . &quot;
&quot; besides Bad Langen@@ sal@@ za , this is Wei@@ mar , S@@ ö@@ m@@ mer@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ er@@ ode . &quot;
&quot; the day sol@@ le &quot; for the esteem of local trade , and its significance for the common good of our cities is stronger , &quot; I said . &quot;
&quot; the promotion under the spring @-@ management of the I@@ HK and with many partners make it clear that every citizen can be influenced by its department , directly on the environment itself . &quot;

Tru@@ mp put forward to the tran@@ scri@@ bed tran@@ scription by phone call Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the border walls
tran@@ scription by phone call by phone @-@ President Donald Tru@@ mp and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
&quot; on 27 January , Tru@@ mp requested a call on a phone with the Mexican President En@@ rique Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to to be publicly proclaimed that he would not pay for a planned boundary walls . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. President accused him because he had denied the wall publicly , he said to him , &quot; &quot; You can not say the press . &quot;
Tru@@ mp launched its presidential campaign with the promise to er@@ ect on the southern border of the US a wall and vibr@@ ates Mexico for the project .
tran@@ scrip@@ tions of his first inc@@ eption with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and un@@ veil@@ ed a tense exchange .
&quot; Mr. Tru@@ mp said Mr. Turn@@ bull that a trading for the USA refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia , &quot; &quot; Wit@@ ness &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; and that the stocks of Obama would like to look like a &quot; &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; &quot; after he proposed a ban of re@@ formation of refugees into the US . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Tru@@ mp ended the call , after he had said Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; this is the most uncomfortable call for the whole day . &quot;
Moo@@ res Ford @-@ mass@@ acre : activists lead rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ akt as a call for justice again
&quot; a 1948 @-@ he Ford Mercury went through a group of spect@@ ators in rural Mon@@ roe , Georgia , and ru@@ mp@@ ed to the Ford @-@ Bridge of Moore . &quot;
&quot; before the car , the four black passengers and a white driver had to reach the bridge , a group of white men came forth to block its path . &quot;
the leader of the mo@@ bs - a man middle age in a con@@ i@@ fers campaign - took a long pull on his c@@ ig@@ ar and looked upon by the wind@@ shield .
inside the occup@@ ants are in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; the man . &quot;
&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot;
&quot; scre@@ ams the silence , as a young black man from the passenger seat . &quot;
&quot; luck@@ ily this horri@@ ble scene , which was played on 22 July , only a post @-@ position . &quot;
&quot; but if a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; , &quot; put nearly all in the audience very real sig@@ h . &quot;
since 2005 civil rights to Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge returned to im@@ itate the night in the two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com and George and Ma@@ e Murray Dor@@ sey - came from K@@ u Kl@@ ux Kl@@ an in 1946 .
nobody was ever charged with the mor@@ als .
&quot; it is truly in@@ concei@@ vable that in all these years it was not a single person arrested - although we see them in our churches , even though we know who they are , &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Brooks , who helps the organisation of re@@ position . &quot;
&quot; it is a dirt stain on a story , but it is a burden to our souls . &quot;
Brooks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former con@@ gresses of the State of Georgia and a life of citizen rights .
&quot; it serves as a dramatic call for him to act as a dramatic call for action , and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ roe Community that has never been fixed . &quot;
&quot; we want pro@@ secution , we want to end up , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must receive justice , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; we cannot achieve healing and reconciliation , until we maintain justice . &quot;
a Court of Justice puts a sc@@ arf on the corp@@ se of one of the victims of Moore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ie on 27 July 1946 .
&quot; according to F@@ BI Act , which were obtained from N@@ BC News , more than 50 men were suspected of Mon@@ roe and the surrounding Graf@@ ships in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process . &quot;
but no one has ever been charged .
&quot; although the susp@@ ects have been on an open foot for decades to say civil rights , that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions in the whole city was always known : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 , a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice had made the black citizens in Georgia for the first time , in the summer time in the summer . &quot;
&quot; about at the same time as choosing the F@@ BI of the black Far@@ mp@@ et Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a struggle - supp@@ osedly due to a woman . &quot;
&quot; Brooks , the ru@@ mor of the city has been that h@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby , which carried her , not from her husband . &quot;
&quot; on 25 July 1946 Lo@@ y Harrison , a prominent land@@ owners , 600 dollars , to liber@@ ate Mal@@ com from the prison , so the F@@ BI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Murray and George Dor@@ sey to the prison .
&quot; but when they removed from the prison and get to the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b the car . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , it was Harrison , who prepared and arranged according to this , includes a F@@ BI report . &quot;
&quot; it is also evident that there was a complete relationship between the state and local pro@@ secution , which was not only involved in the murder , evidence susp@@ ended and the identity of witnesses . &quot;
Brooks does it even form@@ ulate .
&quot; it was an elect@@ oral mass@@ acre , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; you were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; if you register yourself and if you vote , then you will happen here . &quot;
&quot; almost a decade , Cass@@ andra has led the annual surname of Moore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de . &quot;
&quot; their representation is illustr@@ ative , gri@@ pping and established in a kind of deep rac@@ ism that many believe that he no longer exists in America . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to look and look more difficult , but Gre@@ ene said that that is the point . &quot;
&quot; we do not want to talk about the Lyn@@ ch , because we are confronted with its ugly in all of us , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; but I cannot build a relationship with you , if you do not want to listen to me or not want to hear what I have done through . &quot;
&quot; the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen White and the rest bl@@ acks - into a space and lou@@ der than Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ played overview of the piece started . &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ ene Co @-@ director .
&quot; he has played the role of Chief C@@ lan@@ mit@@ gli@@ eds for years , but he said , the role will never be easier . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty because I am not so , &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; but I think it is very important to get this story alive , because we do not want to return to those times . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the room did the actor D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , the Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester playing their lines . &quot;
&quot; the piece starts with Mal@@ com , the h@@ ester an@@ cri@@ es and it be@@ ating , angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy . &quot;
&quot; I said , n --- he , w@@ asted from my property ! &quot;
Ras@@ cona un@@ dert the fire .
there is a break .
and then everybody breaks ( at least all black actors ) in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs .
&quot; what ? ! &quot; , asked Ras@@ cona . &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still obst@@ inate . &quot;
I simply don &apos;t think that white people back then &apos; n --- he &apos; said .
&quot; but , &quot; &quot; wit@@ ked one of the other black actors . &quot;
&quot; you only have to meet the hard &apos; R. &apos; . &quot;
&quot; and exactly there is the energy in the room , a sense of compan@@ ion@@ ship re@@ places the discomfort . &quot;
&quot; everyone is busy to get this right , not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four persons killed . &quot;
the scene begins even once .
&quot; this time , if Ras@@ cona says the N word , he says sharp and over@@ print . &quot;
absolutely no one laughs .
this repet@@ ition ends violent and fast .
&quot; there is cry , shots , and then silence . &quot;
&quot; a woman dressed with a dress bed , stands above the corp@@ ses of the actors and leads to Bil@@ lie Holidays tru@@ sting Lo@@ bre@@ de &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot; &quot;
your voice breaks with every second word .
about a hundred metres behind it caught a group of about four dozen people &apos;s swe@@ at and tears from the eyes .
the audience is almost equally divided between black and white .
&quot; a couple is made from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , traveled to see the performance , many come down only down the road . &quot;
they have experienced all the nearly eight hours of Georgia &apos;s impressive humidity when Brooks will lead them on a pilgrimage to the tomb of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
&quot; up to this point , the Mor@@ de has remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote but now , if one stands in the same country where the Lyn@@ ch Mor@@ de , feels the air don@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; when the last notes of the song stops , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and to insp@@ ect the corp@@ se . &quot;
children ho@@ cks on their heads , sign the fake blood and the silent body and whis@@ per@@ ing each other . &quot;
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; mur@@ mu@@ red a little boy , as he wanted to remember . &quot;
after a couple of minutes Gre@@ ene the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw the Lyn@@ n away and wi@@ ping their tears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w um@@ ar@@ mt Mar@@ bau@@ gh the man in the suit who played the C@@ lan@@ co member .
&quot; Nick Ras@@ cona um@@ ar@@ mt two of his fellow @-@ players and breaks down in their arms , crying together , the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks out with him . &quot;
&quot; it is okay , &quot; &quot; one of the women . &quot;
we know that this is not in your heart .
you have done this for a reason . &quot;
later the audience sets up with the actors for dinner together .
&quot; at a table , a white pair of Atlanta stim@@ ulated about the re@@ position with a black pair , that she has just got to know . &quot;
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski strug@@ gl@@ ed to find words which has left the performance .
&quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... from people who look like yourself and those who do , because they look like you , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the Lyn@@ ch is still going on , &quot; she added , &quot; today it is called the police sc@@ r@@ arity . &quot;
&quot; in the same room Ty@@ rone Brooks Hof on his table , he e@@ ats and remember the civil rights . &quot;
he said he already started to plan the performance next year .
&quot; the re@@ position is inspiring in a certain way , as it describes the hor@@ rors of what we have achieved , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it is so , if we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again . &quot;
&quot; who does not study his own history , who is not familiar with his own history , is condemned to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; id@@ ol@@ k &quot; &quot; con@@ cili@@ ated the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bay@@ re@@ uth

&quot; the turn@@ stage ( designed by Alek@@ sand@@ ar Den@@ ic ) op@@ tionally displays a pe@@ ep road corner with a mas@@ rest and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; &quot; Pl@@ aste and El@@ aste &quot; &quot; logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange . &quot;
&quot; before that , par@@ ked an open Mercedes @-@ old@@ timer , in which the Rhein@@ k@@ ills po@@ sieren as Rock@@ erg@@ ir@@ ls or alternatively a Is@@ etta . &quot;
Gest@@ apo oil che@@ ers remind of Cast@@ or@@ fs Leit@@ mot@@ iv - money , power and gre@@ ed - that runs through his &quot; ring &quot; st@@ aging . &quot;

Stephen M@@ illing sings the gorgeous fi@@ esen H@@ agen which gives the aura of a weight@@ less box@@ ers .
&quot; brutal the scene , when he strikes Sieg@@ fried . &quot;
&quot; later , I still have to believe Gun@@ ther ( Markus O@@ ak ) . &quot;
the audience thanks it to the ensemble with strong appl@@ ause .
&quot; they are celebrated in Foster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and Con@@ ductor Jan@@ owski who de@@ filed himself in the humble way and the hands on Merkel storage . &quot;
&quot; great appl@@ ause is available for the Fest@@ spiel@@ haus , which shows the first time on stage - in view of the big heat , again in legal leisure . &quot;
&quot; with excitement , the performance was expected by Frank Cast@@ orf and his Reg@@ i@@ et@@ eam . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , he had to take place in 2013 , there were five years later great che@@ ers in which the single &quot; &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; . &quot; &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to have pleased about it .
&quot; you notice that the audience is up with the &quot; ring &quot; in a certain way , she had said shortly before the performance of d@@ pa . &quot;
the audience did not only have a form of peace with Cast@@ orf but also an understanding of his perspective .
I prefer a positive result .
max . working as volunteer
they work in their volunte@@ ering right at several places .
where everywhere ?
&quot; quantity : usually in st@@ einf@@ urt in furniture , once in the week I stayed here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge . &quot;
and I have already worked in the open whole day at school .
what are your experiences with this ?
&quot; quantity : it is a nice , wide spectrum that I see here . &quot;
&quot; I have different people to do with young people , with refugees , with young adults . &quot;
&quot; so you are 26 years , so a late volunteer . &quot;
how does that happen ?
quantity : I did score .
&quot; and then a building @-@ engineer study , let &apos;s say successfully , successfully ab@@ orted . &quot;
I know that it is the wrong one for me and I want to do something else with people .
and then I asked me what you do .
&quot; a social year , since there is an insight , there you can see how it is on site , in the focal point perhaps too . &quot;
and was it so ?
quantity : I have collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the winter semester for my studies in social affairs .
I will be studying in the Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t H@@ erne as a social skills and study in Ham@@ m at the Fach@@ hoch@@ schule .
is it not a little unusual while volunte@@ ering has several different applications to have ?
&quot; quantity : yes , it is very variable . &quot;
always it comes along where you can make his FS@@ J .
it can be done from the Al@@ ter@@ sheim to youth work - in all sorts of fac@@ ets of social labour .
with me it was very varied .
&quot; I was in part in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon child care . &quot;
for me it was just the right thing that has ger@@ m@@ illed me .
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really happened .
different from the building @-@ engineer studies ?

EPA returns deci@@ ding to delay the smo@@ g rule by cl@@ agen
&quot; the U.S. Environmental Protection Commissioner has made a decision to delay a regulation of the government of Obama , ann@@ ul@@ ately what the states are obliged to com@@ bs the Smo@@ g @-@ caused emissions . this was a day after 15 states de@@ def@@ endant because of the ped@@ ometer . &quot;
&quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to make the so called &quot; Oz@@ on@@ ation 2015 &quot; , &quot; and said , they show the commitment of the agency , working with states . &quot;
&quot; we believe in dialogue with and in mind that we respond to our state partners , &quot; said EPA boss Scott Pru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; Pru@@ itt was announced in June the intention of EPA regulation , which should be measured by oceans - in which in some of the country of poll@@ ut@@ ant emissions must be set to consoli@@ date , where incis@@ ions must be made to delay better avi@@ ation standards - to delay one year up to October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 mostly democratic states , together with the district of Colombia , travelled on Tuesday Kl@@ age and said that the effort was illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tru@@ mp has tried to reg@@ ain a wide range of environmental regulations , which has imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a wider agenda , which should boost economic growth to Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; however , efforts have triggered the response of the democr@@ ats and conservation groups that worry about the effects of greater emissions on public health . &quot;
&quot; the website of EPA says that the inhal@@ ing of air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; the lung function &quot; and can rein@@ force the atoms like asthma . &quot;
municipalities will be common area
&quot; in the end , the decision was clear : when two counter@@ s decides to con@@ cludes the council of Flu@@ orn Win@@ z@@ eln the establishment of a communal space in the future sen@@ iors . &quot;
&quot; prior to the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase contract for the still missing basic piece was signed , reported Mayor Bernhard Tj@@ aden . &quot;
&quot; though , it is still going to last until the so far the church of the church in the municipal community is , but there is no planning for the project from a private invest@@ or to the em@@ bl@@ esome project . &quot;
&quot; for this , there is a discussion regarding a communal space . &quot;
&quot; one of the two investors who are still in the boat , offered the church to meet . &quot;
on the ground floor it would be a living space - around 55 square meters - and a adjacent terrace with a total of 70 square meters area for a special price .
&quot; the administration and majority of the council did not face such a common area not only as meeting place for the inhabitants of the sen@@ i@@ or@@ less housing , but open into the church . &quot;
&quot; as an example , the word was made from the &quot; &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; &quot; round . &quot;
&quot; treats , the decision , which has already been decided by providing funds for the ongoing household in the past autumn , through funding opportunities . &quot;
the construction is in the renovation area .
&quot; the establishment of a communal space would be , so reported Tj@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; the decision from the decision to signal to signal the invest@@ or that one wants to throw him in this respect , the finding that both s@@ addle - which is reduced to the ambient tune - as well as p@@ ult@@ d@@ ach - which makes tr@@ ination and construction economic power - it would be possible . &quot;
&quot; need@@ less , not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer , be this addition . &quot;
if &apos;s helps : un@@ anim@@ ously it happens the body .
it is not that easy for the communal space .
&quot; Daniela calls points to the many own buildings , with which one can not get pretty pro@@ gres@@ sing in the common area of the window , says : &quot; I &apos;m making me hard with it . &quot;
Yv@@ onne Sta@@ iger speaks for the communal space - but absolutely against a municipal participation .
it looks behind a covered sub @-@ invention of already capital or even foreign investors .
&quot; this is not so , because with the acquisition of the area there is no supplement , but come up a real , in the case of doubt , the counter . &quot;
&quot; Sta@@ ig@@ ers request , the decision @-@ to @-@ rise , will find three supporters . &quot;
&quot; if there are two counter @-@ voices in the original program , the Stefan H@@ aller holds so summar@@ ised : &quot; if we believe the decision , we make a huge step in our infrastructure to close . &quot;

hiking in Har@@ z from star to star
&quot; in Har@@ z , the National Park is said to be first &quot; Stern@@ en@@ pf@@ ad &quot; . &quot; &quot;
this is planning an association observ@@ atory ( Saint Andre@@ as@@ berg ) .
there has been a planetary path in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; Stern@@ en@@ pf@@ ad &quot; &quot; comes to the information of many Har@@ z@@ visitors , was called it . &quot;
&quot; connect nature , science , movement and sport@@ y performance . &quot;
members want to set up along the planned route and inform them about stars and star pictures .
&quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association is planning to reach &quot; &quot; good &quot; &quot; installations from five to six places &quot; &quot; in the Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot;
&quot; Peter Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Si@@ eber . &quot;
the information on the tablets are to be added per Internet .
&quot; therefore , at the site selection , a good mobile net @-@ network plays a role . &quot;
also Acc@@ essi@@ bility is a crit@@ er@@ ion .
&quot; later , the star trail should be extended by train . &quot;
&quot; on the star trail , the viewers learn a lot of knowledge , for example above the physics of the individual stars , &quot; explained the association . &quot;
&quot; moreover , they learned why the stars would have different colors , or why a star stronger than another , even though it is much further away . &quot;
I am also taught in which constellation is a selected star to see and when he is best to see .
the association has already been operating in the Berg@@ städ@@ t St. Andre@@ as@@ berg which is the highest located observ@@ atory in Northern Europe .
the site lies in the heart of Har@@ z National Park is one of the Federal Minister for Nature protection among the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
frequently we are from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a galaxy clearly to see .
in the university town there has been on the initiative of the convey@@ ing International Planet@@ arium Göttingen with something similar to the planned observ@@ atory of the planet - the Plan@@ eten@@ weg .
&quot; beginning before Geb@@ h@@ ards Hotel in Goe@@ the@@ all@@ ee , which forms the interior of our solar system , the Plan@@ eten@@ weg leads up to Hain@@ berg and to the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; extr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( municipality Glei@@ chen ) with the planet S@@ edn@@ a . &quot;
the shri@@ mp with the individual planets - including the d@@ warf degra@@ ded Pl@@ uto at the end@@ point - are exactly situated at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
&quot; the earth shr@@ ink so on a bul@@ let of 6.5 milli@@ metres diameter , while the exact 75 meters from the sun is at least 70 cen@@ tim@@ eters . &quot;
the entire distance of the planet is just four kilometers .
&quot; while the light takes about eight hours to Pl@@ uto about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour up to the st@@ ele with Pl@@ uto . &quot;
pedestrian are so faster than the light in the cosmos .
the march to the next Fix@@ ing but would take a half a year ago .

&quot; I am a former feather @-@ weight , &quot; Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; I grew up for bronze &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I am not so big . &quot;

&quot; climate As asked whether it should be in pay @-@ by @-@ view , part of a strategy , the Lom@@ ach@@ enko has to fight a date ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who are also interested in the fight against the winners of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Campbell according to their lightweight championship battle on September 23 . &quot;
&quot; this battle could take place in the pay @-@ per @-@ view mode , because all fans were asked for him , &quot; said Gar@@ cia , and expressed later on , with the network to fight it the best financial package . &quot;
we are the best .
no other names may generate this type of attention .

four Ver@@ ons to tire @-@ space
in an accident on the A7 on Thursday afternoon four people were in@@ ju@@ red to part .
&quot; after first information , the driver then lost a Opel Z@@ af@@ ira at 4.30 p.m. shortly before the junction market , probably after a tire @-@ placed control over his vehicle . &quot;
&quot; the truck cr@@ ashes down to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he beat himself and then left on the roof at the GR@@ Ü@@ N@@ STRE@@ IF@@ EN . &quot;
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were in@@ ju@@ red in the accident .
&quot; during the initial supply of the last through the lif@@ ebo@@ at service , the A7 toward the north for about one hour was blocked , then traffic on the left lanes could be pre@@ directed at the accident . &quot;
&quot; Fort@@ un@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; &quot; Dre@@ ier@@ chain works better &quot;
&quot; Andre Hoffmann , after the 2 : 2 to the end of the season against Br@@ uns@@ wick , that the optimization of the def@@ ences in Au@@ e points brings . &quot;
&quot; with the first season , Andre Hoffmann were satisfied with the result , would not have been the two oppos@@ ing at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig . &quot;
&quot; these were two oppos@@ es too much , and we must be even better fit in Au@@ e , &quot; says the def@@ en@@ es@@ spl@@ ay@@ er of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; in the Erz@@ gebirge Mountains , the Dre@@ ier@@ chain should also be further optimized . &quot;
&quot; and a gate after a fre@@ estyle , the Fort@@ una does not want to catch any more . &quot;
&quot; for the future , it will be that no longer exists alongside Michael ( R@@ ensing ) on the line . &quot;
&quot; Hoffmann is convinced that his team is even better with the experience in preparation with the Dre@@ ier@@ chain , than with the qu@@ ette . &quot;
&quot; yet I do not know how we will act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his Trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is really sure because we have just been able to build on the semi @-@ positions in KA@@ AN Ay@@ han and N@@ iko G@@ ieß@@ el@@ mann players who can build well . &quot;
&quot; prerequis@@ ite is , but that we are even better harmon@@ ize and we do not afford to afford a lot of waste . &quot;
&quot; naturally , Hoffmann goes to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; but whether one cannot speak after a mis@@ ess of a mis@@ erable start , do not know . &quot;
&quot; the performance might be quite okay , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; but if we are on Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the tro@@ phy , we will certainly talk of a neat season . &quot;
of that his coach did not want to know .
&quot; starting in the season , I first said after six to eight players &quot; , &quot; Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el said not to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e , just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be can@@ cel@@ ed because of an in@@ wet@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season quasi with a home game , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann believes that players from Au@@ e might even be a bit of fresh , as they would have no serious and complete game like Fort@@ una against a as@@ cen@@ sion of the bones . &quot;
&quot; but they do not know as 100 @-@ processor where they are currently standing , &quot; says the In@@ def@@ ender of the Fort@@ una . &quot;
&quot; although the guests come from the Rhin@@ eland as a light favourite on Sunday in the meeting in finally ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e . &quot;
&quot; that we take it away , just because we have the claim to come under the first six@@ ties , it &apos;s bull@@ sh@@ it , &quot; says Funk@@ el , its record with only one defeat against Au@@ e from nine games quite positive . &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ lig@@ a , which one has to take from ahead , &quot; says Fort@@ un@@ as Chef@@ coach . &quot;
such a statement would be arrogan@@ t and arrogan@@ t .
and so Funk@@ el wants to experience his players on Sunday in no case .
new results published by the Swedish asylum @-@ assessment tests
&quot; recent results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , which were subjected to a new method for medical evaluation of their age , show that more than 80 per cent of the tested people older than 18 years are . but not everyone believes in accuracy of this results . &quot;
the Swedish authority for For@@ ens@@ ische Medicine ( Rät@@ t@@ ens@@ cin@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) has begun with the implementation of the tests in the past year .
&quot; they are supposed to be more exact during the asylum , after the Swedish migration authority ( mig@@ raine head@@ ation ) , because of errors when ass@@ essing the correct age of some refugees have been critic@@ ised . &quot;
&quot; until today , Mig@@ r@@ ations@@ and@@ et 6.@@ 880 has been sent out and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from the period from mid March to 31 July 2017 . &quot;
eight@@ y percent ( 2002 ) were ass@@ essed as 18 or older while in more 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency ass@@ essed that the person could possibly be 18 years or older .
&quot; in 432 cases , the conclusion that the person may be under 18 years old . &quot;
tests are only conducted in cases where the age of person is question@@ ed .
&quot; according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are resistant to last months . &quot;
&quot; we do not see a huge difference in statistics of the past months , the numbers are rather consistent , &quot; he said the magazine The Local . &quot;
&quot; the high percentage of cases , in which the person was judged as over 18 years , does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ ers has bent over his age . &quot;
&quot; in May , the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases to suggest that the examined person is 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; as the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bl@@ a@@ det the 5@@ 81 results published , it noted that in 243 these cases the person had been open to the person that they will be 18 years old this year . &quot;
&quot; the method of medical age assessment , carried out in the x @-@ rays of wisdom @-@ teeth and MRT recordings of knee br@@ aces , which are then analy@@ zed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , was also critic@@ ized in some areas . &quot;
&quot; a sc@@ ep@@ tics is the end@@ ocr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work includes the assessment of the biological maturity of people to see whether they used sooner or later than usual through pu@@ ber@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I do not believe that the type of measurement should be used . &quot;
evalu@@ ating the biological age in this way is very uns@@ afe .
&quot; if we cannot say it certainly , we should not do so as if we could , &quot; &quot; he said the newspaper metro . &quot;
&quot; Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency def@@ ended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; generally , you can say that the risk to judge a child as an adult . &quot;
&quot; the biggest risk is in it , when the person is under 18 , in this case it is about 10 percent . &quot;
fully in plan
the works on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are well done .
&quot; on Wednesday , there was a seven tons of hard@@ ship on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;

the building is planned for October and is sure that the schedule is kept .
&quot; the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads over the Tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; it is a v@@ aul@@ ted bridge made of concrete , which is cl@@ ot@@ hed with red B@@ unt@@ sand@@ stein , and has a total length of 4,@@ 80 meters . &quot;

&quot; to ensure the stability and road safety , the three construction works are now thoroughly repaired . &quot;
the two other bridges lead to the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built from Rot@@ em B@@ unt@@ sand@@ stein .
&quot; both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10,@@ 60 meters long . &quot;
the bridge at the entrance to the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has now been on the Wednesday morning on the north side a 1,30 meter wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called bri@@ d@@ fish .
this is a random system that is used as a factory .
on Friday the southern part of the bridge is to be used on Friday a little bit of a wide bridge .
&quot; then , the pedestrian road should then go away . &quot;
&quot; the special thing is that it is about manufacturing , a patent from the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o . &quot;
the other two bridges are already provided with the pat@@ ented brow@@ s .
special finger@@ tips has to be taken by the construction of the construction work in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; for there is also a glass fi@@ ant , which are connected to many companies . &quot;
the residents were informed in the advance of work by hand@@ list on the project .
&quot; in addition , first fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be cut off . &quot;
for the bridges between the building of the building and the collecting in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg the traffic is regulated by an Amp@@ le .
for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bacher village entrance is the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the Hotel &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; filled .
the cost of the three lo@@ wer@@ c@@ ings are around 700 000 Euro .
the whole is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : bund@@ led in german potato
&quot; it does not come so frequently that parties are pulling in a string , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , comes together , which is otherwise only hard to put under a hat . &quot;
&quot; the Communist Parties ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Left ) belong to a broad alliance that shows on this day peaceful flag because the Af@@ D invites the straight @-@ up &apos; great elect@@ oral campaign . &quot;
&quot; and known name at the start brings - like Alice Wei@@ del , which together with Alexander Gau@@ land is the top duo for the Bundestag election on the 24th of September , and the Deputy Beat@@ rix from Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; but those who are already hours before the start of the event , do not want to listen to the Af@@ D artists , but demonstrate &quot;
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colourful . &quot;
&quot; originally the town pic@@ n@@ ics was planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; at the fountain square , but now takes place at the parking lot below the R@@ ond@@ ells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stadthalle . &quot;
a colorful picture that has been here .
&quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chairman of the forum a world and one of the relevant organizers were really happy : &quot; great , how many people came here together . &quot;
&quot; there are music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; German potato salad &quot; , &quot; which also could eat the Af@@ D easily , &quot; says the woman who has brought him . &quot;
&quot; the police took many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it demonstrates the presence mainly at the station , which is only a few meters away from the venues . &quot;
how is the Af@@ D come up to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes reported by the Af@@ D volcano . he endeav@@ ors to make such an event and get the supplement .
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ mes not enough parking available . &quot;
&quot; well , the Ron@@ dell &apos;@@ Hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; &quot; we can have such a beautiful event here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; with a view to the event on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz , he says : &quot; this is the good right of people , the main thing it remains peaceful . &quot;
&quot; this also does : at 20 am , the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz is a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle various speakers , including the rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ pf@@ alz @-@ President Uwe boy . &quot;
&quot; in the room there are about 200 listen@@ ers , who are waiting that the Spitz@@ enk@@ andi@@ dat@@ in for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the Deputy Chairman Beat@@ rix from Stor@@ ch to keep their speech@@ es . &quot;
&quot; the police are still present , but so far the police officers had a quiet evening . &quot;
&quot; a little more than one hour takes the Af@@ D event , the guests on the court have a longer breath , but also there is short after 9 o &apos;clock . &quot;
the police can withdraw - no special inci@@ dents .

crime Stewart talks about her bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; &quot; &quot; some people love gr@@ illed cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives . &quot;
&quot; but I would like to try everything , &quot; says Kri@@ sten Stewart completely openly about their bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; when I went to gr@@ illed cheese , I think : &apos; Oh it was cool , what comes next ? &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the probably best @-@ known relationship of the Dutch stars was that of her &quot; &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; &quot; colleagues Robert Patt@@ inson , which ultimately was bitter apart . &quot;
&quot; despite all assu@@ res the br@@ ace in@@ sured against the &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; I was in any serious love I have remembered . &quot;
&quot; or do you believe , I would have played it ? &quot;
&quot; after their separation there was Kri@@ sten said that they have been bis@@ exual , &quot; &quot; I have always lived the du@@ alism and seriously believed . &quot;
so it has never been confused or disabled .
&quot; I never liked it , not seriously to be taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; especially among them have suffered loud &quot; Bang Show@@ biz &quot; but in school time , when they prefer like a bu@@ b , &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot;
this really hurt me very hurt .
&quot; when I was eleven I told me the children , I would look like a be@@ b . &quot;
I really felt attacked - fright@@ ened and embarrass@@ ed .
&quot; now I look back and think : &apos; girl , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot;
especially the public they don &apos;t like to educ@@ ate her love : &quot; people expect you in a certain way and angry me .
&quot; and maybe I call me some as un@@ think@@ able , but I don &apos;t like to just@@ ify myself before the whole public . &quot;
governor of West Virginia announces that he changes the Party
&quot; the democratic Gover@@ nor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening with President Tru@@ mp , that he will change the party . &quot;
&quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot;
today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of thinking ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia . I can no longer help you when I am a democratic governor .
the manifestation broke out in rejo@@ icing .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration for the rep@@ ublic@@ ans , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; as a coach , I would say that it is time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp said before a big announcement on the West Virginia Rall@@ ye .
&quot; Mr. Tru@@ mp won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice does not endor@@ se the democratic candidates of Hill@@ ary Clinton . &quot;
&quot; Justice , who is according to For@@ bes of the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected 2016 . &quot;
&quot; For@@ bes marks the fact that he has killed coal in five states , and has inher@@ ited a carbon business by his father . &quot;
it is worth $ 1,@@ 59 billion dollars . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime the Republi@@ can National Committee on Thursday , had a statement in which it said : &quot; the party change of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow for a democratic party which would rather hin@@ der us as it was to make our land great again . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 Gou@@ vern@@ s and the control of the least legal corporations in history is the last rejection of a party , which is from above to bottom without guidance and is unable to find a positive , positive message , &quot; said the R@@ NC @-@ Chairman R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the CB@@ S News . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; &quot; Russian &quot; &quot; sorry for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal &quot;
&quot; the global leader of Athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ E , pra@@ ised the Thursday that he described as an obvious exc@@ use from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal but he was repeated , it is not the moment for the country to be taken back into sport again . &quot;
Russia &apos;s Athle@@ tics and Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ ak@@ ht@@ in said during the IA@@ AF Congress at the eve of Athle@@ tics World Championships that the exile of his country was correct from the sport and that he is determined to fight the dop@@ ing .
&quot; he said , I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; all athletes that were car@@ ved on the competitions of gold and silver medals . &quot;
&quot; despite his comments the IA@@ AF Congress held for the maintenance of the ban , which was published in November 2015 after a report by the World @-@ Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( W@@ ada ) references to state @-@ funded dop@@ ing in Russia . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was a very open answer , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF @-@ President Co@@ E the Rep@@ or@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; the entire Council and the entire Congress were so pleased that the Russian Federation has realized itself , that it has experienced some pretty hot periods and will do everything possible to make sure the Federation is new . &quot;
&quot; Co@@ E said , he is also &quot; pleased &quot; that Russia accept the criteria for its re @-@ establishment . &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress has been achieved , but Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force , that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ E . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we must do everything in the coming months to normal@@ ise this situation . &quot;
&quot; the guid@@ ing principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the with@@ ered system , &quot; he added &quot;
ninet@@ een Russian athletes will start at the Athle@@ tics World Championships that start Friday in London according to the strict IA@@ AF criteria for neutral actors .
&quot; the director of the IA@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia needs some of the criteria for re @-@ position . &quot;
&quot; drug tests are still inadequate and bot@@ her@@ ed coach were still free , he said Rep@@ or@@ tern in London after a presentation at IA@@ AF Council . &quot;
daily for in Mali crashed soldiers
&quot; with a celebration at the north @-@ party F@@ ritz@@ lar , approximately 1000 people of the two are conceived in a helicop@@ ter cr@@ ashing into Mali . &quot;
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city at high security arrangements .
&quot; to the still un@@ explained crash , the Ministry of Defence of the Ley@@ en ( CD@@ U ) was nothing . &quot;
&quot; they referred to the two different pilots but as &quot; kings of their expertise . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bow down to this highest victim , which they told in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; declared them . &quot;
33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ el@@ mann from Nord@@ hes@@ sen were born on Wednesday before a week in the West African Mali .
their S@@ är@@ ge were transferred to Germany and was accompanied by a dead guard of the Bundes@@ w@@ ehr into the F@@ ritz@@ lar@@ er Dom Sankt Peter .
at the mid@@ day they took only the relatives at the church f@@ arewell .
&quot; afterwards , the funeral service began in the circle of the family , eng@@ ht@@ est friends , representatives of the federal government and politics . &quot;
among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the Secretary @-@ General of the Bundes@@ w@@ ehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
&quot; grape @-@ sto@@ ols laid on ros@@ es , the relatives were rich in arms on the po@@ kes . &quot;
in front of the church F@@ ritz@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers took the ceremony on a canvas .
&quot; Secretary of Defense of the Ley@@ en , the surrounding soldiers were decorated as &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; and dis@@ integrate . &quot;
the Stab@@ el@@ mann had built the air @-@ operation of the martial @-@ screw@@ ed tiger in F@@ ritz@@ lar and was one of the first six educated tig@@ ers of his Reg@@ iment .
&quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ achs , Com@@ man@@ de@@ ur of the Reg@@ iment , said to which the soldiers declared : &quot; &quot; if this crew did not turn off the crash , then there would not be none . &quot;
doubts about the UN @-@ Mission in Mali showed the minister of the Ley@@ en not : the use is dangerous .
&quot; but he is also of high meaning , for a country , by which we are separated only by two states , &quot; said it . &quot;
after the funeral ceremony the S@@ är@@ ge were brought out of the cathedral .
&quot; when and where to be buried , the Bundes@@ w@@ ehr made no information . &quot;
Prince Hen@@ rik does not want a grave alongside his wife
&quot; the man by the Danish queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried in addition to his death . &quot;
this shared the Royal House on Thursday .
traditionally the Danish König@@ s@@ aar is set in the cathedral @-@ church of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ gaard fer@@ ed a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ g for both the two .
&quot; the Queen may agree with the decision of her husband , he named it in the message . &quot;
&quot; where Prince Hen@@ rik bury , be still unclear . &quot;
but he did not have the intention to join in his French homeland .
prince Hen@@ rik had never made a h@@ ehl from it that he was not happy with his title .
after the throne of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would love to be king .
&quot; he went in retirement , and also sets the title &quot; &quot; prin@@ c@@ ahl . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Hen@@ rik in Denmark did not get the title and the function he wanted to see himself against his wife not as equal - even after death , explained L@@ ene Ball@@ eby , the chef of the Danish king &apos;s house . &quot;
where the last retirement of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will eventually be unclear .
&quot; but he did not have the intention to join in his French homeland , but in Denmark . &quot;
&quot; he likes the country , for which he has worked for over the past 50 years . &quot;
&quot; Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French Adel@@ s@@ gender , had met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London . &quot;
at the Thames he worked in the French emb@@ assy .
&quot; during his later wife , the sympath@@ ies of the people always flew , prince Hen@@ rik had a serious stand in his barely 50 @-@ year ship . &quot;
Hen@@ rik about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival was everything I did .
&quot; my Danish was pregnant , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk @-@ stock@@ ings instead of stri@@ cken , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead Volvo , tennis . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I sm@@ oked instead of Virginia tobacco and that I had the reputation to be the brand of soci@@ etal intellectu@@ als , I could not hope for indul@@ gence . &quot;
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not to be ash@@ amed .
these were two errors ! &quot;
Prime Minister W@@ eil wants swift re@@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP in front of possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; Dutch Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) is named after the loss of red @-@ green government officials for a swift re@@ election of the country , but he doesn &apos;t want to come back . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; because he spoke on Friday for the resolution of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; previously , the surprising o@@ yst@@ ro@@ aring of a Green @-@ MP@@ s had over@@ thre@@ w the government of Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) in a serious crisis . &quot;
five months before the official appointment of the election election the red @-@ green coalition in Hannover lost its scar@@ ce One @-@ voices majority in the Parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the previous green @-@ members Elke T@@ westen constit@@ uted its step with the non @-@ nomin@@ ation for the election of 2018 in the election circle in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ m@@ me ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; she declared Friday in Hanover . &quot;
CD@@ U @-@ Fra@@ eg@@ ef Björ@@ n Th@@ um@@ ers wants to recommend it to his faction .
&quot; with this , CD@@ U and F@@ DP had some 69 seats in the Nieder@@ s@@ ächs@@ ische Land@@ tag , SPD and Green 68 seats . &quot;
&quot; so far , the relationship was revers@@ ed . &quot;
the new Land@@ tag will be the regular opening at the 14th of January coming year .
&quot; Th@@ um@@ ler said , the red @-@ green state government should now decide whether in this situation there could be no majority in this situation . &quot;
&quot; however , Stephan W@@ eil holds it essential for in@@ comprehen@@ sible that the landing is swift as fast as its self @-@ resolution . &quot;
the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on Tuesday through their further procedure .
the language version also sees the possibility of having the Prime Minister to trust the trust and choose a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution offers several options . &quot;
&quot; these options need to be legally checked carefully , &quot; &quot; said Th@@ um@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; you will discuss all questions in peace , if they are legally reasonable . &quot;
&quot; Th@@ um@@ ers called T@@ west@@ ens step &quot; , &quot; somewhat short @-@ qu@@ aint . &quot;
the government itself stressed : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
you signed as a tow@@ el of black green .
the Gre@@ ens requested the ab@@ sent@@ enced members to the return of their land @-@ day parliament .
&quot; we of course assume that they have received their land @-@ day , which she has received over the green country list , with immediate effect , the leader of a Jans@@ sen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; the president of the Green Anja P@@ iel said , &quot; &quot; we regret the decision of Elke T@@ westen extraordinary . &quot;
they deliberately decided to lead no pron@@ unci@@ ation in the group .
&quot; even in front of the background , that there was no in@@ consistent differences , we cannot im@@ pe@@ de this step . &quot;
SPD ch@@ anc@@ ellor did@@ acy Martin Schulz condemned the attack of the Dutch Green @-@ Members Elke T@@ westen to the CD@@ U as a betra@@ yal .
&quot; the behavior of the former Green parliament@@ arians in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of elect@@ or@@ ters and voters , but also betra@@ yal by red @-@ green , &quot; wrote the leader of the Socialists and Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot;
he endor@@ se the decision from Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) to re @-@ release the country &apos;s tag .
&quot; abol@@ ishing T@@ west@@ ens cost red @-@ green in Lower Saxony , the majority . &quot;
&quot; the policy of politicians &quot; in its van@@ ity and in their fore@@ ust their personal interests against the welfare of the country , &quot; critic@@ ized SPD Secretary General of Hu@@ ber@@ tus salvation . &quot;
&quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U has power in Lower Saxony , this dirty in@@ filtr@@ ation and tries to beat the political capital . &quot;
precip@@ itation CD@@ U @-@ fr@@ action@@ ism Björ@@ n Th@@ um@@ ers wants to recommend its members to the Elke T@@ westen into the CD@@ U .
&quot; the leader of the SPD leader in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , cast T@@ westen before , with personalized career giving the outcome of the election election in 2013 . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U was one of the SPD strongest force , SPD and green in the country , but a hau@@ ch@@ ant majority of one voice . &quot;
&quot; agricultural , in the interview - how do we protect ourselves from tox@@ ins , Mr. Schmidt ? &quot;
Germany disc@@ usses about sc@@ anned eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves .
agricultural Minister Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is in an interview with the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) address and response .
Mr. Schmidt : how can the consumer protect themselves from po@@ is@@ oned eggs ?
&quot; I can only encourage all consumers and consumers to watch the eggs in your refrigerator , and check the stress pressure . &quot;
on the consumer portal www.@@ food@@ war@@ n@@ .com the Bundes@@ länder will provide you with the latest information on the affected eggs .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; even , if after all we currently know , a health care is practically excluded . &quot;
&quot; now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis of crisis - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the Council of the Federal Minister is not really perceived ? &quot;
the food monitoring is the task of the Bundes@@ länder .
&quot; nevertheless , my house has immediately opened immediately and is located in close exchange of Germany in close exchange with the authorities of countries . &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available to the consumer .
trade has just as well as the manufacturers to bear them that the sold @-@ selling products are viable and health@@ ful harmless .
&quot; if eggs are exceeded at 0,@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg , these are not traffic . &quot;
un@@ loaded eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time the establ@@ ishments are not to blame .
are you sitting in the same boat and consumers at the same boat ?
after the state @-@ level knowledge the production industry is not an immediate fault .
rather they have to reck@@ on because of mut@@ ually illegal practices of service companies with economic damage .
&quot; as always , there is in the harvest case too little controllers . &quot;
is it only lacking in the staff or even on the lower jurisdiction ?
&quot; however , it is precisely the official controls that have revealed the process . &quot;
&quot; however , the truth is also that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded to 100 percent . &quot;
&quot; this is why a consequ@@ ent clari@@ fication of such action and the hand@@ over to the pro@@ secut@@ ors in the cases , in which offen@@ ders are occurr@@ ing , of crucial importance . &quot;
I have already made several times a lot of times that I expect a complete explanation by the responsible authorities .
is the regular al@@ ar@@ mis@@ m in food sc@@ ales really necessary ?
consumers and consumers have the right to get safe and busi@@ able food .
&quot; if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ des is used in the food sector , consumers and consumers are entitled to justice . &quot;
&quot; due to the ground@@ ed means manufacturers , distributors and consumers come into a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
&quot; basically , it must be clear : the illegal use of the insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ de Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ food supply is not acceptable and must be stopped immediately . &quot;
&quot; therefore , on all levels must be consistent and worked with high pressure . &quot;
&quot; I expect from all relevant authorities , that the facts will be breeding and seam@@ lessly . &quot;
how the financial rules of football on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Move to Paris
&quot; the rules , which aim to prevent un@@ resolved issues of European football , N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s puppy transfer from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain are not inter@@ f@@ ere . &quot;
&quot; any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Germain from the UEF@@ A , for the executive organisation that mon@@ itors the European game has monitored power , teams of access to the prestigious Champions League tournament . &quot;
&quot; financial fair @-@ play rules , which were launched in 2011 by the UEF@@ A &apos;s life , mean that PS@@ G has to be re@@ tired that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without great losses . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona has been paid 222 million Euros ( 262 million $ ) , to buy the Brazi@@ lians from his contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a sal@@ ary that will be several ten million dollars a year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Move to France .
&quot; PS@@ G can make money loose with security , so that N@@ ey@@ mar is under@@ taking and put it into a galaxy , given the financing of the team by the energy rich gl@@ acial family of Qatar . &quot;
&quot; must apply much money for the acquisition of players a lot of money , but having to control the break of revenue sources to give them the break @-@ Even point in their first @-@ related business . &quot;
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
&quot; the former French player believed that in their pursuit of success enormous debt had increased , effectively dec@@ eive and ris@@ ky to ruin , if banks or owners have their support . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P taken from concentration on the deb@@ ts of the clubs to monitor its losses . &quot;
&quot; the change meant that the business model , the novel Abr@@ amo@@ vich originally used in Chelsea - a club with potential and then power@@ fully invested to build the team and build a global brand - to become a tough@@ er matter . &quot;
&quot; during the current three @-@ year @-@ old FF@@ P pre@@ dispos@@ ition , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses in the amount of 30 million euros . &quot;
&quot; and although Platinum 2015 has fallen from the presi@@ dency in Un@@ gn@@ ade , his UEF@@ A @-@ successor Alek@@ s@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in continues to be scre@@ am of excessive spending . &quot;
&quot; surely FF@@ P is not dead and we will surely strengthen the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , opposite The Associ@@ ated Press during the past week . &quot;
&quot; although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out cl@@ ause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a package , it can distribute the amount for invo@@ icing on the duration of its contract . &quot;
N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract so that the abl@@ eness would be made up for the next five years in the amount of 44,@@ 4 million euros in the year .
&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions . &quot;
&quot; the PS@@ G received a money penalty of 60 million euros ( then 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to 20 million euros for the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 to 21 players rather than the otherwise normal 25 players remain limited . &quot;
&quot; the UEF@@ A is in search of clubs , who could try to over@@ see their financial supervision by joining their revenue by companies that are connected to the owners of a club . &quot;
&quot; while a Catalan company could transp@@ ose the PS@@ G , if the value of sponsor@@ ship should exceed the standard market , the UEF@@ A does not apply it as leg@@ it@@ imes . &quot;
&quot; this was what happened in 2014 , when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of the P@@ SA was infl@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority . &quot;
it was reported that a part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar has been paid via payments of the organization &apos;s committee in Qatar .
&quot; however , PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have argu@@ ed that N@@ ey@@ mar World Cup amb@@ assador will be able to find out and such man@@ o@@ eu@@ v@@ ring for the UEF@@ A regul@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEF@@ A will be even more attentive , every attempt to consider the rules to deal with . &quot;
the UEF@@ A had no prevent@@ ative discussions with PS@@ G on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
&quot; they spoke under the condition of an@@ onym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , as they were not authorized to discuss the PS@@ G situation . &quot;
&quot; the last published reports indicate that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 with a turnover of 54@@ 2.4 million euros has achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros . &quot;
the accounts for the last year of financial year must still be published .
&quot; PS@@ G is expected that N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrive a blessing to Sponsor@@ ing De@@ als , mer@@ chan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot@@ ic sales . &quot;
&quot; the association is derived from that sales , after signing up at least 30 per cent increase . &quot;
&quot; the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players going to see , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s , by being claimed that PS@@ G would hurt FF@@ P . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the president of the La League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish Daily AS with regard to Qatar &apos;s final owner . &quot;
ar@@ sen@@ al @-@ Manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La League against a state who financed an association . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of the owners and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; it will be very difficult to respect the Financial Fair@@ play because one gets different ways or have different interests , if a country has such a great actor to represent a country . &quot;

&quot; his brother Christoph , Olympi@@ ad of 2016 , was failed in the national World Cup ex@@ cre@@ tion and could view the disc@@ us competition only from the ble@@ achers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the first attempt was qualified for the Polish title def@@ ender Pi@@ ot@@ r Mal@@ ach@@ owski , which was 65,@@ 13 metres long for the end of the end . &quot;
nost@@ algia goes into &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
&quot; this repet@@ ition of the story is nost@@ al@@ gic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 @-@ er years , for the 90 @-@ er @-@ years @-@ gr@@ unge @-@ era ( as the Vor@@ den@@ ker David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ ers the Sk@@ et@@ ch @-@ Com@@ edy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV , Amy Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Rud@@ d went to larger things . &quot;
as a cultural arti@@ fact it is equally par@@ ody and a em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era permanent memories .
&quot; but as fran@@ chise , it feels like the time would be almost . &quot;
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; worked surprisingly good , not only because of its absurd Hum@@ ors ( it contained an original history for a speaking can of vegetables produced by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot;
&quot; by putting on at the core of the g@@ ags - actors middle aged children play rop@@ es children that grow to grow - nevertheless , they are nevertheless the im@@ possibility to reg@@ ain the last part of the pit . &quot;
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults who are now playing adults , is less emotional rooted and his par@@ ody comes more after the g@@ limp@@ se of the 90 &apos;s films like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the Cra@@ dle &quot; ( &quot; The hand that illustrate the cradle &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; at a point , a character by an Apple @-@ Power@@ Book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from the year 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
&quot; ami@@ able C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ age ) , now Roman@@ aut@@ or , has K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mo@@ reau ) is still not forgotten . &quot;
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has not yet lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
&quot; and there is another crazy auto@@ lot , included in the Ronald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Show@@ age ) , which is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good successful impression of Michael Ian Black ) . &quot;
as always the lessons are the best part of fran@@ chise .
&quot; it is especially fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rud@@ d , the Matt D@@ ill@@ ons Unter@@ li@@ ppen@@ bart of &quot; singles , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy is now like an old boy . &quot;
&quot; there are the moments acci@@ dental mad@@ ness that could get this fran@@ chise like a kind of repet@@ itive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series , until it reaches what I will see as his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : twenty Years L@@ ater , &quot; how she will visit the film premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; at Amazon has now reminded of another type of nost@@ algia : to the revival of the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even at &quot; G@@ low &quot; with its East @-@ West Ring@@ kampf @-@ I@@ con@@ ography . &quot;
&quot; presented by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka made com@@ edy with Rh@@ ys Thomas as a director , a Romanian TV series : a Romanian drama of the ei@@ gh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Bucharest , who fight for truth , ath@@ e@@ ism and the way of Marxism @-@ Lenin@@ ism . &quot;
the main sur@@ fers - a hard ges@@ ot@@ ten@@ er Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u U@@ lic@@ i the di@@ alogs of Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a comprehensive producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt .
it is an ingen@@ ious idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
&quot; there are some nice G@@ ags to watch ( the police force the time to watch chess on TV , like Americans to do with football ) . &quot;
&quot; and the list of famous speakers - including Jenny S@@ late , Nick offer@@ man , Mah@@ erh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Sev@@ ign@@ y - ensures a decent game &quot; Fin@@ ish the voice out . &quot;
&quot; but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is committed to tru@@ th@@ fulness of a des@@ perate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer , who is a Re@@ agan mask , is included - that it is often just like a single one . &quot;
&quot; with six long episodes it moves , and the com@@ edy is not fast or common enough . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective , &quot; which was reduced to a lower length , his Ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p @-@ S@@ ati@@ re can continue to visit the American emb@@ assy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men that sle@@ epy a bunch of ham@@ burger . &quot;
the message for the imag@@ inary communist audience is that the Western culture can do everything for food .
the fic@@ t@@ itious Romanian Creator was not wrong : we even make it with our own younger history and thei@@ rs .
blow against drugs @-@ Maf@@ ia in the country
the police is a blow against the Italian Maf@@ ia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; on Wednesday morning in the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald @-@ B@@ aar circle , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Con@@ stance , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart has visited numerous objects like the Pro@@ secution const@@ ancy on Friday . &quot;
&quot; at the age of 25 years , 15 in@@ filtr@@ ation were arrested between 25 years and 77 years and have already been arrest war@@ rant against these . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the officials received larger amounts of marijuana and coconut , flo@@ wering weapons , as well as several hundred thousand euros . &quot;
at the same swe@@ eps in Italy two people were arrested .
against the two suspic@@ ious Ital@@ ians there were German Ar@@ rest War@@ rant .
the two will probably be delivered to Germany according to Germany .
in the action the Italian and Bav@@ arian investig@@ ators were involved .
&quot; overall , more than 300 polic@@ emen were in action . &quot;
&quot; the members of the Maf@@ ia will organised drug crimin@@ ality , serious violence , attemp@@ ted murder as well as rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail . &quot;
already since summer 2016 the pro@@ secution const@@ ancy against organised drugs in the southern German area .
&quot; between the Pro@@ secution in Con@@ stance and Palermo , there was a lively exchange and investig@@ ator of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had almost daily contact with their colleagues on Sicily . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the major sentence on Wednesday morning was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo . &quot;
&quot; in the vision@@ ing of studies , the exploration of all Italian citizenship deals with a close relationship to the Italian Maf@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; also a incident on 27 May in Hü@@ fingen , where early in the morning several shots were fil@@ med into a guest house , is likely to go to the account of the gang . &quot;
fright@@ ening large g@@ aps in the fore@@ igner register
&quot; data from citizens , which should not appear &quot; : a report according to the fore@@ igner register in Germany has considerable short@@ com@@ ings . &quot;
the lead to partly gra@@ v@@ atives in asylum @-@ procedures .
&quot; the contr@@ acting for the refuge@@ e management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen ways , has given attention to a media report according to large g@@ aps in the country @-@ country register . &quot;
def@@ ects in the registered data could result in asylum and deport@@ ations to partly gra@@ v@@ ending mis@@ choices .
&quot; according to the register , the data is estimated ten million people with foreign nationality , including around 5,@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries . &quot;
the data will be managed according to approximately 600 foreigners in Germany .
&quot; because the data has not been adequ@@ ately maintained , the data quality has not been good in parts of so far . &quot;
&quot; in some cases have been found by 1921 , &quot; by people who have long been no longer in life , or by citizens who have become German citizens and should not appear in the register any more . &quot;
&quot; faul@@ ty data expenditure can be significantly slow , it means the report to further . &quot;
&quot; in the statistics about travelling , EU citizens don &apos;t have to sh@@ out@@ ed EU citizens who would not have to travel . &quot;
&quot; but such false assign@@ ments , however , led to a dist@@ orted debate on dealing with out@@ travelers , &quot; says it in analysis . &quot;
meanwhile the Federal Government seems to have begun to return refuge@@ e families with less than 16 @-@ year children when they travelled from there .
&quot; this was taken out of an internal paper of the Bundes@@ am@@ ts for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , the &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ re Zeitung reports &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the paper that is , &quot; &quot; the BA@@ MF lead such procedures &quot; regarding families with children - except for inf@@ ants and to@@ d@@ dl@@ ers - according to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; since the end of 2014 this was practically no longer possible , so the paper available on a reference to the difficult situation on the spot . &quot;
after the Dublin agreement is responsible for refugees from the EU @-@ State to reach them first .
&quot; if a mig@@ rant travels to another EU country , this state can send it back to the entry country . &quot;
&quot; in reason , the office now write to : &quot; &quot; now the recording capacity for families with older children in Italy has increased substantially . &quot;
Italy has been given for the admission and accommodation of families warran@@ ties .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( EC@@ rt@@ HR ) considers these promises to be sufficient .
another EU states would also return to refugees in the context of the Dublin agreement .
&quot; the inter@@ political speech of the left @-@ fr@@ action in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ized this decision : &quot; families with children , because of the short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian asylum system of human rights , and a haz@@ ard of child &apos;s body . &quot;
second earnings achieved
a total of 220 lit@@ re of blood from in Ober@@ rich@@ enbach living persons presented the blood@@ shed for other people .
&quot; at least from the twelve citizens , which were distinguished on Friday . &quot;
&quot; above all Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who has now shared 50 lit@@ re in the meantime 50 lit@@ re . &quot;
&quot; traditionally , the church in the meeting of the comm@@ uter should be sever@@ ely read@@ able willingness to don@@ ate blood . &quot;
&quot; it is awesome as our body is created for it , and we respect the don@@ ators who provide their blood for stran@@ gers , nor are un@@ even sil@@ ly , under@@ lined Mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; a single blood@@ shot helps several people , explained the circul@@ atory of the German Red Cross ( DRC ) , Holger Ma@@ is@@ enb@@ acher , because the c@@ anned foods are broken in its components . &quot;
this is how three people could benefit from a blood stream .
&quot; at the same time , Ma@@ is@@ enb@@ acher told the actions that are carried out in the spring in Ober@@ rich@@ enbach . &quot;
&quot; in this year we achieved the second best result , &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K cycle . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the change in the theatre was led to higher participants of a few years ago . &quot;

the Bank of England will keep the interest rates at 0.25 %
&quot; the Bank of England is expected to announce that the interest rates remain unchanged , after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation over a rise . &quot;
&quot; the Bank of England warned that economic growth &quot; &quot; will remain &quot; , &quot; when they left the interest rates on family income in the midst of a strengthened pressure . &quot;
the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 to keep the interest rates on 0.25 % whereby the weak economic growth has increased support for an increase in this month .
&quot; in its quar@@ terly assessment , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 to 1.6 % , and warned that inflation in the fall should still be expected to rise under 3 % in the autumn . &quot;
&quot; however , they sign@@ alised that in the coming years of interests they would be necessary to grow by the Bre@@ xit and they said that the credit cost possibly would have to rise more than expected at the financial markets . &quot;
members also agreed to retreat a part of the mam@@ mot@@ h sub@@ jun@@ ctions that was published before a year after the Bre@@ xit .
&quot; it will demand time for the financial plan to provide cheaper funds for banks , although it is now expected that it is expected 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds of ster@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; minutes after the decision on the interest rate said the Bank : &quot; in the central pro@@ gn@@ osis of the M@@ PC , the gross domestic product remains low in the short term , since the pressure on the real@@ time of households continues to be charged the consumption . &quot;
&quot; in terms of interest , they would be repeated that &quot; a certain penalty of monetary policy &quot; was required for the cooling of inflation and a &quot; slightly greater &quot; dimension than the markets are expected . &quot;
the markets pro@@ g@@ nostic at present the first rise in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; however , the Bank stressed that bum@@ ps would be &quot; gradu@@ al &quot; and &quot; limited &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the growth forecasts of the Bank for this and next year are compared to those in May pro@@ g@@ nostic 1.9 % and 1.7 % .
it has maintained its growth forecasts to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pounds fell after these messages compared to the dollar and the Euro .
the Po@@ und fell by 0.5 % to 4.0@@ US dollars and fell by 0.4 % on 1.11 euros .
the decision to no change comes after the recent dis@@ appoint@@ ing growth figures have led to increasing expectations on an in@@ serts and the GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months rose to 0.@@ 3 % in the previous three months .
&quot; growth is expected to come at 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it is easy to recover after the bank at the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; the recent in@@ fl@@ ection report offered little enthusiasm for households which will be affected by a rising inflation and low levels , since the tight@@ ening is first even worse before it becomes better . &quot;
&quot; she added that monetary policy can not be prevented at the next few years , &quot; but she added that wages to come to the end of their three @-@ year @-@ year @-@ gn@@ osis . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the economy is also reinforced by the rising demand for British goods , which is due to the weak Po@@ und , which is compens@@ ated for a part of the lower consumption . &quot;
the decision comes a year after lo@@ wering the interest rates on 0.25 % in the last August after the shock@@ ing EU vote that caused the for@@ ks of the pas@@ sports .
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this prices and the economy will be fully att@@ ained .
&quot; prior to the final judgment of the Bank to the interest rates , the call was increased after an in@@ noc@@ ence , since inflation increased pressure on hard enough , with three political decision @-@ makers in July an increase to 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; inflation is decl@@ ined in the last month of 2,@@ 9 % in June to 2,@@ 6 % even though the bank said that this has been anticipated and will come back in the coming months . &quot;
&quot; the Bank said , the bank moves in relation to their aim of 2 % be &quot; &quot; very &quot; &quot; to the weak pounds . &quot;
&quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director at Co@@ rec@@ o Mort@@ e Bro@@ kers said : &quot; &quot; given the recent return of the S@@ wap R@@ ats , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be more competitive , as the len@@ ders would like to close to shops and want to end the year in a positive way . &quot;
the market looks particularly well for those in which the existing de@@ als are running and the new mort@@ g@@ ages shut down and many with toll free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular .
&quot; N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) is intended to write HIV @-@ Dro@@ ge 10,000 people &quot;
patients will be obtained from September after a fight against the high Court against financing of the drug in the N@@ HS access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV Pre@@ ven@@ tional treatment .
N@@ HS England announced that one before the sexual intercourse exc@@ uses pre@@ dominant phy@@ lax@@ is ( pre@@ p ) which can reduce the infection risk with high @-@ risk assessment by about 86 percent are now supplied by health services over a first three @-@ year @-@ annual study for estimated 10,000 people . &quot;
&quot; he explained to finance the process after the attend@@ ance of the Supreme Court of Justice had confirmed that the N@@ HS had received the powers , for pre@@ p in spite of the claim that local authorities should fund it . &quot;
&quot; he announced today by N@@ HS England manager Simon Stev@@ ens as a &quot; important new intervention , &quot; during the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) , this was called a &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be among the first to follow the registration of people , and other clinics will follow in October 2018 . &quot;
pre@@ dominant phy@@ lax@@ is ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV preparations produced prior to sex to reduce the risk of an HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p reduces the HIV transfer to infection .
pre@@ p in front of the intercourse meant that just enough drugs in the body of a person exists to prevent an HIV infection .
such drugs may be taken every day or just two hours before the intercourse .
&quot; to those who come for treatment in question include g@@ ay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexual and individuals with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated . &quot;
&quot; in clinics , suitable participants are identified to agree with the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known through anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment . &quot;
people who are living in England and registered with a physician to sign up for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program will signed £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract for the supply of drugs this week after an international competitive proc@@ urement .
&quot; the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by collected clinical actions , as it is defined in large scale targeted , being implemented and implemented . &quot;
Stev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should add the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV and transfer . &quot;
it is another milestone in the more than three decades lasting progress in dealing with one of the greatest health challenges of human@@ kind .
Deb@@ orah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National Aids Trust ) , said : &quot; &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ p , when it is targeted at ne@@ edy and dangerous people , the ability to change the English HIV epide@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; from September , people with high HIV risk have access to this N@@ HS @-@ financed attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and not with a partner to improve many , many lives . &quot;
we warmly welcome this notice . &quot;
&quot; Ian Green , CEO of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; the priority must now lie that the study will quickly be carried out throughout the country and that no one is left for HIV . &quot;
&quot; now , as the pre@@ p @-@ test medicine has been created , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people . &quot;
&quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ dg@@ son , shadow @-@ Ministry of Education , said : &quot; &quot; the start of pre@@ p @-@ process is welcome to months delay and del@@ ayed realization through the government and over@@ due . &quot;
the evidence show how transform@@ ative this drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this lifetime infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of pre@@ p .
&quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people , HIV are infected , and that they will contribute to a step closer to the end of the spread of HIV in society . &quot;
the great life live : me@@ zz@@ anine and clever designers @-@ tricks have turned this small Ear@@ ls Court accommodation in a generous home
&quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , resi@@ zed in 2014 by a big house in Kn@@ ight@@ s@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court Apartment . &quot;
it is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed their bags and sold .
&quot; before , I lived with my ex into Kn@@ ight@@ s@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; says Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; I was looking for something that was comparable to my price .
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court and it had the same high ceilings .
I love me in love and made an offer on this day . &quot;
&quot; since the first visit the 1,000 square pass was completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
originally a one @-@ room property with a w@@ ax@@ ed layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - wanted to add a seat room and me@@ zz@@ anine to make the generous coverage height .
&quot; I wanted to have high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot;
&quot; this was my requirement , &quot; &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , she int@@ ends the Architek@@ tur@@ - and Design@@ studio Duck &amp; S@@ hed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill , the 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not just a development , but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms , so that the architectural challenge existed to create a me@@ zz@@ anine in which one could stand . &quot;
Er@@ fan had to be creative to solve the task .
&quot; the ste@@ el@@ works is rather complicated , &quot; he explains . &quot;
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms so they were sh@@ elled , without having had to move away . &quot;
&quot; it not only went to build a simple platform , but the steel that it had for the function at the top or at the bottom the right height had . &quot;
&quot; this arrangement allowed it Er@@ fan , two rooms place in full altitude - with a lot of additional drama . &quot;
for the me@@ zz@@ anine looks a classic cow @-@ blue window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us via the glam@@ orous living area .
&quot; lined Gold@@ proof , sil@@ ver@@ ne dialect and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting put the style for the program . &quot;
&quot; the use of mir@@ rors plays a role in addition to theatre , space and light . &quot;
both ends is mir@@ ro@@ red on both ends to run him longer .
in the kitchen the mirror feels like a window to another room .
at the entrance we can accommodate all the cut@@ lery and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
&quot; due to the perception of a glam@@ orous smok@@ er , the beauty of the sitting room can complete the kitchen if it is not used . &quot;
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
what is special about this is that it is a guarantee .
&quot; a bit of engineering was going into &quot; , &quot; explains the fan of the st@@ ahl@@ reinforced , fur@@ ther@@ ed M@@ DF @-@ door . &quot;
&quot; it is per@@ plex@@ ed so that when you push the door , very light gli@@ des . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the clever use of space and storage room could accommodate additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and a improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the ground floor - or how your property is appreciated , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate mak@@ ler will enter and perform a calculation based on the soil size . &quot;
&quot; here , they managed to enlarge the ground floor and at the same time use high quality materials which provide the room its luxurious advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things that you touch and which hence help to create a emotional bond in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t love you into the electric power in the walls . &quot;
&quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square met@@ er@@ als of something special .
&quot; in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could choose to leave this not . &quot;
brothers are fighting for a 500 million US @-@ dollar real estate imperi@@ alis@@ ms .
&quot; two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dyn@@ asty , in an analysis because of one of the largest real estate imper@@ ative Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as worth over 500 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton football club &apos; and developers Colin De Lut@@ is lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their business may be split . &quot;
&quot; Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp confrontation with the separation occurs in the Supreme Court of Justice . &quot;
&quot; together with her mother Anna the brothers 38 properties found in the value of more than half a billion dollars , accum@@ ulated since the family in 1973 a shop on Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood . &quot;
there the family of West@@ co je@@ ans and grew up to a chain of 160 retailers .
it was sold 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
&quot; this money has been invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lut@@ is now covers offices in the city centre , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the suburbs . &quot;
&quot; after an agreement with her late father Colin - by Paul is described as &quot; &quot; main driver and the domin@@ ating personality &quot; &quot; in the family De Lut@@ is - about two thir@@ ds of the business unit and Paul about one third . &quot;
it states that this means that Colin is the value of 3@@ 16 million dollars and Paul in the value of 176 million dollars .
the division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul as a problem .
&quot; the following from Colin proposed will have left him with which I held for the best objects , he wrote in 2015 in a first aff@@ id@@ av@@ it . &quot;
last Friday the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place on the last Friday .
&quot; the brothers now also struggle to control over existing business - from which Colin , as Paul claimed to be ruled out . &quot;
&quot; Colin argu@@ ed that this is not true , but raises Paul to manage some pos@@ sessions . &quot;
&quot; in an early aff@@ id@@ av@@ it , which was submitted by Colin , he says he hope to come together . &quot;
&quot; my Italian heritage writes , that the family is the most important priority , he wrote . &quot;
&quot; the costs will rise in the case , with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , E @-@ Mails and reports of companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading coun@@ tri@@ ads , including Allan My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and by both sides har@@ dened law firms . &quot;
Mrs. De Lut@@ is and her dec@@ eased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants the Mil@@ bars and Del@@ ik@@ at@@ ess@@ en@@ during the late 1950 &apos;s years and bought a business in Br@@ uns@@ wick .
&quot; they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood recumbent , in the Colin from the first Je@@ un@@ loading of the family . &quot;
&quot; Colin says that he started to West@@ co , when he was in my last years of high school , when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
&quot; Anna De Lut@@ is says that she died and Luigi , who died in 2012 , was hop@@ ed to pass their property to their sons . &quot;
&quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted to land the brothers before judgment , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lut@@ is Group , with Colin says that Mark in leaving the company 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; both Luke and Mark be as Mark , says Paul &quot; had become bitter about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot;
Colin has looked back very back although he was a former AF@@ L pre @-@ board member and after a biography from 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of the TV stars .
Fair@@ fax Media took contact with Colin and Paul De Lut@@ is and their leaders .
&quot; only Colin rep@@ lied to SMS , to say &quot; I can really not say much &quot; because the case before the courts . &quot;
&quot; it is very , very sad , that my brother Paul decided to complain and to draw our surname through the dishes , he wrote . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of 2016 , Colin in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother . &quot;
&quot; our father did not know that Paul and I would end in our current dispute , &quot; &quot; he said and added that he still hope for a solution . &quot;
on Friday the hope seemed to be past .
&quot; our matter will be solved in the near future of the courts , &quot; wrote Colin . &quot;
Tru@@ mp@@ s new St@@ ability is planning to limit the media ab@@ stin@@ ence of the President .
others have tried and have failed .
maybe John F. Kelly it can actually do .
&quot; if yes , he will be the first . &quot;
Polit@@ ico reports that the new rod of the White House is planning to restri@@ ct information to President Tru@@ mp - including reports of news media - in the hope to keep the boss on a uniform course .
here is a piece by Reporter Jos@@ h Daw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new rod of the White House , at his first working day with intro@@ duc@@ tory staff , he set a major problem in President Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s White House , which he wanted to print : bad information that entered into the hands of the President . &quot;
&quot; Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow through him - whether on paper or in letters - because the president would make better decisions , if he would get good information . &quot;
cell@@ phones diagnosis makes sense but others tries to t@@ ame Tru@@ mp by monitor its medi@@ endi@@ ces .
&quot; President Tru@@ mp@@ s relationship with television enough decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his TV value is still strong . &quot;
&quot; when Candi@@ date Tru@@ mp was anno@@ yed because of an in@@ fair coverage , it was productive to show him that he was a fair reporting of places that were to convince , &quot; said the former elect@@ oral campaign Sam Nun@@ berg in February to Polit@@ ico . &quot;
&quot; Polit@@ ic@@ os Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; the key to keep Tru@@ mp@@ s Twitter habit under control , according to six former election campaign officials to ensure that its personal media accounts includes a ste@@ ady praise price . &quot;
okay .
&quot; but the idea that Tru@@ mp@@ s Twitter habit ever &quot; under control &quot; was ridicul@@ ous .
perhaps this campaign was something that we do not know others - that Tru@@ mp@@ s Twe@@ ets could not have any more ign@@ ition or more ign@@ ition .
we will probably never know something about twe@@ ets which Tru@@ mp has not been sent .
&quot; when his collabor@@ ators had taken it several times , anger of him , then their efforts have been worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; however , nobody can prevent it consistently that Tru@@ mp contro@@ vers@@ y is calling . &quot;
&quot; part of the problem consists of the people in a White House , which consists of comp@@ eting fac@@ tions , always try to present their own agenda by promoting Tru@@ mp material that possibly promotes their views from the world . &quot;
&quot; Polit@@ ico - very busy with this story - was reported in May about the preference of the consultants , the president of strategic reasons for des@@ perate information . &quot;
this was an example that was described by Reporter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former Tru@@ mp officials say that Tru@@ mp can react as a volcano on negative press releases , especially those with sham@@ eful le@@ ak@@ ks , and that he asc@@ ends to find out how these come . &quot;
&quot; exactly this happened at the end of February , when someone asked a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ room@@ .com , the website of the Internet pro@@ voc@@ at@@ eurs Charles C. Johnson , who proclaimed the dep@@ uty st@@ aff@@ in K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; the source behind a bunch of le@@ aks to be in the White House . &quot;
&quot; although Johnson had been ban@@ ished because of chic@@ anas , or that he has no concrete evidence offered or that he expressed false accus@@ ations in the past and to cancel it . &quot;
Tru@@ mp read the article and began to ask employees about Wal@@ sh .
&quot; Gold@@ macher added that the former property St@@ ef Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage the pap@@ er@@ work and document the Tru@@ mp . &quot;
how did that work ?
&quot; Kelly tries to do it three months later , the same thing . &quot;
&quot; maybe he will prove to be more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tru@@ mp is still his imp@@ ul@@ sive self , and his consultants are still looking for influence . &quot;
these un@@ changeable factors make wa@@ iter mission very difficult .
master@@ ed crimin@@ als get Post from Euro@@ pol
&quot; since the address is unknown , the co @-@ operation of the population is given and hop@@ ed . &quot;
police throughout Europe are sent in this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards on dangerous crimin@@ als on the run .
&quot; as the addresses of the sought @-@ bre@@ aker men are not known , they are hop@@ ed from the population and pray . &quot;
Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the action that follows the &apos; EU Most W@@ anted &apos; Advent@@ cal@@ ender from the winter .
&quot; the experiences could have shown that many vol@@ at@@ ile destinations , it was on the part of Euro@@ pol . &quot;
you have compiled 21 post@@ cards for selected crimin@@ als from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 there are the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ o wanted more than 2.5 million times this has been viewed .
&quot; 36 of the online songs could have been arrested until now , at least eleven of these were based on the publication on the website . &quot;
travellers negotiate on a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; milli@@ on@@ look@@ er series &apos;
some of the aff@@ lu@@ ent land@@ owners of the West Mi@@ dl@@ ands are back with some resol@@ ute travellers on war foot which have acted one of the municipality of drawn dit@@ ch to claim a field in front of their man@@ sions .
&quot; the travellers have their 20 caravan on a field outside a wealthy street of Soli@@ h@@ ull , which is called the &quot; &quot; milli@@ on@@ ous series &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they have brought horses , babies and an army of transp@@ orter , after they have been thrown down in May without being deport@@ ed by any of the Council to prevent their accidents . &quot;
&quot; the tac@@ tical group found a gap in the def@@ ences of the def@@ ences , and op@@ pres@@ sive their vehicles remained through a section , which remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way . &quot;
&quot; angry inhabitants have noted the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull , who said that it was &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot;
&quot; an anonymous inhabitants said , &quot; They have moved there on the Monday evening after they were sent from Bentley He@@ ath where they have thrown stones upon the pas@@ sers . &quot;
&quot; the Council must act as a rule by shame , as he was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot;
the travellers were there in May and are moved back and are now back .
&quot; more arrived yesterday evening , probably today more . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to deal with it by keeping long under@@ signs to protect their parks . &quot;
I cry without on the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I am not happy to continue to pay my common needs if the Council cannot even stop it .
&quot; a resident who did not want to be called , &quot; &quot; it is ridicul@@ ous , we have just seen the last lap of this trav@@ eler , just to be lo@@ oted by another round . &quot;
the figures have raised this time and you even have seen a horse in the park area . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ person of the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull said : &quot; &quot; we are aware of a un@@ authorized camp in the country beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to move it as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; to support our evidence , it is very important that as many residents to report a anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police by calling 101 . &quot;
&quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must check , when we present our case . &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof is Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the house in front of the gates of Freuden@@ stadt is currently being renovated and will be opened on March 1 next year .
these are good news for the city .
&quot; for with the closing of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof by the former ambi@@ ance operating company , 13 April 2014 were lost approximately 30 000 nights per year and also income through the tourist tax . &quot;
&quot; in the autumn of 2014 the dramatically rising numbers of refugees who came into the district of the district , the hotel buildings of the Land@@ scape with a collecting accommodation , which provided for contra@@ vers@@ y discussion . &quot;
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers by setting up an illustration plan to secure the area as a hotel site .
the decision was at that time no un@@ disp@@ uted at that time .
&quot; but above all Freuden@@ stadt , Ober@@ may@@ or Julian Os@@ s@@ wald def@@ ended the hotel grounds and already talked about serious pro@@ spective buyers to the house . &quot;
he should be right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ otels with office in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern has acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof in a voluntary au@@ ction in Berlin and wants to make it back to a home of three @-@ star @-@ Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freuden@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Her@@ ren@@ al@@ b .
&quot; hot Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; at the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof have been at the long time of Bau@@ sch@@ utt@@ container in front of the entrance , and if one enters the house , it becomes clear , what extensive renov@@ ations will be done . &quot;
&quot; the so@@ ils were removed out , blankets to part , old bath@@ tu@@ bs from the rooms . &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
until March there is much to do .
&quot; it is actually a lovely hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
everything is meant to be renewed in the Black @-@ style style .
&quot; the rooms are fitted with large walk@@ able showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , there will be new windows . &quot;
&quot; everything should be &quot; &quot; nice brus@@ g@@ ern@@ ah &quot; &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses . &quot;
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; swimming pool , spa and a meeting room are part of the equipment . &quot;
&quot; however , one would not want to position himself at the high level of hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but at an up@@ scale level of inner @-@ level . &quot;
&quot; the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms ap@@ points to broad places , explains Sch@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; both single vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or busin@@ ess@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel . &quot;
talks with O@@ B Julian Os@@ s@@ wald and Tourism director Michael Kr@@ ause has already led him so sc@@ iss@@ ors .
the ideas of the city are identical with those of the hotel @-@ group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; after the amount of investment demand , Thomas Sch@@ erer will not want to define itself exactly . &quot;
&quot; nearly under a million euros , he expects . &quot;
&quot; the outdoor systems are also placed in front , which is already clearly visible . &quot;
&quot; in a courtyard comes a large terrace , which is open to the restaurant that is open to the public . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freuden@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ aires : U.S. Speci@@ ators sets Grand Jury
in the Russia affair of US @-@ President Donald Tru@@ mp was intended to have a so @-@ called Grand Jury for a report by Robert Mu@@ eller .
&quot; the committee in the past few weeks have recorded the work , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; under appeal on with the matter familiar persons . &quot;
&quot; the paper value the step as a sign that mu@@ eller have extended its profitability , and intensi@@ fied . &quot;
the sender of CN@@ N reported that there are already first pre @-@ inv@@ itations of the gre@@ ens associated with a meeting between Tru@@ mp@@ s of the oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
&quot; U.S. intelligence services sh@@ ields the Kre@@ m@@ lin since long @-@ term , targeted in the presidential election of 2016 . &quot;
Mu@@ eller studied whether there were there between Tru@@ mp@@ s elect@@ oral campaign and Moscow .
&quot; in the focus of the proce@@ eds , several men are to stand in the election campaign as a consultant of the Republi@@ can . &quot;
&quot; according to , Mu@@ eller took more and more Tru@@ mp@@ s private and business environment under the micro@@ scope . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; Washington Post &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the special representative Tru@@ mp wrote personally to the center and re@@ forest@@ ry , whether the president may have disabled the judi@@ ciary in the course of the affair . &quot;
the main task of Grand j@@ uries is to consider present evidence of possible inter@@ rup@@ tions and determine whether indic@@ t@@ ment is to be charged .
Grand j@@ uries are therefore also called Pro@@ secution .
mostly they are swit@@ ched when it comes to larger and counter cases .
the procedure has always been closed behind closed doors .
the panel can also be swit@@ ched on from the Pro@@ secutor &apos;s office to advance individuals under E@@ id .
&quot; according to the CN@@ N sender , pre @-@ inv@@ itations were already issued to the meeting between Donald Tru@@ mp J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
individuals who were involved in the meeting were asked to be given to a statement it was in the report .
&quot; moreover , they should provide documents . &quot;
beside Tru@@ mp J@@ r. also Tru@@ mp@@ s couns@@ ellor and son @-@ in @-@ law Jar@@ ed K@@ ush@@ ner as well as his former Secretary @-@ chief Paul Man@@ a@@ fort led to the interview .
&quot; legal experts said on Thursday night in the U.S. television , that the enforcement show that mu@@ eller &apos;s not shy away in his work and that he should be necessary to act quickly . &quot;
&quot; however , it should not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on to the end of an indic@@ t@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the enforcement of the body is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason to concern Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the new revel@@ ations , the President on Thursday evening took a speech in West Virginia , in order to present Russia &apos;s affair as a campaign to its political opponents . &quot;
&quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; said Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; the subject give the Democrats an opportunity to feel good , because they have nothing else to talk about which they can talk . &quot;
&quot; his special T@@ y Cob@@ b declared in an opinion , he know nothing by the translation of a Grand Jury . &quot;
&quot; but this work also usually in secret , stressed . &quot;
the White House feared any measures that will acceler@@ ated the work of special concern on &quot; fair &quot; mode .
the former F@@ BI @-@ boss James Com@@ ey have said three times that not may be determined against the President .
&quot; I have no reason to accept that something has changed , it was in the explanation . &quot;
Mu@@ eller was only used after Tru@@ mp Com@@ ey had been fil@@ med .
&quot; because of this re@@ sign@@ age , accus@@ ations had become loud against Tru@@ mp , he taught the judi@@ ciary . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ey said in June before a must@@ ard committee , Tru@@ mp asked him to ask a setting of issu@@ ers against the then national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ ynn . &quot;
the President stands for the investigation of great pressure .
&quot; according to the representation of U.S. media , the White House Material Coll@@ ected the White House and its employees . &quot;
the delet@@ ing spec@@ ulation about whether Tru@@ mp Mu@@ eller wants to release mu@@ eller .
&quot; unlike an independent special representative of the Congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair , the later president Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller gave a position in which it could theore@@ tically folded on the ur@@ ging of the President of the judi@@ cial Ministry . &quot;
several Sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step but prevention .
&quot; two groups of rep@@ ubli@@ can and democratic Sen@@ ators concluded on Thursday , according to which the special bro@@ kers could no longer be released as easy . &quot;
Antarc@@ tica : gigantic Ic@@ eberg is driving in the Antarc@@ tic
in the West@@ ant@@ ar@@ ktis you have solved a gigantic Ic@@ eberg of the almost seven @-@ fold size of Berlin .
this shared the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ Weg@@ ener @-@ Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
&quot; over a Bil@@ lion tons of heavy and 5@@ 800 square @-@ kilomet@@ re large pist@@ on t@@ inge now to the north and will probably be two , three years until he mel@@ ted . &quot;
it is registered with 175 kilometers of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers one of the largest ice creams to have registered the researchers over the past three decades .
there is no danger to people from him .
&quot; however , climate change has played a role in the quar@@ ry of the Ic@@ eberg , is still unclear . &quot;
&quot; however , there has been a series of unusual break@@ down@@ s of rail@@ roads in the region , writes the U.S. research centre for snow and ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a fact pit . &quot;
&quot; according to many researchers , this could be related to the heating up . &quot;
the D@@ broken pist@@ on has so far been a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C che@@ eses .
che@@ ek flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by large gl@@ ac@@ iers .
it continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ sol@@ os lies south of South America almost at the top of the ant@@ ar@@ kt@@ ischen peninsula .
north of this Schel@@ de@@ ed was the balance of w@@ ax@@ ing and w@@ rest@@ breaking some years ago .
a complete che@@ ek may have gone there , writes AW@@ I @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m talking about that also the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ sol@@ em@@ n &apos;s danger , because the dere edge have never moved so far as currently . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the ice @-@ plate is under voltage and could dis@@ integrate , if on a key point is a piece of drinking . &quot;
&quot; the mel@@ ting of Schel@@ cow@@ ards and ic@@ eberg does not increase the sea level , because they swim in water and ice so much water as it turns after the mel@@ ting itself . &quot;
&quot; however , the loss of the Schel@@ de@@ ed causes the gl@@ ac@@ iers to flow directly into the sea as well as much faster than before . &quot;
&quot; this could possibly increase the sea level , but only in the least , the British research project on the observation of the Antarc@@ tic ( Mi@@ das ) . &quot;
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Shel@@ em@@ n is according to AW@@ I information with almost 50 000 square kilometres and the fourth largest che@@ eses of the Antarc@@ tica .
&quot; at the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean around 200 meters . &quot;
there it breaks down regularly .
&quot; although there is a natural thing and no direct connection is aware of climate change , the Ic@@ ef@@ all comes into a dangerous position , &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ Lear@@ n from the British Sw@@ an@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the most extensive retreat since the beginning of the record , &quot; he confirmed . &quot;
&quot; under scientists would be controversi@@ al , whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C che@@ ers will again grow back or back on the long term , and possibly coll@@ ap@@ sed , his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take several decades .
&quot; even if this researchers did not lead to change this giant ic@@ eberg of climate change , so in the past few decades there are many ic@@ eberg of the ant@@ ar@@ kt@@ ischen peninsula . &quot;
this long term of the Antarc@@ tic extends in the direction of South America .
according to data from the research programme of British Antarc@@ tic Survey is the ice @-@ surface of the ant@@ ar@@ kt@@ ischen peninsula since the 19@@ 50s .
&quot; finally , the decline has contributed to the decline . &quot;
the Antarc@@ tic@@ ic peninsula took place in the past 50 years around three degrees and t@@ ames to the areas where the temperature is fastest growing .
CD@@ U wants Hau@@ star@@ if at the staff
&quot; because it becomes more and more difficult to occup@@ y it freely , the CD@@ U calls out of the employer association to become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; just before the summer @-@ break , the Kre@@ ist@@ ag has passed 41 new positions in the administration . &quot;
&quot; more than 1,@@ 100 employees and officials work for the administration in M@@ ett@@ mann . &quot;
now 17 tra@@ inees have their first working day behind .
the appren@@ tices at the circle are apparently very talented .
approximately 620 applications were to be buried in this year .
nevertheless the circle is still missing staff to cope with the Asc@@ ended requirements and tasks .
currently there are at the circle M@@ ett@@ mann still in front of 50 do not occupied bodies .
&quot; sear@@ ched among other things , doctors and engineers and powers of general administration . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to take the initiative in the Cre@@ ist@@ ag together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG &apos;s initiative and join the dep@@ uty @-@ angel in the administration .
the administration is intended to work according to the wish of the parties &quot; a concept for recru@@ itment and recru@@ itment . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to cover not only short @-@ term equipment for skilled workers , but forward @-@ looking for applic@@ ability , means it . &quot;
&quot; the overall concept should be oriented towards inside and outside , concrete measures for cross@@ roads and include a training point , challenge CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot;
this is how it sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has done it with personal problems that you didn &apos;t know earlier .
other towns advert@@ ise good officials and employees and offer attractive conditions .
the speech is from a down@@ right &quot; competition of the public employers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a high number of employees , the disease or alter@@ ation of service is derived from the service . &quot;
&quot; thus , the highest time for action thus , thus no longer remain un@@ occupied . &quot;
&quot; but Klaus @-@ Dieter peoples , leader of the CD@@ U , continues with his party even beyond the common motion . &quot;
he did so long ago in the cre@@ ist@@ ag for a f@@ ry surprise when he asked the recru@@ itment public into question and the rest of the parties were flo@@ wer@@ ed .
peoples wants to examine all the possibilities that give an ex@@ iting from the municipal Employ@@ ers association .
&quot; if we come here not at short notice at a satis@@ factory solution , the administration with the trade unions - perhaps also in collaboration with the circular cities - a rash aim , &quot; as peoples . &quot;
&quot; in this way the CD@@ U , the employees and officials tries to pay better than the tari@@ ffs is actually intended for the public service . &quot;
&quot; the sal@@ aries are currently pre@@ written , increases or more money there is only when you move into a higher level that is focused on professional years . &quot;
but the tasks of the circle have increasingly grown up over the past few years .
&quot; only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be furnished , in which employees care about the provisions of the new pro@@ stitution protection law . &quot;
&quot; not least due to the rising number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hen@@ del@@ e and Kreis@@ ky director Martin Richter has a problem : they have too little staff . &quot;
Italy ex@@ ac@@ erb@@ ated the tone for NGO @-@ migrants lif@@ ebo@@ ats
&quot; Italy has war@@ med NGOs , the lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they cannot continue to hold on new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs have no new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how to continue working , &quot; &quot; said Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Tur@@ iner daily La St@@ ampa . &quot;
Minn@@ itis warning came a day after the Italian authorities had sei@@ zed the boat of the German aid organisation &apos; Youth R@@ ettet &apos; because their team had worked effectively with human tra@@ ders in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
&quot; the aid organisation , which has only been operating for a year in operation , decl@@ ined to express themselves in the exec@@ utions of the Italian state of the Italian state Amb@@ ro@@ gio Cart@@ osi@@ o . &quot;
&quot; for us , the saving of human life remains our top priority . so we are sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone , &quot; said the organization in an opinion on social media . &quot;
&quot; we can all alleg@@ ations , which are currently collected , only ass@@ essed after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot;
&quot; the Italian authorities had the boat from &apos; youth R@@ ettet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , has been monitored since October . &quot;
&quot; it is thought that its occupation infl@@ atable boat migrants will take on board , which can be delivered directly from man &apos;s hands , and that the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers can be used again , so that ships can be used again . &quot;
&quot; at least one such meeting , supp@@ osedly found only 1.3 miles in front of the Libyan coast , according to the acquisition of the state bre@@ wing , whose contents of Italian media was published . &quot;
&quot; the occupation is suspected of dis@@ cour@@ aged on the authority of the Italian Co@@ est@@ ation , the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not of any other mot@@ ives . &quot;
&quot; under the Code of Con@@ duct , boats like the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must also have an Italian police officer who monitored their activities . &quot;
&quot; three of the nine NGOs who are involved in search and rescue operations , have so far been willing to keep up to code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered un@@ necessary , but acceptable , as they would not have any &quot; significant changes or disabilities &quot; of their rescue actions . &quot;
&quot; among those who refuse to sign , is the Nobel @-@ tor organization for doctors without borders ( M@@ SF ) . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , Minn@@ iti said that the number of migrants led to the rescue operations in Italy during the last weeks , that the efforts aimed at strengthening the Libyan coast guard and the cooperation with local civil society . &quot;
&quot; in recent days we started to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; he gave plans for further discussions with Libyan authorities in this month on economic development initiatives and with Tsch@@ ad , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants that can reach these countries in the hope to reach Europe . &quot;
Ascen@@ sions and tri@@ als
&quot; nine W@@ eil@@ er@@ mer Biker , the &quot; &quot; Berlin out@@ post &quot; &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the Nord@@ pf@@ alz , for four days long run and to enjoy landmarks . &quot;
there were three friend@@ ships available .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer Valley turned out to be a good starting point for tours .
the castle and W@@ einf@@ est of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome .
the first tour conducted in hot summer temperatures along the vineyard to the Michael &apos;s Chapel above D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim .
&quot; it followed look@@ out points , partly on towers , of which one could look far beyond the Pf@@ al@@ zer Forest and the prec@@ eding levels . &quot;
&quot; in between there was still longer a long time , for the long run . &quot;
on the second day it went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to Sal@@ ine and the continental market .
&quot; again at view@@ point , look@@ out is at look@@ out spot , connected by &quot; flo@@ ating &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot;
over the last two days were again a lot of high@@ t .
&quot; caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and bars . &quot;
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim at@@ ched the bi@@ kers in the free@@ wheel of a cur@@ ative Sole .
We@@ j@@ her@@ owo became controlled .
after 173 kilometers and almost 4500 @-@ meters the group had met the Pf@@ al@@ zer forest of his best side - sport@@ y and cultur@@ ally - .
console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ lig@@ a retro@@ fit for e @-@ sport
&quot; are the sports stars in the future in front of computer consoles , instead of fighting with wind and weather over the stadium . &quot;
fact : e @-@ sport has long been a serious industry that has become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gifts . &quot;
these have also recognized the first Bundes@@ lig@@ aver@@ a which is increasingly involved in this field .
&quot; in the beginning of 2015 the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later followed the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , founded in mid July an e @-@ sport Department and took two pros for the computer game FIFA . &quot;
&quot; we hope to inspire a whole new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says Chairman Jochen Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
he is sure that on these train still has several clubs climb .
&quot; the coming weekend , the football @-@ world association will be organized to London the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; where the gam@@ er of various clubs will compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; besides Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , you have qualified for example Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Eindhoven . &quot;
Robin Dut@@ t sees great potential in the E @-@ Sport .
the ex @-@ Trainer of Bayer Lever@@ k@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen advis@@ es a agency for virtual football players .
&quot; the real football must deal with the 14 to 30 year @-@ olds , that young people will go into the stadium even into the stadium , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; and : the clubs tried to conquer all sorts of markets , especially the Asian . &quot;
&quot; with prominent e @-@ sport@@ smen , the contract might be much more present on these markets than once in the year the Bundes@@ lig@@ am@@ ann@@ ahs to Asia . &quot;
why is it exactly ?
&quot; e @-@ sport computer games like &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Counter@@ strike &quot; or just the football simulation of FIFA on competition level . &quot;
&quot; long ago , as in normal sports also , le@@ agues are established , in which the pros can compete against each other . &quot;
and in the Asia @-@ play E @-@ Sport already part of the official program .
but is it all about a proper sport ?
for many is the idea for sure .
also Ingo F@@ rob@@ ous has a long time to deal with the question .
&quot; for the Professor at the German Spor@@ ury School in Cologne E @-@ Sport , E @-@ Sport is a sport , because it is know@@ led@@ geable and many biological and physical reactions which can be found in classical sport - such as increased heart frequencies , stress @-@ actions , hormonal changes . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , there is cognitive skills , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a quick response . &quot;
&quot; professional gamers should not only be on the console , but also their body to exercise and pay attention to the diet . &quot;
&quot; the f@@ itte player is a good player . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and no more problems : &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more a theme . &quot;
&quot; checks are difficult to perform in online gaming , and in the scene was missing the structures of the classic sport . &quot;
the scientists highlights the high integr@@ ative effect of the E @-@ Sports .
&quot; the players are internationally on the way , that is like a big global family , there are no inter@@ cultural interest . &quot;
a study of the affiliates Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association Inter@@ active Entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) tells the e @-@ sport a rapid growth ahead .
&quot; in order to be implemented in Germany 50 million euros , mainly on advertising , sponsor@@ ing and large tournaments . &quot;
sales in three years is expected to lie at 130 million in three years .
against the nearly 2.4 billion euros of the soccer le@@ ague is that little .
&quot; however , the E @-@ Sport is not far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice @-@ hock@@ ey , write the Del@@ o@@ itte @-@ consultants . &quot;
international are many countries already .
large markets are Asia and the US where ex @-@ bas@@ ket@@ ball@@ ers Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez will participate in the US team NR@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood @-@ actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher is investing in the e@@ Sport competitions .
also in Europe is doing a lot .
&quot; in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport had been introduced as a classroom , &quot; said F@@ rob@@ us . &quot;
in the Netherlands and in France the football @-@ birth@@ a associations noisy Dut@@ t is now obliged to set up an e @-@ sport department .
&quot; in the European comparison , Germany decl@@ ined &quot; , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B member of the board of Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; not only in nost@@ algia , and the old times should be clari@@ fied , today is no longer enough . &quot;
&quot; it is therefore going to keep the tradition of the organisation , but also to al@@ ign the company at the same time . &quot;
&quot; we live in a digital world , &quot; says Dut@@ t . &quot;
&quot; then you cannot hold on it , that only when football it all remains as it always was . &quot;

&quot; Michelle Carter because of the lyrics , the Conrad Roy joined the su@@ icide . &quot;
a woman from Massachusetts was sent@@ enced to two and a half years because she has encouraged her friend to su@@ icide and calls for su@@ icide .
&quot; Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of their condem@@ nation behind Git@@ tern and five years were exposed to mal@@ nutrition . &quot;
Carter was sent@@ enced in June for the neg@@ ligent killing of Conrad Roy which took life on 13 July 2014 .
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is unknown .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to stay free until calling .
she had been confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years but her law@@ ful argu@@ ed that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a psychiat@@ ric illness .
&quot; dressed in red pants and a cream @-@ coloured blu@@ epr@@ int , Carter da with tears in the eyes , with folded hands and down@@ right eyes , when it was sent@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; their actions have taken as Conrad Roy , &quot; &quot; said the pro@@ secutor of the court . &quot;
she ended his life to make their own better .
&quot; she has no responsibility taken , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; she has no re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
&quot; but Car@@ ters attor@@ ney said , it was a &quot; terrible circum@@ stance , which they fully regret . &quot;
&quot; however , judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said he did not find out that their &quot; age or maturity or even their cl@@ ergy have a significant influence on their actions . &quot;
a pro@@ secutor read a statement by Ro@@ &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy that there is no day that I don &apos;t smoke the loss of my beloved Son .
&quot; I want to be proud of me and how I am walking with everything . I try to bear in spite of all my pain that we will carry for eternity with us to be there for his sisters , &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that it will be pursued by the knowledge &quot; &quot; that they will never be part of the wedding of her brother , or a a@@ unt for his children . &quot;
&quot; not more this only person to have , with whom I stayed together every day , is a pain that I will always keep staying with me for the rest of my life , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the case seems to put a legal preced@@ ence because there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to commit , su@@ icide . &quot;
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in 2014 by a carbon oxid@@ ation in a vehicle .
&quot; the case attracted national attention to himself , after Car@@ ters text@@ books revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life . &quot;
&quot; ham@@ g you on , spring from a building , create yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many paths , &quot; she said in several news that she sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on holiday with his family . &quot;
&quot; in the moments before his su@@ icide , she wrote : &quot; you have to do it , Conrad &quot; and &quot; Everything what you have to do is to turn the generator , and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Th@@ iz said that Carter &apos;s attention was sought by the death of Roy and ord@@ ained that they should benefit from the case through any press .
the case has given the legal opinion .
&quot; to the few , the Carter def@@ ended , Am@@ anda Knox , was sent@@ enced in Italy because of murder at their British ro@@ omm@@ ate in Italy before it was acqu@@ itted for two years ago . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Knox , 30 years old , published in the Los Angeles Times a comment : &quot; Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua K@@ imm@@ i : learn from the new Mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua K@@ imm@@ i was allowed when Audi Cup was a captain in the Audi Cup .
the FC Bayern separates the Con@@ fed cup winner a big season to - Extra motivation is not ground@@ ed .
&quot; something was different at his place in the cabin , that saw Joshua K@@ imm@@ ich immediately , even if the extra gar@@ ment was very , very small . &quot;
&quot; but since far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups there was of course no Philipp Lah@@ m and no Manuel Neu@@ er , he made himself rus@@ hed bin@@ aries on the arm . &quot;
&quot; the coach did not have announced , &quot; told the Con@@ fed Cup winner , after his first use as a Bayern Captain . &quot;
well the entry could have been better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the sign from the coach I could also suggest that .
&quot; not the eight year older Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al was chosen in youth , Deb@@ ut@@ ants and straight from the holiday professionals existing C @-@ El@@ f as a leader . &quot;
&quot; in sugar , one is most ad@@ orable to those who want to add a lot that can be kept in La@@ un@@ ae . &quot;
&quot; so who was chosen to commen@@ ce the heritage of Lah@@ m , a small extra @-@ motivation can only be used . &quot;
&quot; K@@ imm@@ i confirm , &quot; This is what you want as a player to take on responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday fl@@ ashing the 22 @-@ year @-@ old as mini @-@ Lah@@ m over the field .
&quot; right behind , this is now his position , the white bin@@ de on the arm did its rest . &quot;
&quot; and at all , K@@ imm@@ i also worked in this startup , like the one who can take the rod the best into the hand . &quot;
he gave instructions to direct the un@@ played tro@@ upe .
he had the view for the whole while many others were busy with themselves .
&quot; Vid@@ al thus to trans@@ mit his missing fitness ( fol@@ ly hard ) ; Renato San@@ ches with them to get out of the performances of Asia @-@ trip ( folding also only partly ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le was not neg@@ li@@ fied in their first appearance at the Bavaria Tri@@ ko@@ t . &quot;
this was all very good .
&quot; sweet went to K@@ imm@@ i , Rud@@ y in front of the f@@ le on both ag@@ ated sovereign . &quot;
&quot; the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli storm did so often difficult , in addition the sweet@@ ness was also successful in the player for a few times . &quot;
&quot; his colleague Rud@@ y had to say that the result was &quot; &quot; not so , as we have hop@@ ed for . &quot;
&quot; however , he also showed a neat performance . &quot;
&quot; playing , Temp@@ ow@@ ech@@ oes : &quot; for this style I was also fet@@ ched . &quot;
&quot; as usual this Bavaria world was still available for the novel@@ ty , one looked at the match . &quot;
&quot; Rud@@ y for example gave in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs not one or two , but determined six or seven interviews . &quot;
K@@ imm@@ ich passed away after a few cr@@ ack statements in the back of his new fellow @-@ players .
&quot; there he listened to an interesting sentence : &quot; &quot; what is going on here , I have already noticed . &quot;
at Bavaria you just have to win every game .
&quot; after all , it does not have to teach the new one anymore . &quot;
Al@@ aba motivated Ö@@ F@@ B @-@ Women

Austria &apos;s most famous foot@@ b@@ aller has been reported shortly before the play via Twitter and the Ö@@ F@@ B ladies all the best desired .

company satisfied with rh@@ ine @-@ state minister : economy pra@@ ises Wis@@ ła Tempo
&quot; it is often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ ably , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as Ev@@ eline Lem@@ ke ( Green ) and the Minister of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palatinate . &quot;
this shows more than one year in which the new economic Minister Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region talk to T V @-@ request from a change in economic policy - and bl@@ aze at the same time the old ministry .
&quot; Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association Tri@@ erer Company ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; &quot; Wis@@ sing &quot; &quot; takes the wishes of the economy to the Lem@@ ke all the Lem@@ ke . &quot;
the largest K@@ ehr@@ t@@ wende sees Nat@@ us in the infrastructure : the Mos@@ quito of the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is at the pri@@ or@@ pri@@ ght list of the country now on top .
this year the ministry hopes to establish a plan procedure until 2021 should be the building right .
&quot; a role in the plans of the country also plays the West@@ um@@ geh@@ ung Trier , which stands in the urgent need of the federal state . &quot;
&quot; the goal was to take the route in December 2020 , says Minister of Ministers of Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ us sees a sign@@ post to support regional , but international comp@@ eting companies . &quot;
&quot; the industrial and Chamber of Commerce ( I@@ HK ) Trier sh@@ ines as by Wis@@ sing , when wine has an Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palatinate @-@ Label to increase the sales volumes in super@@ markets and stop the trend of the long term German wine exports . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to start their own company , pra@@ ised the I@@ HK . &quot;
the Handwerk@@ skammer Trier provides an additional incentive for young tra@@ inees , Managing Director Matthias Schwal@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; provided is a bonus of 1000 euros for the independent Championships and 2500 euros , if gradu@@ ates within ten years after the master@@ ing formation is self @-@ employed . &quot;
the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
&quot; at the planned road construction , fast facts can be created , at the same time lacking the country at the necessary staff , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , chief executive secretary of the I@@ HK Trier . &quot;
&quot; from 56 new engineers , the Wis@@ sing has to set mobility in the country and has so far been occupied by 29 positions . &quot;
the I@@ HK is calling for more orders to external offices .
&quot; CD@@ U @-@ faction Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf refers to calculations of the Court of Justice , the country invested 2017 and 2018 more than 20 million euros in less in the conservation of inland roads . &quot;
Frank Nat@@ us is still expecting a concept of land as it wants to fix the professional angel in the region .
harvest@@ ing is also the previous broad@@ band construction in the country .
&quot; in 2016 , regional companies had the power supply in a I@@ HK survey only 3.4 . &quot;
you get upgra@@ ding to stock@@ ings of internet connections and break@@ down@@ s .
&quot; at the moment , ex @-@ economy , Ev@@ eline Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and is still sitting on the Super@@ vis@@ ory Board of Wind@@ mill Pro Wind . &quot;
&quot; the Green Group left Lem@@ ke to April , to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe - where it has already been the field after four months due to dis@@ agreements . &quot;
&quot; Audi is supposed to change 85@@ 0,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers already faced with a counter @-@ reaction . &quot;
&quot; one day before the announcement of Audi said BMW , that it would offer to update the software in more than 35@@ 0.000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the BMW Chairman said , the company was the opinion that &quot; &quot; there are intelligent options as constra@@ ints &quot; , &quot; and thus moved to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based on diesel vehicles . &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes @-@ vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the company as a recall .
European automotive manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon di@@ oxide emissions .
&quot; but the nit@@ rogen Ox@@ ides , the diesel engines , are regarded as car@@ cin@@ ogens and can cause asthma . &quot;
&quot; install the cost of automob@@ iles , equipment for neutr@@ alisation of diesel vehicles to install de@@ g@@ ases , also take what makes it difficult to maintain the price of cars competitive . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of ignore the powerful automobile companies and ignore the signs of the problem .
&quot; the companies try to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen , which could reg@@ ulate the use of so @-@ called rock equipment , the emissions were able to comply with the rules if a car has been tested , but will return to normal driving conditions . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , several employees were charged by Volkswagen , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
last month the former head of the Ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in Germany in the motor development of Audi in Germany .
&quot; the former manager , Zac@@ che@@ o Giovanni Pam@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be put to trial in the United States . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi has been included in German criminal investigation in Volkswagen after the authorities have installed Audi to handle the emissions regulations in Europe , and a request that was concentrated on the United States . &quot;
the inclusion of Audi into the examination could be heavy fast : the luxury automobile manufacturer carries disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ate to the profit of Volkswagen .

Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ ases and the laughter of suffering
&quot; Mor@@ dill@@ o was timeless , one of the most visited cartoon @-@ animations , the Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ es of his characters are its hall@@ mark . &quot;
also with 85 the Argent@@ inian still works and works in a film .
&quot; his message : laughter , &quot; For there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ dill@@ o was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
&quot; in the first few years as an artist , he suggested among other things as a sign for lucky maps through - which was frustr@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he once said . &quot;
&quot; after stops in Lima , New York and Paris at the end of the six@@ ties of breakthrough : with the publication of his cart@@ oons in &quot; Paris Match &quot; and then also in the &quot; star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot;
even in China Mor@@ dill@@ o was many fans .
over and over again the artists of cities inspire .
&quot; big , rounded mor@@ dill@@ o @-@ pieces tum@@ ours in drawings by the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and Red Square in Moscow . &quot;
&quot; in the early morning he also s@@ its own information even today , it works almost ten hours every day . &quot;
&quot; calendar , puzzles , books for Gross and Klein , T @-@ Shirts , Pl@@ ush animals and watches find his dro@@ ll figures continue to spread much spread worldwide . &quot;
&quot; for six years , he has also been working on a drawing movie and a TV series with his figures . &quot;
&quot; the main person in the movie &quot; &quot; Crazy Island &quot; &quot; is a gi@@ raffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los &apos;s most popular animal in his drawings - that has a fork @-@ feet as a counter @-@ player . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , his figures in the 3D movie , the 2019 is to come to the Kin@@ ol@@ ein@@ wall . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they say , it is strange for me , &quot; says Mor@@ dill@@ o . &quot;
the script will not be written by him .
&quot; therefore , it &apos;s more likely to put on the TV series , which is produced by its original design@@ ations . &quot;
lav@@ ender from Provence threatened by climate change
&quot; he has become a symbol of Provence in South France , but there is a warning that he is threatened from climate change . &quot;
&quot; the lav@@ ender is due to the dro@@ ught remin@@ ders and due to the diseases of transfer@@ ring insects , giving scientists and farmers who try to find solutions , great head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the agr@@ arian Institute of CRI@@ EP@@ P@@ AM , said : &quot; &quot; the lav@@ ender in Provence is effective at risk because the plant was exposed to the effects of climate change in spring and much more . &quot;
this has effects on the life span of lav@@ ender .
&quot; there is also a small cic@@ ada , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium that carries the Zwerg@@ zi@@ k@@ aden , and with very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is much at stake .
lav@@ ender oil l@@ ures not only for vac@@ ation@@ ers ; it is also very demanded for perf@@ umes and cosmetics .
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; &quot; instead of having a large number of flowers , we have smaller , UN@@ TER@@ EN@@ T@@ W@@ IC@@ K@@ EL@@ TE and either missing or weak@@ ened . &quot;
&quot; so , we have less parts of ether@@ ic oil . &quot;
&quot; the solutions that are considered , include a better water distribution and the slow@@ down of the ev@@ ap@@ oration of the ground , but also the b@@ lowing of plants with a protective mixture of sound and water and the development of varieties that are resistant to dro@@ ught . &quot;

the ass@@ ass@@ ination of a journalist empha@@ sizes the growing threat in Mexico
the employees of the Weekly Ri@@ odo@@ ce is usually meeting in W@@ edn@@ es@@ days to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , cor@@ rupt officials and inc@@ ess@@ antly drug addiction . &quot;
&quot; but at that day , in the shadow of her own tragedy , they came together to talk about security . &quot;
&quot; it was told them , that it is important to change its routines . &quot;
&quot; two high @-@ ranking journalists discuss what feels safe : they are to take their children with the office , which were the target of a attack with gran@@ ules or they leave at home . &quot;
&quot; security experts have written three words on a table on the front of the room : opponents , Neutr@@ al , allies . &quot;
&quot; they ask the rep@@ orter , names for each column - no proof is necessary , perc@@ eptions and abdom@@ inal cav@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; there are drug ad@@ ow@@ ers , politicians , busin@@ ess@@ men , journalists , who are suspected of standing on the hearing @-@ list of the government or the cart@@ els , which make the chaos of Mexico . &quot;
&quot; there is no glory of violence , and throughout the country the corp@@ ses , there are more and more journalists : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to have been going to office in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are facing attacks and threats under federal states and up to now there was at least seven dead in seven countries . &quot;
&quot; among the latter , her editors and her inspir@@ ator of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , the co @-@ founder Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the greatest fail@@ ures to live in Mexico and journalist , &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot;
&quot; its absence will be deeply felt , although its presence is present everywhere - a big picture of Val@@ dez , which shows its mid @-@ finger with the word &quot; Justice &quot; , &quot; depends on the fac@@ ade of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce building . two rep@@ or@@ ters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Miriam Ram@@ i@@ rez , carry T @-@ shirts that will be sm@@ iles face with glasses or its typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut . &quot;
&quot; the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the rep@@ or@@ ters are discuss@@ ing about their shared themes , trau@@ ma , their night@@ mar@@ es , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although 2010 a prob@@ es of the Federal Office was established in order to edit the cases of journalists , this according to the Committee aimed at the protection of journalists only two criminal proceedings . &quot;
&quot; as with the majority of thousands of mor@@ den , who are linked each year with drug trade and organised crime , the mur@@ derer of journalists will only rarely put on trial . &quot;
&quot; at Ri@@ odo@@ ce , they still exist to treat the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , though they are ignor@@ ant and although the terrain is now even more tra@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; without information on the mur@@ derer , without justice , the meeting for discussion of security is little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it is very du@@ mm to w@@ asting my time in this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we do not know the Why , we do all . &quot;
on the morning of 15 May Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the state capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; he managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Cor@@ olla was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , presum@@ ably because of the name of the newspaper - that was translated with &quot; T@@ wel@@ fth river . &quot; &quot;
the Sag@@ itt@@ arius went away in his car and damaged it near .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adults .
rum@@ ors tend to fly into Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an freely .
&quot; but on Val@@ dez , there are virtually nothing but silence . &quot;
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ mans arrest in the past year and delivery in the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a became one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t battles of the country , since ri@@ val@@ ing groups struggle to fill in the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it makes nothing that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or several people are shot on the road or that the cemetery is full of dist@@ orted , two @-@ sto@@ rey Maus@@ ol@@ eums for drug ad@@ lines that are larger than many houses for the living . &quot;
&quot; forget for a minute , that there is a state of &quot; peace &quot; when just a cart@@ el control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs of commercial routes in the United States . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , with the gu@@ ilt that he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ conc@@ eptions have contributed to the murder .
&quot; first , in February the release of an interview with Rak@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the ri@@ val@@ ing cart@@ els in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans sons . &quot;
&quot; this publication may have hi@@ red the sons , presum@@ ed gang@@ ster also bought every copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to time@@ frame . &quot;
&quot; the second fault was to force Val@@ dez , after the conf@@ isc@@ ation of another newspaper , which had the same story to leave the country to his own safety . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists . &quot;
he had survived that his friends and colleagues ann@@ im@@ itate that he would always be there .
he was in 2003 as an experienced rep@@ orter for Nor@@ o@@ este when he joined together with five colleagues for the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars .
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without having to encounter on the rough@@ ness problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; with time , the newspaper earned a reputation because of the cour@@ ageous and honest coverage , and the sales and advertising revenues . &quot;
&quot; rep@@ orter loved it to publish hard drives investigations without fear of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read , which no one else would deal with . &quot;
eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ odo@@ ce she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot @-@ Prize &quot; for their coverage in Latin America .
&quot; in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the protection of journalists for his courage in pursuit of Mexican drugs , wherever it was carried . &quot;
he gave himself up volunt@@ arily that he was afraid .
&quot; I would like to continue &quot; , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J . &quot;
&quot; drug in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot;
you must take the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b .
&quot; I would not want to be asked : &quot; &quot; what did you do in the face of so many dead ... why did you not say what was going on ? &quot;
&quot; the Ri@@ odo@@ ce @-@ team mixed Val@@ dez , the Spa@@ ak bird , who was able to escape the friend , the friend , the generous with h@@ ugs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive . &quot;
you trusted in his routine .
he would always carry out his hat .
&quot; he would always go to El Guay@@ abo , the bar across from the office , and sitting there always at the same table . &quot;
&quot; now , ask : was his love for the routine to be the routine ? &quot;
his death also has forced them to ask their own assu@@ mp@@ tions about how they can do their work best and stay alive .
&quot; they don &apos;t like it if you are dealing with their wives , her children , her clean shops , her secret@@ ly Start@@ - and run@@ ways to move drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ bearing and self @-@ preservation . &quot;
his own inst@@ inct trust .
&quot; if it smells wrong , ab@@ outs away . &quot;
&quot; the trouble is , said the publisher of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real , that &quot; smell is a sense that can be dup@@ ed ... and then the thing is happening with Javier . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer considered in Sin@@ alo@@ a , no longer - just as in Tam@@ au@@ li@@ p@@ pas , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a po@@ ison@@ ous blend of lu@@ cr@@ ative sm@@ ug@@ es , weak institutions and cor@@ rupt government offices . &quot;
the landscape is changing constantly .
&quot; in the room where the staff from Ri@@ odo@@ ce met , there were suddenly no mobile phones allowed . days before was known that Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , for monitoring journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
outside were looking for two polic@@ emen protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .
they were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ sto@@ rey building in a mid @-@ class district of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; half in the joke , some of the rep@@ orter asked whether this officers belong to the 50 percent of polic@@ emen who were the governor themselves as not trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; it is months ago since the rep@@ or@@ ters have gone into the mountain landscape , where the drug lies de fac@@ to under control . &quot;
for the issue of this week Ri@@ odo@@ ce has bent on three main stories .
there was the ass@@ ass@@ ination of the former known box@@ ers Ju@@ lio Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an ex@@ pos@@ é into the state of state that concentrated on the hom@@ etown of the governor .
&quot; and there was a group that resulted in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block away from the office of the Public Pro@@ secutor , a kid@@ n@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who has been kid@@ n@@ apped or how it happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favourite local of drug dealers and authorities . &quot;
&quot; a rep@@ orter rep@@ ented from public records , that the restaurant was registered under the name of a policy , which was ruled by the gover@@ ning Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , who conqu@@ ered almost the entire century all political planes . &quot;
recently several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ cali@@ bre cases of corruption .
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the rep@@ orter to write about previous inci@@ dents in this local , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man became a military attack . &quot;
&quot; only a few months earlier , readers would have seen the column of Val@@ dez , as the best informed source about the ab@@ duction . &quot;
&quot; earlier we had already knew what happened , &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nickname &quot; &quot; El FLACO &quot; because of its slim physique . &quot;
&quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
&quot; the office of Val@@ dez has become a storage room for signs and stick@@ ers that protest against the Mor@@ de of journalists , because the employees have become something that they themselves never expected , activists in the name of the press . &quot;
Rep@@ or@@ alist Miriam Ram@@ i@@ rez sn@@ ap a few signs and went on the next morning to a demonstration on a demonstration on the office of the Pro@@ secutor &apos;s office .
&quot; Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed , in the western federal state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
a burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is his .
&quot; throughout the country journalists have become more broad@@ cast@@ ed , as they have written in organised protests &quot; SOS Press &quot; on hearing and construction . &quot;
&quot; on this day , the director of Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judi@@ ciary in the case of Val@@ dez . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with the Gover@@ nor of Sin@@ alo@@ a , a day after the ass@@ ass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez , the authorities to show journalists and bring them to leave them because they have said the truth . &quot;
she has since then asked that she is once more informed of the government since it is worried that their anger has viol@@ ated their obj@@ ectivity .
&quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico from organised crime , involved in government officials and a valid society . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that rep@@ or@@ ters will not only be killed by drug makers , but also on the command of politicians and security forces who are organised with organised crime under a ceiling . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ulo 19 &quot; has more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials last year .
&quot; in Mexico , you think , because they want you to keep the mouth , &quot; &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the mor@@ de have a horri@@ ble effect . &quot;
nobody for@@ getting the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state Tam@@ au@@ li@@ pas before six years ago .
&quot; your body was found together with a note that was supposed to be signed by the Z@@ et@@ as Kart@@ ell , &quot; Here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer @-@ keys and head@@ set were in addition to its separated head .
some stores have chosen as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Ch@@ ihu@@ ah@@ ua after the ass@@ ass@@ ination of the correspon@@ dents Mi@@ ro@@ sl@@ ava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue on how it did El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after the ass@@ ass@@ ination of their director in 2004 .
&quot; in 2010 Di@@ ario de Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ arez was publicly addressed to the drug card with an editorial meeting on the title page with the title &quot; &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists are drawn from their home states or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
&quot; it is hard to find work in exile , and they are still watching the streets and looking for dangers . &quot;
&quot; and sometimes they are j@@ agt , as it appeared to the photographer Rub@@ en Esp@@ in@@ osa , which was killed in 2015 with four women in an apartment in Mexico @-@ City three months after the flight from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot;
&quot; for those who continue to stay and continue the work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be poet , gives it to be start@@ led him . &quot;
&quot; Mexico will go to hell , and that is why I was rep@@ or@@ ters , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at midnight last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce on the side@@ walk in front of the office and drank beer , when all their phones started to reach . &quot;
a series of sk@@ e@@ wers with Band@@ en@@ ri@@ als and guards in the vicinity of the town Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed left .
the war continued on how it was promised by a number of Kart@@ ell &apos;s messages in the region .
from the Bord@@ stein@@ k@@ ante they released the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce about mobile phone .
the cover page had to be changed the next day .
Sir@@ enen he@@ ed nearby - another shooting in the area .
&quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez have a look at the polic@@ eman , the guard , to see if they were in willingness . &quot;
if they were afraid they showed it not .
&quot; under the tremendous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , its mid @-@ finger was visible for quite Sin@@ alo@@ a , followed the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce his tracks . &quot;
&quot; how can you only think about it , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; if the same day was ass@@ ass@@ inated , the intern@@ ship was asked to send them to the road to the road . &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs use cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age to do@@ dge his enemies
at first glance it looks like a statue if there is a terri@@ fying .
&quot; now researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible Nas@@ horn of a Canadian mountain workers were so well received , that experts are described as &quot; &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it was so well preserved , that they even knew that his shoe skin was of red@@ dish @-@ brown - and they said they would have had something of a &quot; &quot; un@@ quiet past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report in the magazine &quot; Current Biology , &quot; called it as &quot; the best @-@ preserved din@@ osau@@ rs , who ever was found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs specimens of the world . &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs that lived in the middle of the Cre@@ tac@@ eous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
its incredibly well preserved state has researchers who describe it as &quot; really remarkable . &quot;
&quot; according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the p@@ aired plant is the best preserved fossi@@ ls of its kind . &quot;
&quot; it was found by Sha@@ wn F@@ unk when he was born on 21 March 2011 in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; he met something that was missing from the surrounding rocks at the board , and decided to go more accurately . &quot;
the fossil discovered was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pale@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to cover the wild animal within the 2,@@ 500 pounds ( 1.@@ 100 kg ) heavy ground@@ breaking .
after all this hard work the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you are just a bit stupid with the eyes , you could almost believe that it has slept , &quot; &quot; said the principal author of Cal@@ eb Brown , scientists in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum , where the cre@@ ature has to be seen . &quot;
&quot; it will go into the science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs specimens , the Mon@@ a Lisa of the Dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; researchers have found that this plant is also covered with arm@@ or , although it resem@@ bles with a arm@@ or and a changing tank , probably by meat car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; the strong din@@ osau@@ r din@@ osau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a sh@@ iel@@ ding technology , which is used as a counter@@ fix , which is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this could have allowed themselves to mix better in its surroundings and to equi@@ p its enemies , say experts , which is suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
the 110 million years old cre@@ ature from the family of the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs made the first time in May and is now to be seen at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; researchers have now studied the wild animal and it is called Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ er@@ ch@@ elli after the museum techn@@ ician Mark Mitchell , one of a team that has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours so that it has been carefully covering it . &quot;
the amazing preservation of the specimen made it possible to document Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the patterns and form of sc@@ ales and arm@@ our over his body .
&quot; they discovered the con@@ sh@@ aded , a common defence of defence in the animal @-@ rich , which means that the tip of the cre@@ ature dar@@ ker was regarded as their under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the counter @-@ sh@@ ady usually is common , the results are surprising because the size of Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta is by far the living animals living . &quot;
&quot; it suggests that the din@@ osau@@ rs has had enough pressure on meat fres@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , the evolution deteri@@ orate the deteri@@ oration of the confrontation as a means of survival . &quot;
&quot; but most contemporary animals that use the counter sh@@ ady - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or gir@@ dle - are much smaller and hur@@ ting than loo@@ t , which sign@@ aled that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs was exposed to a real battle for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong car@@ ni@@ v@@ ore behaviour on a massive , strong ge@@ pen@@ ed din@@ osau@@ rs , how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs @-@ car@@ ni@@ vo@@ res of the Cre@@ tac@@ eous must have been &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic connections in their sc@@ ales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r is red@@ dish .
&quot; scientists continue to examine the animal in references about his life , including its cont@@ empl@@ ated Dar@@ min@@ hal@@ tes to find out what it has eaten as its last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs , when he died , went out into a river and driven out into the sea , where he fell on the back to the sea . &quot;
&quot; at that time Alberta was so warm as southern today , and rivers and oceans probably far more widespread than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs is really remarkable , because it is completely covered with preser@@ v@@ ated skin , but also in three dimensions and the original form of the animal ret@@ ains &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the result is that the animal is almost exactly the same as in the early chal@@ k period .
&quot; you do not need much imagination to use to re@@ build it . if you only have a little to play with the eyes , you could almost believe that he is at sleep . &quot;
&quot; the chal@@ k times was a time , as giant sp@@ opo@@ ds , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , who stood on two legs to pass on Earth . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them , Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , millions of years after Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta lived , the tort@@ ured Dinosau@@ rs was j@@ agt by some of his fur@@ ious ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this belongs to the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 feet ( 11.@@ 5 m ) long , six tons he@@ avier monsters . &quot;
&quot; scientists , whose latest findings in the journal Current Biology appear , believe that Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta was slim after the death in the sea and the mud . &quot;
&quot; the cre@@ ature was found by Sha@@ wn F@@ unk , when he was born on 21 March 2011 in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum it is the best @-@ preserved din@@ osau@@ rs of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely surrounded by mu@@ zzle up to the hip . &quot;
the creatures were at average approximately 18 feet ( 5 meters ) and have up to 3.000 pounds ( 1.@@ 300 kg ) weigh@@ ed .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch @-@ long tips that rag@@ ed by his shoulders .
&quot; the researchers believe that the geological plant was curved through the Western Canada , until a floo@@ ded river is floo@@ ded into the open sea . &quot;
but the underwater funeral of the din@@ osau@@ r his arm@@ or in exquisite way Show detail .
&quot; the hidden rem@@ n@@ ants of this special specimen are so well preserved , that the door@@ step is still b@@ ump@@ y and ch@@ ew@@ ards along the din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; as Michael Gre@@ sh@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preservation is as &apos; rare as a win in the l@@ otto . &quot;
&quot; the more I approach it , the more confusing it becomes . &quot;
&quot; pet@@ ri@@ fied le@@ av@@ ens of the skin still cover the hol@@ low tank , which carry the sk@@ ull of the beast . &quot;
&quot; his right @-@ stand front is on his side , his five fingers is split up . &quot;
I can count the sc@@ ales on his sole &apos; .
in the th@@ under@@ storm : mass@@ acre on A@@ 8 : many Ver@@ Last
severe accident on Thursday evening at the A@@ 8 : nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass @-@ amb@@ ol@@ age .
&quot; there are numerous Ver@@ Last , kilomet@@ er@@ long St@@ aus - and G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
on the highway Stuttgart @-@ München ( A@@ 8 ) in the late Thursday morning at a mass @-@ amb@@ ol@@ age about 20 people had been viol@@ ated .
&quot; after the first details of the police were at 17.00 hours between the junction no@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( Land@@ kreis A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a storm of nearly 30 vehicles , among them probably also trucks . &quot;
there is no information about the exact number of the last dig@@ its .
&quot; it handle light to mid @-@ sized inj@@ uries , said a polic@@ eman . &quot;
a big elev@@ ot of lif@@ ebo@@ at was at the accident .
the A@@ 8 was fully locked towards Munich .
in the exp@@ on@@ ment of Munich there was some 10 kilometres long back @-@ du@@ st@@ au .
like a AZ rep@@ orter also reported it came on the counter@@ car to massive disabilities - through numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire brig@@ ade themselves are the mark of the drivers who have now to reck@@ on with hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ itivity pen@@ alties .
&quot; shortly after 18 : 45 , then an second accident occurred at the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot;
there was a coll@@ ision between a garage and a car .
a rescue @-@ helicop@@ ter was on the road to the accident .
Deutsche Bahn : Group test@@ et &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everybody has experienced before : nothing is sitting on the train and sle@@ eps .
or it is temp@@ ted in his work and has just a brilliant thought .
and then : pu@@ ff@@ f .
comes the Schaff@@ ner and awak@@ ens a non@@ sensi@@ cal or irrit@@ ates the to@@ ast in the middle of the work@@ flow .
suspension control .
but the times of inter@@ rup@@ tions are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn test@@ et at the currently running line @-@ up control .
it is simply confirmed by mobile phone that you have taken its place and evaluate the ticket .
currently a test run on two routes .
&quot; get the offer , we get it out . &quot;
&quot; it is then expected to be available in Germany at the beginning of the year on many further remote routes in Germany , &quot; said a railway speaker . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; calls the train the vehicle stand@@ ings without Schaff@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; to use the use , however some conditions must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet . &quot;
and you have to have posted an online ticket - which already do most passengers .
&quot; furthermore , it is also necessary to purchase the DB Navigator software on the DB Navigator software , which is the most convenient way of ticket booking . &quot;
and finally you need a seat @-@ reserved .
&quot; for the &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; works as follows : one climb@@ s into the train , calling its driving card under &quot; My Tickets &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the tests will then appear a button on the electronic recovery .
the lin@@ ers get on their mobile devices a message that Fahr@@ g@@ ast X is located on the train and has taken the seat room Y .
returns the train control of the Y control site Y knows that there is a passenger with already un@@ matched online @-@ ticket there .
&quot; so you can continue to sleep , further . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customers , one for the subway - which in turn should use the passengers . &quot;
&quot; if you want to relax without ticket control by our train staff , check in the DB navig@@ ator just yourself . &quot;
&quot; this allows the passengers to make their travel time in the train , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , marketing executive board of DB correspondence . &quot;
&quot; second Plus : &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to meet the individual needs . &quot;
&quot; those who often travel , knows that in addition to del@@ ays and missed the rides are among the biggest trou@@ bles . &quot;
&quot; for many times , one does not have any documents in any case , but one of the fellow travelers do not have all the documents that you need for dev@@ alu@@ ation of online tickets . &quot;
either the credit card or ID cards or otherwise a document you have to do .
&quot; the consequence are endless discussions between accessibility and rides , leading to poor mood in the finish or gener@@ alization and del@@ ays in control of your own ticket and take the Schaff@@ ner at the end the time to take care of other concerns . &quot;
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that is only available on the connections ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further enco@@ ders on the same track are not un@@ locked .
how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; wh@@ ites ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Britt@@ any Fer@@ rell was sh@@ aken to her core .
&quot; only one day after being arrived in New York City , the apartment was born in St. Louis @-@ born on the bed of a Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment that they rented and sc@@ rolling through Facebook on their phone . &quot;
they stum@@ bled upon a post by someone from the High School .
&quot; the police have just killed a 18 year old child , and it still lies on the street , &quot; was it there . &quot;
&quot; confused , as no one else had posted the information on her feed , closed on Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot;
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Ph@@ aro@@ ah was constantly ret@@ ained on their tim@@ eline .
&quot; the rap@@ per from the field of St. Louis was involved , the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white polic@@ emen in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . &quot;
he posted a picture of Brow@@ ns alive body that was stretched on the road and stay there four hours .
&quot; this is wild , &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rell did not think . &quot;
but death was nothing new to them and her community .
she put her cell phone to return later in the evening to twe@@ ets about people on the Can@@ field Drive .
&quot; there were photos of the police band and people who cried out , and by a man who claimed to be a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on police have just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
they observed a live feed on which a polic@@ eman in front of a group of prot@@ esters with a bar@@ king dog .
&quot; in another video , she said , in@@ sured another polic@@ eman , his gun and cried : &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill you . &quot;
&quot; this is not common , &quot; Fer@@ rell reminded her statement . &quot;
&quot; this is not the kind of murder , which we are acc@@ ust@@ omed to and which we can call typical . &quot;
in that moment I felt thr@@ illing .
I was angry and wept .
they booked a return trip and went home the next day .
after the landing at 23 o &apos;clock they took her 6 year old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two would drive the next morning to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on .
&quot; what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the topic of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the cinemas from the 11 . &quot;
&quot; it is a story of survival and Protest@@ ant , love and loss of loss , the strength and resistance of the people who are living in the community and have filled the streets to challenge the answers . &quot;
&quot; as Fer@@ rell with her daughter who was a flower dress , and a suitable crown carried to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , pra@@ ised the two a conversation that they had inn@@ umer@@ able many times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black state . &quot;
&quot; you do not remember how I have taught you when black people must fight for this , what they believe ? &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot;
&quot; now we go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , because the police have killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that was not right . &quot;
&quot; I could not take her , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell later . &quot;
what happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
it must know it and see it and raised it in it .
&quot; it has to be well developed , not only acti@@ vism and organization , but also the different layers of the black experience and the black Constitution and what we need to do is free to free ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even though I have luck to give her an experience , in which they personally does not experience any e@@ at@@ ant rac@@ ism , it is not different from the next black women &apos;s child . &quot;
&quot; I have the feeling , I would prove her a bad service to keep them far away . &quot;
&quot; the first stop when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authorities called activists , on the possible non @-@ accus@@ ation of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
&quot; there , Fer@@ rell and her daughter joined together with a local business owner who made lunch . &quot;
they prepared bags in front of and hal@@ ves they pass on prot@@ esters .
slowly began to accept a new kind of acti@@ vism for Fer@@ rell shape .
&quot; my acti@@ vism has changed after the 9th of August , &quot; she said and noted that she was student at the University of Missouri @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student N@@ urses Association and concentrated on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it is all come . &quot;
&quot; weeks later , Fer@@ rell met during an evening demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ director of the film . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said , she and her comrades Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ rar only wanted to document &quot; document &quot; what happened . &quot;
&quot; a question came from Fer@@ rell in the sense : &quot; &quot; do you want to document , or try to find a story that you can take advantage of it ? &quot;
&quot; this sc@@ ep@@ tic@@ ism was nour@@ ished through countless cases of people , often of wh@@ ites - in a community that prof@@ ited from their pain and their resi@@ li@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently declared in an interview , &quot; We heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , and we did not c@@ entered their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an already worked together with the former co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the field , which is known for his acti@@ vism around To@@ dest@@ ra@@ kt . &quot;
his involvement brought Fer@@ rell the project closer together with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ns Er@@ shoot .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talking to us . we talk , &quot; said Davis . &quot;
&quot; that was the main thing for me , as these people are represented , for so I will be represented . &quot;
&quot; the goal was not to focus on Fer@@ rel@@ ls experience - to show that there is a community that comes together , &quot; &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she turned out to be the most obvious part of the film . &quot;
&quot; consequently , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Fer@@ rel@@ ls &apos;s life , how she loves herself and her wife mar@@ ries . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell , and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
&quot; but I understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability at this work and the understanding of the black people . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Fer@@ rel@@ ls has repeated history the role of the black g@@ ay women in the broader Black @-@ Li@@ ves movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founders of the movement , which after the killing of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ by Martin in 2012 marked the film &quot; &quot; Black@@ li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; &quot; in social media , identify themselves as sw@@ ul . &quot;
&quot; black , g@@ ay women in leadership @-@ positions have borne the movement altogether , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting on various fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , g@@ ay women must carry the main load of everything . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to notice that &quot; the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women . &quot;
&quot; however , it exists that &quot; &quot; this is not a affir@@ mati@@ ver type of action &quot; &quot; was chosen by the Fer@@ rell due to their identity as the heart of the film . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who w@@ reck@@ ed this energy , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it is not a coincidence , although it was at the front front , because with a life at these cross@@ ings as a black , g@@ ay woman is so much on the game . &quot;
you can sense their energy through the screen . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the News@@ cameras are long gone from F@@ erg@@ us@@ on long ago , but the r@@ acial links between the church and the police continue to exist . &quot;
Fer@@ rell is based on nutrition for 2 ½ years because of the block@@ ing a highway on a demonstration .
she describes the soci@@ opolit@@ ical atmosphere of the area that she calls her home : &quot; a m@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , she cl@@ inging to a song and she feels obliged to this mind since then she went to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on on the road three years ago . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we must love each other and support .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
&quot; from &quot; &quot; dream &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV @-@ reader discuss about bit @-@ gallery
the bit gallery is moving the people although it is not yet built for a long time .
but the idea of a mall at the south end of the pedestrian street divi@@ des since the first presentation of 2009 the population in supporters and opponents .
cold makes the subject hardly any one .
also on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; is discussed the subject .
&quot; say the one to the bit gallery : &quot; &quot; that would be a dream &quot; &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; &quot; This would be real &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; don &apos;t need a person &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or simply &quot; &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) . &quot;
&quot; while the supporters argu@@ ed that a gallery will bring more customers to the city , of which the other businesses will benefit , the opponents fear that then the pedestrian street is ble@@ eds . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the property on which the market hall is planned , in the 13 directors mark@@ eted its products . &quot;
with the beginning of the construction work will be the conclusion .
the gallery @-@ makers want to integrate a market hall in the new construction - and for a place where there is a place to sit outside .
&quot; Simone Rooms : &quot; &quot; we have been able to buy almost every week in the farmers market for many years . &quot;
&quot; mostly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of land@@ fill is again very happy . &quot;
also the but@@ chers shop we have discovered for us .
&quot; we would like to wish that even during and above all , after the construction of the gallery a chance to maintain this offer . &quot;
in other cities there is also .
especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
&quot; Ger@@ d D@@ ensing : &quot; &quot; whether the direct market mark@@ eted in a market hall in the gallery , comes at the height of the rent . &quot;
&quot; however , this might not be very low in the new project . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eva Kili@@ c &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; shopping &quot; &quot; in Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
&quot; whether clothing , shoes , threat or supermarkets : I find that super@@ flu@@ ous . &quot;
there is already enough in our city .
you can see how many stores are empty here - some have been here for months and years .
&quot; but since there is not even a neat weekly market , it is all the more important that at least you get the market hall . &quot;
&quot; after all , the goods offered there is fresh , mostly offered directly from the producer and is obsolete . &quot;
&quot; as you see , shop stores in a mall is only rented by larger companies because the dor@@ m Mi@@ ets are often not viable for a retail@@ er . &quot;
&quot; too bad , there is almost no more and what still exists , will probably also disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a mall with a Mark@@ thalle fit for me not together .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
above all : where should the farmers market all during the construction time ?
&quot; the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even on the duration , when the bit gallery is actually coming . &quot;
or creates it the gh@@ ost bit gallery already to exp@@ el all business from Bit@@ burg ?
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; it will simply not work .
&quot; and a shopping center , which is empty , nobody needs no one . &quot;
&quot; in my opinion , it would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of this gallery . &quot;
but for a farmer hall it is thanks to the cre@@ amy many - as I find - meaning@@ less construction projects in Bit@@ burg is no place anymore .
&quot; when the farmers market is broken , a piece of culture will disappear . &quot;
a suitable simil@@ arity : artist creates portrait with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
&quot; in the middle of the room of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York are many faces to see - white , black and brown that are almost in@@ comparable - those on cables are hanging from the ceiling . &quot;
the 30 portraits have been created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Tu@@ pf@@ ern and Haar@@ lem that were sent to her by Chelsea M@@ anning .
&quot; M@@ anning sent the excer@@ pts from the prison of Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former Secret analysis analy@@ sed a 35 @-@ year prison sentence , after they made public as a secret of diplomatic announ@@ cements about the site Wiki@@ Le@@ aks . &quot;
&quot; the new exhibition , which was opened on 2 August , is called A Bec@@ oming a bl@@ ance ( A matching simil@@ arity ) . &quot;
&quot; it is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline became their expertise in technology , computer sciences and art , and M@@ anning , a trans@@ wife and pione@@ ering dis@@ si@@ dent@@ ine , whose condem@@ nation was transformed by Barack Obama as he had only three days in his office . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been extrac@@ ted by the algorith@@ mic analysis of the DNA , which was extrac@@ ted by M@@ anning and created from the 30 portraits , a sharp , although some intellectual comment may not just be interpreted as they may be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these inter@@ pret@@ ations - but also to identity . &quot;
&quot; M@@ anning , who was born as Bra@@ dley Edward , but has already been openly condemned over the identification as a woman in 2013 , was sent@@ enced in 2013 for 20 accus@@ ations , among them six violations against the es@@ pi@@ on@@ eg@@ es@@ etz , computer was and theft . &quot;
&quot; through the prison , her image was supp@@ res@@ sed , so much that there was only one photo - a gran@@ ular , black @-@ white Sel@@ fie in which M@@ anning is clearly sitting on a driver &apos;s seat and a plat@@ inum @-@ blonde bar@@ bec@@ ues - with which it was associated with her . &quot;
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y Hag@@ borg came just about the great success of her 2012 @-@ project &apos; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions .
&quot; in this , the artist portraits of stran@@ gers made from for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts such as Cig@@ ett@@ enst@@ mel and Kau@@ g@@ um , extrac@@ ted the DNA from the waste in order to make a picture of how these people might look . &quot;
&quot; this was the time , in which it received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine . &quot;
&quot; she led an interview with Chelsea M@@ anning while she was in prison , and she wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y Hag@@ borg at a press show of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; and she was not visited at that time and she could not take photograp@@ hed , so you did contact Chelsea , and asked them if they wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot;
the artist and their det@@ ain@@ ees have been re@@ acted to the same bri@@ gh@@ ten over the course of two years .
&quot; they even created one of Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o illustrated Com@@ ic &quot; Supp@@ res@@ sed Images , &quot; who saw a future prior to the President Chel@@ seas verdi@@ ct and would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot;
&quot; that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ings would call for seven brutal years in a military coup in K@@ ansas , was a welcome kind of happ@@ ier meeting . &quot;
&quot; there is also now at the opening of the exhibition somewhat deeper and Star@@ kes , since Donald Tru@@ mp leads to war against inform@@ ants from the government and against trans@@ gender forces to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to fix the rigi@@ d spl@@ its that he should actually fix . &quot;
&quot; as a de@@ we@@ y Hag@@ borg after the strange timing of all these things was asked , she said that &quot; things happen from a certain reason . &quot;
&quot; in one on the wall of the gallery , the artistic statement called M@@ anning with its super@@ large sub@@ title ( the &quot; i &quot; in their surname is provided with a heart ) an end to the &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , based on gender , race , sexuality , and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence is written by Cs and Gs and As in pencil .
&quot; de@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was hoping to show the inclusion of 200 letters ( or nucle@@ ot@@ ides according to the highly developed scientific Lex@@ icon of the artist ) , such as surprisingly similar , at least in bi@@ odynam@@ ic terms we are all . &quot;
&quot; what people hopefully bring about it is that our gen@@ ome is not about who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works of 2007 , Sp@@ are Mem@@ ories , too . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell as many different stories , so that 30 of these stories are . &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition which is kept in an own space is a page from the above Com@@ ic @-@ Nov@@ elle .
it shows M@@ anning as they appear with a fre@@ ezing sh@@ ef@@ on in the hand out of discipl@@ ining in the United States as King @-@ Kong .
&quot; if they ask your speech , then they won , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; so just never the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter they wrote to me , &quot; said the artist , who sal@@ ute from Philadelphia . &quot;
I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ um@@ ps when I speak about it .
&quot; M@@ anning has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was pre@@ emin@@ ent in the com@@ ic book - but if they should do it , then it will be greeted in the middle of the room by their own genom@@ ic simulation , which meet as hor@@ des of prot@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; it was also focused on how all in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ings St@@ ature ) , in which their genetic Hap@@ lo@@ os was written with pencil . &quot;
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y Hag@@ borg from the portraits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted to feel like a mass movement that was formed with Chelsea , like the movement , which was also behind its liberation . &quot;
&quot; Professor at the University of North@@ western and an employee of the University of Oxford , were looking for killing . &quot;
&quot; a nation@@ wide human hunt is under@@ way for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford , who had been chosen as a susp@@ ect after a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with fatal injury . &quot;
on Monday for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) Ar@@ rest War@@ rant on the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as demonstrated by the cust@@ ody of Cook County . &quot;
&quot; the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , after several stit@@ ches died . &quot;
one of the police authorities issued by Chicago published a community system that was discovered on 27 July .
&quot; officials received a call , came to the Grand Plaza apartments and found the victim with several inj@@ uries of his body . &quot;
&quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still explained on the place of the event for dead , and det@@ ectives examine the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police are active after the two susp@@ ects , said officials . &quot;
La@@ them has been an extraordinary professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at North@@ western University .
&quot; Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the Vice @-@ president for University relationships , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ them has now been in be@@ ur@@ ging and excluded from entering the Campus of North@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; this is now a stra@@ ined matter which is examined by the competent authorities and the North@@ western University operates in this investigation , &quot; said Cub@@ ensis . &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at the University of Oxford .
a spokes@@ man at the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and are willing to help U.S. intermedi@@ ary authorities in any way possible . &quot;
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens colleagues were shock@@ ed and want it to present itself .
&quot; chief Communications Officer of the police authorities of Chicago , Anthony Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi , said he challeng@@ ed the suspic@@ ious to face the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police has a conception of their location , and our efforts to locate them , &quot; &quot; said Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said , the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand @-@ Plaza building that had just received a mysterious tip that had just happened in the apartment 10@@ 08 . &quot;
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident also took place on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ them and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; said Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation to the inhabitants : &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline , and the background of the victim and resear@@ ching a variety of mot@@ ives , including a potential domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will shut the W@@ ada timetable in the near future &quot; - the Russian Viz@@ ep@@ re@@ mi@@ er Mut@@ ko
the Russian vic@@ ep@@ re@@ mi@@ er Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it will not last long until the remaining criteria of the world @-@ anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( W@@ ada ) will be implemented to restore the Russian anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; in a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with Ukrain ( UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ) . &quot;
&quot; the W@@ ada @-@ Roadmap was updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; explained Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot;
the PM commented the second part of the cur@@ riculum of W@@ ada to comply with the code which describes the criteria for the re@@ assembly of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the website of the organization .
&quot; according to Mut@@ co , he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia . &quot;
&quot; everything was announced , everything is implemented . &quot;
&quot; and the results will be submitted to the International Olympic Committee ( I@@ OC ) and the W@@ ada in the near future , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; one of the criteria stated in the list criteria , however , that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities reported the reported results of the W@@ ada authorized study by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren to alleged state @-@ funded by Dop@@ ing in Russian Sport . &quot;
&quot; in relation to the matter Mut@@ ko : &quot; &quot; we conduct the study through , as our anti @-@ Dop@@ ing system has caught a mistake . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there was no state programs , and we will not admit something that does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Mut@@ ual words agreed with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Commission . &quot;
&quot; talking to the Russian out@@ let R@@ sport at the beginning of the day Sm@@ ir@@ nov gave problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ Dop@@ ing organisations , then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report embr@@ aces positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; nobody asked to accept this report un@@ conditi@@ onally , &quot; she added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot;
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded in November 2015 in the course of the Dop@@ ing Sk@@ and@@ als of the W@@ ada of Dop@@ ing Controll@@ ing in Russia .
&quot; however , you have been allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ( UK@@ AD ) . &quot;
&quot; after a visit to the main designers of the organization in Moscow in July W@@ ada @-@ General , Olivier Nig@@ gli , that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moved into the right direction . &quot;

start @-@ ups that will help your company not to become the next u@@ ber
Amy Er@@ rett wanted to measure happiness with your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up but the surveys did not work .
&quot; answers were often v@@ age , little helpful or even worse - fr@@ aud@@ ul@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; and even if you spoke an@@ onym@@ ity , some workers did not do the process . &quot;
&quot; there was simply never consistency and obj@@ ectivity , &quot; Er@@ rett , who operates the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Gesellschaft Madison Re@@ ed . &quot;
it has started people from outside to help .
&quot; a new race of the Human Resources Start @-@ ups is on the wax , to help companies to find out how their employees feel . &quot;
&quot; through the creation and licens@@ ing of software , which has the specific purpose of the measurement of employee engagement , it enables companies to address questions , speci@@ ality groups and demo@@ graphic groups , employees An@@ onym@@ ity and complaint @-@ Hot@@ lines , and in some cases wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lowers may allow C @-@ suite ex@@ ecu@@ tives to address and turn directly to the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; you now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for pursu@@ ing their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools used by companies to measure employees . &quot;
Er@@ rett said she has a better insight into what your staff think and feel at G@@ lin@@ t in the three years .
&quot; in addition to the sn@@ ap surveys and surveys from certain teams , there is an heat @-@ card of the company that shows at a glance , which units have most discomfort and which ex@@ ecu@@ tives have low condition results - so you can be drilling why . &quot;
&quot; it is necessary to see that at the top of the workplace must remain , so that you won &apos;t have the next u@@ ber who has been involved in Sk@@ and@@ ale , who has recently published a blog post that have spoken an environment of har@@ as@@ sm@@ ent , with those who have spoken , pun@@ ished . &quot;
for start @-@ ups such as G@@ lin@@ t is this wish for an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business facilities .
&quot; the Global Governance , regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18,@@ 7 billion value , after the financing technical website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; Denver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent bad behaviour and recognize , saw an rising interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the midst of U@@ ber @-@ F@@ all in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ cent has almost 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la . &quot;
this has recently registered as a client .
&quot; like G@@ lin@@ t , Conver@@ cent businesses can send custom @-@ made &quot; pulse , &quot; confidential answers in real time and watch the heat @-@ cards of your problem . &quot;
it also offers an anonymous SMS @-@ hot@@ line with the staff to report a bad behaviour .
&quot; and if the main business leader is included , complaints should go directly to the Super@@ vis@@ ory Board . &quot;
&quot; the court of public opinion claimed the regul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Quin@@ lan , founder and managing director of Conver@@ cent . &quot;
&quot; when a company is found that its staff is badly treated or ins@@ ulated , it can experience precious consequences due to the consumer boy@@ cott , worker @-@ fluid and cl@@ agen , said Quin@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations , conver@@ ging for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to get their company central . &quot;
&quot; earlier , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company &apos;s headquarters , a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; it was often a inti@@ mid@@ ation and un@@ comfortable experience , James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Co@@ uns@@ el who said , there was no good possibility to follow the complaints from employees . &quot;
&quot; now , since the company conver@@ sions , problems can be hidden from ex@@ ecu@@ tives that have been hidden in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , har@@ as@@ sm@@ ent or un@@ wind practition@@ er - faster and addressed . &quot;
&quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view towards the experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who guides the risk management group by Ruby Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment regulation . &quot;
&quot; company began to take part of eth@@ ics , values and employee engagement in 2002 after the account@@ ancy company Arthur Ander@@ sen broke out due to ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal said quin@@ lan said . &quot;
&quot; but it took to the &quot; Social Media &quot; to their right , &quot; that companies knew that you could not prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot;
&quot; before using technology to monitor eth@@ ics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ ters offer your software as a service , and animated the company with recur@@ ring fees for the use of their products . &quot;
&quot; it is a business model and a chance that will find the consent of Venture Capital investors , which both start start @-@ ups . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ sions received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and T@@ ola Capital , with which the entire capital has been raised to $ 47 million . &quot;
Gl@@ itz@@ ers secured $ 10 million in November by Bess@@ emer Venture Partners and brought his entire funding to $ 60 million .
&quot; this investment is hardly surprising considering the connected nature of companies , culture and Venture Capital . &quot;
there is an increasing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more to expect from their jobs than before .
in competitive markets such as Sili@@ con Valley are high sal@@ aries and interesting projects only in@@ serts .
the employees want the feeling that you are accepted and valued and that you can give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are glad to feel in a company that &apos;s their votes is , and that the work you do is worth doing , then Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Employee Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which is both Conver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
investors return to wid@@ ths when their portfolio are well run . businesses are running well when employees work and involved .
&quot; if the analytics tools of third parties promise , commitment and deployment of the employees , it is no wonder that you can find support . &quot;
the data on the employee &apos;s commitment to the experts of the workplace culture is important .
&quot; however , the data is useless if the car@@ et@@ aker of a company does not take action . &quot;
&quot; in fact , if a company was asking for your feedback , it may have an expect@@ ation that change is on the way . &quot;
&quot; and if the shift does not come quickly enough , or not at all , this dis@@ appointments can grow and motiv@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you have to be ready to have 4,000 talks , said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen the company dedicated to collecting data . &quot;
&quot; for if you are not followed by employees , &quot; Hab@@ its you really heard myself ? &quot;
take care of that ?
&quot; who will not care about why , why should I ? &quot;
&quot; Madison Re@@ ed , who is now going through monthly employees , was able to take action on the same day when a problem is reported on G@@ lin@@ t , so Er@@ rett . &quot;
&quot; and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated staff , she was able to organize several teams within the company , to organise several teams within the company and to add a communication education to address the problems . &quot;
&quot; in Ruby Tuesday , the company will always receive new insights on the employees , and it hopes that in a long run , this leads to a better bond of workers in a branch that is known for high turnover . &quot;
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose man , &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you lose customer too . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose customers , then you will lose companies . &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A remo@@ ves the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the br@@ ins
it is about 23 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ ers on one side of the new exercise fields of the team on campus .
some have passed their tri@@ mmer parts and show the back full of swe@@ at from the first day of training camp .
for a good part of the team these indi@@ scri@@ min@@ ate minutes is a lunch break .
&quot; players who are written to the summer courses , will return to their shut@@ ters , before they return on the next morning at 6 : 30 to the water@@ man Football Center . &quot;
&quot; this is for the guys the next three days a real staircase , &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ t @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before Monday to Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the N@@ CA@@ A eliminated two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the burden of the player , and it has actually renewed their days - at least until the final on Friday . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the first three training sessions of U@@ C@@ LA should start at 19 : 15 in order to meet the already packed Time sched@@ ules of the player . &quot;
&quot; the compromise reached from the two days is more than a day , at which the brood at the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season has moved and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six game times in West@@ wood exercises . &quot;
they are to hold out during the course of August 18 exercises . 20 in front of the formal game preparations for its pre@@ l@@ ude against Texas A &amp; M in September .
&quot; Mor@@ a said that he support the rule of N@@ CA@@ A , even if they add a further point in the multiple routes of the players . &quot;
&quot; we put this enormous burden three or four days on them , and it is very challenging , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; and they simply pressed , they plac@@ ken up , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; I think as soon as we come up to Saturday and we have more time , it will truly be great . &quot;
&quot; the U@@ C@@ LA will end their practices as soon as the camp is finished , resulting in view of the clear view of its fields by an adjacent parking lot and the ad@@ joining Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the higher grade that has already been rated with foot@@ age , which will be an easy task . &quot;
&quot; brood @-@ player will occup@@ y the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a spatial that there could be a problem once these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security &quot; , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far fet@@ ched to think that people will rent there a room and then set up a exercise . &quot;
&quot; if you have the video clip from one exercise , it is a pretty good deal . &quot;
&quot; but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 . &quot;
we will do the best with what we have .
I don &apos;t have too much wor@@ ries for this reason .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts in the fight against fake news
&quot; Facebook wants to send more potential articles with folding messages to third parties and see their results under the original , then the largest online @-@ social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called F@@ ake news . &quot;
&quot; the company said in an opinion on his website , that it will begin with the use of updated machine methods to detect possible counter@@ f@@ ights and to send them to the ten@@ ant check out of the original article . &quot;
&quot; Facebook was first critic@@ ised as one of the leading associations for so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News , many of whom believe they have also affected the U.S. presidential elections . &quot;
&quot; the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , whereby the French voters were floo@@ ded in May with false stories , and Germany will support a plan , according to social media networks , if they did not succeed , asser@@ ted post@@ ings like before the elections there in September quickly . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Facebook in a separate statement in German , that in the US , France , the Netherlands and Germany started a test of the new facts review . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the realization , which stories of fac@@ eted ones are challeng@@ ed , people want more context to make well @-@ founded decisions about what they read and share , &quot; &quot; said Sara Su , product management for Facebook news in a blog . &quot;
she added that Facebook will continue to test his feature to the &quot; related article &quot; and to other changes to his messages to reduce wrong news .

&quot; a Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documented the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another , emerging British artist - Isaac Hand@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book of Rhodes , based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he un@@ expect@@ edly found . &quot;
&quot; I only re@@ acted on the thum@@ b pressure on the side of a letter , which was written by a dou@@ bles in the 1700 &apos;s @-@ years , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is his thum@@ b .
&quot; and I still smell to smoke , because back then one had a fire because of the light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect , as if he himself did . &quot;
&quot; Oh , I love Archive ! &quot;
&quot; for someone who is be@@ aten to be so with old papers , that he has been supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council ( &quot; To be honest : I have changed my welcome ) , all this seems to be true . &quot;
&quot; Rhodes spent his days to explore the Vic@@ tor@@ ian &quot; &quot; new &quot; &quot; castle , to study the archives and the many treasures and curios@@ ities of the castle , such as the mon@@ ed hy@@ ena heads in the walls and the bottles , the centuries had spent in the dit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; he emig@@ rated by the grounds and ruins of the old castle , and spoke with Land@@ sc@@ iss@@ ors , gardening and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book . &quot;
then at night he drank &quot; whis@@ key and started writing . &quot;
&quot; the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , as the National Trust was first received the full access to 2006 as the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey . &quot;
&quot; when Rhodes was a decade later , the employee started to take care of the archive , which he said as &quot; hundreds of years , in which Arist@@ ocr@@ ates said &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot;
&quot; sli@@ des@@ h@@ ows , letters from the time of the English Emp@@ ires , cards that represent who what said : &quot; one could mean that Land@@ con@@ flu@@ ous would be boring &quot; , &quot; says Rhodes , &quot; but there was a pe@@ ar to have fought the two families . &quot;
&quot; guys , let everything go down ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to check out a broader basis in the English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who built the newly built castle , in order to join the farm of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a record of a tur@@ mo@@ il , the 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book entitled &apos; Kn@@ ight@@ ly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sussex &apos; , says Rhodes . &quot;
the peasant revol@@ t began in this area and I thought was a revol@@ t was a good start .
perhaps the two are connected ? &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; that tells the story of the Jes@@ uit@@ ment that the family Dar@@ rell was seven years while the English Reformation .
&quot; or &apos; The Sm@@ ug@@ gler &apos; , presented by the sm@@ ug@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rell from the 18th century , he filled his own bur@@ ial with stones ( a discovery that was only years later than his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) . &quot;
&quot; Dar@@ rel@@ ls are Rhodes &apos;s favorite family by Scot@@ ney : &quot; &quot; the gentlemen are able to be able to make deb@@ ts and spend money for things that they could not afford . &quot;
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ rell men proce@@ eds their gu@@ ilt by making rich old women married - I imagine them as a he@@ ap well looked out guys , with a talent to advert@@ ise Er@@ nat@@ ing . &quot;
after the end of his use in the castle Rhodes is searching for other unique writer experience
&quot; he has brought a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a com@@ ic novel about El@@ äm@@ än@@ mä@@ ki , the terrain of a san@@ atorium dating back to the early 20th century , which has been re@@ claimed since then by nature . &quot;
Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it was like : &quot; Oh , now I have to be completed with the dam@@ ned life again . &quot;
campaign launched : more than 300 years old Marien@@ kap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf coated
&quot; with the veil@@ ing of the 301 years old Marien@@ kap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Honnef has started their campaign for introducing a new roof stamp ( Rund@@ schau of Thursday ) . &quot;
even until Thursday Mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team would hold the logo and slogan .
at the end of August it is supposed to be a highlight of the campaign on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; too nice for us .
&quot; or ? , &quot; ask the makers of action since yesterday at the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer chapel . &quot;
&quot; we think that ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; they are released on their yesterday page . &quot;
&quot; but we take advantage of this measure , in order to gain your attention . &quot;
and to make clear that man@@ ches is better than it seems .
&quot; basically , we are firmly convinced that we have known as bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer citizens to know the beauty and attr@@ activ@@ eness of our city . &quot;
&quot; in action it is about more than &quot; &quot; just a logo and a slogan , it means more . &quot;
&quot; it is true to form@@ ulate a all@@ evi@@ ating promise , one that gives the city an un@@ mistak@@ able time . &quot;
&quot; finally , they stand in competition with other municipalities . &quot;
a medium five @-@ dig@@ it amount can be reached the city of Bad Honnef its new umbrella @-@ brand and the campaign .
military forms in Turkey - earth@@ ed fear of the army
every year at the beginning of August advis@@ es in Ankara of the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) on retirement and carriage in the Off@@ iz@@ ier@@ sk@@ or@@ ps .
this week also .
at first sight a normal operation .
&quot; but nothing is a routine in the Turkish forces , a year after the coup attempt . &quot;
&quot; the meeting took place no longer in the building of the General Staff , as previously , but in the prime minister of the prime minister . &quot;
&quot; at the presi@@ dency of governments now also attended the five vic@@ ep@@ re@@ alism as well as the Minister for Defense , Inner@@ es , Justice and Foreign Affairs . &quot;
&quot; thus , the civilians were in the Y@@ as in the assault . &quot;
the government draws up in the military the re@@ ins .
&quot; in office , Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office but the com@@ man@@ ders of the army , the avi@@ ation forces and the n@@ avy were set . &quot;
&quot; since the failed Cou@@ p , state Erd@@ og@@ an Erd@@ og@@ an , of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als . &quot;
&quot; over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of con@@ genital connections to the movement of Ex@@ ile Pre@@ dig@@ s Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , the Erd@@ og@@ an as the wire of the coup . &quot;
&quot; against 486 persons who have been involved directly at the coup attempt , will be negoti@@ ated in Ankara since this week . &quot;
&quot; on the day after the coup , Erd@@ og@@ an had known the uph@@ e@@ av@@ al attempt as &quot; &quot; divine gift , &quot; as he give him the opportunity to clean the armed forces &quot; . &quot; &quot;
but Erd@@ og@@ an the army really has a grip ?
&quot; in the end of February the newspaper &quot; &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; &quot; published an article with the inscription &quot; &quot; Un@@ discomfort in the military headquarters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the Staff , there are concerns over an increasing &quot; &quot; Islam@@ ification &quot; &quot; of the army , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself among other things in the abolition of the head@@ sc@@ arf ban on Sol@@ dat@@ ors , wrote the paper . &quot;
the gener@@ osity in the army and the guards goes on at any rate .
&quot; in the middle of July Erd@@ og@@ an caused by decre@@ e another 73@@ 95 State , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 54@@ 6 soldiers . &quot;
it seemed as did Erd@@ og@@ an the military t@@ ames .
the gener@@ als were formerly known as the actual masters of the country .
three times they called upon calling on her role as the guar@@ di@@ ans of the world @-@ world order .
&quot; after his election in 2002 , Erd@@ og@@ an was forced to step back the power of the military step by step , not least by calling on the reform@@ ists of the European Union . &quot;
former officers say Erd@@ og@@ an t@@ rei@@ be targeted a Islam@@ ification of the armed forces .
&quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; Voc@@ al Europe &quot; &quot; was not a so @-@ called officer who sought after the coup in fear of persecution in A@@ sy@@ l , the Turkish army will be &quot; full of extrem@@ ists and Sal@@ af@@ ists &quot; . &quot; &quot;
meet this could not let such develop the N@@ ato could not be cold .
&quot; anyway , there are doubts in the alliance after inf@@ ancy in the use of the Turkish army . &quot;
&quot; the leaders and oper@@ ation@@ alist skills are &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; say N@@ ato diplom@@ ats . &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
&quot; there will be a new U.S. immigration plan to change the rules of Green Card , President Donald Tru@@ mp , c@@ ited from the media . &quot;
&quot; he looks ahead to lower the legal immigration to 5@@ 0,000 per year , strict regulations for the slow@@ ing of visa for a short work permit and limitations for families @-@ oriented visa . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill is supposed to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and billions dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers and will do this by changing the way the citizens from other countries green cards . &quot;
the law will prevent the chains of chains and replace the current system .
&quot; this new applic@@ ant procedure will speak the candidates who speak English , who have the financial means to support themselves and knowledge that our economy will come together , &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp , c@@ ited from the American media . &quot;
Department wants to take a route for Renn@@ stei@@ in
again and over the past few months over the future of the race increases sh@@ utt@@ les have been crossed - now it is supposed to go very quickly .
&quot; even prior to the end of the year it should be built on the mar@@ que circuit , which drives the tourist train . &quot;
&quot; to ensure the future of the Renn@@ stei@@ g in the long term , according to the transport of the Ministry of Trade in this year we will start working on the track . &quot;
&quot; with the decision to order the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g to order and to store , the country focuses on this mainly for tourism , &quot; declared road @-@ secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot;
the price for the repair of the range paid to approximately 2.5 million euros .
&quot; from this sum , the land take 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; the contract , based on the shuttle also to be ordered by the country in the future , are currently final voted , stated S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the Ministry and the Süd@@ th@@ ür@@ ingen Bahn as the operator could already agree on the technical details .
&quot; this gives the timetable that used vehicles and quality standards , &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
that makes the rac@@ ted shuttle to be ordered on December 2017 .
the Renn@@ stei@@ g Shuttle is one of all popular rail link between stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
&quot; in the last few months the track has been tested in the course of a pilot business , whether the route is used by sufficient many people to order it in the future . &quot;
the circuit is also highly b@@ ump@@ y in parts .
the rise of sex robot is real and we should worry
&quot; just as you thought , that it is not even more crazy , a new report comes across the technological developments in the field of sex robots . &quot;
&quot; yes , actually . &quot;
sex robots are currently a big thing .
the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robot@@ ics in the next five to ten years .
&quot; according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , emer@@ itus professor of robot@@ ics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must begin to take their rise seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the eye @-@ color of the robot , its shape of ni@@ pp@@ le and type of fingers . &quot;
&quot; people make themselves funny , but the companies deliver a lot of it and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; &quot; said Mr. Shar@@ key on the release of his new report . &quot;
modern sex@@ pupp@@ ets have developed themselves from their infl@@ atable partners with a sili@@ cone machine that feels warm to feel warm - with consci@@ ously human reactions that are achieved by the artificial intelligence .
&quot; the user can adjust its robot according to its beliefs , and select all , from the eye @-@ color of the robot over the form of ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or the color of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; but it is still dist@@ res@@ sed , as many robots have the &quot; person@@ alities &quot; who would look progressive to a Step@@ ford &apos;s woman . &quot;
modern sex@@ pupp@@ ets have developed to robots with a sili@@ cone .
&quot; the Real@@ Bot@@ ix robots allows for example its users to adapt their robots to the qualities they are appe@@ aling , such as sh@@ y@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; and then there is still those from True Compan@@ ion developed Ro@@ xx@@ x@@ Gold sex robots with pre @-@ program@@ med figures such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which gives the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild Wendy &quot; with a &quot; advent@@ urous &quot; personality . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ x@@ Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as well as possible , &quot; war@@ ms the website of True Compan@@ ion . &quot;
&quot; this is what you like , and she does not like what you like , etc . &quot;
she also has her m@@ oods in the course of the day - just like real people !
&quot; it can be tired , fixed to convers@@ ational , or she can &quot; be &quot; in the mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are many distur@@ bing aspects in this rise of sex robot - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ mis@@ sive female characteristics , the bac@@ kl@@ ess on rape , when you go a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( meaning : contra@@ dic@@ tory ) Far@@ rah , is a very quiet one most . &quot;
&quot; on his website &apos;s True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ x@@ a with a vibr@@ ator , but for men . &quot;
&quot; if women ( sic ) have a vibr@@ ator , why do men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ x@@ ies ? &quot; it says on the website . &quot;
&quot; however , these sex robots are not just a fet@@ ish or just another Sex@@ y . &quot;
&quot; their emergence and growing sophist@@ ic@@ ation point to something dark and deeper in our culture , to a withdrawal from the Ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as optional addition . &quot;
&quot; most men will of course hold any sex robots and while the FR@@ R notice its rising popularity , it still remain preliminary at the edge of the consumer culture . &quot;
&quot; but what happens from the boundary zones , may be in relation to the spirit of time , in which we live , very instru@@ ctive . &quot;
&quot; and many people are not strange or ins@@ ult@@ ing , until the free market there is permission . &quot;
&quot; there is a certain over@@ lay that these highly developed sex robots have emerged in a time in which the rights of women are threatened worldwide , in which there is a president in the White House , who has been pra@@ ised to have been sexually attacked . &quot;
the ab@@ omin@@ est aspect of the television series &apos; The hand@@ maid &apos;s Tale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the hand@@ maid &apos; ) are not the graphical images that sle@@ epy bodies and the extinct eyes but how realistic this vision works .
&quot; the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap . &quot;
the target behind these sex robots is to establish a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( even with porno@@ star pro@@ portions ) .
your builder want them to feel humane that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; but , brought to the point when it comes to their &quot; person@@ alities &quot; the robots represent no real women . &quot;
you cannot separate yourself from her companion or simply go away .
&quot; they do not have a medi@@ ation or a background story , nothing that could inter@@ f@@ ere on independence or anything that could inter@@ f@@ ere the fantasy of dead . &quot;
other words : they are fake slaves .
or to express it in the or@@ atory of 2017 : ma@@ ids
Tru@@ mp@@ s great performance ?
he makes Particip@@ ate Rom@@ ney into the ep@@ it@@ ome of common sense .
&quot; it has become a bin@@ oc@@ arity of the Tru@@ mp era that the political divisions , which pol@@ ari@@ zed the US elect@@ orate , also families in the small format . &quot;
&quot; around Christmas and harvest feast , there was in the United States newspapers with advice on how to cope with the horror of Tru@@ mp relatives . &quot;
we are all supp@@ osedly supposed to leave our filter@@ ing g@@ ases .
&quot; less noticed is the power of Tru@@ mp@@ s , families . &quot;
&quot; I chose this because my c@@ ousin , a left @-@ focused poet who has lived in Chicago and has long been employed with the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in our family for me this week in New York . &quot;
they reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
&quot; with Tru@@ mp in the White House everyone who knows it , including the Republi@@ can relationship , with whom she fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and quite peculi@@ ar on the same side . &quot;
&quot; in order to eat the dining table this is certainly a good thing , but it falls me in a further context that this brings about significant risks . &quot;
&quot; the left hand was strengthened by Tru@@ mp , but the resulting effect of his presi@@ dency has power to push all of us to right . &quot;
&quot; if we speak of &quot; norm@@ alisation &quot; and Tru@@ mp , we refer to the gr@@ assy possibility that his friends of one day will no longer be off . &quot;
&quot; however , there is an even hor@@ rend@@ ous long @-@ term scenario , in the Tru@@ mp Rep@@ ublic@@ ans of the right wing &quot; normal@@ ized &quot; that appear suddenly compared to its standards as an ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness . &quot;
&quot; I find myself today from an active nost@@ algia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s com@@ ic version of the mad@@ man , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax statement looked ) - both compared to Tru@@ mp in fact , a very mild crime . &quot;
&quot; if Tru@@ mp goes , the next Candi@@ date of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have to be spiritu@@ ally healthy to qualify as in@@ estim@@ able enhancement . &quot;
&quot; when my c@@ ousin in the city was , we brought our children to the carousel of Central Park , the largest of the Kar@@ uss@@ ells of New York &apos;s park , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you have no caffeine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are enormous , the fiber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all cl@@ owns are scar@@ ed and the animals are turning to look at full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the cli@@ ma &apos;s music convey@@ s this in noticeable manner . &quot;
&quot; so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ ap@@ point : the views of high buildings are old , the sky@@ lines are becoming acquain@@ ted to offer a lot of excitement and the reality of the city will not do the dream . &quot;
&quot; five @-@ five years later , and I am still not over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is indeed no Swiss Cottage - the subject @-@ pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not - but a big roundabout in the north of London . &quot;
&quot; however , Central Park @-@ carousel is still a wei@@ rd magical experience , as there are two two @-@ year @-@ old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ er years can go on it and all have a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could evaluate the carousel , I could have given him the full score , but fortunately nobody ever asked him . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , I was forced to assess my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before I could go through my credit card . &quot;
&quot; at the cafe &apos;s corner of my street , it is the same plus the option that review the rating with a 15 % discount . this is to buy something about the Lad@@ ent@@ ric . &quot;
&quot; this does not only lead to a slow@@ down of what actually a neutral exchange should be , but also put pressure on the server in order to bring personality into a situation that is not required . &quot;
&quot; the poor woman in the department store was ap@@ olog@@ ous gr@@ ins@@ ingly , while I get tired of the experience to submit my credit card with five stars . &quot;
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us with p@@ sor@@ eness made out of the prison in the hospital
Pist@@ ori@@ us has left the prison for a hospital for the second time .
&quot; last year , he was brought to the hospital for the treatment of cuts to his wrist@@ s , which he suffered the pris@@ ons according to a case in his cell . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us was sent@@ enced because of mor@@ ality after an appeal of the pro@@ secut@@ ors against a first tot@@ ality .
&quot; he sle@@ w ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning of Valent@@ in@@ days 2013 , by putting them several times by a door of the toil@@ ett@@ enk@@ ins in his house in Pre@@ toria on them . &quot;
&quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his girlfriend for a noc@@ turn@@ al inv@@ ader , who hid in the cabin . &quot;
the pro@@ secut@@ ors have announced their intention to sei@@ ze this time against the six @-@ year prison sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell from which they say they are too indul@@ gent .
&quot; the National pro@@ secution authority said that they will rise to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the claim could be heard this year . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us runs risk that his sentence is increased to 15 years when the pro@@ secut@@ ors are successful .
there are no death penalty in South Africa .
as Bauer Arnold can find a wei@@ rd egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools the quad@@ rup@@ ed min@@ ers were released from F@@ uses and E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen into the holidays and for further schools .
three of the hi@@ ber@@ nation in future go to the gymn@@ asium , four to the Real@@ schule . &quot;

&quot; Bauer Arnold found a strange egg , and let it out of his chicken . &quot;
&quot; instead of a chicken , a small eagle came out . &quot;
&quot; but the hope to make of him a chicken , sm@@ ashing himself , the eagle spreads on a high mountain of its wings and dra@@ in . &quot;
&quot; after that , the classes showed three and four in the classification of Yv@@ onne Frank a chicken . &quot;
&quot; they d@@ anced with the young Go@@ ck@@ eln , the cylinder bore to the bet . &quot;
&quot; the eagle stand for the integration , said Schul@@ leit@@ ner Angel@@ ika S@@ itte . &quot;
&quot; the young is different from the other k@@ ittens ( chic@@ ks ) , but included . &quot;
but he will never be like a chicken .
his purpose is to be free .
they wished to every four @-@ t@@ äss@@ ler that he has been accepted in his new school .
&quot; he was followed by thank@@ s@@ words to the colleagues , the former school leader Michael Müller , who always jum@@ ps on teaching sc@@ ars , and the parent . &quot;
the kitchen @-@ time is now over , stated school teacher Sophia Schum@@ acher . &quot;
&quot; they leave their students after two years of lessons , because it was a really great time . &quot;
&quot; finally , it can rely on the quad@@ ru@@ der . &quot;
&quot; finally , all students left a song of summer time and holiday periods . &quot;
with the children great joy broke out .
for the new school year are already eight first tu@@ bing .
two Bulg@@ arians from illegal camping in Greece
&quot; two Bulg@@ arians have been det@@ ained because of illegal Camp@@ s in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted on television . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of 1 August was arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia from the police a group of illeg@@ itim@@ ate people , including the two Bulg@@ arians . &quot;
&quot; the same day they were released , while now an examination is running . &quot;
the Ministry of the State reported B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were later released .
&quot; the Greek authorities have ag@@ gra@@ v@@ ated control of the free camp@@ uses and place anyone who is found to remain in a place that is not meant for this purpose , which is not meant for that purpose . &quot;
the controls are continued throughout the season .
the ministry said that the court can hang out a money penalty .
software update for diesel vehicles : what they need to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
does diesel @-@ driver have to participate in the action ?
the most important questions and answers at the glance .
&quot; diesel Summit have offered BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW company software updates for a total of around 5,@@ 3 million cars . &quot;
you should improve the emissions from cars of emissions in Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ Diesel or worse are excluded .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin of ACE Auto Club Europe are in@@ valuable :
is the new action comp@@ uls@@ ory ?
&quot; no , the tra@@ ded software updates are voluntary . &quot;
&quot; the oblig@@ atory updates are only applicable to the vehicles , the Schum@@ mel@@ software , &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
their retro@@ fit is arranged by the Bundes@@ amt @-@ Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
&quot; the makers have announced a fast implementation during the next months , but still no exact date . &quot;
Daimler has mit@@ ig@@ ated to write every person concerned .
&quot; if any in@@ spec@@ tion is due , this will be done in the frame . &quot;
how long are the conver@@ sions go up in a total of ?
&quot; difficult to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
the link@@ ages from the engagement of the manufacturer as well as of political pressure .
&quot; for we have seen it volunt@@ arily , the car manufacturers in the subject environment has not yet been given . &quot;
how long is the update take ?
the change@@ over itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming could be it to get an appointment .
&quot; what do car drivers who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ? &quot;
the ACE t@@ ends to wait .
&quot; presum@@ ably foreign manufacturers would pull abroad , so S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
&quot; now , is a massive price @-@ loss of Euro @-@ 4 cars ? &quot;
the ACE feared that .
&quot; but even in the regions , where exp@@ ulsion thre@@ aten . &quot;
in rural areas there is so far no value loss for older diesel .
the ACE t@@ ends to wait with an sale yet .

&quot; Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ achs Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , continues in the coming year in R@@ ente . &quot;
the location is already written - appropriate applic@@ ants are however rare .
for 31 years is W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister .
&quot; and the work still makes him great fun , as he speaks in the presses . &quot;
&quot; he reports to diversi@@ fied , but also demanding tasks that are waiting for his successor . &quot;
at the same time wonder@@ ed that so far we do not fill the application profile .
the city is looking for a night@@ ly at the next time a architect or Bau@@ in@@ genie@@ ur .
that is to be - in regard to the regular cancellation and still enough time for a preparation .
&quot; da Has@@ lach was function@@ ed for the Board of Directors as a sub @-@ class authority , the applic@@ ants must be appropriate . &quot;
because this function wants to keep the city definitely .
&quot; would it not be able to fill them out more , they would have to drive them for advice to Off@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; but it is important to the city and himself , says W@@ acker , who reported by a good company , as well as a good mood between the authority and the citizens . &quot;
&quot; in more than 30 years in office , some major projects have accum@@ ulated to look back with pride . &quot;
&quot; we make the city liv@@ able , &quot; he is sure about the building office and its staff . &quot;
but also in the future are varied projects on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the Dutch park .
&quot; the Kin@@ zig@@ bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach will be renewed , even the stadium is still subject to . &quot;
&quot; the latter is only about 1.5 million euros to book be@@ ech , &quot; &quot; if we &apos;re doing right &quot; , &quot; appreci@@ ates W@@ acker . &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks are waiting for my success@@ ors . &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
&quot; versatile , for a municipal master of large room . &quot;
with Has@@ l@@ achs en &apos;s private construction farm and gar@@ dener could be quite flexible with it .
&quot; one can move a lot , &quot; so w@@ acker , and the design of the green zones are often mentioned by citizens and visitors . &quot;
&quot; since the old town is standing as ensemble under monument protection , it is important to have an eye for what it fits , stres@@ ses the out@@ building climb@@ s . &quot;
&quot; anyway , the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister carries high responsibility . &quot;
&quot; it is builder , &quot; in the end everything goes here about my table . &quot;
&quot; during support and coordination , he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neum@@ ai@@ er ( high @-@ construction ) has been in the company for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( Tief@@ en@@ bau ) for 15 years . &quot;
&quot; also , that his successor remains long , &quot; W@@ acker : &quot; we are looking for someone who truly does and want to stay with this place . &quot;
&quot; because continuity is not only important for a good company , but also for the further design of the city . &quot;
&quot; who wants to meet Roland W@@ acker , should be able to provide information about the town of Has@@ lach a completed study as a diplom@@ a engineer or Bachelor &apos;s degree in architecture as well as a specialist knowledge in the areas of building work and construction material . &quot;
&quot; Stadt@@ bau@@ atel@@ ier under@@ ne@@ ering and fre@@ el@@ ding , building conduc@@ t@@ ations , administration of urban locations , urban tourism , municipal council , municipal office and sub @-@ builder authorities , including monument protection authorities , including monuments . &quot;
biking on lines : 12 ground @-@ line closed
&quot; according to police , the previously unknown perpet@@ rators had thrown the blue bike of the railway station in the area of Le@@ ob@@ ener Street ( B@@ 116 ) on the lines . &quot;
these have been so sever@@ ely damaged that the desc@@ ending goods had to be stopped .
investig@@ ators go from two male birds and looking for the night hours after them .
near the crime scene had been observed by witnesses a ros@@ ar@@ oter rolling and a bike driver .
&quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ anno@@ ver , &quot; &quot; Ö@@ BB @-@ Spe@@ aker Christoph Pos@@ ch said to APA . &quot;
he or the perpet@@ rators would have taken care of itself in great danger and also puts the train traffic .
&quot; in addition to the damage to the Lo@@ k and the plant , as well as the delay , and the cost of rail users could also come to the perpet@@ rators . &quot;
&quot; overall , of a &quot; considerable &quot; sum &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot;
&quot; the damage was fixed at the Friday morning , the railway traffic on the south ground up could be led without disabilities . &quot;
&quot; almost ten person@@ ages were like Friday morning , two of them looked at the remote traffic . &quot;
&quot; Gü@@ ter@@ ings did not fall off , but they had delay . &quot;
according to Ö@@ BB @-@ speaker Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be replaced approximately 200 metres of upper @-@ lines .
isol@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
&quot; rot@@ ten meat , dairy products and chocolate could help to all@@ evi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ els ) . &quot;
red meat and chocolate can sound for your digest@@ ion as a night@@ mare .
&quot; but a new study claims precisely the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , the symptoms of patients could all@@ evi@@ ate with inflammatory bow@@ el diseases . &quot;
&quot; the incur@@ able condition which concerns about 1.3 million in the US around 1.3 million and in the UK 30@@ 0.000 , causing magn@@ itude ste@@ aming and blo@@ ating , recur@@ ring or bloody diarr@@ hea , weight loss and extreme ti@@ redness . &quot;
&quot; during those affected normally , meat and dairy products are to avoid their symptoms , researchers found at the Wash@@ ing@@ toner University , researchers found the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins to develop immune cells which promote a toler@@ ant intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , stated that immun@@ itis in the intest@@ ines pat@@ rol , to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes were hiding in the food not in the body . &quot;
&quot; cells , the capable of infection , inflammation , are balanced from cells to promote tolerance and protect the body without compens@@ ate for sensitive tissues . &quot;
&quot; if the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation , it can result in an inflammation . &quot;
&quot; in experiments , it was found that a kind of tolerance of immune @-@ promoting imm@@ unity on mice occurs which carry a certain bacter@@ ium in their intest@@ ines . &quot;
and the bacter@@ ium requires Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the blocks of proteins - to dis@@ solve the appearance of the cells .
&quot; Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; &quot; we have a connection between a bacteria - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the intest@@ ine micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that foster tolerance . &quot;
&quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han had the mice in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and an on tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han rich diet toler@@ ated , less anti @-@ inflammatory bow@@ ling , if the same system is s@@ wir@@ ing at humans . &quot;
&quot; presented in Dr. Luisa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an under@@ sear@@ ched a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found out that a group of study com@@ ers had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , but that was not accommod@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; it suspected that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ous of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i that usually live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract . &quot;
&quot; the intest@@ ines of the mice were found DNA @-@ sequ@@ enced and there were six species species found in mice with the immune cells , but without them out of mice . &quot;
&quot; mice were raised in an ster@@ il@@ ous environment so that they did not l@@ acked the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome , and they did not developed this kind of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells . &quot;
&quot; to understand how the bacteria count on the immune system , the researchers settled L. reu@@ ter@@ i in a fluid and then led small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on an in@@ ripe immune cells which were isolated from mice . &quot;
the immune cells developed to the toler@@ ant cells .
&quot; as the active component of the liquid was cleaned , it proved to be a by @-@ product of the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han met@@ abolic ism that is known as an in@@ dol @-@ 3 actic acid . &quot;
&quot; when the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the feed of the mice , the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent , but if the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ ic values were hal@@ ted , s@@ ank the number of cells around half . &quot;
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an declared that people have the same toler@@ ating cells such as mice and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i protect our stomach @-@ intestinal tract .
&quot; it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ side products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i the cells in humans develop such as mice , but def@@ ects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el . &quot;
&quot; she said : &quot; &quot; the development of these cells is probably something we want to promote , as these cells are inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot;
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i lead to a expansion of these populations .
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United with Nem@@ anja M@@ atic has committed a &quot; genius &quot;
&quot; at Manchester United he signed a &quot; &quot; genius &quot; &quot; with Nem@@ anja M@@ atic , believes in Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut in S@@ amp@@ dor@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; 40 million pounds of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before starting the UEF@@ A @-@ Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday , as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira according to will . &quot;
&quot; however , M@@ atic had been excluded from the prepar@@ atory Asia tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes to what M@@ our@@ in@@ ho had to improve before the beginning of the Premier League season . &quot;
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks of football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot;
&quot; we will help him to be ready sooner than later . &quot;
besides M@@ atic started Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Luk@@ ak@@ u in the avi@@ va stadium when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho was his start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season .
&quot; the Independent Dis@@ closure in this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho writes also three further novel@@ ties , but he insi@@ sted that the Club has already done a &quot; fantastic work &quot; to fulfil three of his four pre @-@ oriented real@@ ities . &quot;
&quot; three of four to get , I would like to thank the association , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four of four out of four , but they have given great effort . &quot;
Boeing &quot; m@@ alt &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the US @-@ car manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
&quot; the pilots flew from Seattle to the US state Washington , but drawing in Marqu@@ ette in Marqu@@ ette in Michigan and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , these are several thousand kilometers . &quot;
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the ra@@ dar sk@@ ies was to be the form of a Dream@@ liner .
the whole thing was a digest@@ i@@ ble for new engines .
Boeing had already made such commerci@@ als earlier .
so the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing @-@ Logo in the sky was painted .
&quot; new window for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem &quot;
&quot; however , the wind turned aside : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still the SPD boss , the S @-@ Democratic Prime Minister before elections always came to Berlin with a certain worry about Berlin . &quot;
&quot; just no interference from the party central , just no head@@ wind from the covenant - it was the most important wish of elect@@ oral campaigns . &quot;
&quot; since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has changed fundamentally . &quot;
&quot; since then , the staff of the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ House have been watching the events from the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ House with increasing de@@ compos@@ ing events in the SPD . &quot;
&quot; what Schulz has been from there since the beginning of the year , with head@@ wind would not be described in the base . &quot;
there were frozen .
and one after another .
&quot; the covenant @-@ CD@@ U looks after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , a general signal against co@@ al@@ itions of SPD and Gre@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; this shows once more : red green green can simply not be reliable , &quot; said CD@@ U @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber , the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
the surprising fac@@ tional fraction of a Green @-@ MEP called the Government of Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) in a serious crisis .
five months before the first @-@ day election its red @-@ green coalition lost their A @-@ voice @-@ majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green @-@ Federal @-@ Managing Director Michael Kell@@ ner has asked the ab@@ sent@@ enced Hungarian Gre@@ ties Elke T@@ westen to return their mandate to their mandate .
the transition to the CD@@ U means a clear fal@@ si@@ fication of the elect@@ orate .
&quot; Elke T@@ westen there must be back immediately its mandate , &quot; said the Bundes@@ secretary and election @-@ president of the Gre@@ ater Network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; but it must not be true at all , si@@ gh@@ ten up a SPD @-@ election , when the new pi@@ ob@@ s@@ bot@@ an@@ ship will be the party central . &quot;
&quot; Stephan W@@ eil , SPD @-@ Prime Minister of Nieder@@ s@@ achsen , stands after the trans@@ gres@@ sing of the green Parliament Elke T@@ westen to the CD@@ U without their own government officials . &quot;
it is the pro@@ visional point of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD .
and no one knows what next comes .
the Mis@@ ere began with the unexpected defeat at the Saarland &apos;s election in March .
&quot; a blue eye , more not , cal@@ med the com@@ rade . &quot;
after the elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and Nord@@ rhein @-@ Westfalen everything will be different .
this was then also - and it all became significantly worse .
&quot; the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD over the di@@ vers , the Du@@ essel@@ dorf , the party was smooth . &quot;
te@@ di@@ ous the comrades in the weeks back then again .
&quot; then , when they had just had new courage , the G @-@ 20 Summit came from Hamburg . &quot;
and with him came the next descent .
&quot; Mayor Olaf Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD leader , lost its Nim@@ bus in that weekend because he sat in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie , while his city burned . &quot;
and because he made quite everything wrong in the crisis of crisis : what you can do wrong .
&quot; since then , Schol@@ z has been fighting for his political survival . &quot;
now also Stephan W@@ eil .
&quot; because of the VW @-@ de@@ gas and its role in the Super@@ vis@@ ory Board , the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Prime Minister has already been in criticism for some time in criticism . &quot;
http : / / www.ypagesusa.com / guide / cash _ regist@@ ers.htm
&quot; nevertheless , or perhaps precisely , W@@ eil has always tried to put W@@ eil in the past weeks to put in the covenant acc@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; the amb@@ ition of the former Mayor of Hanover , his power in Berlin , remained not hidden in comrades in the surroundings of Martin Schulz . &quot;
&quot; they let him give him , because they talked about a stabil@@ isation of the party . &quot;
&quot; now , the exact opposite could happen . &quot;
&quot; in this case , W@@ eil is not true in the im@@ parti@@ ality of the Lower @-@ Sax@@ on Gre@@ ens , basically no fault . &quot;
and Schulz is not at all .
&quot; sometimes , the comrades make an effort to keep his own ranks closed . &quot;
&quot; your wrath is aimed at the Gre@@ ens , and here especially to the ab@@ sent@@ en@@ ched parliament@@ arians in T@@ westen . &quot;
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic , like Mrs T@@ westen off their own career eating above the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD @-@ Bundestag , the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. T@@ westen is not elected because of its person as a direct channel @-@ can@@ ine , but had voted on the state list of the Lower Green Gre@@ ens , so the Sax@@ on @-@ Sax@@ on . &quot;
the logical consequence would it be that she returns to their mandate .
&quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , chief of the SPD @-@ Bundestag , ev@@ acu@@ ated an &quot; democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the elect@@ or@@ atory of four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan W@@ eil to the prime minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann who passes his head @-@ Sax@@ on SPD as a top candidate into the Bundestag election . &quot;
&quot; now the personal career call for a future CD@@ U @-@ MP@@ s , said Op@@ per@@ mann further . &quot;
he demanded to elu@@ ci@@ date the back@@ grounds .
I want to know if there has been more or more advanced to the CD@@ U Lower Saxony has been given .
sponsors for Ort@@ ern III
who wants to stay in the years back home can soon get support from the country .
informed about Mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives of Ste@@ g Stadt@@ development on Wednesday in Emp@@ fingen .
&quot; at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ ind@@ ler gave another review to the date so far . &quot;
since 1991 there are in Emp@@ fingen areas .
&quot; at that time , in the refurb@@ ishment I from 1991 to 2004 , the country Baden @-@ Württemberg has taken over two thir@@ ds of the funding . &quot;
&quot; in the refurb@@ ishment area II from 2005 to 2016 , the supplement was still at 60 percent . &quot;
&quot; for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the previous renov@@ ations are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is finally important to promote the development , and not just new buildings . &quot;
&quot; on April 4 , one has received the information from the Mayor of Karlsruhe the information that there will be a refurb@@ ishment . &quot;
&quot; the funding rate is charged 8@@ 33 333 Euro , more than 500 000 Euros from the country , the rest of the municipality of Emp@@ fingen . &quot;
how is a refurb@@ ishment ?
&quot; I will continue to investigate , examine where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are . &quot;
&quot; but it also play a role , whether in the planned area there is interest in all the interest . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , the territory may also be post@@ pon@@ ed again . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel . &quot;
&quot; Keller presented the contents of the federal state programme &quot; Social City , &quot; where the renov@@ ations would then be carried out . &quot;
&quot; the core of the program is the rev@@ ital@@ ization of internal capitals , enhancing the residential and employment conditions and the expansion of infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; the measures would target object @-@ related , i.e. per property . &quot;
the refurb@@ ishment area would eventually be defined as stat@@ utes .
the approval period for funding is running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026 .
&quot; until September this year , this year would only once again be conducted the invent@@ ory , as part of which those involved in the refurb@@ ishment area will receive a questionn@@ aire for filling out . &quot;
&quot; in November or December , the stat@@ utes committee shall be made as possible in the coming year with the renov@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann stated that every commune must be carried out on the pro@@ pon@@ ed investigations . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about how to evaluate the urban@@ istic ab@@ ilia , and decide when rolling , and to what extent . &quot;
it will also apply to the respective property for the respective property .
&quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again to Emp@@ fingen and make a picture of the situation , she spoke . &quot;
&quot; Got@@ zel stressed , a key success factor for the project is the participation of the participants . &quot;
&quot; therefore , there will be questionn@@ aires who will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and will be filled out by the end of the summer holidays . &quot;
&quot; the yellow questionn@@ aire is the &quot; building &quot; and the property &quot; , &quot; in which it is among other things in order to build the construc@@ tional condition and renov@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in gray questionn@@ aire , the &quot; household and resi@@ dency &quot; , &quot; data can be made in size , division and residents of a living room . &quot;
the blue &quot; operating bow &quot; is only to fill out when building business spaces are operated .
&quot; however , the de@@ zel pointed out that a filled questionn@@ aire is not at the same time an application for funding . &quot;
re @-@ measures not imp@@ aired .
&quot; Sch@@ ind@@ ler emphas@@ ised that the distribution of funding for the &quot; &quot; wind@@ ling &quot; &quot; work - who first comes , war@@ ts first . &quot;
&quot; one could not make a support for later &quot; &quot; reservations &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; finally , pictures of the project &quot; &quot; Ort@@ ler II &quot; &quot; were shown to make a tasty . &quot;
brit@@ ish invent@@ ors also sets a micro@@ chip in order to get into house and car
&quot; a brit@@ ish inventor is the first in the country which is equipped with a micro@@ chip so that he can enter his door@@ step , and can even start his door@@ step and can even start with a hand@@ ing movement . &quot;
&quot; Steven North@@ am , 33 , had the tiny chip between thum@@ b and fore@@ finger im@@ plan@@ ed and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through its company Bio@@ Te@@ q . &quot;
&quot; he signed up with Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , a consult@@ ative ana@@ esth@@ ood at the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standard . &quot;
the technology resem@@ bles a cats and dogs impl@@ anted micro@@ chip and takes only 30 seconds .
&quot; the company of Mr. North@@ am also wants to change the castles of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for an extra cost of £ 300 per lock . &quot;
&quot; the married father of one has now built both at home and in his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel . &quot;
the advertising @-@ cost of the White House cost tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands
&quot; the decision of the White House to fly a n@@ avy helicop@@ ter for an event that highlights the American production last month , tax@@ pay@@ ers will leave for the details of the military which were left to the TIME magazine , up to 24.@@ 000 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One when the president is on board , the heart of the event was on July 17th in the White House with American developers . &quot;
&quot; President Donald Tru@@ mp , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and executive officials of the White House made a tour of our products from all over 50 states . &quot;
the handmade helicop@@ ter was built in addition to a yacht from Maine , a fire@@ car from Wisconsin and a fork st@@ acking from Mississippi . &quot;
&quot; the military office of the White House complet@@ es the presence of the helicop@@ ter order in a frag@@ mentary order or Fr@@ ago , barely 36 hours before the helicop@@ ter at South Law@@ n landed on the record of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit which is responsible for the operation of the helicop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; I just wanted to realize that you are aware of it because there is such an unusual event with a high visibility , the com@@ mander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 wrote on the eve of the event of his su@@ peri@@ ors , the dep@@ uty nav@@ al de@@ ur for avi@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the message showed that the helicop@@ ter appeared on 17 July at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning at the South Law@@ n for the event at 3 p.m. , and so long remained , until the lawn between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 was cleaned on this evening . &quot;
&quot; the note add that , if the departure from the White House should be del@@ ayed , due to the restriction of the service hours a second team would be required for the return flight . &quot;
the original aircraft was found during the event during helicop@@ ter while the security bul@@ let@@ al of unity remained during the time on the ground .
&quot; from the TIME at the disposal of the recordings were not clear , whether in the end a second flight was required . &quot;
the Hat@@ ch Act ver@@ offers federal , state property for political purposes . &quot;
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked if the event could hurt the destination .
&quot; one question we asked whether it was about a violation of Hat@@ ch acts , and we were informed that this was not the case , wrote the command . &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you are locked , &quot; &quot; rep@@ lied the dep@@ uty com@@ mander . &quot;
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not be covered by the Hat@@ ch Act .
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
&quot; at the event , the president gave an imp@@ etus to reform of health reform that was under@@ way in the Senate , and he prop@@ ag@@ ated the efforts on intru@@ sion of government regulations . &quot;
&quot; the use of the aircraft that is known as Marine One or Air Force One , out of politically advant@@ ageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon . &quot;
Presi@@ dents are obliged to use them for the journey .
&quot; but their use only for a photo @-@ OP is unusual , is unusual . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp resulted in February an examination as the presidential plane in front of the background of his first camp@@ agn@@ en@@ r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , Tax@@ i@@ services , and his Twitter account is full of announ@@ cements based on the use of the presidential vehicle through its predecessor . &quot;
&quot; the White House is enthusiastic about the Show &quot; &quot; Made In America &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 states to be produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the dep@@ uty press tour of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 occup@@ ies often lead training trips around Washington and South Law@@ n around the US @-@ President in the White House with precise Zen@@ ker movements .
&quot; when Tru@@ mp was held at the beginning of July at the G@@ 20 Summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 resulted in the White House 58 evil @-@ land@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event was one of the training needs of the aircraft for the month , said an official . &quot;
helicop@@ ter units are in addition 11 hours a day for non @-@ presidential support .
&quot; the White House said that tax@@ pay@@ ers were the burden on any of the other requ@@ is@@ ites , which were presented on the event . &quot;
a spokes@@ man by S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky said that the company was not involved in the helicop@@ ter at the South Law@@ n .
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 has no budget design@@ ations for the occasion , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event . &quot;
&quot; according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the U.S. Department of Defense for the fis@@ cal year 2017 , the DO@@ D @-@ ticket sales for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per flight time . &quot;
&quot; records of the unit record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Cor@@ ps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia . &quot;
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of the operation of the helicop@@ ter is far below this rate .
&quot; the cost of tax pay@@ ers calculated on the basis of the estimates for the eurozone , is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; this estimates involve staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual means . &quot;
&quot; according to a R@@ AND study from 2015 included the revenue costs for DO@@ D not the recru@@ itment , but take into account the cost of fuel , maintenance and contract . &quot;
&quot; at that time the former press pre@@ ached of the White House , Sean Sp@@ ic@@ er , the use of the helicop@@ ter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present this week things that are made in America , &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot;
&quot; and I know that S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and the State of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not even thousands of people are dependent on it . &quot;
and I think like most Americans are all proud of the helicop@@ ter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
&quot; of course , it is appropriate to highlight this . &quot;
&quot; it was not clear whether Tru@@ mp inter@@ viewed with helicop@@ ter , when he prayed to his tour across the South Law@@ n for the event , but he sat down in the back@@ seat of a fire@@ car . &quot;

&quot; despite after five games still mak@@ ell@@ os@@ er balance sheet , the top re@@ iter of the Second Tennis @-@ Bundes@@ lig@@ a has received the sense of reality . &quot;
chief Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has certainly respect for the opponent .
&quot; this is a compact team , which always plays in quite a similar formation . &quot;
&quot; especially on the rear positions I find the team very good . &quot;
for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer S@@ V above all the imports from the high north .
&quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even refer to bet@@ s in the Davis Cup .
&quot; and they are also strong in double , &quot; says Z@@ ay with views of Har@@ ri Hel@@ i@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andre Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen as well as Andreas Bj@@ er@@ reh@@ us ( all Denmark ) . &quot;
&quot; it will be as always difficult for us .
&quot; you also need a good degree of luck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ uss@@ er team for the trip to the high north is practical .

going back@@ wards : the town presents 46 kitchen@@ ds a
the city organized the K@@ ita @-@ lunch time again .
with fixed contact partners for the children and a assignment to the team .
in the urban nur@@ sery the clock is returned .
&quot; on September 1st , the city of Kre@@ feld takes over the local food supply in the urban nur@@ sery ( Kit@@ as ) again in self @-@ reg@@ im@@ bur@@ ial . &quot;
&quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , Deputy Head of Youth aid , this is good news : &quot; we all have been very happy . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , further than the house : a cat@@ erer will take over this task and delivers fresh air @-@ cool@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the city runs in the Kre@@ feld area 46 kinder@@ garten , in 44 getting the children of lunch time a warm meal . &quot;
&quot; in the past kit@@ aj@@ ahr , 28@@ 00 kids at the tables , and the need is growing constantly . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , not only children who are over@@ looked after 45 weekends , in the K@@ ita , explains Pom@@ mer@@ ancy . &quot;
the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour supervision when children up to 14 o &apos;clock .
&quot; 46 Particip@@ ants from 1 September kitchen service : they war@@ ms the fishing dishes , complement your salad , raw food and fruit , por@@ tion@@ ate the meal individually , give food out , clean , rin@@ se and clean the kitchen . &quot;
&quot; the employees are firmly assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ ancy . &quot;
the size - there are two group @-@ group@@ ed as well as seventh facilities - decide over the poles .
&quot; the kitchen @-@ helping belong now to the K@@ ita @-@ Team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ ancy . &quot;
&quot; so they are much stronger involved and it is easier to implement the ital@@ ian concepts , educational concepts . &quot;
because this is why there is a healthy diet and cooking .
the children should help to prepare the food .
the direct connection of the kitchen @-@ power to the team is useful .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a well known strength in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar to them , and not ever changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the inf@@ ancy of the K@@ ita @-@ Sp@@ aces - thus also the task of the kitchen of the kitchen - will be done in the future by special cleaning personnel .
&quot; this variant is the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - in addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen , it also has the charm that it has taken out for the city as the most economical and foreign policy , it is from the press office . &quot;
and that although 46 divi@@ ders are new to be dis@@ continued .
&quot; but these hours fall around 750 people at the extending area not so strongly in weight , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;

G@@ MB concern about investing in the Mc@@ Vit@@ ie @-@ Fabrik in Glasgow
a union would like to engage with managers of the bis@@ cuit manufacturer Mc@@ Vit@@ ie on long term commitment to produce production in Glasgow .
G@@ MB Scotland said the company has ou@@ tw@@ ei@@ gh on the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross site .
more than 500 employees work in the factory in addition to other products Hob@@ bies and Rich Tea Cook@@ se .
Mc@@ V@@ ities owners Pl@@ adi@@ s said he has invested more than 5 million pounds over the past few years .
&quot; he added that staff and trade union would be &quot; first experienced , &quot; if their activities would change . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the branches of the company called for G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vit@@ ie &apos;s , &quot; raise concerns , &quot; concerns the financing for the modernis@@ ation of production lines . &quot;
&quot; G@@ MB @-@ Senior organiz@@ er Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; the fact that we cannot win clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , our members are deeply concerned . &quot;
&quot; generations of families have worked here and working on the local community and the metro@@ politan area Glasgow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social dis@@ advant@@ aged . &quot;
&quot; therefore , under the perspective of job creation , wage and prosperity , and against the background of the Bre@@ xit , the rising life costs and the long production of life , the eastern end of Glasgow strongly urgently a thri@@ ving production presence at Mc@@ Vit@@ ie . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ person of Pl@@ adi@@ s said : &quot; &quot; the Fili@@ al@@ der at T@@ oll@@ cross has received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland yesterday and the company will respond directly to it , as we estimate the continued commitment to employees and trade unions . &quot;
&quot; two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives from T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were discussed . &quot;
&quot; we discussed with the employees that we work like all companies , who are active in an extremely competitive and uns@@ afe economic situation , our business regularly review - and that applies to all our business sectors and locations - to be competitive . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; &quot; in recent years we invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot;
&quot; we recognise the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production place . if our operating procedures will change at the location , the employees and its trade unions will be the first to experience this . &quot;
does the PS@@ G Barcelona has warned three years ago in front of N@@ ey@@ mar ?
the page of La League might be an interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
&quot; Paris Saint @-@ Germain did not leave in their persecution from N@@ ey@@ mar after having lost an offer of £ 189 million , but have warned them about three years before the world war . &quot;
&quot; the sens@@ ational approach has raised the transfer window in summer , as the Lig@@ ue 1 @-@ Klub is ready to break the world record by more than doubled the previous brand , whereby Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United last season for 89 million pounds to Manchester United . &quot;
&quot; after the end , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and to the highest professional sport@@ smen of the world . PS@@ G offers wages from more than 500,000 GBP per week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is angry about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way to the outside of the Catal@@ ans , although a source has always been in the proximity of the Catal@@ ans board to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013 to take care of it . &quot;
but the football world was warned about three years ago by the PS@@ G President in front of this prospect ?
&quot; when Manchester City 2014 is interested in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for any club that wanted to sign one of the best players from PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; I am not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players , then we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; but if they try to sign up one of our players in sign , so this will have consequences . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona seems to have exceeded this line , with the Spanish club in the beginning of this summer interest in the PS@@ G @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti explicit . &quot;
&quot; PS@@ G made clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to travel under any circumstances , and Barcelona was able to feel the consequences of this interest by having one of their price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar . &quot;

&quot; interview : &quot; &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Report &quot; &quot; pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Reg@@ ensburger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &apos;s report about the abuse of waste @-@ reli@@ ed Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this means author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the con@@ cluding @-@ review of the ab@@ used sc@@ andal at the Reg@@ ensburger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen continued for discussions .
&quot; Christian Weis@@ n@@ der , spokes@@ man of the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; declared to publication from the former Reg@@ ensburger Bishop and today &apos;s Card@@ inal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year brother of emer@@ itus Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an exc@@ use . &quot;
it would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church to serve as Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger her deep regret or her at that time incorrect assessment of the proceedings would be expressed .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ atore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; on the other hand critic@@ ized that with reporting on violence in the domains with &quot; &quot; double @-@ measure &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , the author of Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and a member of the national Italian bio@@ eth@@ ic Committee , as the author of Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historians and member of the national Italian bio@@ eth@@ ic Committee . &quot;
&quot; the habit to call the Catholic Church as a source of all evil , is already part of the day @-@ day experience , and prepare public opinion to keep it for normal , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; also Für@@ sten@@ in Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Tax@@ is said in an interview with the Bav@@ arian Rund@@ funk : &quot; one likes to go on the church and this is a fil@@ med thread . &quot;
&quot; and she pointed out that in her youth &quot; saw a very normal educational means &quot; &quot; to be with friends , as I was one , ready to be finished . &quot;
&quot; it is unfair to address the standards to previous decades , because the world has changed . &quot;
&quot; in connection with reports on the abuse , often the Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared . &quot;
&quot; completely un@@ right , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who recorded with R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s mem@@ or@@ band &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; ( in 12 languages ) . &quot;
&quot; I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protecting , &quot; says H@@ esh@@ emann , &quot; For all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he analyses the results of the final . &quot;
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report which has been submitted by the di@@ oc@@ ese of Regensburg with the En@@ light@@ enment attor@@ ney Ulrich Weber ?
&quot; a total of 547 Reg@@ ensburger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were born in between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s , with high Pl@@ au@@ si@@ bility &quot; victims of over@@ print , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen sexually ab@@ used . &quot;
&quot; in the final report , it was said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who was active from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg , &quot; &quot; summar@@ izing that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. used in many cases of physical and mental violence . &quot;
&quot; especially at high emot@@ ion@@ ality , the punishment for pupils could also be viol@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , in contrast to numerous other cont@@ emplation that many victims are estimated general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases , despite violence even positive memories with him . &quot;
&quot; in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report about the ab@@ duc@@ tions of the ab@@ duc@@ tions for the Reg@@ ensburger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger his opinion is dischar@@ ged . &quot;
Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ pages report on the &quot; inci@@ dents of violence against &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ensburger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; gives a contra@@ dic@@ tory image of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; for a raise , many students emerge his &quot; &quot; humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he also appears as a chol@@ era and perf@@ ection@@ ist who became more tan@@ gible , when a domain was musi@@ cally no top performance . &quot;
how do you evaluate as its bio@@ graph of this dis@@ sertation ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : if one makes the effort and read throughout the 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself rather , why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger only takes place in it . &quot;
&quot; he has just been dedicated to eight sites , and he is clearly acqu@@ itted from every suspic@@ ion of the Medi@@ ator or fellow @-@ soldiers in the terrible cases of sexual abuse . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; non@@ violence at the pre @-@ school occurred in outside of its sphere . &quot;
it is possible to take him at all too late or not take the first accus@@ ations taken seriously enough .
&quot; the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ouw school , on which he was effective , was perceived by virtually any respon@@ dents than - &quot; &quot; salvation , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; better world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; thus the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger presents a very excellent testimony , &quot; &quot; popular &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; sincere &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; compet@@ ently , &quot; &quot; compet@@ ently , &quot; &quot; compet@@ ently , &quot; &quot; know@@ led@@ geable &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; skilled &quot; , &quot; and &quot; &quot; understanding , &quot; &quot; and &quot; always accompanied by grapes of children . &quot;
&quot; only a minority inv@@ aded themselves about its perf@@ ection@@ ism and its high emot@@ ion@@ ality , which also led to we@@ aves too . &quot;
&quot; that he doesn &apos;t only cast even with chairs and the key@@ chain , but also ear@@ rings , and all too many guys went to the hair or ears , he has already announced itself already years ago , deeply regret and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it . &quot;
&quot; however , it must be said that such educ@@ ators have to be noted in the question@@ able time , the 1960s and 1970s , were widely used in parents such as teachers . &quot;
do you still know such bre@@ ed@@ ative methods ?
&quot; of course , I think everyone of us was born before 1968 . &quot;
&quot; also I have experienced this in a world@@ ly school , a state Gymnasium . &quot;
&quot; compared to what it is actually going on in this report , namely the irre@@ plac@@ eable sexual abuse and non@@ violence at the pre@@ school , are the most certainly Bag@@ at@@ elles . &quot;
&quot; if you ask yourself , whether it is not more likely to do with his famili@@ arity and his role as a brother of Benedi@@ kt X@@ VI@@ . to do that many media has just rus@@ hed on him . &quot;
&quot; the Bav@@ arian Pope are working many , who never understood it , still fre@@ ezing . &quot;
the truth is : the report dischar@@ ged Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
in the media report a lot about the issue of abuse at the Reg@@ ensburger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger took place in the con@@ cluding report as well as any delay or co @-@ force in terms of sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : quite clearly no .
none of the 67 victims of sexual over@@ comes claims to have become familiar to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were consec@@ rated .
&quot; I have never dre@@ amed of talking to my father or my mother , &quot; &quot; said a subject of statements for the others &quot; , &quot; It was all very embarrassing . &quot;
the real problem in the education of sexual abuse has been and yet it is that most victims are not silent .
&quot; if they do not even trusted parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a choir conductor who would have been a colleague of the perpet@@ rators . &quot;
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ students R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a survey student formed it so : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he had had ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) timely findings and could have been able to have the perpet@@ rators .
&quot; I consider it ... also for really absurd , to imagine that it has been opened to him ... bubble and more clear or more likely to be opened , as opposed to their parents , intern@@ at@@ ators , trust@@ worthy teaching etc . &quot;
that one speaks to him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able .
&quot; thus the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; &quot; the students involved in the field of interest and / or their surroundings could not be trusted , in the context of the investigation . &quot;
&quot; as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is free from any fellow citizens . &quot;
&quot; thus , it cannot be thrown out to be prevented or brought him to the display . &quot;
&quot; therefore there is no reason to put his good name with these contra@@ dic@@ tory crimes , as unfortunately it happened in some cases . &quot;
in the media was much of &quot; non@@ violence &quot; at the Reg@@ ensburger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was thrown in the report .
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the big problem that missed everything in the reporting everything was mixed and mixed into a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and non@@ violence and somewhere , right in the middle of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; however , this is precisely the abuse of the report . &quot;
&quot; namely , namely clean : between the pre@@ school and the gymn@@ asium of the domains , between sexual abuse and non@@ violence as well as , let &apos;s say once any other accus@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the report addressed inci@@ dents from the period since 1945 , thus also from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not a choir conductor of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; the whole aw@@ ful test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases , in which the boys were down@@ rig@@ ated by sa@@ dist@@ an teachers and among them were un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally suffered , un@@ event@@ ful by the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ hofen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous states have to prev@@ ail . &quot;
&quot; but with whom the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he got the boys only to face when they were already on the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ouw school . &quot;
&quot; on that was , as most witnesses emphasize that the theme &quot; pre@@ school &quot; tab@@ u . &quot;
&quot; one was just happy to be to escape , and enjoyed so much better treatment and for many even &quot; &quot; paradise &quot; . &quot; &quot;
what was different at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ouw School ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was a discipline but not a dist@@ al force .
&quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , where the report comes to the conclusion that &quot; &quot; many victims are estimated general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases , despite violence even positive memories with him . &quot;
&quot; thus , most of the pre @-@ work remains to be turned away . &quot;
&quot; but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods , in which it was reported by the states at the fore@@ school . &quot;
&quot; the first time in 1970 / 71 when he began to establish itself and was not responsible for the events at a school where he did not hear and responsible , ( so the witness ) had nothing to hear , and then again to 1993 . &quot;
deteri@@ or@@ ated Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in front of the states consistently the ears ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ouw Dragon , which was even re@@ produced . &quot;
&quot; he pointed out this point , &quot; that in the pre @-@ school he will continue to pract@@ ise the aud@@ itors . &quot;
&quot; in the face of the danger of negative press , he received urgent information . &quot;
&quot; of course , this was of course at a time when legal clarity consi@@ sted , as aud@@ itors was also illegal in Bavaria too . &quot;
&quot; before , it occurred in a legal gra@@ zone , as everyone of us probably knows . &quot;
&quot; as it was difficult for him to estimate , where suffer@@ ers may have been exagger@@ ated or dramatic , and where really the per@@ mis@@ sible limit was exceeded . &quot;
&quot; but one can also not say , he always would have w@@ ai@@ ded . &quot;
this is simply not true .
in 1980 the aud@@ ited penalty was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria too .
&quot; princip@@ ally in Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Tax@@ is claimed , it is unfair to address the contemporary educational standards to that time . &quot;
how do you see that ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we are talking about the &quot; &quot; pit@@ falls of the ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; , &quot; thus the danger to assess past today &apos;s moral standards . &quot;
there the princess was right .
&quot; of course , of course , this does not apply to sexual abuse , who was ab@@ omin@@ able to all times and not for what was broken in the pre@@ school of resistance and violence against inno@@ cent inf@@ ants , that goes far beyond that time . &quot;
this is all completely horri@@ ble and I am glad that it is finally re@@ conditioned .
&quot; but at the same time I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protecting , for all that had nothing to do with him . &quot;
&quot; his means for discipl@@ ining and punishment , so ear@@ liest , and to pull on the hair and ears were widespread in the 1970s . &quot;
&quot; when physical punishment was then b@@ anned , he also has strictly adher@@ ed to it . &quot;
&quot; which image from his Reg@@ ensburger time Georg R@@ atz@@ inger took back with you for the book &quot; My brother of the Pope . &quot; &quot;
came the topic of aud@@ ited too in the language ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , therefore Pope Benedi@@ ct@@ ine X@@ VI@@ . , tells us from his perspective , as they played the domain of just one side . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , I do not mean by no means that he carried a strict reg@@ iment . &quot;
&quot; but even this must also be said : without this perf@@ ection@@ ism , without the demand of un@@ conditi@@ onally discipline , it would probably hardly have been possible to form the national famous Reg@@ ensburger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen an institution of Wel@@ tran@@ g to form the true culture of Europe and his musical tradition that went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with bis@@ cuits and sweets alone one makes a big singer and stand before any success , right in which area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ over@@ coming . &quot;
what kind of man did you experience Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in interviews with her book ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : through work on the book and beyond that I met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really very well , and again seen as a wonderful , hum@@ orous , basic , deep st@@ itious and sav@@ vy people , from which one could not imagine that he could only do a fly with a fly . &quot;
&quot; I am regularly rewarded with how many former dom@@ ed cats still talk to him , 23 years after his Emer@@ itus , regularly contact him to visit him , he is nearly blind - and to deal with him as a member of her family . &quot;
those who don &apos;t forgive him up today that he was once strict to them are clearly in the minority .
&quot; today , most domains are thank@@ ful to him today that he has enriched their lives and fre@@ ight the world of music . &quot;
&quot; and that he always was a good , fa@@ ther@@ ly teacher - a hard father , certainly that may be - but also a remarkable respect to which they still have to look up today and to turn them straight . &quot;
&quot; and please , even quite clear : all that one thro@@ ws to him are educ@@ ative methods that were then on the order of the day . &quot;
we can be glad that we have been overcome this time long .
&quot; but it is most un@@ just , a man , just because he is prominent and one more prominent brother has to make a medi@@ al s@@ inner . &quot;
&quot; there is the wicked intention , which is behind it , only too obvious . &quot;
&quot; for the report , which has just been published , dischar@@ ged him . &quot;
&quot; now the accumulation of state would have acquired a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has acquired great mer@@ its and would like to know in Germany without the govern@@ ors of Bavaria , finally in peace . &quot;
