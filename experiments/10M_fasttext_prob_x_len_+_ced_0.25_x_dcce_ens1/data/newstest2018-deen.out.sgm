<seg id="7">"this knows everyone who had to upright, because the auto-Navi takes place on a green meadow."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the historical maps of the digital Bavaria Atlases, an offer of Geoportals of the State Government, everything else is up-to-date - but precisely very revealing."</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when you compare them to the current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the cities and communities in the spread-area of the munich Merkur have changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria-Atlas is a patchures that can be seen as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">"a large overpostcard have been in detail for cities and communities in detail, so-called Urpositional blades."</seg>
<seg id="13">These were originated according to the Bavarian surveying administration between 1810 and 1864 and jump to the first survey of Bayers.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your Client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leaders occupied Bavaria since the spring 1800 during the Second coalition of war with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon took an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographic recording of Bavaria in order - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">"even if French troops picked up with the peace of LUNÉVILLE from 9 February 1801, there were today's neighbours that created the idea of a surface-capped Bavaria card."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph was driving the project ahead, founded the" "Topographic Bureau" "- and thus the Bavarian surveying administration."</seg>
<seg id="19">The certificate's document dates back to Munich from the year 1856 and is like all other on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of Earlier / Today is the example of the state capital of the most impressive.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown up.</seg>
<seg id="22">"an example of this is subsendling, which appears in the map of 1856 relatively isolated."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Sendling was posted 21 years after creation of the map, so 1877."</seg>
<seg id="24">"today, Subsendling is in the middle of the city."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the houses of Untersendlings focus on 1856 along today Plinganserstraße, which was named after 1878 after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the Bavarian peasants against Austria 1705."</seg>
<seg id="26">"where today the Westpark is, you see nothing but fields - at first glance: with the hinder lines and numbers: hand-signed ads are derived from the so-called" "Urges" "from which the basic tax was derived."</seg>
<seg id="27">"small plots do not show farmers there today, but small gardeners of the plant" land in Sun. ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green space stands north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">"the Theresienwiese, since 1810 locations of the Oktoberfests, was in fact a meadow - and no concrete bust."</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar there is an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">"in the Urpositional blatt, one reads in the area of today's Au-Haidhausen, not only the street names" "at the Gasteig" "or" "On the ventilation" "- but also in large letters" "Irren Anstalt". ""</seg>
<seg id="32">"yes, here at the Auerfelstraße you once used people with madness."</seg>
<seg id="33">There was 1858 / 59 the Munich circle-Irrenanstalt "On the Auer Lüder.</seg>
<seg id="34">"from 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudder led the furnishings - that psychiatrist who is associated with the death of King Ludwigs."</seg>

<seg id="36">"furthermore, he is forbidden to apply violence against the passengers," says Hermann Wilhelm, Director of the Museum Haidhausen, who is employed for an exhibition with the institution. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"for 280 patients had first place, later was extended to 500 places."</seg>
<seg id="38">"sometime, this capacity is no longer used - the reason for the construction of the circurenanstalt in hair 1905."</seg>
<seg id="39">"since 2006, the Isar-Amper Klint Munich-East has been one of Germany's largest psychiatrical Germany since 2006."</seg>
<seg id="40">On the area of the former Auer Anstalt now meet young people in the Munich Salesianum.</seg>

<seg id="50">Civil Group released Reisewarage for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for promoting colored has issued a warning for colored people who are travelling to Missouri because of the discriminatory policy and the racist attacks of the State to Missouri.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the federal state Missouri, which should enter into force until 28 August 2017, calls for afro-American travelers, visitors and Missourianer, as a series of fragmentary, racial recases occur in recent times throughout the state and here," says it in the opinion of the group. "</seg>
<seg id="53">"a recently adopted law from Missouri, which makes people more difficult to gain discrimination, as well as the prosecution of the state, the disproportionate of minorities, the group, the rice nobility, said the NAACP."</seg>
<seg id="54">They have violations of civil rights that happen people.</seg>
<seg id="55">"they are stopped because of their skin colour, they are merged or killed," said the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star. "</seg>
<seg id="56">"we listen to complaints in such a frequency, which we have not yet heard."</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that has issued the organisation for a state in the US.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the Group quoted as racial rebel against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">"Sanders also died in the circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had taken no petrol during the journey through the state and was taken away from the police of Missouri in custody without being accused of a crime."</seg>
<seg id="60">"the Council has also pointed to a recent announced report by the office of the General Office, in which it is shown that black drivers in the state are raised by 75 percent more common than whites."</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and their families, friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri," "said Chapel."</seg>
<seg id="62">People need to be ready if there is no tension-money or the relatives know that they are traveling through the state.</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri signed in 2015 100 Hasakverbreak after the latest figures from the Al-Spicy Spainment program of the FBI that respect the state in relation to the number of such violations on the 16th scale of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">"the rice is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult, a company for housing or employment discrimination."</seg>
<seg id="65">"previously, the American Civil Liberties Union had published the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), after the states adopted immigration legislation to commit people because of immigration policy, leading to the opinion of ACLU for further segregation."</seg>
<seg id="66">"rice ings are usually issued by the Ministry for other countries, but in recent times, stakeholders have employed the measure as a reaction to certain laws and trends within the US."</seg>
<seg id="67">Weidezvproject is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The heredacher Weidezaun project is a success project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU-Bundestagitator Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac have given a picture on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="70">"at the rectangle of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the heredacher CDU-Located together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members."</seg>
<seg id="71">"Markus Schwendemann gave me an insight into his operation, in which he is 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of woods, 40 milking and also houses many kittens and also houses up in five apartments vacation guests."</seg>
<seg id="72">"the" "Black-milk" "is for him the agonal marketers for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the holiday guests come exclusively with regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">"since he is also called BLHV Chairman of the fisherman, he called the Weidezvproject as" elementary project. ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I can not engage in such steep areas.</seg>
<seg id="76">"green spaces for a lot of work, much of it must be processed with the Motorsense."</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have to fight here with the conditions and with the topography," said Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="78">"in 2003 he took over the parental operation and put this without chemical planting protection and fertilizers, even if there is no bio-operation."</seg>
<seg id="79">"for Mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear:" the Commune has recognised the importance of the Weird project, and is pleased with the leader of the leader. "</seg>
<seg id="80">"at the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hectare, the farmer would have to be supported."</seg>
<seg id="81">Hope that the forestation of the areas could still be out for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the biggest treasure that we have, are the people who work in agriculture and make thoughts about how they continue their operation," emphasised the Mayor. "</seg>
<seg id="83">The farmers are often due to promoting often in criticism</seg>
<seg id="84">"over the incundering promotion, a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced."</seg>
<seg id="85">The disclosure surface is about 40 hectares which are not allowed until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">"from the overall cost of 71 500 euros the half over Leader was promoted, a quarter carried the municipality of Fisherbach."</seg>
<seg id="87">"thus, the farmers remained 12 610 euros, they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of turnkey."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="89">Kordula Kovac stressed: "you are doing a really good job, without farmers and farmer."</seg>
<seg id="90">"also for Peter white stood firm," "here the best food is produced."</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscape shooting range (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows the state to promote pastfences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is the revealing of the Schwarzwald.</seg>
<seg id="93">Prerequisite is the presence of one of the LPR climbers.</seg>
<seg id="94">"in addition, the expansioning area must not be slender. (Hanging over 35 percent) and must be threatened by forestation."</seg>
<seg id="95">"for the heredacher Weidezvproject 2018 it is currently running for eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build nearly 16 kilometers fence."</seg>
<seg id="96">"the disclosure surface corresponds 35 hectares, the calculated cost of over 112 000 euros."</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump is taking the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is it when they begin to attain the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans also appreciate these as any other - hence the careful overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos place in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump-regime, surely knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heat dispute with Jim Acosta by CNN on the proposals of the President to the drastic restriction of the legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">"to stay fair, Miller access not the statue itself."</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and liberty-imitators should have suffered him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but he took hold of their importance, and in particular the meaning that it was written, when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after completion of the monument was added."</seg>
<seg id="105">"as Miller Acosta, I will not go here to a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that the world illuminated."</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem that you relate to which later was added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is objectively true, but as he formed it himself, it is not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about the contemporary resonance on the emerging words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state invites not just any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor:" "your poor, your poor, and your affliced masses, who want to breathe free, to exhallow off your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">"there was never a time, in which the" "waste" "was better to see on our screen."</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not join in literal criticism - he clearly made that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict due to the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural examination: it is in fact a conflict around the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and their friends who sat down to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they completed a high-political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicanism in an abused classical portrayal of freedom-embodiment of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in their poem the female figure is no more abstract - she has got a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she herself gives herself a very different name: mother of the exilant.</seg>
<seg id="116">The combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on the American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and just like Lazarus did the meaning of the statue changed, people from right wing wanted to change it for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the great cry of the Rush Limbaugh, a sort of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued 2010 that the Statue of Liberty doesn't have one another, but rather an early Neoconservatives that bring the American flame into the surrounding world:" "Lady Liberty goes forward."</seg>
<seg id="119">It is supposed to bear the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch should not enlighten the way to the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual is Limbaugh here on a bit engraved.</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is quite and certainly a question of the point of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great imaginative action of Lazarus insisted to see how they were seen by the exhaustive, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often terrible trips on the decks of ships had been seen."</seg>
<seg id="124">"it is in the truest sense to see the world from the perspective of people, seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives."</seg>
<seg id="125">Her statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they must listen.</seg>
<seg id="126">And this is of course not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to recognize.</seg>
<seg id="127">"her torch is not to enlighten the path, but the hatred, which is the only source of power."</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championships 2017: Neil Black loises Scottish members of the team of Britain</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle is located at a time when only two Scots belonged to the team of Britain</seg>
<seg id="130">"the performance of the Athletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent of the World Championships" will make a massive contribution to the team. "</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 which will start Friday.</seg>
<seg id="132">"black believes that" being developed something special in Scotland, "and the athletics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it."</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it, and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find it out," "said Black."</seg>
<seg id="134">"I speak with people at the Scottish Institute of Sports, and think that it has something to do with what they have done."</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think that it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British Athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type at the corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances is it is absolutely brilliant.</seg>
<seg id="139">"several of the Scottish athletes, medals are medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will join Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m circuit while Eilidh Doyle was elected by the team at the team of team."</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eilidh is quite modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">"your captain's speech was incredible," says Black. "</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">"the passion and the genuine feeling, the Eilidh was quite natural, were great."</seg>
<seg id="144">"the Commonwealth of silver medals, which will compete with their fifth world championships at 400-m hurdles, says that it is" incredible "that 16 shoots are at the British crew."</seg>
<seg id="145">"Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015."</seg>
<seg id="146">The Medicer Muir runs on this path and has set up five British and two European records last year.</seg>
<seg id="147">"it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runners."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, the 1,500 m runs, is another carrot, which you should be observed after a great season, which included the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games."</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle is reminded of her first World Championship as the only other carrot in Team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">"the Mannes chapters in says that they are" very proud "on the fact that many of their landers are not only part of the team, but in some cases the medals and the finalists."</seg>
<seg id="151">"what is special about the team of his team, is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honour for me but knowing that my team mates voted for me and have chosen to make me something special for me," she added. "</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously, I am very proud of all the Scots that belong to the team."</seg>
<seg id="153">It shows just how far we came.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to rise to poedies."</seg>
<seg id="155">What my speech is concerned about chapters?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think she went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">I have only pointed out that in this situation we are very happy since we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to put forward to this homegrapture and benefit from that we are back at the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go there and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there.</seg>
<seg id="160">"block critics on Facebook: do not ask for a public office, if you cannot tolerate the heating of voters."</seg>
<seg id="161">The Father of our country knew something of bad news.</seg>
<seg id="162">"the Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him because of all, from internal policies to its political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">He implied with criticism.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not have his critics to silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">"for in 1783, Washington said:" "freedom of expression can be taken away - and, stupid, and mute we are led as the sheep to the slaughter."</seg>
<seg id="166">"this brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who needs to work more like Washington."</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have been blocked by the contributions of at least 450 people and have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union deplened him at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"the rod of the Governor did the lawsuit as frivol, and the online comment was full of a counter-reaction with" Na, and?. ""</seg>
<seg id="170">"it is only Facebook," said many people. "</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is particularly important when it is a guy like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican Governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the two-highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat-head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He showed a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict compliance with the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very sent to use Facebook as a primaiden means to connect with his electors and play his haired head to chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">"therefore, the blocking of persons coming to the site of the Governor - which is a public forum that is officially referred to as officially and by employees working with public tax dollars - needless and ultimately dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="179">"in an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans spokesperson Amelia Chasse the actions of the Governor and argued that the comments of the comments was nothing more than a moderation."</seg>
<seg id="180">"but it is too easy to use the image of conciliation, or spammers or hassertive people, which vibrate online the whip."</seg>
<seg id="181">The post spoke to some of the real people that were blocked from Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">"and these are just real people who speak with their chosen leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, no Trolle."</seg>
<seg id="183">"they all said that their comments are respectful, thoughtful and not profane."</seg>
<seg id="184">The pastor zitized the Bible in his post and appendices to Hogans catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">"lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani from Bowie, Md., was not crowded, but she asked to break down."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I commented that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate relationship and other latest news," wrote in the comment section of the message "The Post."</seg>
<seg id="187">"I don't appreciate this idea if a number of people on the same subject takes position, then it is more likely to be used as a so-called collectivist use and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">What the employees of the Governor is called "focused Spam-attack" would most likely call "intercession."</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocked a critic or a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much more cleaner than in past time when you have done the same that employees were sent to collect newspapers with critical tails and to burn protesters or to keep protesters.</seg>
<seg id="191">But just this just happens digital.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official that he criticised for it on Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is emented by Twitter users that were blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question was last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">"the Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County is the last the First Amendment, according to U.S. district, James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she met a voters of her Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky he received Governor Matt Bevin (R) a visit from the ACLU because of its use on Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so hard.</seg>
<seg id="198">"at the time of Washingtons, the time of affordable porn had a similar effect as the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="199">"the number of newspapers multiplies between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters hit his guidance."</seg>
<seg id="200">And even at that time Washington anonymous trolls at that time.</seg>
<seg id="201">"the people, the pseudonyms like" Juricola, "" Valerius, "" Belisarius "and" Portius, "wrote all the letters of newspapers, the Washington's decisions made."</seg>
<seg id="202">"petitions that have collected his position on the Treaty of Amity, trade and boat trip with Britain, according to the historical documents, collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project."</seg>
<seg id="203">But he has not brought them to silence.</seg>
<seg id="204">"speech, freedom of speech and classes are the foundation of our nation."</seg>
<seg id="205">And true leadership means that to accept.</seg>

<seg id="1393">Here is a piece by Reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new rod of the White House, at his first working day with introductory staff, he set a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House, which he wanted to print: bad information that entered into the hands of the President."</seg>

<seg id="1396">Cellphones diagnosis makes sense but others tries to tame Trump by monitor its mediendices.</seg>
<seg id="1397">"President Trumps relationship with television enough decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his TV value is still strong."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"when Candidate Trump was annoyed because of an infair coverage, it was productive to show him that he was a fair reporting of places that were to convince," said the former electoral campaign Sam Nunberg in February to Politico. "</seg>

<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">"but the idea that Trumps Twitter habit ever" under control "was ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps this campaign was something that we do not know others - that Trumps Tweets could not have any more ignition or more ignition.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know something about tweets which Trump has not been sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">"when his collaborators had taken it several times, anger of him, then their efforts have been worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="1405">"however, nobody can prevent it consistently that Trump controversy is calling."</seg>
<seg id="1406">"part of the problem consists of the people in a White House, which consists of competing factions, always try to present their own agenda by promoting Trump material that possibly promotes their views from the world."</seg>
<seg id="1407">"Politico - very busy with this story - was reported in May about the preference of the consultants, the president of strategic reasons for desperate information."</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example that was described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react as a volcano on negative press releases, especially those with shameful leakks, and that he ascends to find out how these come."</seg>
<seg id="1410">"exactly this happened at the end of February, when someone asked a printed copy of an article by GotNewsroom.com, the website of the Internet provocateurs Charles C. Johnson, who proclaimed the deputy staffin Katie Walsh," the source behind a bunch of leaks to be in the White House. "</seg>
<seg id="1411">"although Johnson had been banished because of chicanas, or that he has no concrete evidence offered or that he expressed false accusations in the past and to cancel it."</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and began to ask employees about Walsh.</seg>
<seg id="1413">"Goldmacher added that the former property Stef Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter," tried to implement a system to manage the paperwork and document the Trump. "</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">"Kelly tries to do it three months later, the same thing."</seg>
<seg id="1416">"maybe he will prove to be more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his consultants are still looking for influence."</seg>

<seg id="1480">In the Russia affair of US-President Donald Trump was intended to have a so-called Grand Jury for a report by Robert Mueller.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"the committee in the past few weeks have recorded the work, wrote the" Wall Street Journal "under appeal on with the matter familiar persons."</seg>
<seg id="1482">"the paper value the step as a sign that mueller have extended its profitability, and intensified."</seg>
<seg id="1483">The sender of CNN reported that there are already first pre-invitations of the greens associated with a meeting between Trumps of the oldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">"U.S. intelligence services shields the Kremlin since long-term, targeted in the presidential election of 2016."</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller studied whether there were there between Trumps electoral campaign and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"in the focus of the proceeds, several men are to stand in the election campaign as a consultant of the Republican."</seg>
<seg id="1487">"according to, Mueller took more and more Trumps private and business environment under the microscope."</seg>
<seg id="1488">"the" Washington Post "wrote a few weeks ago that the special representative Trump wrote personally to the center and reforestry, whether the president may have disabled the judiciary in the course of the affair."</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand juries is to consider present evidence of possible interruptions and determine whether indictment is to be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand juries are therefore also called Prosecution.</seg>
<seg id="1491">Mostly they are switched when it comes to larger and counter cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure has always been closed behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The panel can also be switched on from the Prosecutor's office to advance individuals under Eid.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"according to the CNN sender, pre-invitations were already issued to the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer."</seg>
<seg id="1495">Individuals who were involved in the meeting were asked to be given to a statement it was in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">"moreover, they should provide documents."</seg>
<seg id="1497">Beside Trump Jr. also Trumps counsellor and son-in-law Jared Kushner as well as his former Secretary-chief Paul Manafort led to the interview.</seg>
<seg id="1498">"legal experts said on Thursday night in the U.S. television, that the enforcement show that mueller's not shy away in his work and that he should be necessary to act quickly."</seg>
<seg id="1499">"however, it should not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on to the end of an indictment."</seg>
<seg id="1500">"nevertheless, the enforcement of the body is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason to concern Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1501">"in the middle of the new revelations, the President on Thursday evening took a speech in West Virginia, in order to present Russia's affair as a campaign to its political opponents."</seg>
<seg id="1502">"Russia's history is a total invention," said Trump. "</seg>
<seg id="1503">"the subject give the Democrats an opportunity to feel good, because they have nothing else to talk about which they can talk."</seg>

<seg id="1505">"but this work also usually in secret, stressed."</seg>
<seg id="1506">The White House feared any measures that will accelerated the work of special concern on "fair" mode.</seg>
<seg id="1507">The former FBI-boss James Comey have said three times that not may be determined against the President.</seg>
<seg id="1508">"I have no reason to accept that something has changed, it was in the explanation."</seg>
<seg id="1509">Mueller was only used after Trump Comey had been filmed.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"because of this resignage, accusations had become loud against Trump, he taught the judiciary."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"Comey said in June before a mustard committee, Trump asked him to ask a setting of issuers against the then national security adviser Michael Flynn."</seg>
<seg id="1512">The President stands for the investigation of great pressure.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"according to the representation of U.S. media, the White House Material Collected the White House and its employees."</seg>
<seg id="1514">The deleting speculation about whether Trump Mueller wants to release mueller.</seg>
<seg id="1515">"unlike an independent special representative of the Congress, such as in the Watergate affair, the later president Richard Nixon, Mueller gave a position in which it could theoretically folded on the urging of the President of the judicial Ministry."</seg>

<seg id="1521">"over a Billion tons of heavy and 5800 square-kilometre large piston tinge now to the north and will probably be two, three years until he melted."</seg>
<seg id="1522">It is registered with 175 kilometers of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers one of the largest ice creams to have registered the researchers over the past three decades.</seg>
<seg id="1523">There is no danger to people from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">"however, climate change has played a role in the quarry of the Iceberg, is still unclear."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"however, there has been a series of unusual breakdowns of railroads in the region, writes the U.S. research centre for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a fact pit."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"according to many researchers, this could be related to the heating up."</seg>
<seg id="1527">The Dbroken piston has so far been a part of the Larsen-C cheeses.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Cheek floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelsolos lies south of South America almost at the top of the antarktischen peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this Scheldeed was the balance of waxing and wrestbreaking some years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A complete cheek may have gone there, writes AWI-researcher Daniela Jansen. "</seg>
<seg id="1533">"I'm talking about that also the Larsen-C-Schelsolemn's danger, because the dere edge have never moved so far as currently."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"moreover, the ice-plate is under voltage and could disintegrate, if on a key point is a piece of drinking."</seg>
<seg id="1535">"the melting of Schelcowards and iceberg does not increase the sea level, because they swim in water and ice so much water as it turns after the melting itself."</seg>
<seg id="1536">"however, the loss of the Scheldeed causes the glaciers to flow directly into the sea as well as much faster than before."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"this could possibly increase the sea level, but only in the least, the British research project on the observation of the Antarctic (Midas)."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Larsen-C-Shelemn is according to AWI information with almost 50 000 square kilometres and the fourth largest cheeses of the Antarctica.</seg>
<seg id="1539">"at the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean around 200 meters."</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks down regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although there is a natural thing and no direct connection is aware of climate change, the Icefall comes into a dangerous position," "said Martin O'Learn from the British Swansea University."</seg>
<seg id="1542">"this is the most extensive retreat since the beginning of the record," he confirmed. "</seg>
<seg id="1543">"under scientists would be controversial, whether the Larsen-C cheers will again grow back or back on the long term, and possibly collapsed, his colleague Adrian Luckman and added:" our models say that it will be less stable. "</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take several decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"even if this researchers did not lead to change this giant iceberg of climate change, so in the past few decades there are many iceberg of the antarktischen peninsula."</seg>

<seg id="1811">"but at that day, in the shadow of her own tragedy, they came together to talk about security."</seg>
<seg id="1812">"it was told them, that it is important to change its routines."</seg>
<seg id="1813">"two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels safe: they are to take their children with the office, which were the target of a attack with granules or they leave at home."</seg>
<seg id="1814">"security experts have written three words on a table on the front of the room: opponents, Neutral, allies."</seg>
<seg id="1815">"they ask the reporter, names for each column - no proof is necessary, perceptions and abdominal cavity."</seg>
<seg id="1816">"there are drug adowers, politicians, businessmen, journalists, who are suspected of standing on the hearing-list of the government or the cartels, which make the chaos of Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"there is no glory of violence, and throughout the country the corpses, there are more and more journalists: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto have been going to office in December 2012. 589 are facing attacks and threats under federal states and up to now there was at least seven dead in seven countries."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"among the latter, her editors and her inspirator of Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the greatest failures to live in Mexico and journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="1820">"its absence will be deeply felt, although its presence is present everywhere - a big picture of Valdez, which shows its mid-finger with the word" Justice "," depends on the facade of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, carry T-shirts that will be smiles face with glasses or its typical Panamahut. "</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters are discussing about their shared themes, trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although 2010 a probes of the Federal Office was established in order to edit the cases of journalists, this according to the Committee aimed at the protection of journalists only two criminal proceedings."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with the majority of thousands of morden, who are linked each year with drug trade and organised crime, the murderer of journalists will only rarely put on trial."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"at Riodoce, they still exist to treat the violence of Sinaloa, though they are ignorant and although the terrain is now even more traitor."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without information on the murderer, without justice, the meeting for discussion of security is little benefit, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very dumm to wasting my time in this workshop," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we do not know the Why, we do all."</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of 15 May Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the state capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - that was translated with" Twelfth river. ""</seg>
<seg id="1830">The Sagittarius went away in his car and damaged it near.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adults.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly into Culiacan freely.</seg>
<seg id="1834">"but on Valdez, there are virtually nothing but silence."</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzmans arrest in the past year and delivery in the United States in January, Sinaloa became one of the bloodiest battles of the country, since rivaling groups struggle to fill in the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it makes nothing that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot on the road or that the cemetery is full of distorted, two-storey Mausoleums for drug adlines that are larger than many houses for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">"forget for a minute, that there is a state of" peace "when just a cartel control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs of commercial routes in the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1838">"nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, with the guilt that he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"first, in February the release of an interview with Rako Lopez, a leader of one of the rivaling cartels in the war with Guzmans sons."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this publication may have hired the sons, presumed gangster also bought every copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to timeframe."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second fault was to force Valdez, after the confiscation of another newspaper, which had the same story to leave the country to his own safety."</seg>
<seg id="1843">"Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived that his friends and colleagues annimitate that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He was in 2003 as an experienced reporter for Noroeste when he joined together with five colleagues for the founding of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa," it was impossible to operate journalism without having to encounter on the roughness problem, "said Bojorquez."</seg>
<seg id="1847">"with time, the newspaper earned a reputation because of the courageous and honest coverage, and the sales and advertising revenues."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporter loved it to publish hard drives investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read, which no one else would deal with."</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the establishment of Riodoce she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot-Prize" for their coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the protection of journalists for his courage in pursuit of Mexican drugs, wherever it was carried."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave himself up voluntarily that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I would like to continue", "he said at the time of the CPJ."</seg>
<seg id="1853">"drug in Sinaloa" is a way of life, "he said in an interview with Rompeviento-TV."</seg>
<seg id="1854">You must take the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb.</seg>
<seg id="1855">"I would not want to be asked:" "what did you do in the face of so many dead... why did you not say what was going on?"</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the Riodoce-team mixed Valdez, the Spaak bird, who was able to escape the friend, the friend, the generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive."</seg>
<seg id="1857">You trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always carry out his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always go to El Guayabo, the bar across from the office, and sitting there always at the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">"now, ask: was his love for the routine to be the routine?"</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also has forced them to ask their own assumptions about how they can do their work best and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like it if you are dealing with their wives, her children, her clean shops, her secretly Start- and runways to move drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even in the best times, a high level of self-bearing and self-preservation."</seg>
<seg id="1865">His own instinct trust.</seg>
<seg id="1866">"if it smells wrong, abouts away."</seg>
<seg id="1867">"the trouble is, said the publisher of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal, that" smell is a sense that can be duped... and then the thing is happening with Javier. "</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the old rules, as he and others say, are no longer considered in Sinaloa, no longer - just as in Tamaulippas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a poisonous blend of lucrative smuges, weak institutions and corrupt government offices."</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is changing constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">"in the room where the staff from Riodoce met, there were suddenly no mobile phones allowed. days before was known that Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, for monitoring journalists and activists in Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside were looking for two policemen protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a mid-class district of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">"half in the joke, some of the reporter asked whether this officers belong to the 50 percent of policemen who were the governor themselves as not trustworthy."</seg>
<seg id="1874">"it is months ago since the reporters have gone into the mountain landscape, where the drug lies de facto under control."</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week Riodoce has bent on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the former known boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé into the state of state that concentrated on the hometown of the governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">"and there was a group that resulted in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block away from the office of the Public Prosecutor, a kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1879">"there was no official word about who has been kidnapped or how it happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favourite local of drug dealers and authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1880">"a reporter repented from public records, that the restaurant was registered under the name of a policy, which was ruled by the governing Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), who conquered almost the entire century all political planes."</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently several PRI governors were accused of high-calibre cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">"Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this local, including one in which a son of" El Chapo "Guzman became a military attack."</seg>
<seg id="1883">"only a few months earlier, readers would have seen the column of Valdez, as the best informed source about the abduction."</seg>
<seg id="1884">"earlier we had already knew what happened," "said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname" "El FLACO" because of its slim physique. "</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">"the office of Valdez has become a storage room for signs and stickers that protest against the Morde of journalists, because the employees have become something that they themselves never expected, activists in the name of the press."</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporalist Miriam Ramirez snap a few signs and went on the next morning to a demonstration on a demonstration on the office of the Prosecutor's office.</seg>
<seg id="1888">"Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed, in the western federal state of Michoacan."</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is his.</seg>
<seg id="1890">"throughout the country journalists have become more broadcasted, as they have written in organised protests" SOS Press "on hearing and construction."</seg>
<seg id="1891">"on this day, the director of Bojorquez in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez."</seg>
<seg id="1892">"at a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa, a day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez, the authorities to show journalists and bring them to leave them because they have said the truth."</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has since then asked that she is once more informed of the government since it is worried that their anger has violated their objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">"Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico from organised crime, involved in government officials and a valid society." ""</seg>
<seg id="1895">"in his last book" Narco Journalism, "he wrote that reporters will not only be killed by drug makers, but also on the command of politicians and security forces who are organised with organised crime under a ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="1896">"the" Articulo 19 "has more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials last year.</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico, you think, because they want you to keep the mouth," "said Ramirez."</seg>
<seg id="1898">"obviously, the morde have a horrible effect."</seg>
<seg id="1899">Nobody forgetting the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state Tamaulipas before six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">"your body was found together with a note that was supposed to be signed by the Zetas Kartell," Here I am because of my reports. "</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer-keys and headset were in addition to its separated head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Some stores have chosen as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state Chihuahua after the assassination of the correspondents Miroslava Breach in March.</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others continue on how it did El Manana of Nuevo Laredo after the assassination of their director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">"in 2010 Diario de Ciudad Juarez was publicly addressed to the drug card with an editorial meeting on the title page with the title" "What do you want from us?"</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists are drawn from their home states or even from the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">"it is hard to find work in exile, and they are still watching the streets and looking for dangers."</seg>
<seg id="1908">"and sometimes they are jagt, as it appeared to the photographer Ruben Espinosa, which was killed in 2015 with four women in an apartment in Mexico-City three months after the flight from Veracruz."</seg>
<seg id="1909">"for those who continue to stay and continue the work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1910">"Ibarra, who once wanted to be poet, gives it to be startled him."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"Mexico will go to hell, and that is why I was reporters," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="1912">"at midnight last Friday, when the last issue was already finished, the editors of Riodoce on the sidewalk in front of the office and drank beer, when all their phones started to reach."</seg>
<seg id="1913">A series of skewers with Bandenrials and guards in the vicinity of the town Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed left.</seg>
<seg id="1914">The war continued on how it was promised by a number of Kartell's messages in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1915">From the Bordsteinkante they released the news on the website of Riodoce about mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The cover page had to be changed the next day.</seg>
<seg id="1917">Sirenen heed nearby - another shooting in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1918">"Bojorquez have a look at the policeman, the guard, to see if they were in willingness."</seg>
<seg id="1919">If they were afraid they showed it not.</seg>
<seg id="1920">"under the tremendous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, its mid-finger was visible for quite Sinaloa, followed the staff of Riodoce his tracks."</seg>
<seg id="1921">"how can you only think about it," said Bojorquez, "" said Bojorquez, "if the same day was assassinated, the internship was asked to send them to the road to the road."</seg>
<seg id="1922">Dinosaurs use camouflage to dodge his enemies</seg>
<seg id="1923">At first glance it looks like a statue if there is a terrifying.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"now researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible Nashorn of a Canadian mountain workers were so well received, that experts are described as" "Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">"it was so well preserved, that they even knew that his shoe skin was of reddish-brown - and they said they would have had something of a" "unquiet past." ""</seg>
<seg id="1926">"the report in the magazine" Current Biology, "called it as" the best-preserved dinosaurs, who ever was found, and one of the best dinosaurs specimens of the world. "</seg>
<seg id="1927">The fossil is a newly discovered type of Nodosaurs that lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1928">Its incredibly well preserved state has researchers who describe it as "really remarkable."</seg>
<seg id="1929">"according to reports in National Geographic, the paired plant is the best preserved fossils of its kind."</seg>
<seg id="1930">"it was found by Shawn Funk when he was born on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1931">"he met something that was missing from the surrounding rocks at the board, and decided to go more accurately."</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years to cover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1.100 kg) heavy groundbreaking.</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all this hard work the finished result is now ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you are just a bit stupid with the eyes, you could almost believe that it has slept," "said the principal author of Caleb Brown, scientists in the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature has to be seen."</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will go into the science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs specimens, the Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers have found that this plant is also covered with armor, although it resembles with a armor and a changing tank, probably by meat carnivorous dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the strong dinosaur dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technology, which is used as a counterfix, which is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this could have allowed themselves to mix better in its surroundings and to equip its enemies, say experts, which is suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the family of the Nodosaurs made the first time in May and is now to be seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers have now studied the wild animal and it is called Borealopelta markerchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours so that it has been carefully covering it."</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing preservation of the specimen made it possible to document Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the patterns and form of scales and armour over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered the conshaded, a common defence of defence in the animal-rich, which means that the tip of the creature darker was regarded as their underside."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the counter-shady usually is common, the results are surprising because the size of Borealopelta is by far the living animals living."</seg>
<seg id="1945">"it suggests that the dinosaurs has had enough pressure on meat fresvorous dinosaurs, the evolution deteriorate the deterioration of the confrontation as a means of survival."</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most contemporary animals that use the counter shady - think of deer, zebras or girdle - are much smaller and hurting than loot, which signaled that this Nodosaurs was exposed to a real battle for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong carnivore behaviour on a massive, strong gepened dinosaurs, how dangerous the dinosaurs-carnivores of the Cretaceous must have been" said Brown. "</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic connections in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur is reddish.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists continue to examine the animal in references about his life, including its contemplated Darminhaltes to find out what it has eaten as its last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaurs, when he died, went out into a river and driven out into the sea, where he fell on the back to the sea."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at that time Alberta was so warm as southern today, and rivers and oceans probably far more widespread than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurs is really remarkable, because it is completely covered with preservated skin, but also in three dimensions and the original form of the animal retains" said Brown. "</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that the animal is almost exactly the same as in the early chalk period.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you do not need much imagination to use to rebuild it. if you only have a little to play with the eyes, you could almost believe that he is at sleep."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the chalk times was a time, as giant spopods, carnivorous dinosaurs, who stood on two legs to pass on Earth."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the king of them, Tyrannosaurus Rex, millions of years after Borealopelta lived, the tortured Dinosaurs was jagt by some of his furious ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"this belongs to the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 feet (11.5 m) long, six tons heavier monsters."</seg>
<seg id="1958">"scientists, whose latest findings in the journal Current Biology appear, believe that Borealopelta was slim after the death in the sea and the mud."</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he was born on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum it is the best-preserved dinosaurs of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely surrounded by muzzle up to the hip."</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were at average approximately 18 feet (5 meters) and have up to 3.000 pounds (1.300 kg) weighed.</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch-long tips that raged by his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">"the researchers believe that the geological plant was curved through the Western Canada, until a flooded river is flooded into the open sea."</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater funeral of the dinosaur his armor in exquisite way Show detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">"the hidden remnants of this special specimen are so well preserved, that the doorstep is still bumpy and chewards along the dinosaur."</seg>
<seg id="1966">"as Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of preservation is as' rare as a win in the lotto."</seg>
<seg id="1967">"the more I approach it, the more confusing it becomes."</seg>
<seg id="1968">"petrified leavens of the skin still cover the hollow tank, which carry the skull of the beast."</seg>

<seg id="2034">"this is not common," Ferrell reminded her statement. "</seg>
<seg id="2035">"this is not the kind of murder, which we are accustomed to and which we can call typical."</seg>
<seg id="2036">In that moment I felt thrilling.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept.</seg>
<seg id="2038">They booked a return trip and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After the landing at 23 o'clock they took her 6 year old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two would drive the next morning to Ferguson.</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, the topic of a new documentary film," Whose Streets? "in the cinemas from the 11."</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a story of survival and Protestant, love and loss of loss, the strength and resistance of the people who are living in the community and have filled the streets to challenge the answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"as Ferrell with her daughter who was a flower dress, and a suitable crown carried to Ferguson, praised the two a conversation that they had innumerable many times before this morning" about the black experience and the black state. "</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you do not remember how I have taught you when black people must fight for this, what they believe?" she remembered what she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2044">"now we go to Ferguson, because the police have killed a 18-year-old boy and that was not right."</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I could not take her," "said Ferrell later."</seg>
<seg id="2046">What happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">It must know it and see it and raised it in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it has to be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also the different layers of the black experience and the black Constitution and what we need to do is free to free ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even though I have luck to give her an experience, in which they personally does not experience any eatant racism, it is not different from the next black women's child."</seg>
<seg id="2050">"I have the feeling, I would prove her a bad service to keep them far away."</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first stop when they arrived in Ferguson, the South Florissant Road, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authorities called activists, on the possible non-accusation of Officer Darren Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="2052">"there, Ferrell and her daughter joined together with a local business owner who made lunch."</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags in front of and halves they pass on protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly began to accept a new kind of activism for Ferrell shape.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism has changed after the 9th of August," she said and noted that she was student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and concentrated on food justice and health inequalities in black communities. "</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It is all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">"weeks later, Ferrell met during an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-director of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"Folayan said, she and her comrades Lucas Alvarado-Farrar only wanted to document" document "what happened."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"a question came from Ferrell in the sense:" "do you want to document, or try to find a story that you can take advantage of it?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">"this scepticism was nourished through countless cases of people, often of whites - in a community that profited from their pain and their resilience."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"as Folayan recently declared in an interview," We heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson, and we did not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently. "</seg>
<seg id="2063">"Folayan already worked together with the former co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the field, which is known for his activism around Todestrakt."</seg>
<seg id="2064">His involvement brought Ferrell the project closer together with six other locals followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Browns Ershoot.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talking to us. we talk," said Davis. "</seg>
<seg id="2066">"that was the main thing for me, as these people are represented, for so I will be represented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the goal was not to focus on Ferrells experience - to show that there is a community that comes together," "said Folayan - she turned out to be the most obvious part of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2068">"consequently, documents of" Whose Streets? "surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrells's life, how she loves herself and her wife marries."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," "said Ferrell, and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2070">"but I understood that there must be a certain vulnerability at this work and the understanding of the black people."</seg>
<seg id="2071">"in addition, Ferrells has repeated history the role of the black gay women in the broader Black-Lives movement."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of the movement, which after the killing of the black teenager Trayby Martin in 2012 marked the film" "BlacklivesMatter" "in social media, identify themselves as swul."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership-positions have borne the movement altogether," "said Ferrell," and therefore we are constantly fighting on various fronts. "</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, gay women must carry the main load of everything."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"Folayan agreed to notice that" the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women. "</seg>
<seg id="2076">"however, it exists that" "this is not a affirmativer type of action" "was chosen by the Ferrell due to their identity as the heart of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who wrecked this energy," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is not a coincidence, although it was at the front front, because with a life at these crossings as a black, gay woman is so much on the game."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can sense their energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">"meanwhile, the Newscameras are long gone from Ferguson long ago, but the racial links between the church and the police continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is based on nutrition for 2 ½ years because of the blocking a highway on a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the sociopolitical atmosphere of the area that she calls her home: "a mess."</seg>
<seg id="2083">"nevertheless, she clinging to a song and she feels obliged to this mind since then she went to Ferguson on the road three years ago."</seg>

<seg id="2089">The bit gallery is moving the people although it is not yet built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a mall at the south end of the pedestrian street divides since the first presentation of 2009 the population in supporters and opponents.</seg>
<seg id="2091">Cold makes the subject hardly any one.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Also on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg" is discussed the subject.</seg>
<seg id="2093">"say the one to the bit gallery:" "that would be a dream" "(Anja Becker) or" "This would be real" "(Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side:" "don't need a person" (Siggi Betzen) or simply "" megalomania "" (Lars Scholz). "</seg>
<seg id="2094">"while the supporters argued that a gallery will bring more customers to the city, of which the other businesses will benefit, the opponents fear that then the pedestrian street is bleeds."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"in addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the property on which the market hall is planned, in the 13 directors marketed its products."</seg>
<seg id="2096">With the beginning of the construction work will be the conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The gallery-makers want to integrate a market hall in the new construction - and for a place where there is a place to sit outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">"Simone Rooms:" "we have been able to buy almost every week in the farmers market for many years."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"mostly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of landfill is again very happy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Also the butchers shop we have discovered for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">"we would like to wish that even during and above all, after the construction of the gallery a chance to maintain this offer."</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities there is also.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">"Gerd Densing:" "whether the direct market marketed in a market hall in the gallery, comes at the height of the rent."</seg>

<seg id="2106">"" "Eva Kilic" ":" "shopping" "in Bitburg?"</seg>
<seg id="2107">"whether clothing, shoes, threat or supermarkets: I find that superfluous."</seg>
<seg id="2108">There is already enough in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">You can see how many stores are empty here - some have been here for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">"but since there is not even a neat weekly market, it is all the more important that at least you get the market hall."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"after all, the goods offered there is fresh, mostly offered directly from the producer and is obsolete."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"as you see, shop stores in a mall is only rented by larger companies because the dorm Miets are often not viable for a retailer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"too bad, there is almost no more and what still exists, will probably also disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a mall with a Markthalle fit for me not together.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Above all: where should the farmers market all during the construction time?</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the old Edeka would be the solution - even on the duration, when the bit gallery is actually coming."</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or creates it the ghost bit gallery already to expel all business from Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "it will simply not work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"and a shopping center, which is empty, nobody needs no one."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"in my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">But for a farmer hall it is thanks to the creamy many - as I find - meaningless construction projects in Bitburg is no place anymore.</seg>
<seg id="2123">"when the farmers market is broken, a piece of culture will disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2124">A suitable similarity: artist creates portrait with Chelsea Mannings DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">"in the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York are many faces to see - white, black and brown that are almost incomparable - those on cables are hanging from the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits have been created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfern and Haarlem that were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"Manning sent the excerpts from the prison of Fort Leavenworth, where the former Secret analysis analysed a 35-year prison sentence, after they made public as a secret of diplomatic announcements about the site WikiLeaks."</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the new exhibition, which was opened on 2 August, is called A Becoming a blance (A matching similarity)."</seg>
<seg id="2129">"it is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline became their expertise in technology, computer sciences and art, and Manning, a transwife and pioneering dissidentine, whose condemnation was transformed by Barack Obama as he had only three days in his office."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"Dewey-Hagborg has been extracted by the algorithmic analysis of the DNA, which was extracted by Manning and created from the 30 portraits, a sharp, although some intellectual comment may not just be interpreted as they may be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also to identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has already been openly condemned over the identification as a woman in 2013, was sentenced in 2013 for 20 accusations, among them six violations against the espionegesetz, computer was and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"through the prison, her image was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a granular, black-white Selfie in which Manning is clearly sitting on a driver's seat and a platinum-blonde barbecues - with which it was associated with her."</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey Hagborg came just about the great success of her 2012-project 'Stranger Visions.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in this, the artist portraits of strangers made from forensic artifacts such as Cigettenstmel and Kaugum, extracted the DNA from the waste in order to make a picture of how these people might look."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"this was the time, in which it received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine."</seg>
<seg id="2136">"she led an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and she wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey Hagborg at a press show of the new exhibition. "</seg>
<seg id="2137">"and she was not visited at that time and she could not take photographed, so you did contact Chelsea, and asked them if they wanted to make a DNA portrait."</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and their detainees have been reacted to the same brighten over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">"they even created one of Shoili Kanungo illustrated Comic" Suppressed Images, "who saw a future prior to the President Chelseas verdict and would be able to see the exhibition personally."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published, Mannings would call for seven brutal years in a military coup in Kansas, was a welcome kind of happier meeting."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"there is also now at the opening of the exhibition somewhat deeper and Starkes, since Donald Trump leads to war against informants from the government and against transgender forces to find new, tweetable ways to fix the rigid splits that he should actually fix."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"as a dewey Hagborg after the strange timing of all these things was asked, she said that" things happen from a certain reason. "</seg>
<seg id="2143">"in one on the wall of the gallery, the artistic statement called Manning with its superlarge subtitle (the" i "in their surname is provided with a heart) an end to the" automatic fragmentation, based on gender, race, sexuality, and culture. "</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall its mitochondrial DNA sequence is written by Cs and Gs and As in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">"dewey-Hagborg was hoping to show the inclusion of 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the highly developed scientific Lexicon of the artist), such as surprisingly similar, at least in biodynamic terms we are all."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people hopefully bring about it is that our genome is not about who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," "said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works of 2007, Spare Memories, too."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell as many different stories, so that 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition which is kept in an own space is a page from the above Comic-Novelle.</seg>
<seg id="2149">It shows Manning as they appear with a freezing shefon in the hand out of disciplining in the United States as King-Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"if they ask your speech, then they won," says it. "</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so just never the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came directly from a letter they wrote to me," said the artist, who salute from Philadelphia. "</seg>
<seg id="2153">I still get goosebumps when I speak about it.</seg>
<seg id="2154">"Manning has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was preeminent in the comic book - but if they should do it, then it will be greeted in the middle of the room by their own genomic simulation, which meet as hordes of protesters."</seg>
<seg id="2155">"it was also focused on how all in the exhibition, up to the size (5" 2, Mannings Stature), in which their genetic Haploos was written with pencil. "</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted to feel like a crowd," "said Dewey Hagborg from the portraits."</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted to feel like a mass movement that was formed with Chelsea, like the movement, which was also behind its liberation."</seg>

<seg id="2291">In his younger past the small Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze-music video and was an end for Margaret Thatcher in 1970-he and 1980-1980.</seg>
<seg id="2292">"but Scotney has experienced 700 years turbulent history of his cozy seat in the Mal River Valley in Kent and is now for inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaired Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents."</seg>
<seg id="2293">"I find it so beautiful to look at the manuscript of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says falsely. "</seg>
<seg id="2294">What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand.</seg>
<seg id="2295">"a Castle in England 'spans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documented the families who lived in Scotney. each story was illustrated by another, emerging British artist - Isaac Handley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg."</seg>
<seg id="2296">"it is not the first book of Rhodes, based on an archive: he wrote in 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he unexpectedly found."</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I only reacted on the thumb pressure on the side of a letter, which was written by a doubles in the 1700's-years, who worked for the Jacobins," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2298">"this is his thumb.</seg>
<seg id="2299">"and I still smell to smoke, because back then one had a fire because of the light."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"for someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect, as if he himself did."</seg>
<seg id="2301">"Oh, I love Archive!"</seg>
<seg id="2302">"for someone who is beaten to be so with old papers, that he has been supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council (" To be honest: I have changed my welcome), all this seems to be true. "</seg>
<seg id="2303">"Rhodes spent his days to explore the Victorian" "new" "castle, to study the archives and the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the moned hyena heads in the walls and the bottles, the centuries had spent in the ditch."</seg>
<seg id="2304">"he emigrated by the grounds and ruins of the old castle, and spoke with Landscissors, gardening and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book."</seg>
<seg id="2305">Then at night he drank "whiskey and started writing."</seg>
<seg id="2306">"the intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown, as the National Trust was first received the full access to 2006 as the last Erbin, Elizabeth Hussey."</seg>
<seg id="2307">"when Rhodes was a decade later, the employee started to take care of the archive, which he said as" hundreds of years, in which Aristocrates said "Oh, throw it on the attic."</seg>
<seg id="2308">"slideshows, letters from the time of the English Empires, cards that represent who what said:" one could mean that Landconfluous would be boring "," says Rhodes, "but there was a pear to have fought the two families."</seg>
<seg id="2309">"guys, let everything go down!"</seg>
<seg id="2310">"some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to check out a broader basis in the English history, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who built the newly built castle, in order to join the farm of 1381."</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a record of a turmoil, the 1380 in the castle, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex', says Rhodes."</seg>
<seg id="2312">The peasant revolt began in this area and I thought was a revolt was a good start.</seg>
<seg id="2313">Perhaps the two are connected? "</seg>
<seg id="2314">Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest' that tells the story of the Jesuitment that the family Darrell was seven years while the English Reformation.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"or 'The Smuggler', presented by the smuggler Arthur Darrell from the 18th century, he filled his own burial with stones (a discovery that was only years later than his coffin was excavated)."</seg>
<seg id="2316">"Darrells are Rhodes's favorite family by Scotney:" "the gentlemen are able to be able to make debts and spend money for things that they could not afford."</seg>
<seg id="2317">"other generations of Darrell men proceeds their guilt by making rich old women married - I imagine them as a heap well looked out guys, with a talent to advertise Ernating."</seg>
<seg id="2318">After the end of his use in the castle Rhodes is searching for other unique writer experience</seg>
<seg id="2319">"he has brought a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämänmäki, the terrain of a sanatorium dating back to the early 20th century, which has been reclaimed since then by nature."</seg>

<seg id="2390">"yes, actually."</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robotics in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"according to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we must begin to take their rise seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2394">"customers can choose the eye-color of the robot, its shape of nipple and type of fingers."</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make themselves funny, but the companies deliver a lot of it and we will see them much more frequently," "said Mr. Sharkey on the release of his new report."</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sexpuppets have developed themselves from their inflatable partners with a silicone machine that feels warm to feel warm - with consciously human reactions that are achieved by the artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"the user can adjust its robot according to its beliefs, and select all, from the eye-color of the robot over the form of nipples to the type or the color of his fingernails."</seg>
<seg id="2398">"but it is still distressed, as many robots have the" personalities "who would look progressive to a Stepford's woman."</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sexpuppets have developed to robots with a silicone.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"the RealBotix robots allows for example its users to adapt their robots to the qualities they are appealing, such as shyness."</seg>
<seg id="2401">"and then there is still those from True Companion developed RoxxxGold sex robots with pre-programmed figures such as" Frigid Farrah, "which gives the impression of shyness and" Wild Wendy "with a" adventurous "personality."</seg>

<seg id="2404">She also has her moods in the course of the day - just like real people!</seg>

<seg id="2406">"there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robot - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female characteristics, the backless on rape, when you go a step on Frigid (meaning: contradictory) Farrah, is a very quiet one most."</seg>

<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) have a vibrator, why do men then have no Roxxxies?" it says on the website. "</seg>
<seg id="2409">"however, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another Sexy."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"their emergence and growing sophistication point to something dark and deeper in our culture, to a withdrawal from the Ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as optional addition."</seg>
<seg id="2411">"most men will of course hold any sex robots and while the FRR notice its rising popularity, it still remain preliminary at the edge of the consumer culture."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"but what happens from the boundary zones, may be in relation to the spirit of time, in which we live, very instructive."</seg>
<seg id="2413">"and many people are not strange or insulting, until the free market there is permission."</seg>
<seg id="2414">"there is a certain overlay that these highly developed sex robots have emerged in a time in which the rights of women are threatened worldwide, in which there is a president in the White House, who has been praised to have been sexually attacked."</seg>
<seg id="2415">The abominest aspect of the television series' The handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the handmaid ') are not the graphical images that sleepy bodies and the extinct eyes but how realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap."</seg>
<seg id="2417">The target behind these sex robots is to establish a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (even with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Your builder want them to feel humane that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"but, brought to the point when it comes to their" personalities "the robots represent no real women."</seg>

<seg id="2432">"with Trump in the White House everyone who knows it, including the Republican relationship, with whom she fought for decades because of politics, suddenly and quite peculiar on the same side."</seg>
<seg id="2433">"in order to eat the dining table this is certainly a good thing, but it falls me in a further context that this brings about significant risks."</seg>
<seg id="2434">"the left hand was strengthened by Trump, but the resulting effect of his presidency has power to push all of us to right."</seg>
<seg id="2435">"if we speak of" normalisation "and Trump, we refer to the grassy possibility that his friends of one day will no longer be off."</seg>

<seg id="2437">"I find myself today from an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's comic version of the madman, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax statement looked) - both compared to Trump in fact, a very mild crime."</seg>

<seg id="2579">"rotten meat, dairy products and chocolate could help to alleviate IBD (inflammatory bowels)."</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestion as a nightmare.</seg>

<seg id="2582">"the incurable condition which concerns about 1.3 million in the US around 1.3 million and in the UK 300.000, causing magnitude steaming and bloating, recurring or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme tiredness."</seg>
<seg id="2583">"during those affected normally, meat and dairy products are to avoid their symptoms, researchers found at the Washingtoner University, researchers found the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins to develop immune cells which promote a tolerant intestines."</seg>
<seg id="2584">"the leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, stated that immunitis in the intestines patrol, to ensure that harmful microbes were hiding in the food not in the body."</seg>
<seg id="2585">"cells, the capable of infection, inflammation, are balanced from cells to promote tolerance and protect the body without compensate for sensitive tissues."</seg>
<seg id="2586">"if the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation, it can result in an inflammation."</seg>
<seg id="2587">"in experiments, it was found that a kind of tolerance of immune-promoting immunity on mice occurs which carry a certain bacterium in their intestines."</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires Tryptophan - one of the blocks of proteins - to dissolve the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"Professor Colonna said:" "we have a connection between a bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestine microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that foster tolerance."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more tryptophan had the mice in their food, the more they had from these immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"he suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and an on tryptophan rich diet tolerated, less anti-inflammatory bowling, if the same system is swiring at humans."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"presented in Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan undersearched a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found out that a group of study comers had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, but that was not accommodated."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"it suspected that the difference with the intestinal microbious of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that usually live in the gastrointestinal tract."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"the intestines of the mice were found DNA-sequenced and there were six species species found in mice with the immune cells, but without them out of mice."</seg>
<seg id="2595">"mice were raised in an sterilous environment so that they did not lacked the intestinal microbiome, and they did not developed this kind of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2596">"to understand how the bacteria count on the immune system, the researchers settled L. reuteri in a fluid and then led small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on an inripe immune cells which were isolated from mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed to the tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"as the active component of the liquid was cleaned, it proved to be a by-product of the tryptophan metabolic ism that is known as an indol-3 actic acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"when the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of the mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but if the tryptophanic values were halted, sank the number of cells around half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan declared that people have the same tolerating cells such as mice and that most of us L. reuteri protect our stomach-intestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether tryptophan-side products from L. reuteri the cells in humans develop such as mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel."</seg>
<seg id="2602">"she said:" "the development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, as these cells are inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine."</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high tryptophanvalues in the presence of L. reuteri lead to a expansion of these populations.</seg>

<seg id="2729">The event "Made in America" was designated by the White House as an official event and would not be covered by the Hatch Act.</seg>

<seg id="2731">"at the event, the president gave an impetus to reform of health reform that was underway in the Senate, and he propagated the efforts on intrusion of government regulations."</seg>

<seg id="2895">"however, the author of Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and a member of the national Italian bioethic Committee, as the author of Lucetta Scaraffia, historians and member of the national Italian bioethic Committee."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit to call the Catholic Church as a source of all evil, is already part of the day-day experience, and prepare public opinion to keep it for normal," writes Scaraffia. "</seg>
<seg id="2897">"also Fürstenin Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said in an interview with the Bavarian Rundfunk:" one likes to go on the church and this is a filmed thread. "</seg>
<seg id="2898">"and she pointed out that in her youth" saw a very normal educational means "" to be with friends, as I was one, ready to be finished. "</seg>
<seg id="2899">"it is unfair to address the standards to previous decades, because the world has changed."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"in connection with reports on the abuse, often the Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"completely unright, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who recorded with Ratzinger's memorband" "My brother of the Pope" "(in 12 languages)."</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I must take Georg Ratzinger in protecting," says Heshemann, "For all this had nothing to do with him," he analyses the results of the final. "</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report which has been submitted by the diocese of Regensburg with the Enlightenment attorney Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were born in between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s, with high Plausibility" victims of overprint, 67 Domspatzen sexually abused. "</seg>
<seg id="2905">"in the final report, it was said to Georg Ratzinger, who was active from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg," "summarizing that by Domkapellmeister R. used in many cases of physical and mental violence."</seg>
<seg id="2906">"especially at high emotionality, the punishment for pupils could also be violated."</seg>
<seg id="2907">"nevertheless, in contrast to numerous other contemplation that many victims are estimated general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases, despite violence even positive memories with him."</seg>
<seg id="2908">"in the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report about the abductions of the abductions for the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger his opinion is discharged."</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Hesemann, the 440-pages report on the "incidents of violence against" "Regensburger Domspatzen" "gives a contradictory image of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2910">"for a raise, many students emerge his" "humanity." ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">"on the other hand, he also appears as a cholera and perfectionist who became more tangible, when a domain was musically no top performance."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate as its biograph of this dissertation?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"Michael Hesemann: if one makes the effort and read throughout the 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself rather, why the name Georg Ratzinger only takes place in it."</seg>
<seg id="2914">"he has just been dedicated to eight sites, and he is clearly acquitted from every suspicion of the Mediator or fellow-soldiers in the terrible cases of sexual abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2915">"" "nonviolence at the pre-school occurred in outside of its sphere."</seg>
<seg id="2916">It is possible to take him at all too late or not take the first accusations taken seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the Domspatzengouw school, on which he was effective, was perceived by virtually any respondents than -" "salvation," "heaven" "and" "better world." ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"thus the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger presents a very excellent testimony," "popular", "" "sincere", "" "competent", "" "competently," "competently," "competently," "knowledgeable", "" "skilled", "and" "understanding," "and" always accompanied by grapes of children. "</seg>
<seg id="2919">"only a minority invaded themselves about its perfectionism and its high emotionality, which also led to weaves too."</seg>
<seg id="2920">"that he doesn't only cast even with chairs and the keychain, but also earrings, and all too many guys went to the hair or ears, he has already announced itself already years ago, deeply regret and apologized for it."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"however, it must be said that such educators have to be noted in the questionable time, the 1960s and 1970s, were widely used in parents such as teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you still know such breedative methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think everyone of us was born before 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"also I have experienced this in a worldly school, a state Gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared to what it is actually going on in this report, namely the irreplaceable sexual abuse and nonviolence at the preschool, are the most certainly Bagatelles."</seg>
<seg id="2926">"if you ask yourself, whether it is not more likely to do with his familiarity and his role as a brother of Benedikt XVI. to do that many media has just rushed on him."</seg>
<seg id="2927">"the Bavarian Pope are working many, who never understood it, still freezing."</seg>
<seg id="2928">The truth is: the report discharged Georg Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media report a lot about the issue of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger took place in the concluding report as well as any delay or co-force in terms of sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: quite clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">None of the 67 victims of sexual overcomes claims to have become familiar to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I have never dreamed of talking to my father or my mother," "said a subject of statements for the others", "It was all very embarrassing."</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem in the education of sexual abuse has been and yet it is that most victims are not silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they do not even trusted parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir conductor who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen-students Ratzinger's role in terms of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a survey student formed it so: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he had had (Georg Ratzinger) timely findings and could have been able to have the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I consider it... also for really absurd, to imagine that it has been opened to him... bubble and more clear or more likely to be opened, as opposed to their parents, internatators, trustworthy teaching etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks to him about sex... - unthinkable.</seg>
<seg id="2941">"thus the report comes to the very clear result:" "the students involved in the field of interest and / or their surroundings could not be trusted, in the context of the investigation."</seg>
<seg id="2942">"as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is free from any fellow citizens."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"thus, it cannot be thrown out to be prevented or brought him to the display."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore there is no reason to put his good name with these contradictory crimes, as unfortunately it happened in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">In the media was much of "nonviolence" at the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger was thrown in the report.</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that missed everything in the reporting everything was mixed and mixed into a huge melange of sexual abuse and nonviolence and somewhere, right in the middle of Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"however, this is precisely the abuse of the report."</seg>
<seg id="2950">"namely, namely clean: between the preschool and the gymnasium of the domains, between sexual abuse and nonviolence as well as, let's say once any other accusations."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"in addition, the report addressed incidents from the period since 1945, thus also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not a choir conductor of the Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"the whole awful test pedagogy, the cases, in which the boys were downrigated by sadistan teachers and among them were unequivocally suffered, uneventful by the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous states have to prevail."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with whom the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boys only to face when they were already on the Domspatzengouw school."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"on that was, as most witnesses emphasize that the theme" preschool "tabu."</seg>
<seg id="2955">"one was just happy to be to escape, and enjoyed so much better treatment and for many even" "paradise". ""</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different at the Domspatzengouw School?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was a discipline but not a distal force.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, where the report comes to the conclusion that" "many victims are estimated general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases, despite violence even positive memories with him."</seg>
<seg id="2959">"thus, most of the pre-work remains to be turned away."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"but despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods, in which it was reported by the states at the foreschool."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time in 1970 / 71 when he began to establish itself and was not responsible for the events at a school where he did not hear and responsible, (so the witness) had nothing to hear, and then again to 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Deteriorated Georg Ratzinger in front of the states consistently the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Hesemann: no, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the Domspatzengouw Dragon, which was even reproduced."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"he pointed out this point," that in the pre-school he will continue to practise the auditors. "</seg>
<seg id="2965">"in the face of the danger of negative press, he received urgent information."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"of course, this was of course at a time when legal clarity consisted, as auditors was also illegal in Bavaria too."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before, it occurred in a legal grazone, as everyone of us probably knows."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"as it was difficult for him to estimate, where sufferers may have been exaggerated or dramatic, and where really the permissible limit was exceeded."</seg>
<seg id="2969">"but one can also not say, he always would have waided."</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">In 1980 the audited penalty was officially abolished in Bavaria too.</seg>
<seg id="2972">"principally in Gloria of Thurn und Taxis claimed, it is unfair to address the contemporary educational standards to that time."</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Hesemann: we are talking about the" "pitfalls of the achronism", "thus the danger to assess past today's moral standards."</seg>
<seg id="2975">There the princess was right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"of course, of course, this does not apply to sexual abuse, who was abominable to all times and not for what was broken in the preschool of resistance and violence against innocent infants, that goes far beyond that time."</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all completely horrible and I am glad that it is finally reconditioned.</seg>
<seg id="2978">"but at the same time I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protecting, for all that had nothing to do with him."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"his means for disciplining and punishment, so earliest, and to pull on the hair and ears were widespread in the 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"when physical punishment was then banned, he also has strictly adhered to it."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"which image from his Regensburger time Georg Ratzinger took back with you for the book" My brother of the Pope. ""</seg>
<seg id="2982">Came the topic of audited too in the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, therefore Pope Benedictine XVI., tells us from his perspective, as they played the domain of just one side."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, I do not mean by no means that he carried a strict regiment."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"but even this must also be said: without this perfectionism, without the demand of unconditionally discipline, it would probably hardly have been possible to form the national famous Regensburger Domspatzen an institution of Weltrang to form the true culture of Europe and his musical tradition that went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with biscuits and sweets alone one makes a big singer and stand before any success, right in which area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming."</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of man did you experience Georg Ratzinger in interviews with her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Hesemann: through work on the book and beyond that I met Georg Ratzinger really very well, and again seen as a wonderful, humorous, basic, deep stitious and savvy people, from which one could not imagine that he could only do a fly with a fly."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I am regularly rewarded with how many former domed cats still talk to him, 23 years after his Emeritus, regularly contact him to visit him, he is nearly blind - and to deal with him as a member of her family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who don't forgive him up today that he was once strict to them are clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">"today, most domains are thankful to him today that he has enriched their lives and freight the world of music."</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he always was a good, fatherly teacher - a hard father, certainly that may be - but also a remarkable respect to which they still have to look up today and to turn them straight."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, even quite clear: all that one throws to him are educative methods that were then on the order of the day."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have been overcome this time long.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is most unjust, a man, just because he is prominent and one more prominent brother has to make a medial sinner."</seg>
<seg id="2996">"there is the wicked intention, which is behind it, only too obvious."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"for the report, which has just been published, discharged him."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now the accumulation of state would have acquired a 93-year-old man who has acquired great merits and would like to know in Germany without the governors of Bavaria, finally in peace."</seg>
