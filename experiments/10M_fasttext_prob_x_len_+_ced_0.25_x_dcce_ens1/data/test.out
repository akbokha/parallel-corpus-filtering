Jennifer Ani@@ ston : I always put in dra@@ wers
Jennifer Ani@@ ston does not always have to be perfect or successful .
this has clearly made the Hollywood @-@ Star in an interview now un@@ mis@@ understood .
&quot; I will always put in dra@@ wers , or get stuck from outside label , who have little to do with me and reality . &quot;
&quot; I myself do not have the wish , always perfect and successful . &quot;
&quot; frank@@ ly , these things are more snow . &quot;
&quot; Jennifer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh that she is considered &quot; &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; , &quot; as it explains in the current &quot; Cos@@ mopolit@@ an &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the most ad@@ orable , the actress sp@@ ends her time at home , a television with cur@@ ly Dut@@ t and mex@@ ican food , it means in the magazine . &quot;
&quot; to the white , they bring the question of the child &apos;s desire : &quot; &quot; we do not have to be married or children to be perfect &quot; , &quot; says the Hollywood star . &quot;
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - love is not a children &apos;s game &quot; is Ani@@ ston as a all@@ uring mother of two sons .
the film runs with us from August 25 .
Gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the Sport@@ pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
at the end of a golf course in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger sought a bit of variety with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a first .
CHI@@ O : &quot; golden Sport@@ pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
&quot; after a couple of minutes , the horses reminded of their celebrations , they were hunting at the fast Gal@@ op@@ p at home to the feed @-@ ar@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; a mile at this temp@@ o , I have had fear . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger . &quot;
and thus the Reit@@ k@@ arri@@ ere ended up again .
on Saturday the end of Germany was the best gol@@ fer at all time - 101 tournament - back near horses .
&quot; he left himself with his family over the system of AL@@ RV , on a horse he won &apos;t get a photograph . &quot;
&quot; long was the first time in Aachen , and thus at CHI@@ O . &quot;
the reason was quite convincing .
the German Sp@@ orth@@ ilfe overwhel@@ med the man from An@@ hausen within the framework of a small Gala the Golden Sport@@ pyramid .
of awards it does not lack the li@@ ke@@ able athl@@ ete .
&quot; Bundes@@ ver@@ kreu@@ z , Silber@@ nes Lor@@ be@@ er@@ blatt , Champions Tour @-@ Player of the year ... &quot;
even the British Queen has already tort@@ ured .
long is the 18th prize winner of the Sport@@ pyramid .
in Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler .
&quot; this distinction means me a lot , &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; because it is not only granted for sport@@ y achievements , but also for social commitment . &quot;
for decades Lan@@ ger promotes the offspring .
and so he also gave the prize of 25.000 Euros in the same way .
with 15 more outstanding sport@@ smen the W@@ eight@@ fold U.S. Mast@@ ers@@ si@@ eger was recorded on Saturday in the &quot; Hall of Fame of the German Sports . &quot;
&quot; the award for the award include Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Tur@@ ner Eber@@ hard G@@ ien@@ ger , the Ru@@ le Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , Bob @-@ driver Mein@@ hard N@@ eh@@ mer , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wien@@ eke , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wien@@ eke , the Spr@@ ang@@ ite Al@@ win Sch@@ ock@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um the hand@@ maid of all Er@@ hard . &quot;
many of these sport@@ clubs have come to Aachen on Saturday .
&quot; after the official part the illustr@@ ating society went into the Spring@@ stadium , where the lava prize was running . &quot;
Bernhard Lan@@ ger held a distance to the great animals .
Cl@@ int@@ on and Tru@@ mp@@ s Economic Policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
&quot; we invest in infrastructure and prevent trade agreements T@@ TP , both Clinton and Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; however , the two U.S. presi@@ dents are however on the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental request . &quot;
&quot; differences in economic policy between Donald Tru@@ mp and Hill@@ ary Clinton is a basic , rather philosoph@@ ical difference . &quot;
the role of the state .
Tru@@ mp wants to keep in doubt rather small and be warned about how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regul@@ ators .
&quot; Clinton wants to test@@ ify the economy to death and reg@@ ulate death , he says . &quot;
&quot; for it itself would be quite different , Tru@@ mp claims . &quot;
&quot; he will turn to the regulations , and he will be strong for a wide tax reform with lower tax channels - for individuals and for companies . &quot;
Clinton said : the state has certain tasks to meet , he dis@@ advant@@ aged chances and needs money . &quot;
&quot; therefore , taxes for the rich would increase , says it . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , both are very close to infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; in which it must be invested , Tru@@ mp and Clinton said almost literally . &quot;
the democratic Candi@@ date announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes in the infrastructure are classic democratic policy and are strictly rejected by the state @-@ critical Te@@ ati@@ y @-@ wing of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
so on Tru@@ mp you might still have an im@@ partial discussions .
&quot; clearly , the differences in energy and climate policies are concerned . &quot;
Tru@@ mp wants to build coal @-@ power plants and back the coal @-@ promotion in the United States .
oil &apos;s oil is also possible to be possible to termin@@ ate the Paris climate agreement as far as far as possible .
&quot; Clinton , Clinton wants to extend and calls for renewable energy with their investment Programme : &quot; &quot; a country becomes the super@@ power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I will say that we are . &quot;
&quot; however , not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other . &quot;
&quot; TP@@ P , the transp@@ orter , do not want to sign . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , both the US does not want to isol@@ ate the US not only from international trade - but simply to protect American jobs . &quot;
&quot; that should then be better paid , calling for about Clinton . &quot;
&quot; the current minimum wage of 7,@@ 25 US dollars is a hunger . &quot;
it will increase her to 15 dollars per hour .
&quot; what Tru@@ mp wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says , he says , he says , he should not be changed . &quot;
but the great discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the control policy of the two camps .
&quot; on the one hand , Tru@@ mp , who wants to dism@@ iss the economy and citizens to boost growth . &quot;
&quot; his critics hold him in front of him , so that the budget defic@@ it would only be even bigger . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand Clinton , who wants to ask at least from the rich that they pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution . &quot;
escape : &quot; every woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot;
&quot; sexual violence is owned by women , who fle@@ e alone , almost already to everyday life . &quot;
when they arrive in Germany they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
in a large kitchen just sit four women .
each has a baby that is at most one year old .
one has placed her little son in the arm .
he gu@@ ed with big eyes curious in the room .
his mother mo@@ rt on the tabl@@ etop .
until they notice that it is observed .
she sm@@ iled short and kis@@ sed the little ones .
the scene works normal .
until you speak with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
&quot; she is the president of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social aid offers in Bavaria , and among other things deals with the subject of women on the run . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are overweight .
they live in the Munich north in one of the few de@@ centralized accommodations for all @-@ in women and their children in Bavaria .
&quot; in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs made the furniture together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich &apos;s family . &quot;
&quot; recently , it was officially opened . &quot;
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men are not available - also not as visitors .
the exception is a guard against the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who comes here , has made her escape experiences with sexual violence , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; men fle@@ e because they are politically pursued because they thre@@ aten torture or death , or because their families send them as hop@@ n@@ ers to Europe , &quot; tells them . &quot;
&quot; for women wei@@ gh other reasons for the flight , &quot; many ste@@ al themselves secret@@ ly , because they do not see any other way out . &quot;
&quot; in their home , they have experience with sexual violence , forced , hon@@ orary , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot;
this continues it away .
on the run it goes on .
&quot; that tu@@ g@@ boats for example ask for a bottle of water a sexual act is not r@@ arity , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families . &quot;
&quot; who believe that the end as soon as they come in Germany , ir@@ re , tells B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; even here , women would often be regarded as in@@ fer@@ ior and worse than in@@ fer@@ ior and worse . &quot;
&quot; this means that about 90 percent of women who live in the accommodation in the Munich north , trau@@ mati@@ zed them . &quot;
&quot; some of the children certainly have not volunt@@ arily developed . &quot;
many women were so used to say nothing .
&quot; or she does not dare to speak openly about the experiences , because the shame is too big . &quot;
&quot; as they often do not help to assist , there is more accommodations only for them , calling for bear . &quot;
in Bavaria the seven districts of refugees are in charge of the accommodation of refugees .
&quot; on the question whether they are w@@ asted from a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction , answer some with no . &quot;
&quot; in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , there is something like something in the ties of the government . &quot;
&quot; even in Schw@@ aben alone , women are not divided separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , Press@@ en@@ pre@@ cher of the government . &quot;
&quot; in Ober@@ bay@@ ern , Lower and Mid @-@ Fran@@ con@@ ia , are available in some common meetings or own homes only for in@@ coming women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Lower Bav@@ arians , there are two central accommodations solely for women . &quot;
also the committee &quot; rights of women and gender equality &quot; in the European Parliament calls for that women need to be separated from men .
&quot; in a study which was published for the Committee , it says : &quot; it is very important that men and women are being separated . &quot;
l@@ acks privacy or will be accommod@@ ated both men and women and may come to - continual violence against women .
&quot; especially the washing rooms should be easily accessible and accessible to women , stands in the study . &quot;
&quot; how much the women can feel this patron , it is possible to pass on the cr@@ ush that there is on the house in Munich . &quot;
&quot; since it has spoken about that there are us , we have a long qu@@ eu@@ es , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
you could easily take a second house .
assistance @-@ looking forward : demands for new work@@ stations
&quot; a substitute of assist@@ ants have called on their union , new labor measures in their disp@@ utes concerning the new contract . &quot;
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has requested his entire advice from early September for more workers .
J@@ DC said that there would be a minister to adopt the wor@@ rying regarding the contract .
&quot; assistance and media studies have voted on the rejection of a contract in July , which has been agreed with the BM@@ A . &quot;
he was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted upon the elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members who was published on Twitter on Thursday , the President of J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court told that the government would have remained peac@@ eable peaceful . &quot;
she said : &quot; given the J@@ DC Management Board voted to fully reject the proposed new contract and are challeng@@ ed to all breeds . &quot;
&quot; in response to the silence of the Government , the J@@ DC Executive Board has set a formal application for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to learn a further program of escal@@ ating work@@ stations , which begins at the beginning of September . &quot;
&quot; the disp@@ utes brought that assistance in this year six@@ ties , the first overall waste in the history of the N@@ HS . &quot;
&quot; the director of BM@@ A assistant director Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana joined the election of the rejection of the agreed contract conditions , which had been recommended by the BM@@ A . &quot;
&quot; he shared BM@@ A members during meetings , which still took place before the vote through 5@@ 4.000 assist@@ ants and media event , with that the contract should be beneficial and accepted . &quot;
&quot; after the vote , the Health Minister Jerem@@ y Hunt , that the contract for doctors in England should be introduced in England . &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended up a crisis .
&quot; the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday , in order to give hands to the hands and to announce an official end of the eight months of long lasting war against words and economic sanctions . &quot;
&quot; but when Vladimir Putin took his Turkish counter@@ player in gold @-@ plated room of St. Petersburg Pal@@ ast@@ es in the reception , I can not oppos@@ e the intru@@ sion that Ankara will most want this reconciliation . &quot;
&quot; there was the precip@@ itation , yes . &quot;
&quot; however , Putin des@@ y lubric@@ ated and he barely radi@@ ates warmth , even for its res@@ etting relations . &quot;
&quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an however repeatedly spoke of his &quot; &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; - according to a report all five times . &quot;
I could no longer count .
&quot; he also spoke that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but can even improve . &quot;
the next day described a newspaper that Erd@@ og@@ an could have heard so as if it would never happen a bit worst .
I seemed to be a enthusiasm rather to suggest the opposite .
&quot; but one of Putin radi@@ ant , sustainable cool@@ ness showed that the state of Russia had forgotten nothing . &quot;
&quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing that he mentioned in his intro@@ duc@@ tory marks : the shot of a Russian fighter plane in the Syrian border by Turkey . &quot;
Moscow at the time was w@@ ut@@ ary burned .
&quot; Putin condemned and prov@@ oked Ankara , Russia to be fallen into the back . &quot;
leaving was even greater since it was committed by a alleged friend .
un@@ balanced again will be difficult if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; for months , the state @-@ controlled media led a fier@@ ce , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara . &quot;
&quot; at once , it seemed as would the Turks for everything to blame . &quot;
&quot; serious officials were the alleg@@ ations of conduc@@ tive officials that had benef@@ ited their own family from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria , which will be controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic state . &quot;
he did this v@@ eh@@ ement .
&quot; but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was , that it is time to look forward . &quot;
&quot; finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received from the President Erd@@ og@@ an the exc@@ use he wanted to hear . &quot;
Russia could book a sort of victory .
&quot; for Ankara , the advantages of a cease @-@ fire is clearly obvious . &quot;
&quot; Erd@@ og@@ an needs first and all the friends , which he can get , after having spent last month at a failed coup in almost his ministry . &quot;
repet@@ itive terror@@ ist attacks on Turkey have also sh@@ aken him also .
but there are also economic mot@@ ives .
&quot; Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on Char@@ ter@@ istics , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year . &quot;
the number is gone by almost 90 % .
&quot; in Russia , travel agencies and charter companies will be easier , if the flights are added again . &quot;
you are counting on a late @-@ seas@@ onal ons@@ lau@@ ght of the Mediterranean .
this week pro@@ g@@ nostic cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agr@@ arian imports will be allowed again .
&quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti forms it as follows : &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is fur@@ i@@ ously angry at the West as it has been response to the tried to take power over a weak response .
&quot; to this end , the persist@@ ence Gro@@ ll come across the sn@@ ail @-@ accession negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ ke to pull out from the cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the west . &quot;
the Russian leader won in Ankara with security a bonus that he had requested for the elected coup in favour of the elected state organ@@ e .
this is well @-@ deser@@ ved for Moscow a self @-@ evident that even has a deep fear of reg@@ im@@ e@@ change .
&quot; the summit in this gl@@ anz@@ ful Palace at the sea allowed Russia and Turkey , one as it once described me an an@@ alyst@@ s of once described , &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; depic@@ ted : two countries that can be confused by the West and are badly treated and now . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two still . &quot;
&quot; the greatest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave the role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey are contra@@ dic@@ tory pages . &quot;
it could be signi@@ fying that after almost three hours of first place the President at the press conference said that they had not even stri@@ ped the issue .
&quot; the president of Turkey rent it clearly on a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emphasize . &quot;
there is no definite consensus on how a common denomin@@ ator can be found to Syria .
&quot; but after months of open host@@ ility - and in the light of potenti@@ als for a perfect disc@@ aster , as NATO member of Turkey ab@@ oss the Russian fighter jet , it is certainly better that the two leaders are at least talk with one another . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland is no longer available
the brand R@@ BS should be reduced to a back@@ office role according to the Executive Board of Bank nur@@ series .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland with that the brand R@@ BS were connected to the global amb@@ itions of the bank .
the Bank has since dist@@ anced when she had to be almost coll@@ ap@@ sed off and saved .
&quot; in this period , brand strategies are used to protect other end @-@ consumer brands . &quot;
&quot; she supported international sports with millions of pounds to Sponsor@@ ing , from the Six Nations Rug@@ by to Wim@@ bl@@ edon champion Andy Murray . &quot;
but now she decided to move more national brands in the focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland but will not be initi@@ alized .
&quot; in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centr@@ alised headquarters and stock exchange at Nat@@ West will change . &quot;
the Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are others to get smaller stamps for private business , which will receive more significance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dru@@ m@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a guided tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Sh@@ ire inter@@ viewed .
&quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the brand RS@@ B will be on our invest@@ or brand as well as the brand , under which our employees are employed , as we now become a bank of brands . &quot;
&quot; as the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand . &quot;
&quot; now I say that we are not global goals , but local goals . &quot;
each of these marks is completely different from their own communities for something completely different and our employees will work among these brands with the customers .
R@@ BS has already argu@@ ed that there will be its Six Nations Sponsor@@ ing and will not increase the perc@@ ep@@ ability of different brands in its sport sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; it is time for us to develop into the bank of brands , as we are in the inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; said the fore@@ ground . &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ n@@ ical prior to three years ago if we had said that we have to be a great bank for our clients and have lan@@ c@@ ated these marks .
&quot; but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see a lot of changes . &quot;
&quot; we can turn off these brands again , so I think that the time has come . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori achieved on Pre@@ dil@@ ection his 3.@@ 000@@ ten win at New@@ market
&quot; D@@ ett@@ ori is spra@@ yed champagne after a double with New@@ market , which brings him 3.@@ 000@@ ten profit &quot;
the G@@ ett@@ ori Jockey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori was on Friday his 3.@@ 000@@ th British profit in New@@ market .
&quot; he sat on Pre@@ dil@@ ection , which is trained by John Gos@@ den , on his local race track with his second win of the night a milestone . &quot;
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Ital@@ ians is the sixth Jockey , who reached the milestone in the Flach@@ rennen . &quot;
&quot; he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , Pat Ed@@ dry and Willi@@ e Car@@ son . &quot;
&quot; the dre@@ am@@ al@@ ous winner of D@@ ett@@ ori , who before previously won on G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar , said : &quot; it is something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is also here
I am very happy that it is done with New@@ market because I am here 30 years ago .
&quot; it is not a big meeting , it is not the Royal As@@ cot - it is a bank@@ rupt Friday night with 20,000 people . &quot;
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes the che@@ ers when he took the victory on Pre@@ dil@@ ection
&quot; two Jo@@ ck@@ eys have reached the milestone in the obstacles race - Jockey Richard Johnson and the re@@ tired 20 @-@ mal@@ ian winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who achieved more than 4,@@ 300 vict@@ ories in a recru@@ itment career . &quot;
&quot; L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the ninth Der@@ b@@ ysi@@ eger had 4.@@ 4@@ 93 Kar@@ rier@@ esi@@ ege . &quot;
Frank@@ ie is one of the best Jockey of Modern and it &apos;s no surprise that he has reached this milestone only a few before him .
&quot; he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intell@@ ect that distingu@@ ishes it from the other in the weight loss . &quot;
he has been a fantastic amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors for races , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma fans for years for this sport . &quot;
&quot; I said Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som , that he had already brought 6@@ ,000 prizes if he was not just a weekend and big @-@ tur@@ ni@@ er@@ jo@@ ckey ! &quot;
Frank@@ ie has won nearly 30 years of winners in UK what is great .
&quot; he has a lively personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an incredible person . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated its milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
&quot; from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ mo@@ unts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flag@@ ship of British flat@@ lands for two decades . &quot;
it was ner@@ ven@@ ous .
&quot; a whole series of big @-@ tur@@ ni@@ ers capture , including its famous &quot; Gl@@ orious Si@@ eben &quot; 1996 at As@@ cot , but he also survived a leaf@@ let and was given a drug bot . &quot;
&quot; three years ago he had returned to the beginning of three years ago , when he returned from his six@@ teenth semen , but he showed an impressive strength to beat his branches and to return to his order . &quot;
&quot; and he is not yet in the end - D@@ ett@@ ori has once again said that in competitions , up to his at least 5@@ 0,@@ ten years . &quot;
Russia Putin dam@@ ert Stab@@ sch@@ ef Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin un@@ expect@@ edly released his Stab@@ sch@@ ef Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was many years part of the nar@@ row@@ est bonds of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed for environmental and transport affairs .
&quot; in an opinion of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , it is that Putin without giving reasons &quot; &quot; dism@@ is@@ sal Ivan@@ ov@@ s was arranged by his duties as chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration . &quot;
&quot; Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who was dep@@ uty chairman since 2012 Ivan@@ ov@@ s , was appointed to his successor . &quot;
&quot; V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at . &quot;
1972 in the Est@@ onian capital Tallinn , he made his degree at the renowned State of Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in Tokyo . &quot;
on the web site of the Kre@@ m@@ lin it was ( in Russian ) that he later was the manager and staff members of the government .
&quot; about his appointment he said to Putin , &quot; &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot;
I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as a state leader regarding legislation and controls the implementation of your instructions .
Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday with that Ivan@@ ov had asked to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convince the smiling faces ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov was for a long time one of the nar@@ row@@ est trusted Vladimir Putin &apos;s and works as he was for the Soviet secret service .
as a rod captain he was one of the most powerful men of the country .
&quot; at a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast on TV , both men reported that the Stab@@ ney his own desire returned . &quot;
&quot; but despite the sm@@ iles for the cameras , here are only a few of them convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
so here is the consequence of a kind of power struggle ?
he currently knows no one .
&quot; but the official claim - that a man , who once was called to be potential President , he would like to guide the Russian environmental policy - came across great sc@@ ep@@ tic@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; in his comments on Putin , which is quoted on the website of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , Ivan@@ ov said it is true that I asked you in early 2012 in a conversation I could almost say - to trust this very complicated post for four years . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , I have been Chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months . &quot;
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December 2011 .
previously he was Deputy Minister and Defence Minister .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin former member of the S@@ GB &apos;s security services .
&quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin was Chairman of the B@@ und@@ essi@@ ch@@ erh@@ ouses ( FS@@ B ) was appointed by the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his dep@@ uty . &quot;
as a Putin on the power he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people whom he was most familiar .
&quot; once , Ivan@@ ov was named after Putin &apos;s second term as president of Russia , as a third term in the coup against the Constitution . &quot;
&quot; but this post was taken from another , closest allies Put@@ ters , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev . &quot;

Queens@@ ferry crossing : bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe
the £ 1,35 billion &apos;s project should be completed until May 2017
engineers have joined the North deck of the Queens@@ ferry Cross@@ ings with the vi@@ adu@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; it is the first of four verses of the &quot; &quot; Deck @-@ b@@ lower &quot; , &quot; which leads to completion of each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons .
&quot; it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete , and 46 locks . &quot;
the £ 1,35 billion &apos;s project should be completed until May 2017 .
&quot; economy , Keith Brown put the construction site today and was one of the first to went out from the country to the bridge . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; This is a historical and symbolic moment when building the Queens@@ ferry Cross@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; we are all witn@@ essing a engineering with a truly epic degree of this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the hing@@ es between the vi@@ adu@@ ct and the bridge deck is a sacred activity that require extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit . &quot;
&quot; in total , nearly 79 % of the total inc@@ enti@@ cks are in their place and the last section of the Dec@@ ks in Ros@@ y@@ th will get a sc@@ ong@@ ings for the deck , which means that the whole deck is ready to be raised on the bridge to its place . &quot;
&quot; Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; &quot; the first con@@ stri@@ pper will be a significant milestone at each Br@@ ücken@@ project . &quot;
in this fantastic project the exclusion of tr@@ end@@ setting high @-@ depth and low @-@ mounting .
&quot; after the installation of the last street @-@ covers , and its connection with which in the expansion of the North @-@ deck , we had to close the existing gap in the north or country side . &quot;
this was reached by drag@@ ging the northern Zu@@ br@@ inger@@ brücke 700 milli@@ metres south .
this was a massive and at the same time very hom@@ eless activity .
&quot; massive , since the vi@@ adu@@ ct 222 meters long is , approx . 6@@ ,000 tons , and had to be drawn from approximately 3 % to the top . &quot;
&quot; the toler@@ ances , because the toler@@ ances who work on the team , were tiny - on each side they were only a few milli@@ meters . &quot;
fortunately everything went very well .
rescue at Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay : three men have luck to be alive
&quot; three men have no luck to be alive , after they have thrown from their fishing boat in front of Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot;

&quot; the three men had difficulties to swim , while her boat moved from their own strength . &quot;
&quot; we saw how the boat turned near to turned and put us the worst , &quot; &quot; said the head of the lif@@ ebo@@ at station of Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the strong winds have already left the boat out of their range until we left water , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , while the third man was found at the age of 60 exhausted , and was found on a bo@@ il without life@@ jacket . &quot;
they all came on board the coastal area and were taken back to the lif@@ ebo@@ at station .
&quot; Mr Jones said : &quot; &quot; the three men who have been thrown into the water , have luck in@@ ju@@ red and still alive . &quot;
&quot; the boat @-@ engine had a stop@@ over , but they can get rid of the boat from the person from the person that the boat was tax@@ ed . &quot;

this al@@ armed forces then his sister .
&quot; together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother . &quot;
&quot; however , she could not move him to leave the apartment . &quot;
that &apos;s why she went out with her life @-@ mate from the house .
on the street they met the ex @-@ habitats of the man .
&quot; when the two women bet@@ ray the apartment again , fancy the 50 @-@ year @-@ old his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
who builds Braunschwei@@ gs affordable apartments ?
the SPD and Green My : investors should in future be much stronger in the future .
how does one react to the bad news that Br@@ uns@@ wick will lose nearly 1300 to the next few years ?
the SPD is propos@@ ing a &quot; action concept for the next step . &quot;
but dispute is program@@ med .
primarily is the question : who is supposed to build the cheap apartments actually ?
a policy is missing .
&quot; SPD leader Christoph Brat@@ mann writes : &quot; &quot; we are committed to the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build on urban areas in the future 20 per cent of all the housing as social housing . &quot;
&quot; however , the cheap apartments can also arise in the stock . &quot;
&quot; in the town hall of the town hall , however , as Brat@@ mann : &quot; how do you want to build investors , who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot;
&quot; we want investors to build on such areas at least 10 per cent , but as possible as 20 percent of housing as social housing . &quot;
&quot; a new urban housing program , which will cost millions of cost and will still be financed , must provide for incentives . &quot;
&quot; the problem , as Brat@@ mann : &quot; there is no agreement between the groups at the moment . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as few as possible .
the left is still aim@@ ing for investors .
&quot; regardless , as Brat@@ mann , flag is an intensi@@ fication of the situation on the market @-@ market . &quot;
&quot; the action concept is implemented , which will provide additional tasks in the construction administration . &quot;
more personnel is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers .
&quot; however , the program is not entirely different : for the around 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway . &quot;
&quot; but how do you compare the loss of further around 1300 cheap apartments , whose funding will run in the coming years ? &quot;
it will be 500 apartments alone until the year 2020 .
&quot; to prevent this , the plan@@ ational Spe@@ aker Nicole Palm , should now be sold out of the city now . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the apartments would have to be thought to get back into the delivery . &quot;
this is possible in the west city .
on one stroke the problem can solve .
because in the west town there are the annual dates back to the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments one could get there back into the price connection for affordable housing .
only : these are the owners who do not want the owners .
&quot; for the number of social housing in the Western town is again dramatically , it is removed from the goal of the so @-@ called diarr@@ hea . &quot;
there is no longer a concentration of social weak in just a few neighbor@@ hoods .
the Gre@@ ens expect that there will be movement in the discussion .
&quot; leader Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; for a wide majority must use the CD@@ U into the boat . &quot;
I have concentrated on more construction sites for family @-@ families .
but what does not mean that not yet a compromise can be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that is worth &quot;
it is fascinating to see how the world changes .
&quot; that teenagers and child to play no longer go outside , but rather prefer to spend their free time with it , on screens , was taken over the last decade of many . &quot;
&quot; at Pok@@ emon Go , it is about to get people from the sofa to get more active . &quot;
&quot; the time on the screen was initially on TV , then limited to video games and last on smartphones . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is great to see that technology and activities cannot be mut@@ ually exclusive . &quot;
&quot; of course I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an App which is based on the characters , first created for vide@@ og@@ ames in the 1990s ( later emerged from a drawing series , game cards and other spin @-@ off@@ s ) . &quot;
&quot; like many phenomena of the Pop@@ culture , the interest in front of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand in the beginning of July . &quot;
launching in other countries was post@@ pon@@ ed by the massive demand that the server over@@ loaded .
within a few days Pok@@ é@@ mon Go more users than Tin@@ as and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , players go outside with their smartphone to the outside and search for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons that are followed by a GPS as soon as they were once found , &quot; photograp@@ hed &quot; ( on a screenshot on the phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot; &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was even younger than she joined the W@@ ahn and sp@@ rang out for the sofa .
in the United States the game led to a considerable increase in steps that causes the &quot; average &quot; person every day .
&quot; Cardi@@ ograph@@ s , a App for Apple Watch , the 35.@@ 000 users re@@ pro@@ sec@@ uted , distributed by the Washington Post recently concluded that within two days of the launch of the game , the number of nights followed by 45 percent to 53 percent . &quot;
the company does not know who plays the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it just sees the raw data to improve performance .
&quot; many public advice campaigns for health , people want to take a &quot; 30 minute time &quot; to come from the sofa &quot; and &quot; to be active every day , because many public messages are boring to health and come from people who look el@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ rated . &quot;
who regularly drives sport regularly reduces its chances of cancer or depression .
&quot; physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here . &quot;
&quot; but the wonder@@ full of Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something in the open , that gives them fun . &quot;
&quot; thus , three pillars of health covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine , and fun . &quot;
some people are close on the hunt even new friend@@ ships .
as always there is m@@ ür@@ ric gam@@ ation that have always to complain about something .
&quot; and yes , someone might run against a door . &quot;
what is it meant to be ?
it has a breakthrough .
&quot; even when a smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit were able to follow our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to do sports such as this game does . &quot;
the new will lose its charm and the use will be refresh@@ ed with time .
&quot; however , due to Pok@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success there will be more games to join the apps and virtual reality with the activity in the real world and will help many people on the hunt , active , f@@ itter and healthier . &quot;

and finally also the Olymp@@ ics .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American Tur@@ ner@@ in er@@ kl@@ om@@ m on the Thursday of the multi @-@ campaign and enlarged the gap between themselves and the rest of the world before all eyes of the hypo@@ cris@@ y of the Olympic Games .
your overall result of 6@@ 2.@@ 198 was clearly in front of the silver medalli@@ sts and &quot; final Five &quot; -@@ Mann@@ sam@@ sk@@ amer@@ ad@@ in A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian Bron@@ m@@ aill@@ eur Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
&quot; the Americas , Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ nt at the flo@@ at @-@ head of women in the art@@ ef@@ ons at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ a is the fourth heter@@ os@@ exual Americ@@ anism , who wins a multi @-@ battle and earned a total of the fifth , while keeping her reputation to be the best of their generation or even at all . &quot;
&quot; she broke out in tears , when her end result was shown and her long journey took place at this moment . &quot;
&quot; this success provides them in the same le@@ ague as unique athletes such as Michael P@@ helps , which have brought their sports to new heights : &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ it has dominated the last three years their sport @-@ art , 15 World Cup medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that the Olymp@@ ics of 1984 Mary Lou Rett@@ on from her said that she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast that I have ever seen . &quot;
&quot; it expected it a last test in Brazil , a competition , not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather , between her and a burden of higher expectations . &quot;
&quot; not return with a hand@@ ful gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be regarded as disappointment . &quot;
&quot; the Americas , Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace , after they have won gold and silver in the single @-@ fighting for women during the Olympic Summer 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday , &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es took the first Medal on Tuesday , while on the f@@ arewell party he served in retirement team @-@ ordin@@ ator in Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi as an exp@@ ulsion . &quot;
&quot; although Bil@@ es insi@@ sted on the top , during their long journeys to the top , never planned the future , this is not really true . &quot;
part of her ground exercises - that contain their typical tum@@ bling pass - is adapted to Latin American music that would fit at home on the road outside the Olympi@@ a@@ arena in Rio .
it is not a coincidence .
&quot; this girl was adopted by their grand@@ parents as a small child and by coach A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans &apos;s mother during a school trip to the gym , was trained in the Bo@@ or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; since the summer 2013 she has not lost a multi @-@ battle competition since the summer of 2013 , a winning series that will hold for so long as it desires . &quot;
&quot; even though Must@@ af@@ ina was slightly led by two rot@@ ations , the image had the image . &quot;
flo@@ wering and Bo@@ dent@@ ur@@ nen - in which Bil@@ es hold the world @-@ best titles - lau@@ ded .
she took up again with 15.@@ 4@@ 33 on the flo@@ wering speed - and sat on the ground with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground .
&quot; Ra@@ is@@ man h@@ ug@@ ged them gently when they were expecting their end@@ owed - a pure form@@ ality - and tears stream to a bright red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , when the vision that once described it in their collective @-@ book , for reality . &quot;
&quot; the performance Ra@@ is@@ mans was a ven@@ ge@@ ance for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke at Must@@ af@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ year team played by the Americans &quot; &quot; Grand@@ ma &quot; , &quot; a lead . &quot;
&quot; after her bum@@ ps , they cast to the public bo@@ oth@@ s to overcome by a com@@ eback that was sometimes dou@@ bt@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; as it concerns , so that he quickly spread out to the 19 @-@ year @-@ old @-@ year @-@ old from the beginning of this week , a brand new meaning : &quot;
police : 3 victims in mass mur@@ der@@ ships at the music heard in the car
&quot; according to police report , which were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year old girls have been shot in one of the most deadly attacks from Phoenix , while they were talking in the car and heard music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Rochelle Liner , Stef@@ anie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on 12 June , while the car was par@@ ked at a rec@@ iting , said the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the perpet@@ rator fi@@ red eight shots from a hand@@ shake , while he stood on the back@@ side of the car and then fled with another vehicle , is in the report . &quot;
&quot; the police shared that the triple murder does not seem to have been the result of a pre@@ dat@@ ors , since the ass@@ ail@@ ers did not participate the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 that were in possession of an adult victims . &quot;
&quot; the polic@@ emen of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the investig@@ ator has failed to get a closer look at it , whether it is connected to four previous attacks . &quot;
&quot; in total , mainly in h@@ isp@@ an resi@@ dences were killed within four months in nine attacks seven people and two more wo@@ unded . &quot;
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , shared Howard the K@@ HP@@ O , a subsidiary of CB@@ S , beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that the susp@@ ects has used several vehicles , including a brown n@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln . &quot;
&quot; investig@@ ators were forced to off@@ set the evidence that they have led to the conclusion that the attacks are linked , and committed by the same mur@@ derer . &quot;
&quot; Ellis , 33 , was im@@ it@@ alised due to their inj@@ uries and died later . &quot;
&quot; Liner , 31 , and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died even on site . &quot;
a witness shared the police with that it was not unusual to sit in a tort@@ ured car and listen to music .
&quot; the authorities also published a police report about the shooting , which took place on an empty pick@@ up truck , half an hour before the thir@@ sty murder and ruled that it was the work of mass mur@@ ders . &quot;
investig@@ ators found Pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen and saf@@ ed a bul@@ let from the seat as well as spher@@ ical fragments from the motor .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cephal@@ ia : &quot; it gets better &quot;
&quot; like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old , Edmund Pic@@ ci@@ uto love singing , toys , and of course his mother . &quot;
&quot; but as the least of his al@@ tery , Edmund micro@@ cephal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ uto knew nothing during their pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; when he came home the first time , my first thought , I won &apos;t . &quot;
I do not create that .
I did not let myself down .
&quot; what is not true at all -- of course you have left it , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; your husband Vincent and her husband has been informed that Edmund it will never be able to recognize them , and that he may not even survive . &quot;
some doctors even went so far that they sm@@ ote him to institutional .
&quot; my first answer to it was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &apos; explained Pic@@ ci@@ uto . &quot;
Edmund can work with the help of an audit@@ ory .
&quot; Edmund could not sit up to his third year , neither sit kr@@ ab@@ bles and he cannot speak . &quot;
but he slowly makes progress .
he can run with support and cycling .
he likes to play with his two brothers and sing .
Elizabeth displays the drawing language that Edmund for &quot; Please sing me something before . &quot;
&quot; we bring him &quot; character upon , &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ uto CB@@ S News . &quot;
but it is not a typical character -- says it . Edmund has invented some characters alone .
micro@@ cephal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as with Edmund as well as infections with viruses such as masks or the Z@@ ic@@ av@@ irus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how to influence the life of the Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus In@@ infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ uto re@@ minds of the emotional price of a certain future .
I asked constantly what is going to happen ?
what will happen ?
and they still know not really .
I have no longer asked for the pro@@ gn@@ osis since a long time because I don &apos;t expect that someone can really say to me .
&quot; but Pic@@ ci@@ uto has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers affected by inf@@ ants , which have been caused by the cic@@ av@@ irus . &quot;
it gets better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
&quot; fier@@ ce , floo@@ ding gives rise to b@@ ail@@ ments in Louis@@ iana , Mississippi &quot;
fier@@ ce rain@@ forest and large @-@ scale floo@@ ds in Louis@@ iana is forced to rest the governor on Friday . it will be reck@@ oned throughout the Saturday with more rain @-@ cases .

Ste@@ ele said that alone the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa ten thousand sand@@ bags required .
a floo@@ ding system is used on long parts in the southern Louis@@ ian@@ as to Saturday .
the weather service could be dis@@ si@@ det@@ ectable that in this area could fall additional 3 to 5 inches in rain .
&quot; in Southern Alabama , the Friday has been deploy@@ ed on Friday a fly@@ wheel system , while in the area of Mobile continues to be ra@@ ining . &quot;
the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs that are both in Louis@@ iana are likely to be reached by the weekend record .
the Met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Al@@ ek Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could be floo@@ ded near Bat@@ on Rouge .
&quot; he also said that a steep , floo@@ ding floo@@ ding in Ascension Par@@ ish there is a danger , since these are flowing via the rivers only slowly into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as . &quot;

&quot; Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house to rise above night . &quot;
he said that he was another step@@ son who lives near .
&quot; we asc@@ ended and pour in the water , &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot;
it reached my waist .
&quot; his wife told Hans@@ ford that she had lived in the 48 years , where she had never seen such a strongh@@ old of the river . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members could have all the disabled , and he would have the only one who can swim . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that not@@ hel@@ pers would have saved all three in a large military truck , and brought them to the next fire@@ house in Glo@@ ster , where they were staying up to Friday . &quot;
&quot; Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the floo@@ ding &quot; had quickly spread , as there were still heavy ra@@ inf@@ all and that the authorities should consider ev@@ acu@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; according to Kr@@ aut@@ mann , an ob@@ server held near Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13,@@ 75 inches . &quot;
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the ground was considerably ful@@ fil@@ med by the ra@@ ins since Wednesday .
the authorities gave to the fact that serious rain@@ forest and road floo@@ ds the saving of inhabitants from their houses in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and teaching forces in five bor@@ ough@@ s .

&quot; in the town of Ham@@ mond the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two d@@ utz@@ ing streets were closed and sand@@ bags prepared for residents for residents who hope to keep the water out of their houses and shops . &quot;
&quot; the last big floo@@ ding we had , was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
in R@@ pp the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Harrison Count@@ ys said that it continues to be ra@@ ining on the Gulf coast .
&quot; according to his details , a hand@@ ful of houses should be reported on Thursday as a floo@@ ded , but on Friday there have been no reported . &quot;

the other two victims were not found in the car and the police were found whether one of the last men of the perpet@@ rators could be found .
investig@@ ators shared CB@@ S Philadelphia with that it seems to have come to a cross @-@ fire between several sho@@ oters .
&quot; Pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen for Stur@@ ges , which were trac@@ ed to various assault , over@@ se@@ ated the crime scene . &quot;
it seems that it is clear to a lasting battle here .
&quot; on the street , on both sides of the hearing , found H@@ ül@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; so it seems to have been here several armed fighters , who were very active involved , shared police officer of Gin@@ al@@ di of the police in Philadelphia to the sender . &quot;
there were also several houses and vehicles hit in the area .
there was no fixed and the police currently check reports according to the surveillance video .
on Tuesday there was another 6 @-@ year girl hit by a Quer@@ schl@@ äger on his arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of the West O@@ ak Lane .
they re@@ bound@@ ed himself and the police are still looking for a susp@@ ects .
why we Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie &quot;
that is what I present to me under the Frauen@@ oly@@ mp@@ i@@ am@@ ann@@ ess in the turn , and that is more than one reason . &quot;
&quot; first , I have been around since 1984 at every summer Olymp@@ ics and the USA have never been so dominant . &quot;
&quot; and secondly , this team has three gymn@@ ast , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Hern@@ an@@ dez , who are both inspiring for many young girls from other skin colour . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this crew , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the J@@ üd@@ in is and Madison Ko@@ cian , the Kath@@ o@@ lik@@ in is , ab@@ round , makes every proud . &quot;
this team is finally reflected the USA .
it has been the black and h@@ isp@@ anic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years the number one under the female tur@@ ret was one A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americ@@ ana .
last year were Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
at the last Olympic Games Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympi@@ ag@@ ew@@ inner and America che@@ ered .
&quot; now the world was able to be witn@@ essing the unbelievable performance of the Thir@@ f@@ uss World Championship in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Hern@@ an@@ dez , as they were unexpected , but master@@ ful Gy@@ ma@@ st@@ ik@@ routines . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Simone the fourth , heter@@ os@@ exual Americ@@ anism who won in an individual multi @-@ battle event for women Gold . &quot;
Mann@@ scape member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
&quot; we are experiencing the top of this sport , but so you don &apos;t see classes in the whole country . &quot;
&quot; Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie they sm@@ ote all the same way as A@@ ly and Madison to create it into the Olympic team . &quot;
they are the &quot; Last Five &quot; because the next Olympi@@ ad only four tur@@ rets expressed in the team . moreover , this is the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a trainer . &quot;
&quot; but the reality is like that Tur@@ n is a expensive sports and turbin@@ es will be kept primarily in private trainers who want to maintain parents , travel , travel , and hotel costs ( for the coach and their turbin@@ es and families ) . &quot;
the majority of these rotation are in wealthy suburbs that can support business .
&quot; in these verses , the Tur@@ ner get their overall training and this is a most expensive and long @-@ term engagement . &quot;
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer by Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer by Lau@@ rie Hern@@ an@@ dez , both have exercis@@ ed their athletes , since they started with the turn . &quot;
&quot; we have to be inspired to the municipalities Au@@ n numerous , young girls , who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a powerful and more easily accessible trainers . &quot;
I have established my turn@@ al from 20 years ago .
&quot; with my events we have free and affordable turn in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban young people ( above all black and h@@ isp@@ anic ) offered and trained national and international competition . &quot;
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer the youth high @-@ quality turtle that deserve the opportunity to learn from this great oly@@ mp@@ ic sport .
&quot; exercising develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determin@@ at@@ eness for the mind . &quot;
this combination provides vital benefits for health as well as for the school and professional success .
&quot; it is the inspiration of this crew , which bring thousands young girls to get involved in the turn , and this is great . &quot;
&quot; it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls . &quot;
this is such an exciting time .
&quot; thanks Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Madison for this real presentation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ en des oly@@ mp@@ ic Mann@@ es@@ gol@@ ds and thank you that motiv@@ ates her so many young girls with different background to start their way to start healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
assistant doctors want to organise further strikes after they have rejected Jerem@@ y H@@ unts proposal
&quot; the ministers had hop@@ ed to end the dispute over the changes due to adop@@ ting a reform@@ ist contract with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7.@@ 000 assist@@ ants who voted for a choice , decl@@ ined him . &quot;
&quot; in July , hunt plans will be revealed to introduce the contract inev@@ it@@ ably and said that the N@@ HS were found in a &quot; &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; &quot; and any further delay in the employees and patients were harmful . &quot;
&quot; the first assist@@ ants should receive a new contract , to make changes to night and weekends , in order to improve maintenance to im@@ movable times . &quot;
&quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the Chairman of the BM@@ A com@@ pressor for assist@@ ants shared last night in a message with : &quot; assistance doctors have been proposed to the proposed contract after such a serious concerns , especially that it is going to treat the current state crisis and administ@@ ered to treat all doctors . &quot;
&quot; for only eight weeks , which still remain , until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , have to be made progress and the time is running out . &quot;
efforts on the part of the BM@@ A to resolve any dispute caused by talks to the government on with@@ ers and sometimes on o@@ hr@@ en@@ ening silence .
&quot; this happened of a promise , the Jerem@@ y Hunt had only made the last month over the last month , that his door was always open . &quot;
&quot; Jerem@@ y Hunt must now act , the re@@ condition and concerns the concerns of assist@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; should he do not do this , so it did not make an assistant clearly that they are ready to perform further work schem@@ es . &quot;
&quot; the last strike at the end of April saw an asc@@ ended of almost 13.@@ 000 Rout@@ ine@@ operations and 100,000 appointments , as n@@ urses and specialized doctors were included in order to grant doctors on the stri@@ kers chain . &quot;
the ministers had hop@@ ed to end the dispute over the changes made by adop@@ ting the reform@@ ist contract with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association .
&quot; the BM@@ A wants to be a better den@@ ial wages for the 5@@ 4.000 assist@@ ants , which are subject to the contract . &quot;
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Direct@@ orate @-@ General of the N@@ HS employees , called for assistance to end the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ timer said , &quot; &quot; Labor Statist@@ ics have nothing but little , but already exceeded teams and service providers and prepare the patient , care and their families only wor@@ ries , need and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
in the last two months we have talked to the Comintern Minister and with the Ministry of Health and other minist@@ ries have a positive response to concerns regarding the pre@@ mat@@ ernity and the W@@ hist@@ li@@ low@@ ings .
&quot; the employers had hop@@ ed that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as disp@@ atch , flexibility in training , training courses , mutual recognition of the cur@@ riculum , training courses and health Department concerning the compliance with the BM@@ A in November , February and May . &quot;
£ 2 @-@ per day - medication that can lower the heart attack
thousands of heart attack are profit from a £ 2 @-@ a day drug which was advised by the authorities to administ@@ er this more people for a longer period of time .
the anti @-@ minded drug Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repet@@ itive heart attack for people with a heart disease .
&quot; this medication is already given for 12 months after a heart attack , which reduces the risk of stroke , or another heart attack . &quot;
the regulatory authority of the N@@ HS has recommended a four years long ing@@ est@@ ion to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the regulatory authority of the N@@ HS has recommended a four years long ing@@ est@@ ion to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
around 14@@ 0.000 people each year have a heart attack and a quarter of it suffer a further heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by accum@@ ulations fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls .
&quot; when the t@@ ag breaks off , it can cause a blood flow that causes blood flow to the heart and thereby causing a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; when the blood cells is sol@@ ves , it may flow through blood stream and flow flow to the brain , causing a stroke . &quot;
people who have already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk to another .
Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or which is manufactured by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and is driven under the name of Bri@@ li@@ que and reduces this risk by making the formation of blood @-@ minded un@@ prob@@ able .
&quot; the manager of nice , which was published today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with an twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years . &quot;
&quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son said : &quot; despite the availability of the nice health care centre , a quarter of all persons who suffered a heart attack or stroke - often with des@@ ast@@ rö@@ sen consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have considerable negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
the experience reveals that Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in effectively at the reduction of further heart attack and stroke of people who already had a heart attack .
&quot; by a pro@@ visional recommendation by Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to extend the treatment options to thousands of people that can benefit from them . &quot;
the information on the effectiveness and safety of Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the blood risk - is restricted to a period of up to three years . the intro@@ duc@@ tory does not recommend treatment that goes beyond this period .
the Culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness can be opened in Muslim areas
the former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ for Rah@@ man was removed last year for the release of a government report because of corruption from the office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to that far @-@ prolifer@@ ation was to be ignored in Muslim communities like a non @-@ non @-@ governmental report today .
&quot; the former member of Sir Eric Pic@@ kl@@ es verb@@ ally , the police , elect@@ oral observ@@ ations and Rath@@ enh@@ anc@@ ements to have ignored due to &quot; hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ itivity to Eth@@ no@@ bility and religion &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the former Minister for Integration and Commun@@ al government , who is now a pro@@ cor@@ rupt , said that the inti@@ mid@@ ation of elect@@ ors from religious mot@@ ives should be bad that the police should be allowed to set out blocks outside of elect@@ oral cabins , to protect inti@@ mid@@ ated voters . &quot;
he recommends that voters should lead a credit card to prove to the elections their identity .
at the moment a voters must merely call its name and address .
&quot; the report propos@@ es , not removable ink on the finger of a person when they give up their vote , to prevent that someone is chosen twice . &quot;
&quot; wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lowers should get more protection , says Sir Eric . &quot;
he demands that the press should have more access to par@@ is@@ sions and decisions of not official Com@@ missions or work@@ groups .
&quot; that serves not only against elect@@ oral power , but is also the communist government in front of the broader cor@@ rupt and finance culture that goes with it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets Wahl@@ sk@@ and@@ als in the east of London .
&quot; last year , a special person decided that the current Mayor of Lut@@ fur was supposed to be cor@@ rupt to a lit@@ igation and illegal practices of his ministry . &quot;
&quot; the court was that Rah@@ man could have had the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in a cy@@ n@@ ical way , &quot; and that he had brought his critics with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man is supposed to have led to &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the reli@@ ous duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
&quot; up to 300 voices were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the result of an im@@ itation , in which one person cho@@ oses someone else . &quot;
Sir Eric said that there would be no evidence of betra@@ yal throughout the country .
he explained in particular al@@ ar@@ ming for fr@@ aud@@ ul@@ ent letter - in the older members of the Muslim community must have made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
&quot; Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to clean the elect@@ oral system , including the feeding of caus@@ ative to prove the identity . &quot;
&quot; in his report it says : &quot; as evidence was appropriate that pres@@ su@@ res members of some ethnic minorities , especially women and young people in order to choose according to the will of elders , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ian or ban@@ quet background . &quot;
there were concerns that ... state institutions have had such behaviour due to &quot; politically correct &quot; hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ itivity to the eth@@ nic@@ ity and religion .
&quot; Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the pro@@ hibition that political activists can be processed , to stop &quot; election . &quot; &quot;
the report published by Ther@@ esa May is considered to be tough@@ er regist@@ rations to prevent the elect@@ oral rules of immigration and social dec@@ eption purposes .
consider trying to ask voters before the choice after your ID .
&quot; not removable ink on the finger of a person , once they gave their voice to prevent that someone choose twice . &quot;
systematic ex@@ aud@@ ited about the nationality of a person to ensure that they are optional .
a three @-@ year limitation on applications to an automatic letter selection .
pro@@ hibition that political activists will edit full letters and re@@ charge of letters .
the police give the powers to set off @-@ ups to elect@@ oral stations .
a bill that facilit@@ ates an accus@@ ation because of inti@@ mid@@ ation of the People Act 1983 ( People &apos;s Act 1983 ) .
photography in elect@@ oral @-@ gy@@ ms .
requirement that only English can be used in the elect@@ oral units ( except Wales ) .
&quot; intensi@@ fication of the training , to ensure that the employees rule the rule that voters alone go to the elect@@ orate . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric falls through the Metropolitan Police and it is &quot; &quot; amazing &quot; &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets Fall are not a pro@@ secution . &quot;
&quot; the elect@@ oral dish has Lut@@ for Rah@@ man and his representative for due to a lit@@ igation at cor@@ rupt and illegal practices , &quot; he said . &quot;
he was sufficiently well known for a number of reasons - according to the high demands in the criminal proceedings .
he also critic@@ ised the effective &quot; Ab@@ h@@ ak@@ controlled &quot; from the Sub@@ scrip@@ tions of the Rath@@ th@@ houses .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the Court of Tower Ham@@ lets from last year was a warning signal .
&quot; our country is known as the mother of parli@@ aments , a proud heritage , but the wor@@ rying and covered spread of elect@@ oral authorities and den@@ ial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot;
crazy about K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ dou@@ bl@@ ist and other famous double @-@ lon@@ ers from Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ ants in Rio
&quot; fans of the Olympi@@ ad in 2016 in Rio are this week over the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot , except the edge and band that has proven to be impressive viol@@ in@@ ist of the Du@@ chess in Cambridge . &quot;
&quot; but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olymp@@ ics this summer is by far not the only way of gold struggles , which has its own famous double @-@ go@@ ers - at least not when you have to believe the social media . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ our@@ ing the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces , which was used at the time on our screens , FE@@ MA@@ IL has created a lists on Olympi@@ oni@@ ans , which have more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Dutch . &quot;
&quot; the hunter and the Wolf : team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ l@@ ison , left , is compared with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since his childhood . &quot;
&quot; besides K@@ ates dou@@ bl@@ ist on the bike track , many people on the internet are referred to as a certain arch@@ ery of the Gem@@ ini of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio . &quot;
&quot; the team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ l@@ ison has caused a ons@@ lau@@ ght on Twitter after pictures , on which he looks like the Wolf of Wall Street Star un@@ cann@@ y . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the arch@@ ness was given the mad@@ ness in the social media with and gave it to hear that he has already been hearing since his childhood he looks like Leo . &quot;
&quot; I see no major simil@@ arity , except the facial hair , shared Bra@@ dy of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot;
&quot; he is a well @-@ looking guy , so I feel that probably as a compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be at the center : the emerging simil@@ arity between the British fo@@ yer Greg Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Har@@ ris .
the Russian Tur@@ ner@@ in Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with its large , expres@@ sive eyes shall be able to go through a dou@@ bl@@ in@@ ist for the Cub@@ an American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an . &quot;

&quot; a gear higher : this user is the view that Nathan is the &quot; &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor &quot;
another affection@@ ate comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ &apos;s who has similarly heavy eyebrows and lips .
&quot; the Russian silver medalli@@ ons Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ f@@ im@@ ova points out more than just the sun @-@ bent skin and bl@@ on@@ ha@@ irs as the actress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ Cord , while the American Nathan was att@@ ested by Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;

not the only : a Twitter user was very happy about that others have also liked the similar@@ ities .
theory placed in the room : according to this user there is perhaps a reason for the simil@@ arity of the pair .
&quot; a Twitter @-@ User@@ in declared their satisfaction , that &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer car@@ penter are almost identical . &quot;

Byr@@ on Mac@@ Donald &apos;s criticism was quickly and hard on Twitter when asked him many of them .

&quot; it was an un@@ happy chosen form@@ ulation , sorry that it is happening . &quot;
C@@ BC exc@@ ised himself at the end of over 90 times in the people who responded to the crew of Twitter
the comment@@ ator Scott Rus@@ sel had to ap@@ ologi@@ zed on behalf of Mac@@ Donald
C@@ BC copied and added his exc@@ use at more than 90 other Twitter users who had compl@@ ained about the comments of Mac@@ Donald
the network also ap@@ olog@@ ised too fast and gave out a message .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we regret that these statements have been made and that it was enabled to broadcast it . &quot;
we were able to ap@@ ologi@@ ze our spect@@ ators yesterday night with our spect@@ ators in the social media .
&quot; to clarify one , Byr@@ on &apos;s comments related to the performance of the swimming pool and not to them as a person . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , they were inadequate and an un@@ happy wor@@ ding . Byr@@ on does what he said is very sorry . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday morning , Mac@@ Donald in the show and tried to just@@ ify his observation by saying that it was not his intention that it was designed to be a personal attack . &quot;
&quot; I would like to take a moment to me for the comment which I made for the women &apos;s te@@ em@@ ing in the C@@ BC Olymp@@ ics , he said . &quot;
&quot; I have applied to the performance of the swimming pool , and not to them as a person . &quot;
&quot; of course , no dis@@ regard was intended and I am sorry . &quot;
buyer in Pri@@ mark emp@@ ower over woman who was in the middle of the shop sham@@ eless under@@ wear
the buyer did not know where to see where to see her clothes when a woman went out in the midst of a pri@@ ming to stop sau@@ ces .
&quot; in order to con@@ du@@ red the situation , it insp@@ ires as it looked at it , she moved out and laid them back into the shelf . &quot;
&quot; she went on and tried four pairs of shelter in a shop in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place mall in Folk@@ estone , on . &quot;
&quot; the Pri@@ mark Business in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Mall in Folk@@ estone , in which the woman tried the sau@@ ces before they put them back into the shelf . &quot;
&quot; a mother of two children , Jenny Davi@@ d@@ son who was at the same time in the store , said that after the mysterious woman had tried the under@@ wear , &quot; she left again and left the business without having something to buy . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; people could not believe what they saw . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the out@@ let , they took a pair of sau@@ ces from the out@@ lining , its own sus@@ pen@@ ders and pants , and tasted them . &quot;
&quot; she did not even tried to find a somewhat discreet place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; each rigi@@ d when she returned to the he@@ ap that you obviously didn &apos;t like , because they put them back into the shelf . &quot;
&quot; it would be repeated the same with three other sub @-@ pants before they finally decided that their nothing fell , and again and r@@ aus@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; it does not seem to distur@@ b it , that someone ob@@ serves - or to think about the person who would buy the sau@@ ces who had tried them tried . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Davi@@ d@@ son , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; how hard to think that someone had to take home with a different person and that were not washed away . &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; Mr Davi@@ d@@ son added : &quot; as I have received , the employees have tried to pull the garments from the sale after she went - what is just as good . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;d hate , go home with a new couple of under@@ pants to go home and find out that another woman had them away and returned , and they were not washed away . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ man of Pri@@ mark said : &quot; Pri@@ mark is the incident , which occurred on Tuesday , August 9 in our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot;

how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a before ce@@ as@@ parag@@ us
&quot; the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of D@@ ail@@ y@@ mail.com could make it safer for you . &quot;
&quot; we spoke with Rh@@ one Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a grand@@ master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Ver@@ ban@@ des in New York to find out how to walk with armed inc@@ ense . &quot;
&quot; regardless of whether you are approaching your front or from the back , this video will show you how you turn it out for your rob@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; if you turn out from the back , then you should see yourself as one side , so you can see your att@@ acker , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
grab the weapon then between your front arm and your shoulder before you hit him with your free el@@ bow .
&quot; hit him so@@ then with the knee , and rot@@ ate you while the ag@@ gres@@ s@@ ander coll@@ ap@@ sed before pain , the weapon out of his hands . beat him with the run into the face and move back@@ wards while they set the weapon upon him . &quot;
&quot; with att@@ ackers that approach the technique is similar - move your body from the line , take the weapon and rot@@ ate it , so that the att@@ acker cannot shoot . &quot;
&quot; once you shift the weight on the gun and beat the att@@ acker on the chest , then turn the weapon out of his grip before they move back@@ wards and put the weapon on him . &quot;
sounds difficult ?
&quot; watch the video , to see exactly how it goes to Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
&quot; but remember that there is a pre@@ y at the saf@@ est , your money enough - if you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ masters . &quot;
Reis@@ er Ian Wright sch@@ gi@@ fted for a guide his tongue to the dirty places of Europe
a British trav@@ eller under@@ gone his immune system and Wür@@ ger@@ ef@@ lex in a serious review - by put some of the dirty and ec@@ ar@@ est places of Europe .
&quot; the moder@@ ator and travel @-@ author Ian Wright , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k picked up his course on a euro strip , a rail@@ man on Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a dishwasher of a train toil@@ ette as well as a public phone in Russia to provide the resistance of his immune system . &quot;
&quot; before the dist@@ rac@@ tions of each object , it used a lumin@@ ometer to show themselves and to show us on what he will get . &quot;
&quot; but the experiment , which was fil@@ med under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; brought some surprising results to the day@@ light . &quot;
&quot; the thought , the dishwasher of a train toil@@ ette , which has already been used by thousands of others , may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive but actually there are in a kitchenette more bad bacteria . &quot;
on his journey through Europe Mr. Wright with doctors and medical experts talk about the promotion of intestinal bacteria as well as his own health .
&quot; fortunately nothing left , what he did , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth . &quot;
Mr. Wright was known to test the firm@@ ness of his intest@@ ine by travelled through the world and ate peculi@@ ar as well as wonderful things .
&quot; from public funds to train stations up to dishwasher of toilets , the task made his immune system definitely under a sample &quot;
&quot; in the film he told : &quot; already as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about what my health is concerned and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and s@@ amm@@ able water . &quot;
in the film he was definitely righteous in his reputation .
&quot; the only thing he abl@@ ished , was a dirty public toilet in Russia . &quot;
its commission @-@ line showed a half @-@ range of over 4000 units .
&quot; compared to this , the L@@ umin@@ ous number of fresh washed hands is less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; but there was a Russian toilet , which he refused to post@@ pon@@ ed , after its l@@ apse @-@ number over 4000 units was , while fresh washed hands a little less than 60 &quot;
Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of Milk Products Vali@@ o produced the Reis@@ ef@@ ile &apos; s Guide to In@@ ner Strength &apos; that shows the bacterial number of different places like the bathroom
&quot; in the film he says , &quot; This comes the worst , what I have to do in a toilet , close . &quot;
there is nothing scar@@ let than that !
I &apos;m going to do nothing here because it is here inside .
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , was produced in collaboration with Finnish producers of dairy products . &quot;
&quot; the company performs Mr. Wright with Val@@ ve Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains both Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ illi and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system . &quot;
validation Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories N@@ iko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we really wanted to offer the consumer something new . &quot;
something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time the benefits of pro@@ biot@@ ics .
&quot; we led crazy Bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming through , the so that we said , Let us call us Ian . &quot;
they claim that the interest in intestinal health is to a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of speaking about the products we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system . &quot;
the growing interest in the intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide more information on an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the direction of the film , added : &quot; &quot; let me say so - I had gotten my respect for Ian , if he had put some of the things that I have directed to him , just like the ek@@ el@@ ective Russian toil@@ ette that will be shown in the film . &quot;
&quot; of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to bring them , and others , with which this was quite difficult . &quot;
I am glad we recorded some of these dirty delicacies .
&quot; in one of vali@@ ant survey conducted by 2015 joined 84 per cent of all respon@@ dents , especially with the wellness of stomach and intest@@ ine and 58 percent said that they use at least occasionally products that included both Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us . &quot;

&quot; Donn@@ a Mc@@ Ev@@ oy , who works for the administration of Corn@@ wall Housing , said that they are afraid that the apartment is no longer repaired . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for people here and I believe that people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot;
there are many things to consider since this property is probably considered not as beautiful part of Corn@@ walls .
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is also .
&quot; the couple had three sons , who lived in the apartment , and the police told that the terror that had to put the family , inti@@ mid@@ ation , drug abuse , drug and excessive scre@@ ams , dispute and escape . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the le@@ ase contract , was given an order for anti @-@ civilian behaviour . &quot;

&quot; were in the property , in which in the past drugs were acted , the wood@@ winds b@@ lows . &quot;
neighbors said they saw them on the streets and regularly had to inv@@ oked the police regularly
Corn@@ wall Housing del@@ og@@ ged them and their partners this week for@@ ci@@ ent by the property after they gave them a prolonged period of 11 weeks to be voluntary .
&quot; the del@@ ights have been che@@ ered by facilit@@ ated neighbours , saying that their lives was made to hell . &quot;
&quot; one said from : &quot; &quot; you were talking about no one . &quot;
we lived 20 years apart from them and it was always bad .
&quot; the countless times , which we say the police here are incredible . &quot;
&quot; today , we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood on because it was so quiet - we are not used !
&quot; now , where they are finally gone , it will be nice . &quot;
&quot; Adam Fitz@@ patri@@ ck , Neigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager from Corn@@ wall Housing , said that it would not have the family to cooperate with local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house where the police was launched at regular intervals , 20 years . &quot;
&quot; on the over@@ grown side of the comm@@ its , tr@@ ash and old toys have been thrown down . &quot;
he added : &quot; it is a shame that there was the ten@@ ant to adopt any responsibility for their behavior and their family because a del@@ og@@ ation is always the last step to take into consideration the Corn@@ wall Housing .
&quot; this was a very difficult case , because the behavior was extremely difficult and their actions had to be terrible to their neighbours . &quot;
&quot; I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the community who have had to contact us and have provided us the information provided . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that this development will strike some neighbors , and the message affir@@ ming that anti @-@ civilian behaviour will not be toler@@ ated . &quot;

&quot; they said that the money was a tom@@ b@@ stone of her son Lee skel@@ et@@ don , who came to life in 2013 with an auto@@ accident . &quot;
&quot; after they were without shelter , it will assume that T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh . &quot;
many part@@ itions of the house were gra@@ ff@@ ed with gra@@ ffiti .
police says that they are ten@@ ant to hold ten@@ ant who do not hold at the house@@ keeping
Angela C@@ row from the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall shared that the dolph@@ ins have a clear warning to the other ten@@ ant who do not stand at the house@@ keeping .

Mecklenburg @-@ Vor@@ pomm@@ ern : &quot; go where it hur@@ ts
stran@@ ger Mecklenburg @-@ Vor@@ pomm@@ ern : the locals get nothing from the summer @-@ election campaign with - and the vac@@ ation@@ ers from North Rhine @-@ West@@ phal@@ ia are not allowed to choose the farm .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vor@@ pomm@@ ern they understood .
&quot; the elections will not come back directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ iner Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; as far as before , it is not : summer holidays , heat and land @-@ day campaign - this is both . &quot;
&quot; the locals , who are supposed to be convinced by the elect@@ oral campaigns are on vacation . &quot;
&quot; most of the tourists who are in the country are on Us@@ edom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not locals , so they are not allowed to choose the farm . &quot;
&quot; these are practical problems : in the holidays are hel@@ pers who attach plac@@ ards , bal@@ lo@@ ons , leaf@@ lets and end up voices at the end of the vote , just m@@ ills . &quot;
&quot; until 4 September 2016 , the elect@@ oral and final Fer@@ i@@ ent@@ ag , Mecklenburg @-@ Vor@@ pomm@@ ern has to be reached by the people in Mecklenburg @-@ West Pom@@ er@@ ania . &quot;
&quot; the hot phase , if one can say that at all , has just begun . &quot;
&quot; and it is also about something : Prime Minister Erwin Sell@@ ering , leader of the SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must be afraid of his ministry . &quot;
&quot; SPD , since 1998 the strongest party , is now in surveys behind the CD@@ U . &quot;
thr@@ illing is thr@@ illing as strong Ne@@ ul@@ ing Af@@ D cuts and what remains at the end of the coalition .
&quot; Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 head of government , makes an almost un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive campaign , can be seen from his grand@@ parents . &quot;
&quot; he travels through the land , distributed , ros@@ es and plau@@ sible a little with the people , as well as his legendary verb@@ t@@ kar@@ ger predecessor Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , sailors got cold feet and gives ch@@ anc@@ ellor Merkel to blame for the flo@@ wering of the Af@@ D . &quot;
&quot; your refuge@@ e policy , you &quot; &quot; We create the &quot; &quot; have acceler@@ ated the rise of justice , which is now likely to cost him the beautiful office . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U with their Spitz@@ enk@@ andi@@ dates , the Interior , Lor@@ enz Man@@ aff@@ ier , has experienced how to make the wrong time at the right place of the campaign . &quot;
she invited two ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel to major issues ; Merkel Bun@@ dest@@ ag@@ ile is located in the north @-@ east .
&quot; but the target group did not agree , there were more Nord@@ rhein @-@ Westfalen , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg @-@ burger and Vor@@ pomm@@ ern . &quot;
&quot; that was probably the majority of other Länder , &quot; compl@@ ained Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vor@@ pomm@@ ern , recently in the N@@ DR . &quot;
&quot; but it was a p@@ ity also to hear anybody from other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel can hear . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , the North @-@ CD@@ U leaves largely to the usual elect@@ oral campaign on market grounds and in front of shopping m@@ alls with umbre@@ llas and bal@@ lo@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; so , coconut , plays only a &quot; &quot; minor role &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; also the union also has noticed that you must take away the base , that it must be very vulnerable to the people again , again a wire to the people . &quot;
&quot; you are just like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : in the countryside of the country barely exist . &quot;
&quot; the Council of the CD@@ U @-@ Wahl@@ ers Kok@@ ert is also self @-@ reve@@ aling : &quot; you have to go to where it is doing , namely where men are : Dor@@ ff@@ est , Golden weddings , every birthday party needs to be used . &quot;
&quot; because a lot on the game stands , Sell@@ ering has now called its SPD a particularly committed campaign . &quot;
&quot; in surveys , the Socialists and Democrats also last with 22 percent behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just under the Af@@ D ( 19 ) . &quot;
in the election of 2011 the SPD was still clear with 35.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
&quot; the Gre@@ ens , small part@@ ei with seven percent in the poll@@ s , sc@@ ents the jump into the land &apos;s day . &quot;
they make a modern vir@@ tue of a modern vir@@ tue and abandoned her campaigns in the internet .
&quot; online campaign , &quot; he calls the President Claudia Müller . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , green elect@@ or@@ ers go on Sp@@ ur@@ ensu@@ ites to local stimul@@ ates among the vac@@ ations . &quot;
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ jek , the Spitz@@ enk@@ andi@@ dat@@ in , kur@@ t straight with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the m@@ ec@@ kl@@ en@@ burg@@ ische lakes and finds it also nice . &quot;
their impression : &quot; voting in Mecklenburg @-@ Vor@@ pomm@@ ern is not punishment . &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ San@@ ation : restaurants suffer from pl@@ ywood
&quot; in the speed , with which the B 27 is gentle , there is nothing to complain . &quot;
&quot; for those responsible of the construction work , which begin at 5.@@ 30 in the morning and at the end of the end of the clock , there is always enth@@ om@@ al@@ able praise . &quot;
&quot; they have done everything quite jag@@ ged , &quot; tells El@@ vir@@ a T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff of the Jet @-@ Tank@@ stelle . &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is no delay .
the job@@ site could be moved to the south at the semi@@ o @-@ time to the south end until the end of October will be all ready .
&quot; the compensation will also be responsible for the construction work , for example when it comes to the establishment of containers . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site on Monday to the south , and also the block@@ ing of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ f@@ ter@@ dingen has been removed and thus the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg has come back , the traffic situation is relaxed within the place . &quot;
the citizens are now able to drive from O@@ f@@ ter@@ dingen from the B 27 again .
the traffic @-@ traffic through the place seems to be back .
&quot; there was partly significant complaints , &quot; says the main @-@ technical management of the San@@ ation @-@ appointed Executive Director Florian King . &quot;
&quot; the residents of Bach@@ el@@ straße , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ n@@ erstraße , and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many shades sought and more likely to trust their Nav@@ i than the sign@@ posting . &quot;
what led to that there are some trucks in residential areas .
&quot; since the speed limit@@ ing have not been respected , the municipality has strengthened the vehicle &apos;s vehicle from M@@ ös@@ sing . &quot;
&quot; there was considerable exagger@@ ation , &quot; says King , who made himself a place on the location . &quot;
two to three per minute has been repaired .
the fastest was at the pace @-@ 30 @-@ zone in the speed @-@ 30 zone .
&quot; since the site has moved on , but it has become more quiet . &quot;
for busin@@ ess@@ men at the B 27 there is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg now the road is open again .
in the cards we don &apos;t like to have a look at busin@@ ess@@ men .
&quot; but that the B 27 @-@ sani has led to them in sales , everybody lets you see . &quot;
&quot; however , some more and some less affected . &quot;
&quot; who has nothing to do with the &quot; &quot; end users &quot; &quot; so for other companies , the San@@ ation has no consequences . &quot;
&quot; also in the deal@@ ership Ma@@ ier , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; most light decrease , &quot; but also one that naturally &quot; the drive will be missing . &quot;
the strongest explo@@ res are the restaurants along the road .
&quot; J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly the crown , finds clear words . &quot;
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; not just him , but all the restaurants I met &quot; &quot; hard &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; missing the customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil . &quot;
we need to be glad about every Euro turnover .
sales design@@ ates in &quot; far more than 50 percent . &quot;
the road of road have thrown its operation &quot; for two years . &quot;
half of his employees have to be released .
&quot; if I had a company with 4000 employees , and half would have been released , politics would have responded differently . &quot;
&quot; instead , government President Jörg Schmidt on a request of g@@ öh@@ ner could give if there would be a financial compensation with the reference of the situation at the B 27 . now it is also the draw@@ backs that arise through the renovation . &quot;
g@@ öh@@ ner knows of other land@@ circles where such a kind of funding has been handled .
&quot; in all cl@@ agen , g@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his private place will continue . &quot;
&quot; after all , the family run has been here since 17@@ 15 , he refers to the long history . &quot;
&quot; other reg@@ ulars are now being able to understand more often because of the complex transport system , he can understand . &quot;
&quot; if one cannot go down , it is also different . &quot;
&quot; that his root cli@@ ent@@ el will come back after the end of the san@@ itation , there is no doubt about it . &quot;
&quot; despite the crises with B@@ SE and bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the effects of the B 27 construction working on its customers for the biggest crisis that has experienced its guest house in their long @-@ standing history . &quot;
&quot; six months of construction , this is already brutal . &quot;
&quot; constantly , the name of terror@@ ist control is constantly being screw@@ ed on behalf of the terror@@ ist control . &quot;
&quot; after the recent attacks in the Minister de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , now a thicker security package . &quot;
but what has a slideshow to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partners say to all this ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the reconciliation .
&quot; all his proposals were politically reasonable , &quot; says the Federal Minister for the presentation of his new vulner@@ abilities . &quot;
they do not demand any anyone .
&quot; others , further points would first be discussed within the parties . &quot;
even in this part I beg@@ ged me .
&quot; as an internal minister he was on the results , and on a &quot; &quot; achieved consensus &quot; &quot; within the Coalition . &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère presented a little time after the recent attacks in Würz@@ burg and Ans@@ bach , before he presents his conclusions for the safety of the Republic . &quot;
the fall now is all the more extensive .
&quot; some is known , announced , un@@ hur@@ ries , that a new security authority is to take care of the button of encrypted communication is not new . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also , it is not the fact that Germany must put multiple EU guidelines on air@@ planes and weapons . &quot;
the call for more video surveillance and staff for safety authorities are also not surprising .
&quot; partly , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère have not been a second attempt for suggestions , who have not been to do with the SPD : he wants to put their sympath@@ ies for terraces under punishment , and jiha@@ dists with double citizenship by the German passport . &quot;
&quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; the CD@@ U @-@ man is . &quot;
&quot; however , he nonetheless hold this for reasonable and certainly nothing , what has no chances for the co@@ effic@@ acy . &quot;
a few new ideas presents de Ma@@ izi@@ ère .
these have partly in itself : it plans quick @-@ time planning for deport@@ ations and more opportunities for det@@ ention of people in front of deport@@ ations .
refugees who are targeted to the country should be transferred to their smartphones in advance and to open social media accounts for a safety pre @-@ examination .
&quot; for stimul@@ ating asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to put some even worse than before - such as such , off@@ ences or their papers are aware of wor@@ sen@@ ing their identity . &quot;
some of them is politically and legally heated .
&quot; man@@ ches also seems to be un@@ balanced , and leaves questions open . &quot;
and with some points - in the im@@ treatment of Ged@@ i for example - the question arises : what does this really have to do with security and terror ?
&quot; yes , says de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the issues of refugees and terror . &quot;
&quot; but it cannot be put into departure , that the ass@@ ass@@ inations of Ans@@ bach and Würz@@ burg Refu@@ ge@@ es were . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , many people were worried about the high level of refugees concerned about safety . &quot;
&quot; and things that the people displ@@ ac@@ ulate , now they are not allowed to hide in election . &quot;
the inner security is enormous in the focus .
&quot; the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in Würz@@ burg and Ans@@ bach .
the insurance is great .
&quot; and yes , there are elect@@ oral campaigns . &quot;
the Union and SPD can therefore become increasingly important in the subject of inner security .
in the past few days it went up between the two parties .
&quot; only a gar@@ rison argument about the equipment of the federal police , then on a safety @-@ policy ideas collection of some Uni@@ ons Interior , in which the re@@ efs also call a bur@@ ka ban and a revers@@ al of double citizenship . &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is also here to con@@ cili@@ atory sounds .
from a revers@@ al from the double pass he will keep nothing .
we have been the discussion in Germany .
&quot; they are new to make , be not useful . &quot;
and with a Bur@@ ka ban he has constitutional concerns .
&quot; whether its own package is constitutional at all corners and whether it is actually &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; for the co@@ al@@ ition@@ ist , must not yet show itself . &quot;
there is a lot of stuff in what to worry about .
&quot; however , the SPD is currently trying to pro@@ filed himself on the subject of inner security . &quot;
&quot; Sig@@ mar Gabriel is just rated as careful convers@@ ing , saying , &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to increasing safety . &quot;
even Volkswagen gli@@ ders comes through .
&quot; despite diesel sc@@ and@@ als , the deliveries pay worldwide . &quot;
but not in all markets there is about .
during the action there is verteb@@ ra@@ e for a term .
Volkswagen starts with the deliveries in the second half @-@ year .
&quot; Europe &apos;s biggest motor@@ bikes , in the previous year , in spite of the diesel affair , thanks to its many brands and some well @-@ run markets further a plus . &quot;
&quot; however , in July weak@@ ening the core brand VW mainly in Western Europe and stressed the overall sales , such as that in the D@@ ax was recorded in the D@@ ax . &quot;
&quot; worldwide , the VW is sold in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars 1,8 per cent less vehicles than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; in Western Europe , after China the second most important market , the sales of 14 percent were under the previous year . &quot;
&quot; in the home market of Germany , the ship@@ ments around almost a six @-@ six@@ es . &quot;
Mark@@ enver@@ tri@@ eb@@ ef Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann introduced the weak@@ est numbers from July mainly on two sales @-@ days less in Europe .
&quot; in addition , I have given it back in some core markets by &quot; changing economic framework &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey as well as the British V@@ ot@@ um exp@@ ulsion from the EU , he explained a spokes@@ person . &quot;
&quot; in the US , where the gas station first escal@@ ated , is also further a min@@ us to be@@ ech . &quot;
large stands for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; in total , the mainly affected Hau@@ smar@@ ke of the Nieder@@ s@@ achsen will be further gli@@ mmer by the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , there is only a supplier of 0.4 percent to 3,@@ 37 million vehicles to Bu@@ che . &quot;
consolidated Fred Cap@@ pler was able to introduce a sales network from January to July .
&quot; 1.3 percent more vehicles delivered Volkswagen in this period , worldwide 5,@@ 904 million . &quot;
Volkswagen had manip@@ ulated a software to software with a software .
he is calling for VW around 2.5 million cars for upgra@@ ding to the workshops .
&quot; in the course of retro@@ fit , VW confirmed that the re@@ modeling of the cars has no negative effects . &quot;
&quot; after upgra@@ ding the vehicles there are fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance without any deteri@@ oration . &quot;
&quot; the motor@@ bikes present the customer after upgra@@ ding a &quot; guaranteed &quot; certificate , but not of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was on Friday in the company . &quot;
&quot; reason , legal en@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; Focus &quot; reports , Volkswagen water pipes its German customers now has a guarantee for the diesel models . &quot;
this could have confirmed on the last Monday VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Education .
the transport of the Ministry was confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; VW has to fulfil the requirements of my investig@@ ative Commission , and the KBA task . &quot;
&quot; devi@@ ations are not accepted , &quot; declared Federal Minister Alexander Dob@@ r@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot;
&quot; VW has adopted the guarantee that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance after the retro@@ fitting will have no deteri@@ or@@ ations and all type @-@ approved vehicle values remain unchanged . &quot;
&quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; but not how it was called in the company . &quot;
&quot; when the wide term &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; provides Volkswagen to allow customers for example a half year after the retro@@ fitting for approximately with a motor @-@ harm to a workshop - and this can lead to the new software even if the damage does not have anything to do with it . &quot;
&quot; even in customer interest , it is important to avoid that with any other damage , which does not have nothing to do with the bug@@ ging sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; therefore , VW use the term &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; . &quot; &quot;
Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enbank G@@ mund to T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands from rich austerity in the future - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; it is only about 139 customers who park 40 million Euros to Gi@@ ro@@ - or daily tours . &quot;
&quot; the Bundes@@ verband German banks is talking about an individual case and does not consider a signal , normal austerity must not be feared to pay for their austerity . &quot;
&quot; storage banks money by night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay its 0.6 percent criminal . &quot;
&quot; this charge requires the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enbank G@@ mund from September of individuals and corporate clients for deposits over 100,000 euros on pl@@ aster or day@@ time accounts . &quot;
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 costs will take charge of 400 euros in the year , &quot; said Paul . &quot;
he laid up 40 million Euros that could be raised from one day on the other and that he cannot be uti@@ lized .
&quot; they are at me on the central bank account and cause 0,@@ 4 percent costs , &quot; &quot; said the bank chief . &quot;
&quot; I cannot place for every million 4000 Euro . &quot;
the cost increases it after the caus@@ ality of the principle .
&quot; the cash is simply to leave in the v@@ aul@@ ts of the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enbank , would be much too dangerous : &quot; &quot; I have experienced four accidents , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! &quot; &quot; said the ban@@ ker standing . &quot;
most customers have had an understanding and changes to other systems .
only a few hi@@ ked to other banks .
&quot; the co@@ operative role of Bavaria explained , &quot; &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the ECB causes significant costs in all banks . &quot;
&quot; they alone wear , be &quot; &quot; economically permanently not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some German banks therefore have increased their fees for accounts , credit cards or transitions . &quot;
&quot; with criminal investment for deposits from three million euros had the Thur@@ ing@@ ian folk and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enbank , Alten@@ burger Land . &quot;
&quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , chief executive leader of the ban@@ en@@ verb@@ und , said : &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t expect to pay a large @-@ wide range of responsibility for deposits , this is the competition in Germany among banks and saving banks much too strong . &quot;
&quot; a ban@@ ker said , at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; a client , which is prepared by the property a little lush . &quot;
&quot; this can be a little bank for a little bank , &quot; if it is free for free money . &quot;
&quot; the 1911 Con@@ sci@@ ut@@ s@@ bank G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , R@@ ott@@ ach @-@ E@@ ber , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot;
&quot; the area is known as well known actor , athletes and entrepreneurs . &quot;
&quot; the co @-@ operative Bavaria &quot; &quot; Bayern &quot; &quot; are currently not known to further banks that charge an out@@ set for deposits of individuals , &quot; said narr@@ ator Ernst . &quot;
&quot; the President of the Federal Association of German People &apos;s Association and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enb@@ aum ( Bv@@ R ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared the thresh@@ old to go towards the Neg@@ ative , is very , very high . &quot;
&quot; competition is tough , and it threat@@ ens the migration of anch@@ oring to competition . &quot;
the customers in Germany will not have fallen in the width .
destination plates : who does not buy sound plates ?
lonely men middle age love records .
&quot; before you go to the comment section , to so@@ w him under the pseud@@ onym of non @-@ lack of men with r@@ ins@@ ults , this statement is derived from the current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the multip@@ lication of sound @-@ plates do not want to welcome on a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als who want to welcome the novel@@ ty of physical objects but to mid@@ life nost@@ algia . &quot;
those who have recently bought a record are all fo@@ resi@@ ght after the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely kid group .
&quot; it is also not a hor@@ des through hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older sheet @-@ players keep their feelings more likely to spend ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it , alone time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) . &quot;
but do the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
&quot; if this blog would be a news report on TV , I would follow me the camera while in the midst of a busy road in Soh@@ o &apos;s walk , a humble way I consider , my hands hold and something to say like : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
&quot; so , let us take a look at it . &quot;
&quot; even if the heart is slowly moving to its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent seller is located - there are still a hand@@ ful of fantastic record . &quot;
&quot; I would probably ask the c@@ amer@@ aman , to turn the camera to the next part in which I am standing in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind through observation . &quot;
&quot; Stuart Tank from Glasgow , 55 , whom I am from S@@ ister Ray ( Data atten@@ de@@ es : eight men aged men ) into the Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( Data atten@@ de@@ es : eight men middle age ) , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is a day long because of a meeting in London and passes through the shops to fill the few hours . &quot;
is he a collectors I ask ?
&quot; I already appreciate , &quot; says he . &quot;
&quot; I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates . &quot;
&quot; this sound@@ boards , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I am not followed to him ) , dress the walls of his sitting room . &quot;
&quot; the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles , the result of his available income : he is now able to buy plates when they appeared and again buy objects that he sold , when he was young and pl@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; many things I buy , are from the late six@@ ties , early 70s who appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things , where I probably was too young to buy them , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; he is true that those who buy plates , more intro@@ ver@@ ted and would like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I drink not very much . &quot;
this is my L@@ aster .
&quot; WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with S@@ ister Ray , believes that many customers who meet , to meet the You@@ Go@@ v profile . &quot;
&quot; however , he has also noticed a new wave of people who have influenced by the media of the media , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and causes you to buy their old records again . &quot;
&quot; from the talks I have led , people usually have emp@@ tied in 1998 or 1999 of their collection . &quot;
&quot; customers who once bought their records in order to buy CDs , sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says . &quot;
this would explain the boom to the tow@@ ing of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates ?
it takes only a few seconds in a shop like Ph@@ onica to recognize that record stores a soothing community of equ@@ als .
&quot; according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers participated in the contact@@ less payment system . &quot;
some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and would like to withdraw to the stability of familiar sound @-@ plate lin@@ ens of objects to alert the happ@@ ine@@ eship .
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the col@@ t of a void or possession of the pos@@ sessions as a kind of con@@ sol@@ ation , &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot;
this is as collectors I am so and I think it is so in many people .
it is a simple way to employ spiritu@@ ally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social worker ! &quot; &quot; we have a staff of a record @-@ p@@ ile . &quot;
&quot; a survey of the IC@@ M in April un@@ veil@@ ed that nearly 50 % of the people , the last month have bought a record , they have not yet heard . &quot;
&quot; the survey also found out that 41 % have a record player that they never use , while 7 % of those who buy one plate , do not own record players . &quot;
&quot; at this time of the news report , I would probably look very concerned while I bl@@ oss@@ oms through a p@@ ile of Bos@@ sa Nova Com@@ il@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( Data : three men middle ages ) has noticed a &quot; &quot; tro@@ phy &quot; &quot; of the prec@@ inct . &quot;
&quot; someone recently came here purely and said , &quot; I have never got a record player , but I would like to buy a radi@@ ost@@ ead record , so that I can put it into the shelf , &quot;
&quot; this is not a big percentage , but it is definitely happening . &quot;
more products @-@ last@@ y , less musi@@ cl@@ ast@@ ig . &quot;
&quot; we have people who say , &quot; I have no turn@@ table . &quot;
&quot; these are younger people , not older , who only slowly come . &quot;
&quot; F@@ op@@ p , which has almost a whole floor , has a b@@ lower audience when I follow . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ ager and women middle ages . &quot;
&quot; even if the atmosphere is a little less relaxed than in the af@@ ore@@ mentioned stores , Wild Be@@ asts neu@@ ester Syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ er- and sex@@ ed Pop instead of experimental jazz and acc@@ ust@@ omed from the loud@@ speakers - it is good to see such diversity among customers . &quot;
&quot; neither of them sees peculi@@ ar@@ ingly lonely , but nag@@ ging psych@@ ic trau@@ mas are difficult to be adjustable if one stands next to someone over 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , runs around in the store for some minutes and looks at the vari@@ et@@ aker of sale . &quot;
it is more likely to make a man@@ nequ@@ in than a big one .
&quot; it does not deserve a lot , so the collection of records is not a real option , says it . &quot;
it costs much .
&quot; it is easy to hear music from a computer or other way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; it drives with a loving sig@@ h . &quot;
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it really is unique .
&quot; my last stop is a business , which is said to have inspired a new generation of turn@@ around : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; as I give the vou@@ cher to sample the je@@ ans hot@@ spots that group for a moment about Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras , before a father and his daughter is superior to buy a cro@@ sl@@ ey turn@@ tables . &quot;
&quot; on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of plates of Adel@@ e , Jeff Bu@@ ckl@@ ey , Amy Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mix of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection . &quot;

French Court decl@@ ined by demol@@ ition of shops in the jungle refuge@@ e camp
&quot; French Court has rejected an offer of the authorities in Calais , do@@ z@@ ens of pro@@ visional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais , living in the thousands of refugees . &quot;
&quot; in a court proceedings this week argu@@ ed the authorities in Calais that the state should be entitled to sell 72 pro@@ visional Shops to sell , hairdres@@ sing services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 P@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in pro@@ visional restaurants . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ fecture of Calais are argu@@ ed that these places should be lower , because they would pay a parallel economy out of which no taxes would be paid and which is a fire and san@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; humanitarian groups divided the court that stores and restaurants are important , as the free meals offered by state supported union and other groups , not enough food for the growing numbers in the camp . &quot;
they led beyond that the pro@@ visional stores and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; a court in Lille decided that there were no legal basis for the transfer of people who were to operate the 72 pro@@ visional business , but the concern of the pre@@ fecture of Calais are absolutely comprehen@@ sible . &quot;
&quot; the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that the grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than just people feed , which live in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas are quiet meeting between refugees and volunteers .
&quot; one of the places that was threatened by the Nieder@@ re@@ issen , the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café des camp , the community @-@ n@@ avy is operated and 200 meals a day , Engl@@ ish@@ - and French @-@ speaking classes as well as advice on Asyl@@ um , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot;
&quot; more than 17@@ 0,000 people have signed the pet@@ ition to keep the Kids &apos; café . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was that the closure of this children would be a disaster of which the most recent eight years are old . &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement Trailer
&quot; Germany Ras@@ er have to set up on the next generation of speed : in different federal states , among other things in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash devices have tested particularly effectively . &quot;
&quot; the futur@@ istic acting entry trailer of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden , can be used for example at random points , where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police . &quot;
&quot; for example , on highway construction or to soft bridges with a temporary Tem@@ po@@ p there are often no necessary infrastructure to ensure there with a stationary flo@@ itzer for compliance with speed bum@@ ps . &quot;
but a permanent mobili@@ z@@ able construction can be too dangerous or time @-@ consuming .
the En@@ forcement Trailer is aut@@ ark : his battery holds five days with un@@ interrupted measuring operation five days and the pit@@ falls are encrypted via a mo@@ dem .
&quot; with laser measurement technology , all cars can also be recorded across several tracks at the same time . &quot;
&quot; variable speed limit@@ ing , as well as search for time , cycling and vehicle class can also be monitored . &quot;
&quot; in the high @-@ run condition , one can move the p@@ endant according to manufacturers with each car with tags . &quot;
&quot; in order that it is not easy to cl@@ oned , he is reduced in the trade fair , so that the wheels van@@ ished in the upholster@@ ed and by the way also incl@@ uss@@ ed aliens . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system is to protect the blo@@ wers before v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
since 2015 the trailer was tested by Vit@@ ronic in different federal states and is now used by now .
&quot; foreign authorities flo@@ ating with the new technique : younger , France has won 100 pieces by post , after an order of 150 pieces last year . &quot;
&quot; Britain led silver in the 7 @-@ er Rug@@ by , after Fiji master@@ class Gold dated &quot;
&quot; the impressive performance of Britain at the 7 @-@ er Rug@@ by came in the finals on Thursday evening to a ab@@ rupt stop at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were be@@ aten by a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the De@@ al Stadium in Rio . &quot;
&quot; Fiji is a master class in handling , side @-@ step@@ ping , after@@ ward , line circulation and ro@@ her power to gain gold - her first Olymp@@ ics of any color . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was struck by the not too bad tro@@ ugh price of the silver medal - of Great Britain on this day - and they were able to take pride in this tournament in which they sm@@ ote New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the distinct defeat of the bow , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ finals on the same day could be attributed to them in the finals . &quot;
&quot; but independently of this , Fiji on this form could have been a 15 @-@ man team in order . &quot;
it could be a con@@ sol@@ ation for GB - but it will probably not - that at least one Br@@ ite tomorrow will hang out a gold medal around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is chef Ben Ryan , the former Chef for England from Wim@@ bl@@ edon . &quot;
GB had a difficult path behind them .
eight years ago she lost under Ryan every game at Adelaide Sev@@ ens .
&quot; here , they lost only one . &quot;
&quot; this fl@@ ap is sore , but progress is ast@@ o@@ unding . &quot;
&quot; Fiji was wonder@@ full and left the GB@@ s of fun finish . &quot;
&quot; it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co . , when one would run into driving buses . the World Series winner went 5 @-@ 0 to the top , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au went down in the corner . &quot;
&quot; with even four minutes , Jerry Tu@@ w@@ ai added another attack from the right corner , which he turned . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly has the ball .
&quot; a pro @-@ president T@@ ackle of Mitchell stopped the mountain of Mann Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa , a third gate to achieve , but it has kept Fiji only stopped . &quot;
in the seventh minute l@@ ete j@@ asa ent@@ angl@@ ua in the right corner a tou@@ ch@@ down and it was 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the re @-@ run and there was still more than a minute playing time ... in the first half .
Vat@@ emo Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pre@@ ached by further weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB team and stor@@ med up to line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to break .
&quot; it is so , as if Fiji was born to play the 7 , while GB still p@@ itted . &quot;
this is how it is .
&quot; GB existed in fundamental changes to the half @-@ time , and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for all four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua went through Tu@@ is@@ ova after a brilliant inter@@ play of Fiji . &quot;
&quot; Dan N@@ ort@@ on started an attempt for GB , made a tou@@ ch@@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went long in favor of the Süd@@ se@@ ein@@ ate , whose fans sang , fl@@ ags fl@@ ags and d@@ anced on the ble@@ achers . &quot;
it was not hard to admire the playful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the i @-@ icing with another attempt in the last seconds .
&quot; the fi@@ ff contr@@ actor , the Fi@@ j@@ is re@@ ar@@ ming themselves and GB k@@ ick@@ ed be@@ aten in the lawn . &quot;
&quot; earlier on the day , Fiji Japan had defe@@ ated in the semi @-@ finals with 20 @-@ 5 , and the UK re@@ acted South Africa in a scar@@ ce half @-@ day match from the race - British conversion of the difference . &quot;
K@@ yle Brown brought the boats in the first half to the front but Dan N@@ ort@@ on broke the line with an impressive foot@@ work and achieved a gate among the post in the second half .
&quot; a brilliant late afternoon from Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ aside teams , secured the gain - and thus the silver medal . &quot;
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by battle with the cancer of the trainer
there will be no emot@@ iv@@ al@@ ous gold as with these games and that wants to be hot .
&quot; from the first gli@@ der until the last , 220 hard h@@ ieve , who go into history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; even if there were only those who were in the boat , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the Train@@ ers Robin Williams , was all present when they ru@@ sted to the second Olymp@@ ics in two without tax wife , the first women in the history of British Sports that was on such a scale . &quot;
&quot; your domin@@ ance was absolutely , as well as their watch@@ ful use , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant athletes that reflects the surface with the elegance of spon@@ ges , which does not reflect the type of Tri@@ om@@ it . &quot;
&quot; behind each gold in the ruin there is a batt@@ al@@ ion to consent to the incre@@ mental progress that did not know the difference and it was no one to survive as the coach , who would survive day at all when he was diagnosed with him cancer . &quot;
as he said he was ris@@ ky .
&quot; I had blow@@ job , the oper@@ able is and this did it . &quot;
&quot; if you do not do that , he spreads anywhere . &quot;
it would have been a very shy situation .
it changes a bit the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the Trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , could start out what the inter@@ ruption to a minimum was in case that in such circumstances the correct term is . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , so I had to go better again soon . &quot;
it was an incentive .
&quot; I was at the hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they told that some steps would satisfy . &quot;
this is how it starts .
&quot; rowing at itself is already a challenge , but that makes it an even larger . &quot;
&quot; in the in@@ calcul@@ ability of the victory , their first thoughts on Williams , who spent a annoying morning to make a little more than usual and tried to work his own fears . &quot;
&quot; st@@ anning , which was as the captain in the Royal Ar@@ til@@ lery reg@@ iment in an application in Afghanistan , &quot; &quot; I was a emotional wre@@ ck . that &apos;s perhaps something extremely , but it means so much . &quot;
&quot; it is only repeated how much I mean , how much I and Helen and also Robin have worked . &quot;
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
&quot; without Robin , we would be no one , therefore a massive thank you to him . he is the best coach in the world . &quot;
I could not have wished for a better person to coach or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have no race in the last five years .
the pair had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up with them .
&quot; even in the last 500 meters , when the teams started up from New Zealand and Denmark , st@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve . &quot;
we were very at the moment im@@ pris@@ oned .
&quot; Helen called &quot; &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important to not get t@@ ear .
&quot; we had a good start and at the same time , we didn &apos;t want to make a bit more difficult . &quot;
&quot; today we didn &apos;t want a fire@@ works , we just wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race what we did . &quot;
the pair will take a break for a year before making decisions about his future .
&quot; Glo@@ ver must appear next week at a wedding , their own with the TV advent@@ ur@@ ers Steve Back@@ shall . &quot;
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I did not want to say that that was my last race .
this would have too much pressure .
&quot; in London it took about six months , to conc@@ eive that I am a Olymp@@ ics . &quot;
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
&quot; it feels so much better , &quot; she said . &quot;
31 years of experience for clarity is taken care of clarity
&quot; the manager of the water @-@ purpose &apos; V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ein@@ group &apos; , Rup@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler , continues in retirement . &quot;
the con@@ federation is considered to be &quot; Bav@@ arian &quot; . &quot; &quot;
a small fr@@ act@@ able water @-@ purpose model as a model for the large water @-@ producers .
it was the name of some time ago in the origin@@ alt@@ on in a post by Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk .
little later he announced the water forum of the Government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia .
the work of the sub @-@ group for@@ ged &quot; bay@@ ern@@ wide as an exempl@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; behind all this stands Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler , who was 31 years in the kenn@@ el @-@ association , which was 28 years as Managing Director . &quot;
&quot; now , he was adopted at the age of 65 in retirement . &quot;
&quot; the drinking water @-@ purpose group with headquarters in K@@ ott@@ endorf , municipality of Breit@@ brunn , promotes approximately 150@@ 000 cu@@ bic meters of water and provides 32 locations and hamlet with about 5@@ 500 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; member communities are the churches of Kirch@@ lau@@ ter , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the city of Ba@@ un@@ ach . &quot;
for more towns and villages there are water @-@ suppliers .
&quot; the current President , Breit@@ brun@@ ns may@@ oral may@@ or ( FW ) , reminded that Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler in 1985 was employed as a water@@ front and was appointed as 1988 as Managing Director of the kenn@@ el . &quot;
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they have been extended by water management and maintenance operations on office and organis@@ ing activities , household production , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency purposes on weekends , &quot; said the chairman . &quot;
&quot; outstanding events called for outstanding events the start @-@ up and inaugur@@ ation of the new well ( 1994 ) , property sales in the field of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation for farmers , renov@@ ating a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the sub@@ missions of water pipes . &quot;
there have been no stand@@ still there and you have always received new additions because water is be@@ aming and drinking water is the most important food .
&quot; in her Lau@@ d@@ atio , she pra@@ ised G@@ öl@@ ler tru@@ sty , reliable and correct service over 31 years . &quot;
he has worked with a lot of heart@@ land for his water purpose and he has made the water @-@ purpose association as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago he has a real practition@@ er to present the success concept of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ r group to nit@@ rate in front of the Wasser@@ forum of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia .
&quot; for this , he received a lot of recognition and praise . &quot;
&quot; Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler , meanwhile , pra@@ ised Wasser@@ wart Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked together with him for 28 years . &quot;
he is the best water@@ front and he was a faithful bu@@ ck .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as a highlight of his point of view he posted the Brun@@ n@@ ulture and the restructuring of the kenn@@ el .
but the biggest challenge and most difficult use were the pi@@ pel@@ ines at the floo@@ ding at Kirch@@ lau@@ ter at a 3rd January .
&quot; here , at minus 17 degrees had to work throughout the night , so that the loc@@ alities could be supplied with water . &quot;
the supply of Neu@@ brunn is also possible to maintain only because you filled the floo@@ ding of P@@ ett@@ stadt with sli@@ ppers .
&quot; the management of the drinking water purpose was handed over to Daniel Stor@@ mer from Lau@@ ter , who enters the succ@@ ession of Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler . &quot;

steel - Light@@ view for German steel industry
the can@@ op@@ ted exploited and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed by additional costs in milli@@ meters height .
&quot; financial bur@@ dens , which threat@@ ens the industry from the econom@@ ist promotion , are from the table . &quot;
&quot; ab@@ ide in the liberation from the Renewable Energy @-@ Exchange for the most @-@ called self @-@ production facility in the German steel industry , said Federal Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ German General newspaper &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Fri@@ an@@ age ) . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am really happy that we could finally achieve negotiations after two years . &quot;
&quot; the European Commission did not first plan to ask the steel manufacturer , the g@@ ases from the ho@@ ops to electricity generation for their own consumption , to cure the cas@@ hier . &quot;
&quot; the steel industry threat@@ ens to provide additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year . &quot;
&quot; Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , now I now give a corn@@ erst@@ one with the EU Commission to talks with competitive officer in Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; only when the generators is replaced in the Stahl@@ werke , all an E@@ EG @-@ radius of 20 percent . &quot;
but even these will not be lifted in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed the unification of Germany with the European Commission on the self @-@ plan@@ ing generation .
&quot; thus , the status quo of the current regime will be largely written . &quot;
&quot; special meaning have the successful effort of Gabriel for the steel industry . &quot;
&quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; steel , the future &apos; is this a first step . &quot;
&quot; further must follow . &quot;
&quot; also with the reform of the emis@@ sion rights of the emissions and employment destinations , IG Metall @-@ Chief Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from the financial crisis in 2008 with plenty of capacity and a significant price print .
last year the situation continues to intensi@@ fy than the world &apos;s largest producers in China given the weak@@ ening domestic demand of the steel on the world market .
European manufacturers throw Chinese steel @-@ break@@ ing price @-@ du@@ mp@@ ing .
in the course of this early years the situation has something relaxed .
&quot; for one show , v@@ ault on impor@@ ter &apos;s effect , on the other hand the economic prospects have turned into China . &quot;
unclear is how sustainable the pricing is .
the German Bran@@ chen@@ pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp remained careful on Thursday .
&quot; finally , the prices would have been more stag@@ nat@@ ured . &quot;
the industry is respon@@ ding to the difficult situation with further prints .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp finally wanted to end closing the closing of individual works .
&quot; in the German steel industry at the end of 2015 , around 86@@ ,000 people were employed . &quot;
&quot; in July , the German steel manufacturer remain careful despite rising prices and increasing orders . &quot;
&quot; they produced with 3.4 million tonnes of less than six percent less material , than in the previous year , such as the economic recovery in steel on Friday . &quot;
after a short increase in May the crowd went back to the second month after a row .
since the beginning of the year the production has been given by two percent below the previous year .
the association does not counting in the coming months due to improved order intake with a rising output .
&quot; community , spirit , health : sing is sen@@ iors good &quot;
&quot; the s@@ ingen has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp already accompanied her whole life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , in the mag@@ ist@@ erium studied music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a sen@@ iors . &quot;
&quot; singing moves - emotion@@ ally and physically , &quot; she describes . &quot;
&quot; after a sample she feels good , cheerful and overall food , she says . &quot;
the next door she does good in her health and mind something good .
&quot; for singing is the same from several perspectives , a great hobby for sen@@ iors , says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler by the German Sen@@ or@@ en@@ lig@@ a . &quot;
&quot; most sen@@ iors singing in the choir , and share the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
through regular connections , sen@@ iors can make social contacts and maintain . &quot;
&quot; because often social and familiar structures at age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
&quot; this experience also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; to talk and organize themselves on the other , to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of awareness . &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in the positive sense that H@@ ac@@ kler means .
for exercising sen@@ iors a deep and controlled breathing .
&quot; who regularly calls his lungs regularly , even in everyday life is not as fast as the pu@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; even if it comes to get the sound of the voice at the age , S@@ ingen is an optimal hobby . &quot;
&quot; on elderly people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , Ursula L@@ enz says of the state @-@ of @-@ the sen@@ iors of the sen@@ iors . &quot;
&quot; in the older generations , the joint S@@ ingen had a much higher priority than it belonged to everyday life , both in school and in leisure time . &quot;
&quot; L@@ enz is commonly observed that the singing or hearing of songs in older people are arous@@ ed many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth . &quot;
by Li@@ ed@@ tex@@ te and very melodies arise themselves stran@@ gling themselves in long @-@ standing events .
&quot; in singing , the head will also have a special performance , says L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , concentrate on their own voice and a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge . &quot;
&quot; just older people who live alone , exercise themselves not only to concentrate on himself . &quot;
another positive aspect is the recognition that can be heard by singing in the choir ( H@@ ac@@ kler ) .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
even the self @-@ esteem is growing through the singing in the choir .
&quot; to show yourself : if I have long for something , I will get better and vig@@ il@@ ant about me - this experience is stronger . &quot;

cats react sensitive as a hang@@ over to cry of k@@ ittens
bi@@ ologists have investigated in Hanover which has the effect from k@@ atz@@ enb@@ ab@@ ys on adult animals .
&quot; to her surprise , the Mi@@ ys also let the males not be cold - however they kept in the difference to the females always . &quot;
female cats can recognize the path@@ ogens from K@@ atz@@ enb@@ ab@@ ys at the Mi@@ ys of the Less@@ er .
&quot; they respond to ten percent faster on the l@@ utes of k@@ ittens who have found themselves in great need , such as scientists from the veterinary University and Medical University of Hannover ( MH@@ H ) . &quot;
K@@ ater also react to the re@@ fe of k@@ ittens - but always the same .
&quot; evi@@ d@@ ently the acoustic differences between the building of less and strongly arous@@ ed juven@@ iles for the males either not perc@@ ep@@ tible or not of meaning , &quot; &quot; said the Biolog@@ o Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding from the MH@@ H . &quot;
&quot; she is the first @-@ author of the study , which was published on this Friday in the &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology . &quot; &quot;
in a previous investigation the research team had already discovered that the duration and pitch of the k@@ ittens is different with the ur@@ gency of their help .
&quot; over a total of nine adults , and eight c@@ ots from the animal welfare of the MH@@ H . &quot;
you were played for a re@@ ap of little ones that were taken for three minutes from the throwing box and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
&quot; on the other , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of stronger k@@ ittens resulting in addition . &quot;
the researchers keep their results in spite of the small sample @-@ sample for expres@@ sive .
&quot; all females , even those who had not had their own offspring , re@@ acted to the cry , &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot;
they turned faster to the loud@@ speaker if this ruins of the very arous@@ ed k@@ ittens played .
this ability may be anti @-@ born or developed with the sexually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; said the Biolog@@ o . &quot;
in the past scientists have already examined several times when men were studying the reactions of women and men on baby noise .
&quot; moreover , some studies showed that women sens@@ iti@@ vely re@@ acted , regardless of whether they were already mothers or not , the Biolog@@ o @-@ Marina Sche@@ el reported . &quot;
Pod@@ ol@@ ski spreads with &quot; Gala &quot; to Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ w@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
in Turkey against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver has had a war@@ rant back@@ rest .
he is thrown to be a member of a terror@@ ist group .
&quot; for the first time after the coup , Turkey will take place an important football match in Turkey . &quot;
in front of the Du@@ ell of the Arch@@ ri@@ als between Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as Istanbul and Luke Pod@@ ol@@ sk@@ is Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya the official line is clear : &quot; business as &quot; is said .
&quot; even in the suspension of acceptance after the overthrow , in July the government , the daily life of Nor@@ mal@@ ign@@ ant should not be affected . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not apply to the suspected of suspic@@ ion , the movement of the Pre@@ dig@@ er Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the coup attempt . &quot;
there will also be no surprise prior to football .
&quot; against the former Star@@ k@@ icker Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver , the Pro@@ secutor requested a war@@ rant pro@@ secutor . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is now living in America in America , a member of a terror@@ ist group . &quot;
&quot; ad@@ dic@@ ate to be the supporters of the Pre@@ dig@@ s Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the coup attempt by the president Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an . &quot;
&quot; true for 90 days , the emergency condition is still valid until October , but in fact this has on the life of most Turks , but as good as no effects . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; democracy @-@ guards &quot; &quot; in public places throughout the country has declared Erd@@ og@@ an on Wednesday for finished . &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - split in followers and opponents Erd@@ og@@ gans .
especially fans of the worker @-@ club Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as are traditionally not part of the friends of the President .
&quot; but the Gro@@ s of the Turks , but in the face of dramatic experiences in history , the strict rejection of military coup . &quot;
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart is preparing for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as .
at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger &quot; Gala &quot; it will be particularly back on Luke Pod@@ ol@@ ski .
his sporting value presented the Köl@@ ner in the dist@@ orted season with proof : with 17 gates and nine pre @-@ set in all competitions the 31 @-@ year @-@ old ended his first game time as a Top@@ sc@@ orer of his association .
in the end@@ game against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he sco@@ red the 1 : 0 @-@ seal .
the newspaper &quot; FAN@@ A@@ TI@@ K &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; he was the best in the place .
he has completed the season in an excellent way and his team is assured the podium .
&quot; thanks &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; found the dis@@ appointments of the season for the record , an irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able conclusion . &quot;
after the pre @-@ round @-@ K.@@ o in the Champions League goodbye the &quot; Lions &quot; also in the Europa League early .
in the Sü@@ per Li@@ g it was possible to rank 6 .
the season was not good .
&quot; the cup was the only way to win something . &quot;
&quot; we managed and this is the most important thing , &quot; said Pod@@ ol@@ ski . &quot;
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as the year ran better .
&quot; especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who with 26 Seas@@ on@@ ers as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ sch@@ ütz@@ enk@@ ö@@ nig , the basis for the 14th title . &quot;
that is also the reason that the fans hope to return to the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ olds .
&quot; at the AC Florence , he had decided to announce the AC Florence under the contract and announced on Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as , Gom@@ ez after the coup attempt , because of the political situation in the country after his EM &apos;s holiday . &quot;
&quot; if Mario still wants to come to us , he must only say , &quot; quoted the &quot; &quot; K@@ icker &quot; &quot; club chief F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the stor@@ mer would have to be ready to con@@ du@@ ce about a third of his to 7.5 million euros in the year &apos;s sal@@ aries , it is clear : &quot; its sal@@ ary in Florence can we do not pay . &quot;
&quot; despite dop@@ ing : these athletes have two medals opportunities at Olympia in Rio

others over@@ led athle@@ tics s@@ inner can only laugh it - they fight in Rio to play Med@@ als .
the topic Dop@@ ing is looking forward to the headlines at the Olympic Games in Rio .
&quot; the Russian s@@ wim@@ wear in Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ owa , which had ended up after a dop@@ ing lock of her start shortly before the playing time , was mer@@ cil@@ essly off @-@ le@@ aking and hidden . &quot;
it offered a sc@@ ur@@ r@@ ile scene : with a superior smile she was still attached to the hall and had prov@@ oked with their performance .
&quot; as a fest@@ ive that they will not take gold , the audience broke into a j@@ ub@@ el@@ storm . &quot;
&quot; however , there are many other athletes who go to the start despite dop@@ ing @-@ past at the Olympic Games in Rio . &quot;
here an overview :
&quot; Just@@ in Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m Rel@@ ay / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversi@@ al figures in athle@@ tics . &quot;
he was closed for two times because of dop@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
&quot; since his spell the Olympi@@ ad run from 2004 and ex @-@ World Champion even faster than before , he is over 100 m in 9,@@ 80 seconds the number one in the world and is considered to be the biggest challenges of Us@@ ain Bol@@ t . &quot;
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Season / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ stage Olympi@@ ad had to be susp@@ ended in 2010 after having proven the intake of pain by O@@ xy@@ co@@ don . &quot;
&quot; after a surgery , you have had strong to@@ ot@@ ha@@ che , def@@ ended the 29 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : 2011 the Olymp@@ ics of 2012 , World Championship of 2013 and Europ@@ am@@ ines from 2010 to 2016 has been positi@@ vely tested on the bot@@ an@@ icals Meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amin from 2010 to 2016 . &quot;
Per@@ kovic was the knowing ing@@ est@@ ing@@ taking and has been locked six months .
the four wid@@ est lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the great gold f@@ avo@@ ids .
&quot; La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ck ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the Peking Olympi@@ ad and two @-@ time World Champion over 400 m , was successfully tested and 21 months have been locked . &quot;
a means of penis enlargement may have been responsible .
this year the 30 @-@ year @-@ old over 200 and 400 m has been the fastest man in the world .
&quot; Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ ing , Belarus ) : probably hardly any athl@@ ete were reported as many medals . &quot;
&quot; so T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later , after having been found in him testosterone Dop@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; the meantime 40 @-@ year @-@ old had also had to give Olympia @-@ silver 2004 because of ster@@ oid Dop@@ ing and the EM @-@ title 2006 because of testosterone abuse . &quot;
the also realised Bron@@ zem@@ ed@@ aille of the Olympic Games in 2008 was awarded due to a judgment of the International Sport@@ gericht@@ shof .
with 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m he is situated on the rank of two of the world @-@ tran@@ g@@ ist .
&quot; Liu Hong ( 20 km walking , China ) : the world leader and gold f@@ avo@@ red has been tested only in May and still can start in Rio . &quot;
&quot; during the 29 years old world championship , notes were found to the intake of a well @-@ bot@@ her@@ ed dietary supplements , the spar@@ re of the world @-@ anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency W@@ ada fell off and ran on 13th July . &quot;
bom@@ bing in Thailand - Austrian bre@@ aker - Sever@@ al t@@ ote
&quot; the Austrian emb@@ assy in Thailand stand with the woman in contact , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign , Thomas Schn@@ öl@@ l , Fri@@ day@@ morning . &quot;
&quot; they have been overcome chi@@ ves and have been treated in hospital , but have already left this one again . &quot;
your home trip has planned for the beginning of September .
&quot; whether by further explo@@ sions on the holiday island of Ph@@ uk@@ et as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g , and Ch@@ om@@ ni@@ ch on also Austrian citizens are still unclear . &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in this regard to the local authorities , so snor@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; at about 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , H@@ in were first explo@@ ded on Thursday evening in a quarter of two bom@@ bs . &quot;
&quot; according to police a Tha@@ il@@ änder@@ in killed and about 20 people have been viol@@ ated , among them the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Ital@@ ians . &quot;
&quot; Friday morning then again two jum@@ ps went up , there was a further man killed by the authorities . &quot;
also from Ph@@ uk@@ et was reported in the morning a bom@@ b explo@@ sion .
the det@@ on@@ ation near the popular Ba@@ dest@@ ab@@ ds Pat@@ ong was viol@@ ated a taxi driver after police station .
&quot; in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani at the southeast coast of the country , then an additional bom@@ b who killed an urban staff . &quot;
the spr@@ ite set up according to the authorities in a flower in front of the prec@@ inct of the coast @-@ police in the air .
&quot; finally , det@@ on@@ ations were demanded even more det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast as well as in Ch@@ om@@ p@@ at on the south @-@ eastern coast . &quot;
one go from a connection to the explo@@ sions in Hua H@@ in whose name was .
&quot; the bom@@ bs bear the same manuscript , &quot; said armies of Dan@@ ai Krit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Fre@@ ag@@ early in front of journalists . &quot;
we assume that it is a co @-@ ordin@@ ated attack .
&quot; it was too early to express themselves to possible mot@@ ives - however , it is likely to handle the acts of Muslim rebels . &quot;
Thai media wanted to identify with the proposals a pattern which is typical for the bom@@ bs Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
&quot; however , the Thai police on the other hand explained , the attacks are not related to the Islam@@ ist movement or with international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is only local sab@@ ot@@ age , limited to limited areas and provinces , said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot;
it is rather the fact that the bom@@ bs of opponents of the ruling military j@@ unta were placed .
the authorities would have received sec@@ rec@@ y references in the south of the country in the last days - but they don &apos;t be informed about the exact time and places .
&quot; still , be unclear , which group behind the attacks . &quot;
&quot; the police pointed her officials throughout the country , security around important government buildings and airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and am@@ us@@ ement parks . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand there are always minor bom@@ bs , but mostly they are not directed against tourists . &quot;
in Hua H@@ in is a palace which was used over years by Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Adul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
&quot; according to the nun &apos;s bombar@@ d@@ ment , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on his homepage , the instructions of Thai safety authorities should necessarily result in a consequence . &quot;
&quot; high safety risk ( safety stage 3 ) for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ iw@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah Vi@@ hear and surroundings . &quot;
&quot; after disp@@ utes between security and Muslim people , it will not be deport@@ ed to these provinces . &quot;
increased safety risk ( safety stage 2 ) for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversi@@ al referendum on one of the military j@@ unta .
this spatial influence of military influence also in the coming years .
&quot; Jun@@ ta @-@ Chef and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Chan @-@ o @-@ cha said the bom@@ bs were an attempt to asc@@ ents , while the country is toward stability , an improvement of economic situation and tourism . &quot;
&quot; the military j@@ unta , which took power after a phase of bloody sho@@ ots , holds itself too good to have led the Kingdom back to stability and order . &quot;
&quot; however , it has not been successful in the military to get a grip on the face in the extreme south of the country in the extreme south of the country . &quot;
more than 6@@ 500 people have been killed in the conflict .
just under a year ago in Bangkok with a stroke of a popular Hind@@ u @-@ sister 20 people were killed - most of them are foreign tourists .
it was the bloody cl@@ apping of the younger history of the country .
the right &quot; identity &quot; movement &quot; is into the vis@@ or of the Federal Ministry of constitutional .
after several cut@@ ters also the Constitu@@ tion@@ alists have also put the group under observation .
&quot; we see in the &apos; Ident@@ ity movement &apos; locking points for aspir@@ ations against the fundamental democratic principles , &quot; said constitutional State Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate the German Press Agency in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; thus , according to the Islamic faith , or from the Middle East in extrem@@ ist manner . &quot;
&quot; therefore , we are monitoring the movement as well . &quot;
the &quot; Ident@@ ity movement &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots that has been active in Germany since 2012 .
&quot; it turns against &quot; &quot; Mul@@ tic@@ ult@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass migration &quot; &quot; and the &quot; loss of own identity by survival . &quot;
&quot; constitutional statistics in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , Saxony , Nieder@@ s@@ achsen , Saxony and Thur@@ ing@@ ia - watch the &quot; Ident@@ ity &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ate said , his authority was closely coordinated with the state . &quot;
&quot; groups like the &apos; Ident@@ ity movement &apos; try to pick up their audi@@ ences , where it stands , &quot; &quot; said the constitutional chef . &quot;
&quot; generally , extrem@@ ists try to speak with youth@@ ful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music . &quot;
the tatt@@ ing Islam@@ ists as well as law @-@ extrem@@ ists .
this is not a concrete promotion for your own thing .
the propaganda should address the people emotion@@ ally .
young people are being sus@@ cep@@ tible in a special way .
this is dangerous .
&quot; finally , it had been from several Bundes@@ länder reports on contacts of the &quot; Ident@@ ity &quot; to Af@@ D politicians . &quot;
&quot; d@@ ined , he did not have any knowledge . &quot;
the possible contacts in this way be relevant only from a certain point .
&quot; it depends on whether the particular party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , changes its target and so extrem@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; thus , the fact that such people have a tax on the party . &quot;
that is not recogni@@ z@@ able .
&quot; with a view to the significant increase in legal criminal off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers , and Refu@@ ge@@ es said Ma@@ ate , he would not speak of new rights terrorism in this context . &quot;
yet in recent years we found that there can be legal structures in recent years .
there was the Group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Fre@@ edi@@ aler group .
&quot; it can be quite clear that further law@@ ful group@@ ings or small groups formed , the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , are planning against refuge@@ e camps or attacks from other legal sex@@ ist mot@@ ives . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a nation@@ wide or European @-@ wide control of leg@@ ality , but is not recogni@@ z@@ able . &quot;
the previous groups have emerged on the regional level or in social networks .
&quot; moreover , Ma@@ ate expressed that many over@@ lap on the account of people who were not entered into the right scene before . &quot;
this is the assignment .
&quot; many of the fact @-@ suspected in attacks on Asyl@@ um do not have been known as crimin@@ als , politically motivated or supporters of the right scene . &quot;
&quot; many people have committed criminal off@@ ences who had previously elected with the extrem@@ ist extrem@@ ists , who were perhaps politically in@@ different or for example CD@@ U , SPD or left , but they have radic@@ alised ally radic@@ alised . &quot;

this shows the cour@@ ageous appearance of RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer time in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; at the Aqu@@ atics Center sw@@ am the slightly overweight swimm@@ ers out of Ethiopia , so slowly that he could not see more in the TV pictures . &quot;
it disappeared simply - no matter how far the cli@@ pping was selected .
in social networks Hab@@ ed was subsequently presented to the viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
&quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ended up with a back@@ drop of 48 seconds , and rank@@ ed 5@@ 9th square of 59 star@@ ters . &quot;
but it was rather its not just sport@@ y figure that drew the attention of international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still takes part in the Olympic Games ?
Ethiop@@ ian got a special start from the international swimm@@ ers .
this is distributed to make swimming in re@@ presented countries well known .
&quot; since the th@@ op@@ ies run the most athl@@ ete , I just wanted to do something different . &quot;
preparation is all : RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te makes ready for the big race .
quickly the first nickname did the lap .
some media referred to as &quot; RO@@ BEL of the W@@ al . &quot;
&quot; on a &quot; &quot; good performance &quot; &quot; the English bou@@ lev@@ ard@@ let &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; made with &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; about him . &quot;
&quot; his time , he only hit a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters Fre@@ estyle , there was no part . &quot;
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
at the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney presented the run of Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ b@@ ani for medi@@ al attention .
unforgettable was the performance of the swimm@@ ers out of Equ@@ atorial Guinea when he had to compete over 100 meters Fre@@ estyle alone .
Frank@@ en@@ etic was captured M@@ ous@@ sam@@ b@@ ani at that time .
at the time of 22 @-@ year @-@ old I learned to swim until eight months before Olympia and had never been a long distance before the competition .

inci@@ dents - Bus sli@@ ps in Kru@@ mm@@ audi@@ n in dit@@ ch : eight Ver@@ last
&quot; in an accident of a co@@ aches with 43 sen@@ iors as a road@@ stead , on Thursday in Kru@@ mm@@ audi@@ n ( Land@@ kreis Aur@@ ich ) eight people had been viol@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; two of the occup@@ ants suffered severe inj@@ uries , shared the police . &quot;
&quot; the 66 years old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisen@@ nach had to im@@ pose their information according to a counter@@ part , the partly transferred on the counter@@ car . &quot;
the bus came to the right of the road and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch as a spokes@@ person of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund .
&quot; because of the location of the bus , the people were unable to leave the bus self @-@ employed , &quot; she said . &quot;
the fire @-@ fire @-@ liber@@ ated the occup@@ ants .
six life@@ jacket and a not@@ aries came to the accident location on the highway 2 .
the un@@ last trav@@ eler were brought back by a line bus to Kru@@ mm@@ audi@@ ble district of P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should be waiting for a replacement bus of the travel company .
investig@@ ators called for the load @-@ experience and possible witnesses to report on the police .
the fees per Ku@@ bi@@ km@@ eter are from 1 October 2016 for the branch of the new village of Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ahl 3.@@ 44 instead of the euro ; for Z@@ ult@@ enberg / Lind@@ enberg / Lop@@ p 3.@@ 36 Euro ( so far 1.9 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3.@@ 64 Euro ( previously 2.7 euro ) .
&quot; at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the waste fee will be at least then increase , if appropriate improvement measures will be necessary . &quot;
&quot; after a sle@@ epy calculation , the waste price in Az@@ tec will be at 4,@@ 37 euros per Ku@@ bi@@ km@@ eters . &quot;
&quot; like Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) , was established during the approval of the household through the landsc@@ ap@@ ed Kul@@ mb@@ ach , that there are sub @-@ covers for these se@@ wage systems . &quot;
the kas@@ endorf market is committed to legally binding to run the facilities for free .
&quot; from 1 October 2016 the citizens as well as the commercial and industrial companies from Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lind@@ enberg , and Z@@ ult@@ enberg must have access deeper into the money bag . &quot;
the fee is between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; as the Chairman of the Board of Directors , Herbert Schmidt was opened on the panel , was a re@@ cal@@ v@@ ulation of fees for the sec@@ tion@@ aries of the market community . &quot;
the period from October 2016 to September 2020 were also over@@ - or under@@ cover@@ ings from the prec@@ eding cal@@ ization period .
&quot; the gra@@ v@@ ending prayer increases Schmidt with the fact that there are relatively small facilities around relatively small establ@@ ishments with a very low se@@ wage rate , that lies between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 Ku@@ bi@@ km@@ eter per year . &quot;
&quot; thus , due to the low constitutional basis for example expend@@ itu@@ res for necessary repairs of several thousand Euros . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the se@@ wage comes in all three lines slightly decl@@ ining . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the prec@@ ursor period of all three plants do not last noticed because of their age of san@@ itation and repairs in a significant extent . &quot;
&quot; the plant in Az@@ endorf was nearly 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ coming , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth , as well as Z@@ ult@@ enberg , Lind@@ enberg , and Lop@@ p almost 20 years . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Schmidt was pointed out that in the water@@ front Az@@ endorf the mechanical ventilation system had to be ex@@ changed due to a poll@@ ut@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; in the P@@ ump@@ werk Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ahl , the almost 20 years old sponsors had to be out@@ dated back to almost 20 years of operation of the first fr@@ ac@@ iers , which provides glue and an additional ventilation system to be able to comply with the water legal requirements in the future . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; to these extraordinary expend@@ itu@@ res were the continued @-@ written supervis@@ or and maintenance costs which are to be taken into account according to the new cal@@ ization period . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs which in the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 even clearly below the present level .
Stein@@ häuser recently made that with the low se@@ wage of water in three systems the expend@@ itu@@ res for operation and maintenance .
&quot; recently , Schmidt , the market community of large entertainment costs in the se@@ wage systems have been spar@@ ed during the past 20 years . &quot;
&quot; the situation for the af@@ ore@@ mentioned systems will continue to remain prec@@ arious on the duration of the range of stone buildings , especially since you can not extend the supply of the water @-@ purpose of the Fries@@ en@@ acht@@ al , because it is a defic@@ it@@ ory facilities . &quot;

domestic statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria in July 1 % was on a monthly basis .

the annual temperature of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured by the CP@@ I -@@ 0.4 % .
&quot; the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 , 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 % . &quot;
&quot; the in@@ fl@@ ation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) -@@ 0.2 % , and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 -@@ 0.2 % . &quot;

Snap@@ chat &quot; An@@ ime &quot; is critic@@ ised as Asian caric@@ ature
Snap@@ chat says that this filter is An@@ ime @-@ inspired but some ob@@ servers say that it is uns@@ en@@ si@@ bly towards breeds .
&quot; with its filter tool , Snap@@ chat allows about 150 million daily users to change the reality and play with ident@@ ities in such a way that already borders the Ab@@ sur@@ de . &quot;
&quot; you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lich@@ tenstein paintings . &quot;
&quot; the filters are un@@ poll@@ uted , autonom@@ ous tools that generate over 30 million improved sel@@ fs per day . &quot;
all fail@@ ures will get to the public .
Snap@@ chat @-@ filters have moved in the past cr@@ itic in which they were accused of prop@@ ag@@ ating the App Black@@ face convey@@ or or white skin as beauty @-@ deal prop@@ agate .
&quot; when this week gave a filter a filter that gave them fl@@ ashing , false teeth and blo@@ ated che@@ eks , there were some critics a rac@@ ist cartoon by Asi@@ ans - &quot; Yellow no@@ face . &quot; &quot;
they asked whether these repeated contro@@ vers@@ y showed a greater problem that the company has with diversity .
&quot; the news and the rebellion have been widely used on Wednesday , with reports of The ver@@ ge and motherboard , one day after Snap@@ chat , that it could have been de@@ activated by the feature . &quot;
the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was intended as hom@@ age to An@@ ime characters and not as a caric@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
&quot; however , out@@ standing , the rac@@ is@@ sm@@ us have experienced , reminded of the filter of hur@@ t@@ ant c@@ lich@@ és . &quot;
others refused the anim@@ e comparison .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani has written Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean American art student , whose twe@@ et about the photos were widely used that the filter was hur@@ t@@ ful and had said uncomfortable . &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to ar@@ gue with the counter@@ part of a very contra@@ dic@@ tory Asian caric@@ ature and the filter@@ ing effects .
&quot; it shows that the filter is not clear , but that the Yellow @-@ face was drawn into the extreme . &quot;
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that this cultural Stol@@ per@@ dra@@ ined crosses .
&quot; American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration of integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the appliances , which we all hold in hand . &quot;
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats great audience young people - those who are breed race as their older counter@@ player - could rather be expected to expect sensitivity to awareness .
&quot; if one of the snap@@ ch@@ ats fil@@ ters an image creates that there is much more difficult for a user , &quot; so it &apos;s much more difficult that such things was un@@ noticed when it was the case earlier , the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu said in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Z@@ hu decided to work as a product management and engineering in medium , you will delete snap@@ chat account for others to do the same . &quot;
&quot; in an essay for medium and in a telephone interview she said that r@@ acial @-@ related contro@@ vers@@ y will reflect a lack of diversity in the settings of Snap@@ chat with Snap@@ chat . &quot;
Z@@ hu critic@@ ized the large part of white , only male leaders and ended their attachment with a has@@ ht@@ ag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; either they have no diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their occupancy , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but not in positions in which they are safe or feel at what to say about it . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinion , a complaint that Snap@@ chat is largely un@@ answered . &quot;
the company does not release figures for diversity of its work@@ force and points to its status as a private company .
&quot; on Thursday , Snap@@ chat now decl@@ ined to discuss the cultural background of his employees , but according to a spokes@@ person , the company has recently focused a personnel of personnel who focused on sub @-@ presented population groups and to internal integration efforts . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu said that she will shut her Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
military coup dist@@ orted ISIS in@@ con@@ scientious obj@@ ection
&quot; military acts of the United States Central Command changed thought@@ fully information , in order to draw an optim@@ istic image of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic state in Iraq and Syria when the actual states were allowed on the ground in a report on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the pro@@ visional report , created by a Task Force on Republi@@ can Committee , Secret Services Committee and the Wehr@@ bud@@ get@@ ites , reported by great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command intelligence services , reported as su@@ peri@@ ors their ass@@ essm@@ ents to American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; the Central Command , short Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in Tampa , Florida , which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; some information provided by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com Com@@ man@@ ders , regularly a positive picture of the American efforts on terrorism could have allowed the actual conditions on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other news services , &quot; quoted a newspaper article . &quot;
&quot; what is done at Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when poor analyses our political leaders are presented , &quot; Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can member of the Represent@@ ative house . &quot;
the guidel@@ ine in Cent@@ Com range up to the top tip of the organization .
the ten @-@ sided report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the formation of the Ira@@ qi armed forces .
&quot; although there is no direct reference to it that Inter@@ tops described under Obama statements , shows how analy@@ st saw the pressure from their predec@@ essors , an optim@@ istic image of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as ISIS or IS@@ IL . &quot;
&quot; during the first half @-@ year 2015 , many Central Command Press releases , statements and statements made in front of the Congress clearly more positive than it corresponds to the facts . &quot;
&quot; for example , a Cent@@ Com An@@ ger was publicly announced that a military rec@@ ap@@ ture of Mos@@ sul@@ s can already begin in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ su@@ l , second largest city in Iraq , continues to be under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigation , it is as clear . &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Congress of K@@ ansas , in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; from the middle of the year 2014 to the middle of the year 2015 , the tips of the Central Command changes the following reports to download the danger through ISIS in Iraq . &quot;
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans called the Task Force into Life after having agreed that analy@@ st was concerned with regard to the manip@@ ulation of reports on the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday released will be completed in more detail and completed during the proce@@ eds .
&quot; in addition , further information of Cent@@ Com reports are under@@ going through the Secretary @-@ General of the Ministry of Defence in progress . &quot;
democratic members of the news service published on Thursday their own findings that coinci@@ des with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 the Cent@@ Com announced an over@@ ly limited process for the creation of in@@ rac@@ tions to IS@@ IL and the Ira@@ qi security services , &quot; the highest democr@@ at @-@ democr@@ at Adam B. Shi@@ p , known in the representative office Adam B. Shi@@ p , in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; this process , so Mr. Shi@@ p , &quot; del@@ ayed the publication of after@@ math reports , &quot; the mor@@ als under an@@ alyst@@ s and &quot; gave excessive amount for devi@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; but Mr. Shi@@ p and the Democrats have given no indications of a intervention of the White House with the Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st in terms of a &quot; particular political opinion &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the preliminary results of the Congress of the Congress were published on Tuesday through &quot; The Daily Beast . &quot;
&quot; last August , the New York Times reported by proce@@ eds by the general chief of the Pentagon , which were taken after complaints by Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a press pre@@ ached of the Pentagon , was in an opinion that the Ministry of Defence would have no reports of Congress while the investigation of the general spect@@ ator would be still under@@ way . &quot;
&quot; but he also said that &quot; experts sometimes have quite di@@ verg@@ ent opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data , and that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Defence was a controversi@@ al discussion of these important issues of national defense . &quot;
the proce@@ eds of the question of a successful airline campaign led by American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a claim that is now being made by an increasing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) .
&quot; however , the alleg@@ ations of the past year have raised the question raised , in@@ wi@@ ef@@ ed President Obama can rely on the Central Command for hon@@ ors of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis @-@ regions . &quot;
&quot; the criticism of hearing about the Islam@@ ist state remind of the Islam@@ ist state of more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st , Gregory Hoo@@ ker , a writing made by George W. Bush against the recommendations of many an@@ alyst@@ s only saw a small occup@@ ying forces in Iraq and saw little time on the consequences of the invasion of 2003 . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the insur@@ rection against the current reporting on the Islamic State .
&quot; last year , the team led by Mr. Hoo@@ ker according to information from government agencies , that contrary to the statements by the government officials had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terr@@ arium since these pro@@ visional refin@@ eries in operation would have taken to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; however , this recognition was not published , the Times reported in September . &quot;
&quot; Cent@@ com@@ s &apos;s former command , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the Leg@@ isl@@ ative account for its excessive positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing in front of the Senate . &quot;
general Austin was held in April in the retirement and was replaced with the Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
&quot; the USA wins fourth match in the field @-@ hock@@ ey of women , a show@@ down with the UK . &quot;
&quot; one day after they had shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 winner over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates of the American Feld@@ hock@@ ey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americ@@ an@@ ers with 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five gates in two games should actually be a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said they could not remember that ever have done . &quot;
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
I am not belonging to the people who keep their gates in mind .
&quot; however , they know that the Americas are at 4 @-@ 0 in the oly@@ mp@@ ic competition and are equal in their group with the Brit@@ ons in the first place , which after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan are un@@ be@@ aten . &quot;
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday last game of the first round .
&quot; both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ finals , the game will decide which the two within their group from six teams can gain the first and second place . &quot;
the first @-@ placed will take a little longer a little longer from the path that the other group would lead to the next group .
&quot; as well as the game might go out on Saturday , the Americ@@ anism have triggered a surprising work by their success story , four years after they landed in the past London Games on the last of 12 places . &quot;
BA@@ M was part of this team .
&quot; it grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years an Ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ schl@@ äger in hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at the Dre@@ x@@ el University ) , with 16 years she was the national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team . &quot;
they missed the Olympi@@ ad in 2008 because they could not qualify for the cad@@ re .
&quot; then came the year 2012 , in which for her and her team was all shi@@ fted . &quot;
&quot; in the subsequent year Craig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the National Team and thus began to turn things to better . &quot;
&quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am . &quot;
we did not have the working space in London that we now have .
we have the rod completely around .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the Torre@@ igen in the first half of the game with a retreat from the clos@@ eness .
India was gone without a victory in the tournament but the team showed themselves surprisingly heavy and held the game stand from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter up to the play in their hands .
&quot; she accomplished one spr@@ int with the flat ball on the left side fl@@ ank , then moved to the center and invited the ball into the gate to get the Americ@@ an@@ ers 2 @-@ 0 guidance . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ zal@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last qu@@ artet .
&quot; the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the door @-@ ke@@ epers of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs which previously had to book a gate in any of the previous games . &quot;
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how well is on Saturday from the result of the next game on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; amid the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the tramp@@ oline &quot;
&quot; wherever you are , how late it is , there are the Olympic Games . &quot;
the events in Rio de Janeiro feel resistant and in@@ escap@@ able to be a rapid increase between competition and aspir@@ ations .
&quot; it is as if the oly@@ mp@@ ic f@@ ack@@ el itself is a burning st@@ ab , which is used by the br@@ ac@@ eans on the turn for the turn to the turn . &quot;
&quot; you cannot read the TV , read a paper or listen to your neighbors in the queue in the queue without about Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there is still Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey who is the first time for the first time in the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s black with dim@@ ples , could certainly have been sent to the Prime Time , built up to Prime Time , built by sponsors and well @-@ good TV advertising if he would be a swimm@@ er , tur@@ ner or even f@@ real . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , is fighting in the oly@@ mp@@ ic tramp@@ ol@@ ines around gold . &quot;
the oly@@ mp@@ ic flame does not illuminated any event identical .
&quot; further from the center , partly in the shadow are the sports that are not generally recognised : air conditioning , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ w@@ ondo . &quot;
we will always have the breast swimming and let it be long .
&quot; but if I might want to make humble arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the tramp@@ oline . &quot;
&quot; although the tramp@@ oline jump already since 2000 a oly@@ mp@@ ic event , when it had been in Sydney since 2000 , it was perceived to be the last 16 years so many that , I didn &apos;t know that it is a Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ art at all . &quot;
this could also be regional ignorance .
&quot; although the USA sent athletes to the competition , it has never had a medal in a tramp@@ oline and had made up a athletes that has made it up to the end . &quot;
the Chinese and Russians tend to share the prizes for the men and the Chinese and Can@@ adi@@ ans share the women .
Dong Si from China and Ro@@ she Mac@@ Lenn@@ on from Canada this year will defend their gold medal from London .
&quot; the tramp@@ oline jump a certain outdoor hotel , partly because it does sound for the un@@ enlight@@ ened ear more suitable for a cl@@ own@@ ing school than that sounds for the Olympic Games . &quot;
at this point I should admit that I am not an expert but only a bear@@ er enthusi@@ ast .
&quot; it has hum@@ orous potential - the cart@@ o@@ ily trem@@ bling of his never to end , but also the refinement of the rotation and diving , the two sports that it essentially combines . &quot;
the word &quot; tramp@@ oline &quot; comes from the Spanish El tramp@@ oline as much means as &quot; spr@@ ing@@ board . &quot;
&quot; fir@@ ing winners jump on a giant tramp@@ oline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a series of falling movements ( rot@@ ate , cl@@ ave and sal@@ tos ) before landing on the feet . &quot;
&quot; you will be evaluated according to the official Olympi@@ ad after execution , difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; two @-@ eight athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women are to compete in Rio . &quot;
the most common oly@@ mp@@ ic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
&quot; hoping to go further in their pursuit of gold , faster , up@@ wards and dr@@ über , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes back and back , up and down at the bottom of the playground . &quot;
they are not only the accordion or the starting point but in the television trans@@ ference is also another height : the world or the Olympi@@ ad .
&quot; the purpos@@ eful aspir@@ ation is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ ati@@ cal - and it is enough to get even a spect@@ ator to tears . &quot;
but it is also what I feel when watching these games as something ti@@ res@@ ome .
it offers tramp@@ oline an at@@ emp@@ ause .
the v@@ ector of the tramp@@ oline is above .
a prec@@ eding movement is not the goal .
&quot; he or she boun@@ ced , seem@@ ingly hard @-@ el@@ os like an ast@@ ron@@ aut , go up , then down , then effort@@ lessly back up . &quot;
&quot; there is also a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during exercise there is no h@@ ectic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves in the distance , just the dre@@ amy , elegant up@@ lifting of time and gravity . &quot;
it is as Zen as the competition with the Olympic Games could only be .
&quot; the qualifying and ends of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in the streaming about 13.00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13.00 . &quot;
N@@ BC will beam the ducks as part of a afternoon blocks on both days starting at 2@@ pm .
&quot; in the midst of Olympia man@@ ie , they promise a quiet , nice moment , one which will probably be over@@ looked for the general tum@@ ult . &quot;
&quot; when the awareness raising only by the Ang@@ monkeys and the obj@@ ecti@@ fication they can be achieved - as it was the male US @-@ Tur@@ ner according to The Wall Street Journal recently ahead , the Lord Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his to rin@@ se new Fan@@ es . &quot;
&quot; a generation prot@@ ested in Ethiopia , Long a exile of the USA &quot;
violent protest in Ethiopia
&quot; demonstr@@ ators , the political changes in Ethiopia , call on violent resistance to the government . &quot;
witnesses say that zig @-@ protest during the coll@@ ision with police were killed .
is Ethiopia right to break with it ?
&quot; over the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid association of West with a fast growing economy . &quot;
&quot; but in the past few months , protests against the government the country and turned into more and more areas . &quot;
last week thousands of people rus@@ hed to the streets and slow@@ ed fundamental political changes .
the answer of the government was un@@ mer@@ ciful according to human rights organizations .
witnesses given that polic@@ emen were killed on zig @-@ armed prot@@ esters and killed .
&quot; in circulation , videos over the protests , which are probably from the last or beginning of this year , show how security men can hit young people with sho@@ cks while these were forced to make a hand@@ stand against a wall . &quot;
the Chief of the UN Agency for Human Rights is now calling for an out@@ going investigation .
&quot; it was always difficult to maintain this country and will even become more difficult , &quot; &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot;
Ethiopia is still the most populated country of Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West .
&quot; American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ian forces to fight terrorism across the region , particularly in Somalia . only few countries in Africa , if at all , get so much western aid . &quot;
Ethiop@@ ian economy expanded in the temp@@ oral temp@@ o .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new comm@@ uter train in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
&quot; roads are usually quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; although Ethiopia is far from being a model for democracy - human rights organizations have ongoing supp@@ ression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted , with disp@@ ens@@ ate effective to silence . &quot;
&quot; many were sent into exile or prison , killed or driven to the wilderness of the desert . &quot;
but that could change .
&quot; if you are supp@@ ress people and these no other options have to protest out , it breaks out , &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lect@@ urer in central Ethiop@@ ian . &quot;
the entire youth protest .
a generation protest .
there are numerous ail@@ ments which cover everything from the bum@@ ps to stran@@ gl@@ eh@@ old in relation to power of the ruling coalition .
&quot; after a widespread choice last year , the ruling party and its allies got the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the tensions continue along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea ; a battle for these jag@@ ged , controversi@@ al line for June hundreds of life . &quot;
an@@ alyst@@ s fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts as the Oro@@ mo @-@ liberation front or the national liberation front of the O@@ g@@ aden which were more or less imposed over the last few years and arms themselves .
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ tern@@ ess after years of di@@ vul@@ tures under the surface now explo@@ de .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
&quot; only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ian were able to communicate using social media , as cheap smartphones have always been more common and improved services . &quot;
&quot; even if the government lock the access to Facebook and Twitter what they are at regular intervals , especially with protests , many people can still communicate via Internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are staying . &quot;
several young Ethiop@@ ian gave them that they gathered so as protests .
&quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ nic@@ ities in Ethiopia . &quot;
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; since el@@ ons , Am@@ har@@ as , continues to come from Ethiopia , mainly Christian highlands , in politics and economics , while the Oro@@ mos explo@@ it , of which many Muslims are living and living in low@@ land areas . &quot;
but even this is changing straight .
&quot; we are going to coordinate under a umbrella , &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot;
the biggest protests were in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
&quot; many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have domin@@ ating the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray that are approximately 6 percent of the population and that are dominant in the sec@@ rec@@ y , trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; Mr Mel@@ es , a former re@@ bel leader , was up to his death in a non @-@ publi@@ ci@@ zed disease during the year 2012 17 years of Ethiop@@ ian Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; he was regarded as tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think of the corners . &quot;
an@@ alyst@@ s say that it was especially versi@@ bly to make early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and un@@ authorized to use opponents and to make them un@@ dam@@ aging .
&quot; the present regime is lacking in this basic skill , &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , a conflict @-@ analy@@ st . &quot;
Ethiop@@ ian new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , has been selected for relatively recent reasons to take the position of Mr Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; unlike Mr Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region in northern Argentina , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south . &quot;
an@@ alyst@@ s say that he enjoys not enjoys the confidence of the security of the Tig@@ able security services .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; the last time Ethiopia was witn@@ essed such a tur@@ mo@@ il was in 2005 , after thousands against elections , the according to the statements made by Analy@@ st &apos;s apparently origin@@ ated by the government and then stolen . &quot;
&quot; during the subsequent ra@@ ids were killed many prot@@ esters , even if there were less than in the last months and this time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; developing experts pra@@ ised Ethiop@@ ian leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new comm@@ on@@ ers , as well as for their meas@@ urable progress in poverty all@@ evi@@ ation . &quot;
but obviously this has not prevented the intensi@@ fication of the internal mis@@ deeds of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
&quot; the last month of the prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ hic city , of Tig@@ ray guided businesses and the hate opposite the Tig@@ ray will always be more common in the social media . &quot;
an@@ alyst@@ s say that protests are the USA and other Western allies to a peculi@@ ar position .
&quot; the American government used Ethiopia as a basis for pres@@ sur@@ fers via the neighboring Somalia , even if they were recently de@@ ed that it has closed this base . &quot;
&quot; while the West will clearly support democracy , he does not want to collapse that his exile in an already vol@@ at@@ ile area coll@@ ap@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; is a very thin congratulations . &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp explains his asser@@ tion Obama declared ISIS &apos; sar@@ cas@@ m .
&quot; Donald J. Tru@@ mp tried to dis@@ si@@ p@@ ate the last contro@@ vers@@ y on Friday that his campaign was repeated , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would be the &quot; founder &quot; of the Terr@@ or@@ upe Islamic State , not seriously meant . &quot;
this clari@@ fying new questions regarding the communication skills of the presidential data of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans if he is able to communicate clearly and understandable with the American public .
&quot; it also brings his comrades who strive to take him during an event@@ ful stage , to explain to the peculi@@ ar position to explain statements that he could not have meant to be meant . &quot;
&quot; after he had made the clear@@ ance at an election event on the Wednesday evening , Mr. Tru@@ mp had returned to the claim on Thursday and consi@@ sted of interviews that he really did not intend to specify the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS . &quot;
&quot; but in an early twe@@ et on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp said Mr. Tru@@ mp , he is just sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
&quot; the twe@@ et was contrary to the previous day , on which Mr. Tru@@ mp said in a series of interviews , he meant the alleg@@ ations completely seriously . &quot;
&quot; as the conservative Radi@@ om@@ o@@ der@@ ator H@@ ugh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tru@@ mp wanted to help to we@@ aken the statement that Mr. Obama wants to destroy him , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate wanted to know anything about it . &quot;
the last storm of criticism pr@@ as@@ sel@@ t on Mr. Tru@@ mp desc@@ ends while he tried to direct the focus of his campaign because of falling out@@ placement values to the economic situation .
Mr. Tru@@ mp and Mrs. Clinton held speech@@ es on the economic situation in Michigan in this week .
on Friday Mr. Tru@@ mp tried to return to this topic again .
&quot; over Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Cl@@ int@@ ons would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech d@@ ull bored . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp has already taken sar@@ cas@@ m to its defense .
&quot; in late July he moved strong criticism to himself when he meant , the Russians should Mrs. Cl@@ int@@ on E@@ mails but he later declared &quot; Natural I said the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tru@@ mp to move the lingu@@ istic limits in politics and then return as needed .
&quot; I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are shot from his fans as they arrive , and then possibly &quot; clarify &quot; depending on how the reaction falls . &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sherman , an communication expert who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates . &quot;
&quot; but I also believe it is clever enough to keep his statements v@@ age enough , so that they can be interpreted in various ways . &quot;
&quot; instead of shar@@ pen@@ ing the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tru@@ mp has assumed an even if its changing values have gone further . &quot;
&quot; a new survey conducted by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ is , published on Friday , a tour with a great start in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ an @-@ head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tru@@ mp has generally tried to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative pronoun@@ cements , he frequently acc@@ uses his critics , his statements to dist@@ orted or wrong . &quot;
&quot; but during the focus of attention during the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s has brought his loyal followers to him in the un@@ comfortable situation , ir@@ respective of how pro@@ voc@@ ative may also be his statements . &quot;
Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former Mayor of New York and one of Tru@@ mp@@ s prominent inter@@ pret@@ ations , there was great trouble to defend the candidates today in a CN@@ N interview from Thursday . &quot;
&quot; I believe what he says are legitim@@ ate , political comments &quot; &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani so he was asked to the accuracy of Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s statements whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost un@@ familiar , small organization , he called it amb@@ ush , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he ab@@ used the troops from Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most mainstre@@ am rep@@ ublic@@ ans attempt to ar@@ gue that the government served under Obama , in the Mrs. Clinton as the Secretary of State , it allowed to spread the situation in the Middle East to aggressi@@ vely under control . &quot;
&quot; before the election event in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp put his attacks on the media and cast them to re@@ ride against him on any of his words . &quot;
&quot; he for@@ giving the &quot; poor &quot; j@@ aw@@ ned &quot; television exper@@ ten , trying to understand it and said , &quot; &quot; You Can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some of the democr@@ ats don@@ ated over Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s exc@@ use as only another proof , that he may be un@@ suitable for the presidential office . &quot;
&quot; once on the price of the market , Café is back in Green@@ point . &quot;
&quot; the Cafe was a pe@@ dic@@ ated café in William@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash , which was no Wi @-@ Fi but 15 years of good coffee . &quot;
&quot; of course , the prices origin@@ ated from its Bedford Avenue Laden@@ front . &quot;
&quot; the store So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , set the verb in the summer of 2014 , sold soap in the form of cup@@ cakes . &quot;
indigenous people saw it as the last loss in a gene@@ tically reduced city .
&quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I still cannot believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and Ver@@ b now is a soap business . &quot;
&quot; but if New York is changing , it is also re @-@ finding . &quot;
a re@@ ated Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
the new version has Wi @-@ Fi and accepted credit cards but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
&quot; the new owner of Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old cafes , the owner and managing director of the new café . &quot;
he began working in Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
&quot; when he offered him a customer to provide money for a new office , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ guez , 36 , kept a lot of things . &quot;
verb the same distributor for the bag@@ els purchased the same es@@ pres@@ so model .
it even uses the same lamps off the old verb .
but Rodri@@ guez told that he wanted to be experim@@ enting .
he led new ingredients .
on the menu are sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are gar@@ ages such as cap@@ ers and sour onions .
there are natural keys .
the café serves no beer more so there are fresh juices .
after nine months Rodri@@ guez told Rodri@@ guez that he noticed a steep stream of old tri@@ bal customers .
&quot; many old customers were also associated with prices from William@@ sburg , &quot; he said . &quot;
recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in William@@ sburg and visited the verb regularly . &quot;
&quot; even after she moved to Green@@ point , she would take the way to himself . &quot;
&quot; after the verb had closed , she gave a while the coffee ro@@ asted on , she said . &quot;
&quot; I became clear that it was coffee and the culture in the verb , which I liked it , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now they drink coffee , even if they ordered at this day instead of their usual I@@ ced coff@@ ees a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea , who is another new addition . &quot;
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been another long @-@ standing and faithful customer since the beginning of 2003 .
he went there before work and ordered un@@ so@@ y always the same .
&quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss fl@@ ash@@ ells and they prepare my Everything Bag@@ el with butter , &quot;
photo Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment with experim@@ enting and record new ingredients in the menu .
&quot; nowadays , Ros@@ enthal get even his usual order but sometimes it changes his Everything @-@ Bag@@ el with bac@@ on , egg and cheese . &quot;
Rodri@@ guez said that he had no resent@@ ment about that the soap @-@ shop has taken the old business room .
&quot; in fact , the owners of So@@ ap Ch@@ erie used to establish a special soap for Ver@@ b with the cold @-@ ed coffee of the café as an ingredient . &quot;
&quot; I think we will go to their offer , &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ guez . &quot;
&quot; and the traditional , Polish inhabitants Green@@ points have also accepted the café . &quot;
&quot; a new customer translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ guez said that he has to present them soon , so that his new neighbours feel welcome . &quot;
the site has also other benefits .
an ör@@ gy Saf@@ t@@ locally wants to fill the k@@ alt@@ ro@@ ast coffee in bottles and sell .
there is a chance to expand the café on an es@@ art@@ ing building .
for many customers a new hiding place is sufficient to get their old favorites .
Joseph W@@ itt was tri@@ bal and said that he was devast@@ ated on the ground than the café included .
&quot; when the new cafe opened , Wh@@ itt said that the bed@@ time of Lok@@ als and the radi@@ als felt a new coffee as a hom@@ ec@@ oming . &quot;
&quot; I had to smell , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the depres@@ sing food of the economic crisis in &quot; an abundant meal &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his rise to the President , Franklin Del@@ ano Roos@@ ev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office . &quot;
&quot; as gour@@ mets , President Roos@@ ev@@ elt , a Fai@@ ble for refined del@@ ights of Fifth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland water @-@ tor@@ tie soup . &quot;
&quot; his menu on this day was somewhat modest : stu@@ ff@@ ed eggs in Tom@@ at@@ ru@@ ce , potato p@@ ü@@ ree and as dessert a pl@@ ums . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ E added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans , how they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both groc@@ ers .
&quot; Co@@ es last book &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; was about the Chinese cuisine in the USA while Zi@@ egel@@ man told in her book &quot; &quot; 97 Orchard &quot; &quot; about living in a residential building on the Lower East Side of the food perspective . &quot;
&quot; your latest collaboration , &quot; A decent food , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at the Har@@ per Publishing , illustr@@ ates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity , when they meet with a rep@@ orter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s sand@@ wich shop for dinner , a small , schn@@ k@@ ell@@ os@@ em Im@@ bis@@ s in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock crash 1929 . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh cream @-@ sand@@ wich with olive @-@ piece while Co@@ E , 57 , Tru@@ th@@ ahn with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetables . &quot;
&quot; ordered as the rep@@ orter h@@ ooks , this found the couple for discussion about eating at the era of Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; rich food were very popular , &quot; &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
there were pe@@ anu@@ ts and liver bro@@ kers .
they were prepared from an ingredient and something Bil@@ lig@@ em which stretches the ingredient .
imagine so many pe@@ anu@@ ts to eat that they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ inst@@ e .
&quot; it must be placed in the stomach such as lead , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; during the years before Great Depression , the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ you @-@ can @-@ E@@ at @-@ buffet . &quot;
&quot; teams of women bo@@ ars for male fel@@ lows and it was served fresh baked p@@ â@@ té for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; there were the Americans who sent food at the des@@ per@@ ing Europeans at the first World War . &quot; &quot; A Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; marks the paths that the country went on , no longer the s@@ laughter of the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a time when the food was a central , tense issue , &quot; Co@@ E , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; just as tense , the new bud@@ get@@ fulness : mysterious foods such as Br@@ ote and Kas@@ ser@@ dies have been revi@@ ved as a &quot; wonderful way , the cas@@ ser@@ ge@@ s as a &quot; wonderful way , the sens@@ iti@@ y , as coo@@ ks non @-@ appeti@@ zing ingredients were hidden under a cre@@ amy sauce . &quot;
fresh fruit was replaced with cheap dry dri@@ er .
&quot; meat , for years the center of the American cuisine was , became a rare and luxury . &quot;
&quot; peculi@@ ar mixing @-@ like mix@@ tures have been tried , as a cal@@ orie @-@ cal@@ orie and nour@@ ishing pre@@ emin@@ ence for flavor or even healthy kitchen . &quot;
&quot; during their research for the book that includes recipes , prepared Zi@@ egel@@ man a court of that epoch , baked onions with pe@@ anu@@ be butter , too . &quot;
&quot; it was not a popular supplement on the mid@@ day , &quot; says Co@@ E . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ mann goes further from : &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ anu@@ til@@ ed butter and baked onions do not fit each other .
it was typical for many of the farm recipes .
&quot; as never before or since then , exagger@@ ated Hous@@ eh@@ ler - including Louise Stanley , Head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 , the eating habits of the country . &quot;
&quot; published in newspapers and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; &quot; house@@ wives &quot; &quot; and the challenge to transform pamp@@ as such as cre@@ amy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rots in delicious meals . &quot;
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a celebration of historical delicacies .
&quot; especially tasty , reports of the response from the government to star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ cakes @-@ meal @-@ post@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; as he publicly pra@@ ised the simple Iowa farms in its kitchen , he sp@@ ies like the milli@@ on@@ ensch@@ on@@ est man of the world to which he has become . &quot;
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; said Co@@ E . &quot;
he ate in an almost g@@ ild@@ ed dining room and contributed a smo@@ king .
he was really realistic .
&quot; President Roos@@ ev@@ elt might have committed the same mistake , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to stat@@ ute him with his stomach . &quot;
&quot; as described in the book , the recru@@ iting of a households with no interest in flavors caused by Mrs Roos@@ ev@@ elt , that the White House brought the more boring food in Washington but also one of the most sought @-@ on test . &quot;
&quot; many of the species from the era of Great Depression , with food was rejected , once the land came back on the legs . &quot;
&quot; the legacy is on our advanced focus on calories and food , said Zi@@ egel@@ man , as well as on how science was applied to food . &quot;
the couple gave more to the writing of the book the eating habits of Zi@@ egel@@ mans @-@ in @-@ law @-@ in @-@ law - for example how they could not throw food .
&quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; said Co@@ E . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man reminded me : &quot; &quot; she made people really sick . &quot;
there was the wind@@ exploited .
&quot; after the T@@ eller were clear@@ ed at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they moved and Co@@ E made a dessert that they had cooked at home : the pl@@ ough@@ ing of Roos@@ ev@@ elt , President Roos@@ ev@@ elt . &quot;
&quot; it will be called &quot; &quot; W@@ hip &quot; , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man , and added that it was a common trick , humble recipes was sending a new name . &quot;
&quot; there was no shar@@ pen@@ ed cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon . &quot;
&quot; everyone tau@@ r@@ ally a spo@@ on in the t@@ aps , brown gli@@ b@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; amaz@@ ingly , it wasn &apos;t bad . &quot;
Co@@ E took three times a precip@@ itation .
&quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ erer , he said to his wife , &quot; A couple of h@@ ack@@ ed wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
at Bom@@ bs attack : he was the hero of Al@@ ep@@ po
he set his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed Omar .
he was the hero of Al@@ ep@@ po : Khal@@ ed Omar dedicated his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ed everything to save others life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old itself has died in a bom@@ b attack of the Assad regime .
Omar was a member of the &quot; White Hel@@ mets , &quot; a civil protection group who saved his life according to image newspaper so far more than 6@@ 0,000 people . &quot;
29@@ 00 Volunte@@ ers put her own life on the game to attract people from zer@@ om@@ ed houses and to make first aid in the war area .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
Omar was the face of the group : a video of the civi@@ liz@@ ers who shows him at a 11 @-@ hour rescue of a house in 2014 around the world .
it made the Syri@@ ans to the shining symbols in the Gre@@ ys of war .
&quot; but as a hero , he has never seen himself , said according to the picture : &quot; for me this is the true Ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; when I die to save life , I think that God sees a mart@@ yr in me . &quot;
&quot; shortly before Omar fell on a attack on the victim , he had talked in a video about the last bombar@@ d@@ ment of Syria . &quot;
&quot; the Hel@@ icop@@ ter have had four fa@@ bom@@ bs over the Alz@@ adia district , one was filled with Ch@@ l@@ org@@ a . &quot;
&quot; a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breath . &quot;
&quot; we now eliminate the toxic rem@@ n@@ ants of the bom@@ b , so that not children play , c@@ ites the image his last words before he died . &quot;
the deadly bom@@ b of the Assad regime had to make terrorists .
Greenland : the oldest spine is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie usually come only in winter to surface .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to a study on board the S@@ anna &apos;s approach to the sea .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and swi@@ ms with a good 1 km / h by the North Atlantic - to date .
Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie got only 150 years of offspring .
&quot; the Greenland shar@@ ks along the ground of the North @-@ Atlantic along the bottom of the North @-@ Atlantic along , in an hour it is on average just 1,@@ 220 meters far . &quot;
&quot; only when it comes up , it speeds up the five meters long animal to s@@ atte 2,@@ 6 km / h - and with this top speed is half as fast as a seal . &quot;
this of long @-@ term life @-@ made lifestyle seems to be a pat@@ ch@@ iller for a high age .
&quot; Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues are reporting in the magazine &quot; Science &quot; at any rate of a Greenland , who could be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; ins@@ an@@ ity , &quot; said Alexander Sch@@ eu@@ er@@ lein by Max @-@ Plan@@ ck @-@ Institute for demo@@ graphic research in Rostock this life @-@ span , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot;
indeed the evolutionary bi@@ ologist has long been that Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ia are st@@ ony .
just lacking the evidence .
&quot; Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie are difficult to observe , eventually they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the low density coast of Canada , Greenland , Norway and Sp@@ it@@ s@@ bergen . &quot;
&quot; because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees c@@ enti@@ grade , dive at the surface usually only in winter . &quot;
researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland researchers according to little .
her tim@@ l@@ up@@ ent@@ emp@@ o ma@@ ize them when they built up six animals with a transmitter .
&quot; pre@@ y do this shar@@ ks nevertheless : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the j@@ aw@@ bones of a young ice @-@ bears . &quot;
possibly they are sleeping animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the Eis@@ me@@ eres and are looking for car@@ c@@ asses that are from higher water layers to bottom tor@@ ches .
&quot; Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues investigated 28 Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in Greenland or Sp@@ it@@ s@@ bergen from the depth of the North Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; the smallest Sh@@ ark was just 81 cm long , while the biggest 5@@ 02 cen@@ tim@@ eters . &quot;
&quot; to determine the age of the animals , they are using the carbon @-@ 14 method to the len@@ tic@@ ists of shar@@ ks . &quot;
this centre of the eyel@@ id is already born before the birth of the shar@@ ks which are contained in the proteins will no longer be renewed .
the two smallest shar@@ ks had stri@@ k@@ ingly much carbon @-@ 14 in the lens .
&quot; after the early 1960s , your birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s , as nuclear @-@ weapon trying larger amounts of this radio@@ active carbon into the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in which with 220 cen@@ timet@@ res length third @-@ smallest animal contained the lens @-@ 14 from the nuclear @-@ weapon @-@ 14 , it is likely to have celebrated his 50@@ th birthday in 2012 . &quot;
all major Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie had in their len@@ tic@@ ism against normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts that arises from cosmic radiation in the atmosphere .
&quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ clock showed a 4@@ 93 cm long Greenland , a age of 335 years , during the record shar@@ k with 5@@ 02 cen@@ tim@@ eters even 3@@ 92 years old might be old . &quot;
&quot; the Greenland @-@ female only then get offspring , when they are longer than four meters , was known . &quot;
&quot; now , the researchers have been able to as@@ sign up the length of the length . &quot;
&quot; as one of the animals were at the thresh@@ old with 3@@ 92 cen@@ tim@@ eters at the thresh@@ old to the sexually mature couple and his age was determined with 156 years , Greenland shar@@ pen@@ ed with the multip@@ lication obviously at least one and a half centuries . &quot;
also this is likely to be a World@@ record for verteb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme live mainly in icy waters is not a coincidence .
&quot; also the previous record holder , a 211 year old Grön@@ land@@ w@@ al , in whose bac@@ on the neck an 120 year old Har@@ po@@ pun@@ k pointed out , was captured before Alaska . &quot;
&quot; due to the low temperatures , the organism and the body of the living animals live in as@@ fl@@ ames . &quot;
so they mature later - and int@@ s@@ lower .
&quot; to keep in cold water warm , the animals are also often particularly big . &quot;
&quot; because the volume grows much faster than its surface , through which the animal feed heat . &quot;
the heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much larger than at one gram elephant .
another advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should concentrate on it , as soon as possible as many offspring as possible , explains the evolutionary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ eu@@ er@@ lein . &quot;
a very big animal should invest his resources more likely to invest in a long life .
mounting in double @-@ pack
&quot; with subjects related to building , the comm@@ on@@ at in the most recent session is reflected in the most recent session . &quot;
&quot; with relief , the committee took the message of Mayor Robert P@@ utz on that &quot; finally the marketing of the younger palms can begin . &quot;
&quot; after the property , par@@ cel@@ est@@ ation and placement questions were clari@@ fied and the requests for survey@@ ing could be clari@@ fied , is the sale of plots in residential areas &quot; road l@@ weg &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( section Bin@@ der@@ straße - Ex@@ hib@@ ited from 1 ) to those interested nothing more in the way . &quot;
the council is convinced that the buildings in the rural and quiet residential areas Schön@@ au young families and retro@@ grade sen@@ iors alike .
&quot; as it was called , Bau@@ verl@@ asting can be present immediately in the City Hall , on the awar@@ ding of the plots will probably be advised in the meeting session in his September @-@ session . &quot;
&quot; in order to also have requests to re@@ location other commercial companies , connected to the creation of jobs , to come , decided to change the comm@@ der@@ at first in the spring of this year &apos;s newly created bott@@ len@@ ation plan . &quot;
&quot; in the area of Unter@@ zeit@@ lar@@ n , this is already a designated commercial area around two plots towards state road 2112 . &quot;
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ xit
&quot; the city on the Main has moved to Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg to attract the best opportunities to attract new jobs and companies . &quot;
&quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt am most from the Bre@@ xit V@@ ot@@ um , Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , leader of the competence of financial markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot;
after the Bre@@ xit referendum it is un@@ certain whether cash buildings can continue to operate from London from the financial transactions throughout the EU .
&quot; for the so @-@ called EU passport , they have so far the approval in Britain . &quot;
this is currently using large US banks .
several banks have already announced jobs to shift jobs .
the Lob@@ by@@ unification &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; expects 10000 new jobs on the main bin@@ nen five years .
&quot; for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the head of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) united the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks of the euro zone , as well as further important authorities like the European insurance supervision of EI@@ O@@ PA and the risk of EI@@ O@@ B . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) will be head@@ quar@@ tered , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB . &quot;
&quot; the proximity to the database is important for banks , since they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; Luxembourg Rec@@ ei@@ ves a large f@@ ond@@ ary sector , but also like Dublin is worse off the infrastructure . &quot;
Frankfurt was significantly easier to achieve thanks to the large airport .
further focuses on the town with easily available workshops .
&quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;

&quot; in a cr@@ ack contrast , Donald Tru@@ mp hidden behind false exc@@ uses and re@@ viewers in relation to his former promises to publish his tax explic@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; it is common for US presidential data to publish their tax explic@@ ations , although they are not required by law because of the law . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp , a New York busin@@ essm@@ an , and his attor@@ neys have stated as the reason for his den@@ ying a tax check by the tax authorities . &quot;

states have become an issue in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a regulation that is named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and invest@@ or War@@ ren buff@@ ett which would ensure that people pay more than USD 1 million to pay a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama supports the proposal also .

&quot; Jewish director sm@@ ashing Berlin hotel , because Israeli election was removed after &quot; Arab@@ ian &quot; call - RT News &quot;
a French director with Jewish roots un@@ veil@@ ed a media entry after he had betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin had no Israeli election in Berlin because the Arabic guests had requested according to an employee .
Claude Lanz@@ mann : author of the Holocaust @-@ documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; left his trouble in the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by wrote an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
&quot; during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the state of the hotel . &quot;
&quot; however , the country was not listed among the countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; how is it in the year 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel was eliminated and deleted ? &quot;
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
&quot; instead , the Kemp@@ ink@@ si Bristol offers a way to choose Israel via its own call center . &quot;
after a statement looking turned to the director to the reception .
&quot; the answer that he received there , &quot; shock@@ ed him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot;
the hotel said that the measure is a &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the company Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
&quot; the reason , which was behind it , the director was even more anger . &quot;
&quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs and they demanded that the pre @-@ choice is deleted , the employees of Lanz@@ mann is quoted . &quot;
&quot; the Israeli amb@@ assador in Germany Y@@ akov Ha@@ das @-@ trade , this was a &quot; great shame , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung reports . &quot;
we were horri@@ fied by this event and fright@@ ened .
this really is very embarrassing .
&quot; the fact that this in Germany has borne out exactly this hotel chain , is even a bigger dis@@ grace . &quot;
this is no explanation .
&quot; we expect the hotel &quot; &quot; the right conclusions &quot; , &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; the incident extingu@@ ishers a fairly large reson@@ ance on the Internet , where people called the whole sc@@ andal . &quot;
some talked to the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it had been granted the alleged dish @-@ challenges Arab@@ ian guests .
&quot; ash@@ amed you , &quot; was it in another post , where it was pointed out that the hotel which is located on the cl@@ assy Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , near a synagogue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel pointed out all alleg@@ ations of the alleg@@ ations of themselves and called the incident of &quot; &quot; los@@ ers &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ ze &quot; &quot; in Lanz@@ mann , reports The mirror . &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct statement , &quot; Israel did not record into the quick@@ set list , &quot; quoted the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung a spokes@@ person of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
it adds that the country code was now added .

trade between Russia and Iran suddenly increases 71 % - RT Business
&quot; with the lifting of sanctions grew to the Russian Ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the sales revenue of Moscow and Teheran are equal to 7@@ 0,@@ 9 percent . &quot;
&quot; since the international sanctions imposed against Iran , the interest in the Russian company grew strongly in the country in the country , shared the amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; Russian companies are taking existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to get access to the market . &quot;
&quot; of course , the further commercial construction is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan . &quot;
&quot; he assumed that the sum total between Russia and Iran in the first five months of the year 2016 at 7@@ 0,@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 , increased in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the Russian imports in Iran around 9@@ 1.5 percent are err@@ atic and dec@@ eived $ 6@@ 97 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; the trade @-@ rise was achieved by deliveries of machinery , driving vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; said the amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors . &quot;
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan goes for this year by a record of Iranian tourists in Russia .
&quot; last year the Russian emb@@ assi@@ es were about 35.@@ 000 Vis@@ as , primarily from Reis@@ ev@@ is@@ as , an Iranian citizens . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries , which concerns the tourist destinations in Russia . &quot;
&quot; one could say that the record number of tourists in Russia are broken from the last year , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , visit only relatively few Russians the Iran , something of which the amb@@ assador hopes that it will change . &quot;
&quot; personally , I can recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ahan , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d to have received the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization in a good condition . &quot;

&quot; Sch@@ otte Call@@ um Sk@@ inner rus@@ hes to home , as Br@@ ite Gold for Rad@@ sport &quot;
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ra@@ vel last night in the male @-@ team in Rio to the fame , as the British team def@@ ended the title of London 2012 . &quot;
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the an@@ chor@@ us , who had made his Land@@ smann Sir Chris Ho@@ y . the young and made the legend proud when he rus@@ hed to home a victory of the favorites New Zealand . &quot;
England claimed a shock@@ ing victory over four years ago during Ho@@ y the fifth of six Olymp@@ ics medals .
&quot; they repeated the trick , after they took place in March at the train World Championship in London despite the return of the Ho@@ ys , only a humble sixth place . &quot;
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driving Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as a sign @-@ up .
Ho@@ &apos;s retirement beg@@ at a gap , the K@@ ian Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ ampton were trying to close . &quot;
&quot; Sk@@ inner was the man where they remained , when they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots that has now developed . &quot;
&quot; Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - the four years ago with Ho@@ y vict@@ orious - and Sk@@ inner sat down into the Quali@@ fier round a Olympi@@ ad , but in the closed round vict@@ orious the New Zealand in the first lap . &quot;
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
&quot; Hin@@ des was just shortly after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team to the front and Sk@@ inner . &quot;
&quot; a Strateg@@ o change made a large part of transformation , in addition to the execution in a higher motion to slow him slow and it &apos;s Kenn@@ y and above all sk@@ inner to hold the pace . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ y saw from his position as BBC @-@ Expert and fell in Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des , when this was on the podium . &quot;
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner said , &quot; It is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot;
I am only here to do my best and to make me a name .
we have put up a Olympi@@ ad in the ducks and defe@@ ats the world champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph of 2012 at the side Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys gave it the way he fell into the train after a weak start .
he returned this statement later and there was no claim of England Rival .
for such a overwhelming victory this time there was no such problem .
&quot; he said , &quot; It feels like the whole GB fl@@ ags on the ble@@ achers like London . &quot;
we have joined the team over the last three months .
&quot; we have been so bad at so many world titles , so that it was incredible to win back at the Olympi@@ ad . &quot;
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , the seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and in London . &quot;
if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the last five months is that we expect successful five days at the Vel@@ od@@ rom .
&quot; with the form of tra@@ ys , it is in the realm of the possi@@ bl@@ ity that he is repeated in a contest of three oly@@ mp@@ ic gold medals in a contest . &quot;
&quot; this would mean for Kenn@@ y - who was exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on 23 March ( an apparently he@@ eded date for British sport ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster was born ) - an exc@@ use of six gold medals and a silver medal . &quot;
the che@@ ats of the Ho@@ y is the same .
Kenn@@ y takes part next in the spr@@ int who starts today and will go over three days .
&quot; the 28 @-@ year old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot;
the team @-@ event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely to win alone .
&quot; he said , &quot; If he wins two more gold medals , he should be be@@ aten to the k@@ night . &quot;
it was the only medalli@@ on of the day but there were other good news for England .
&quot; Sir Bra@@ dly Wig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified himself with the fastest performance in the quad@@ rant @-@ four @-@ od@@ ometer . &quot;
you arrived at 3 : 5@@ 1,9@@ 42 at the destination .
&quot; the world record , which won in 2012 in London gold , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,6@@ 59 . &quot;
&quot; today , the first and final round ( 22 ) will be held on the second day of the competition , where the Wig@@ gins are under focus will be on stage . &quot;
&quot; he had fought yesterday to the qualification before the qualification , when he had to sh@@ out@@ ed him to measure his body size . &quot;
&quot; in the appropriate women &apos;s competition , the tomorrow continues and ends , av@@ anc@@ ée Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna Row@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie Archi@@ soon of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ av@@ ie in puppy time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 . &quot;
the GB team leaves to be on his strong rail team to domin@@ ate the mean period of the Olympic Games and to take a flock to Med@@ als .
after a truly exceptional representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London the expectations had been shut down to Rio .
&quot; playing Dr@@ amas in the background , leaving the technical guide Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April in the midst of Sex@@ is@@ mus@@ - and mob@@ scene , as well as retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pen@@ dl@@ eton . &quot;
&quot; however , if one sees the first evening of the competition at the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks like the legendary reputation of GB@@ s that has reached the perfect moment to achieve his climax again . &quot;
future of mel@@ ting from Portland due to lifting the energy exchange .
&quot; the future of the aluminum rods from Portland , Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs from workers - stand on the game , as the plant operators announce the energy supply contract , and thus all the delivery dates will up@@ lift , such as the supply of energy companies . &quot;
&quot; this step followed by the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsi@@ dies to operate the plant . &quot;
one for 20 years of occa@@ sional subsi@@ dy runs out in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the installation of Al@@ coa in Portland are standing on the game .
no less than 2000 jobs - direct and indi@@ rect - could be at risk of closing .
&quot; in addition , it could come to domin@@ ating effects , as the melt flow around 10 percent of the total electricity generation Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as consumed . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , Al@@ coa closed the Point Henry mel@@ ting , which led last year to a closing of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power station . &quot;
the mel@@ ting from Al@@ coa in Portland loses money and ris@@ ky a closure .
&quot; this step follows the past long spec@@ ulation in terms of the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollars and last due to the power price for the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , which was supplied with its Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ ro@@ be Valley , shared with that three other owners will announce their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the complex is owned by a joint venture between Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , the Chinese company C@@ ITI@@ C and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p smaller shares . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant in Portland continues to be operated in Portland , which means another physical demand for electricity through the mel@@ ting , divided the company . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L also said that the contracts called &quot; &quot; sec@@ rec@@ tions &quot; &quot; were to have come into force from November 2016 . &quot;
the contracts have received a 12 @-@ month cancellation so that they will end 2017 .
&quot; from that reason AG@@ L assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to the revenues , &quot; &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot;
all potential impact on the revenues in AG@@ L from G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong markets for wholesale prices .
AG@@ L shared with that it has already written the value of the contracts entered into the amount of $ 187 million in the expect@@ ation of a cancellation .
&quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; ability to operate &quot; &quot; the ability to operate Al@@ as ... the mel@@ ting and the power supply to the mel@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. company said that it was completed in 2010 a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , which would have come into effect from November this year , even though it is still a declaration guilty why it is re@@ signed by the contract . &quot;
an@@ alyst@@ s war@@ n because of the poor economic conditions in the industry before the possible closing of the Portland mel@@ ting in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago area near New@@ castle .
&quot; in reference to the statements of the analy@@ st at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Portland is about 600 meg@@ aw@@ at@@ ts and Tom@@ ago about 900 meg@@ aw@@ at@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; if both plants disappear from the market , this would mean a considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; current market &#93; . &quot;

more than just a car@@ as@@ hi@@ an Reality @-@ TV @-@ Star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the new issue of the Vo@@ gue . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner , 20 , model and fourth daughter of the managers and mother of the Kard@@ as@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ enner C@@ lans Kr@@ is is on the cover of the cov@@ eted issue of the US Vo@@ gue . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all , the brand amb@@ assador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der is and went on the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , on Thursday the news on her Inst@@ ag@@ ram account . &quot;
&quot; in a room full of people I love , brought me the sight of this Co@@ vers to wines , &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all . &quot;
&quot; the un@@ veil@@ ing of the Co@@ vers followed by a bizarre ( or simply keeping Up with the Kard@@ as@@ hi@@ ans like this ? ) , ob@@ pt@@ ed Reality @-@ Video , which shows the entire card@@ as@@ hi@@ an &apos;s elite as well as in the presence of the well @-@ known show@@ biz On@@ k@@ els and producers of keeping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest , and that ends with a classical twist : they all have a surprise party . &quot;
&quot; this represents the cl@@ ever@@ lasting act almost every Birth@@ day sep@@ is@@ ode of a children &apos;s turn ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the proposition , &quot; you did not have forgotten ? &quot; , &quot; with the honesty of a cartoon by 8 am in the morning ) , but Kr@@ is had to make her other girl somehow at this Public@@ ity . &quot;
with a view to the new issue of Vo@@ gue with a degree of security a new era of the car@@ as@@ hi@@ ans started .
&quot; K@@ end@@ om big sister Kim likes it , as well as the Vo@@ gue cover cover ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the new issue of the magazine is a le@@ ague for itself . &quot;
the new issue of Vo@@ gue is the most popular output of the year .
&quot; with a circum@@ ference , which is rather similar to a picture @-@ band as a fashion magazine , the output draws a large number of advertis@@ ers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were from the 8@@ 32 pages of the Bear@@ er 615 pages advertising ) . &quot;
&quot; the un@@ veil@@ ing of its Cover@@ stars is so cr@@ ad@@ dic@@ ted , that in the last two years of the magazine announced the official notice . &quot;
&quot; women who were already on the cover , Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; celebr@@ ities &quot; model@@ n &quot; as &quot; Models , the celebr@@ ities &quot; are on the cover . &quot;
Oscar winner and Di@@ or @-@ trademark Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor . &quot;
&quot; even with the small chance that Ms. J@@ enner - which is described by the magazine as the &quot; &quot; break@@ down model &quot; &quot; of her generation - under the former category , it is in good company . &quot;
these celebr@@ ities are not related to famous individuals or Reality stars or young people of today who know how to connect a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if it all depends on J@@ enner ) .
they are really talented women who are exhibit@@ ing in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once that appeared on the last cover was released with the publication of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of their career .
&quot; of course , J@@ enn@@ ers do not like success everyone . &quot;
with her Reality @-@ TV history J@@ enn@@ ers was always tense in the fashion world .
in June I critic@@ ized the lonely Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ Model Stephanie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ enner and her colleagues in Gig@@ i Ha@@ did and called it &quot; the pieces of the moment . &quot;
these feelings emerge again high than the message with the show J@@ enn@@ ers came out on the Vo@@ gue Cover .
&quot; but on the mist@@ ress , it seems to go down at the point . &quot;
K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner is on the cover of the new issue of Vo@@ gue .
it is in the tru@@ est sense of the word a super@@ model .
she is running for Marc Jacobs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
you and all their sisters sell you pictures of their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
they sell of her master@@ ed pictures of C@@ indy Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her free time she is seen in Reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
&quot; common centers , each year 16@@ 0.000 people &quot;
&quot; more than 160,000 of the benefici@@ aries of the rest of the country will be rejected by the similar@@ ities , while the industry is applied to the effects of other mid @-@ recent transactions . &quot;
&quot; in Queensland three of five people are already three of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , helpful workers , victims of violence and those who have no means of un@@ just del@@ ights and similar agreements . &quot;
&quot; legal services of the community , which are already out@@ lined , are ready for further cuts . &quot;
&quot; from June next year , the legal centres will be scheduled to lose another 30 percent of their federal government . &quot;
the director of the community centers of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last collection of the National Association of community centers revealed that thousands of people will be rejected every year .
&quot; Far@@ rell said that the situation would only be worse , without the abolition of the decision of the Federal Government . &quot;
&quot; Queens@@ lands comm@@ on@@ cology centers are chronic , which means thousands of people of important services that you will need to be rejected , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; people who leave violent relations , people with uns@@ ur@@ b@@ able and depres@@ sing debt , families who were released by separ@@ ations , workers , the un@@ just type and this collection shows that they can not get the help they need . &quot;
&quot; the German government will cut the means of 30 percent in June 2017 , which means thousands of hel@@ ne@@ edy people from Queensland to be forced to just@@ ify with their legal problems without any help . &quot;
&quot; we call for the gener@@ osity and federal government agencies as well as the Sen@@ ators of Queensland George Bran@@ dis to lift them straight away , so the people need help you need to get in legal problems . &quot;
&quot; last year the national government met their commitment , means for sp@@ elling on the national average . &quot;
it is now time to look at the needs of the community centers and its customer experience as well as the Government Pal@@ asz@@ c@@ zu@@ k invested in this important work .

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey of countries of European elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
&quot; in the upcoming elections in the Bundes@@ länder Mecklenburg @-@ Vor@@ pomm@@ ern ( 4th September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) , a considerable losses for the ruling classes and CD@@ U . &quot;
this made a representative of the dis@@ sem@@ inal Institute of the IN@@ SA for the &quot; Image &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
&quot; while the red @-@ black government @-@ presence in the north is shortly afterwards , this is not possible after the ro@@ dents in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in both states , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances to continue to establish the head of the head . &quot;
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vor@@ pomm@@ ern the SPD led by 35.@@ 6 percent last five years ago at 24 percent .
&quot; the party therefore saw the survey only shortly before the CD@@ U , which could come back to 23 percent . &quot;
the third place is fought between the Left and the Af@@ D .
the left ri@@ ms came to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) ; the Af@@ D would have been present for the first time with 19 percent for the first time in the country .
the Gre@@ ens in spite of easier losses with 6 percent ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) again in the Schwer@@ iner Land@@ tag .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not be represented with 3 percent each in the land .
&quot; according to the Berlin Parliament , the SPD of the survey conducted only by 23 percent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) . &quot;
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent to 23,@@ 4 percent .
they saw it even behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) but in front of the left with 15 percent ( previous 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would be represented with 14 percent for the first time in the Parliament .
&quot; with 5 percent the F@@ DP could hope for a return , the pirates would never miss the one in contrast to 2011 . &quot;
Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ mail and internet in Zeit@@ l@@ upe : 20 years ago the Nokia communic@@ ator went to the market .
the successor is the world - its manufacturers experienced a disaster .
the unit weigh@@ ed almost a semi @-@ kil@@ ograms and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was thicker and larger ; it was therefore not good in the hand .
&quot; on the contrary , it was quite klo@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the built @-@ in memory was at the beginning of eight meg@@ ab@@ y@@ tes , this would be sufficient for approximately two sel@@ fs with high resolution . &quot;
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gig@@ ab@@ yte .
&quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator , was exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , in the shops - and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a couple of euros , lovers can still buy the equipment on the internet , but they somehow come from the St@@ one@@ age of the dormit@@ ory . &quot;
20 years ago the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish cell phone @-@ maker had announced the product a few months before at the computer fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hannover as an &quot; office in the West of the West . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent and received a lot : SMS and email could be sent and received , even by fax was the communic@@ ator . &quot;
even access@@ ing Web sites was possible via HTML browser if also agon@@ izing slowly .
a calcul@@ ator was available to a digital addres@@ see and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be similar to a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black @-@ white screen .
&quot; the price was quite proud of the price : 2700 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 euros . &quot;
the average price price of a smartphone in Germany was at 3@@ 92 euros .
&quot; nobody was allowed in August 1996 , that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era . &quot;
since then everything is different .
&quot; clever phones are a success story , if not for Nokia . &quot;
the cell @-@ chart of the Finn@@ s lived an un@@ parall@@ eled disaster . eventually was sold to Microsoft and was sealed .
the market today domin@@ ate suppliers that all came much later than Nokia .
&quot; always and all online , this is today for very many people everyday . &quot;
in 2015 there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide .
&quot; sold approximately 1.4 billion devices , Samsung and Apple dis@@ inf@@ ects alone 555 million copies . &quot;
the global sales department with the devices lies about 400 billion euros .
&quot; to do this , the well @-@ running transactions of the numer@@ eless app @-@ suppliers and telecommunic@@ ations companies . &quot;
around the smartphone now has developed an entire industry .
the decisive breakthrough on the mass market was just beginning to be announced at that time Apple @-@ Chef Steve Jobs on the Mac @-@ World launch the i@@ Ph@@ ones .
&quot; he spoke three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an internet communic@@ ator , everything per touch @-@ screen easily to use . &quot;
&quot; the winner of Apple started , still today the iPhone is the most important product of the Group . &quot;
&quot; Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market . &quot;
they finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight . &quot;
the sag@@ as have now Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is 20 years after its invention a self @-@ evident .
&quot; in the event , any German Germans now looks on his cell phone on the day . &quot;
&quot; we must all learn the smartphone also away , &quot; said exactly Jan@@ ina sphere , in the Siemens Board of Directors for staff . &quot;
permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must draw the Olympic Spirit and expand He@@ a@@ throw .
He@@ a@@ throw will not only bring prosperity and prosperity throughout the country but throughout the country .
&quot; for me , it was the biggest attraction of He@@ a@@ thro@@ ws , just as at that time in 2012 , when we operate a great deal of effort to ensure that all of our nations and regions were prof@@ ited . &quot;
the Olympi@@ ad brought great advantages for Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and we will be able to achieve new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ a@@ throw .
&quot; for our local communities , we will already create 10,000 new appren@@ tices , create 4@@ 0,000 new jobs and prepare for youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot;
&quot; just as they were ahead in London in 2012 , there will be such that the challenge of enlargement He@@ a@@ thro@@ ws is too big . &quot;
it was told me that England will never be ready for the games and that we will bl@@ aze on the world stage .
the two @-@ fl@@ ats in 2012 are wrong and they are also wrong with He@@ a@@ throw .
&quot; there are always obstacles to the over@@ coming , but He@@ a@@ throw answers every question . &quot;
like the Olympic Games is He@@ a@@ throw for many and not for single infrastructure project .
&quot; enlargement is a way to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion in wit@@ ty growth and to leave a bequ@@ est of skills and employment both to leave the airport and in the whole UK . &quot;
&quot; we have made a great team in He@@ a@@ throw , which has been implemented a £ 11 billion most expensive infrastructure program in time and budget , from the T5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport . &quot;
&quot; now , they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment . &quot;
the London Games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ a@@ throw will also be one .
it is time to expand this oly@@ mp@@ ic mind and create He@@ a@@ throw as well as our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment to be proud of England .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; K@@ atz @-@ and mouse game &quot; on display block &quot;
&quot; for companies , who earn money with Onlin@@ e@@ wer@@ bung money , according to one of the software manufacturers to handle advertis@@ ements , a &quot; k@@ atz@@ e- and mouse game . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block advertis@@ ements on his desktop page , Ad@@ block Plus a blog@@ post , in which it rus@@ hed to update advertising in the social network to re@@ juven@@ ate advertising in the social network . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook will show that his desktop page would change the enco@@ ding regarding his advertis@@ ements in order to realize it advertis@@ ements about which part of the site is advertising to ag@@ gra@@ v@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; however , Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to get to the new codes . &quot;
&quot; in a blog@@ post , the spokes@@ man on Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ H@@ er @-@ fight is already under@@ way since the invention of advertis@@ ers in progress is &quot; &quot; and that it &apos;s possible that Facebook soon comes with a new solution . &quot;
&quot; the fact that the world &apos;s largest company has left social media in the struggle , is a strong Indian , as wor@@ rying advertis@@ ers for the industry have become . &quot;
&quot; according to a study , according to a study from the last year of Pag@@ ef@@ air and Adobe is approximately 200 million people advertis@@ ers ; almost four times so much 2013 . &quot;
&quot; with 1.03 billion daily active users who access Facebook over their mobile devices , hand@@ y@@ wer@@ bung 84 per cent of the advertis@@ ements are fac@@ ebook . &quot;
&quot; the company has shown it on sco@@ ops block on desktop PCs , as mobile advertis@@ ers block no effect on Fac@@ ebooks mobil@@ es App for the social network and inst@@ ag@@ ram , shared an spokes@@ man . &quot;
&quot; advertising on desktop PCs makes a sufficient large proportion of revenue , so that Facebook appears to be the investment of such a step as worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared with that it would update his &quot; Display @-@ state ool &quot; to have more control over them over them . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook that Ad@@ blocks would be wor@@ rying about new filters because they would also block content on the page that are not advertising . &quot;
&quot; for users this does not constitute a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , distributed a spokes@@ man on Facebook in an e @-@ mail message . &quot;
&quot; advertis@@ ers are a bl@@ unted means , which is why we have focused on development tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences , to put more control in the hands of the people . &quot;
woman with suspected su@@ icide on Swiss motorway
the victim was in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police call witnesses after spending a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday with a suspected su@@ icide of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident occurred at the A1 near Morges in the canton V@@ aud shortly after midnight .
a woman laid down in the Dark On@@ es &apos; in an act of despair &apos; on the road and were taken by several cars , the police said in Wa@@ adt . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that there was a Swiss population at the age of 49 , who was transferred by several vehicles , including a truck , who wanted to kill myself . &quot;
it still died on site .
&quot; several drivers have already been heard , but some have not been identified still , the police mentioned these as well as any witness of the incident . &quot;
&quot; it has been opened a con@@ ciliation , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter to Le Trib@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot;
&quot; however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown . &quot;
was a cl@@ ash avoid@@ able ?
&quot; this is something that the Pro@@ secutor has to decide , &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers will not be held ac@@ coun@@ table .
&quot; in each of the two cases , one person went on to the highway on the highway - was decided that the drivers will not assume that a pedestrian in the middle of the night runs on the highway as it was in the paper . &quot;
&quot; last year a polic@@ eman of the neg@@ ligent killing was acqu@@ itted , after they killed a man and killed in August 2014 a night at the A1 near Pay@@ erne . &quot;
&quot; the 22 @-@ year old sacrifice had dr@@ unk , and has become unconscious on the street , and took the judgment . &quot;
&quot; the court pointed out that the polic@@ eman -- which had responded to a call -- on a justified way , and that the presence of a man on the road was an &quot; completely exceptional and un@@ fores@@ een situation &quot; , &quot; said the judge . &quot;
anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should be present at the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA Klim@@ amo@@ dell : Venus was once inhabited
the Venus was probably inhabited according to the proj@@ ections of a new NASA climate model probably inhabited .
scientists at the God@@ d@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorith@@ ms that resem@@ ble those of climate research .
&quot; the model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have raised the Venus with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere . &quot;
scientists have previously explained that the slow re@@ fraction of the Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
&quot; but the latest simulation points out that Venus could have had a thin , thin @-@ like atmosphere and slowly turned slowly . &quot;
the model illumin@@ ates also the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; the planet actually referred to more dry areas as de Earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to accommodate life and quickly ev@@ ap@@ oration . &quot;
early Venus benef@@ ited also from a Sun which was 30 percent of Zermatt .
&quot; in the GIS@@ S model simulation exp@@ on@@ ated the slow re@@ ro@@ cket of the Sun almost two months , &quot; explained GIS@@ S scientists Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer of clouds which works like an umbrella , to sh@@ ielded the surface of a large part of the paras@@ ols . &quot;
the result are average temperatures that are cooler than that of the earth are today .
the model brought forth a history of Venus that resem@@ bles the evolution that had previously been susp@@ ended by Plan@@ etary explo@@ res .
although it was once believed to be the Venus -- in the course of several billions years --@@ a lot of heat and ul@@ tra@@ violet light exposed .
their oceans were dar@@ ker and its water vap@@ or was ground@@ ed by the ul@@ tra@@ violet light .
as their hydro@@ gen escap@@ ed only a thick atmosphere of carbon di@@ oxide with a deadly greenhouse effect back -- the Venus we know it today .
the researchers participated the results of her new Venus climate model in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Letters .

&quot; many stars in this constellation , which resulted in approximately 125 million years ago , now we reach the adult . &quot;
they are now turning at the fastest .
&quot; to peak rotating , these gri@@ pping stars emerge large amounts of star@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; since these win@@ ch travel through the magnetic fields of stars , they have a brake effect on the stars . &quot;
&quot; when a star is age , his rotation rate starts to slow . &quot;
Ke@@ pler is the rotation rate of each star where he recognis@@ es the time between the appearance of an recogni@@ z@@ able observ@@ atory -- like sun@@ spots .
the latest catalogue of rot@@ ations@@ advise points out that massive stars s@@ lower than less massive stars .
&quot; Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with larger stars s@@ lower pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; ball@@ et &quot; of the Pl@@ ei@@ aden we see that slow rot@@ ors will tend to be massive , while faster s@@ rot@@ ors to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; since the star@@ gates of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades is so close , it serves as the ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ are qualities such as rot@@ ary rates . &quot;
&quot; the star@@ gates of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; we would like to learn more about what we would like to know more about how , When , When , When W@@ ann and Why stars down their rotation sl@@ ack@@ down and so to say to say their &quot; &quot; dance shoes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Reb@@ ull and her colleagues in three newspaper reports detailed on their latest analysis of the rotation of the Ple@@ j@@ ades , which will soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal . &quot;
a controversi@@ al bas@@ eball @-@ Star steps from
the tears flow@@ ed at Alex Rodri@@ guez faster than the US bas@@ eball @-@ star in best days from Base to Base .
&quot; according to his emotional trac@@ tions , the 41 year old pro will contribute to the Tampa Bay R@@ ays last time the Tri@@ ko@@ t of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es . &quot;
&quot; I love this game , and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &quot; &quot; goodbye &apos; to the &quot; &quot; declared the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star @-@ Game participants of the Major League Baseball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; three times Rodri@@ guez was elected to the most valuable players of the League , 2009 he won the Yan@@ ke@@ es the World Series . &quot;
his signature under a tenth year contract led him since 2007 to 27 million US dollars .
&quot; by the end of the contrac@@ tion on 31 December 2017 , he will serve as a consultant and youth coach - at full content . &quot;
as a player there will be Rodri@@ guez for a long time with performance .
&quot; with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his team ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 he managed some mil@@ estones . &quot;
&quot; with the Hall @-@ of @-@ Fame @-@ members H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e M@@ ays , only two other bas@@ eball player in the most important statistics similar values . &quot;
&quot; however , in the retirement of the bas@@ eball , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old may not be recorded . &quot;
&quot; for so successful Rodri@@ guez - nickname &quot; &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; &quot; - in the field was , so controversi@@ al is his appearance outside the space . &quot;
&quot; already in 2009 the super@@ star at &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; was taken into account between 2001 and 2003 . &quot;
in August 2013 he was locked in the so @-@ called Bi@@ ogen@@ esis sc@@ andal by the end of 2014 for 211 games .
Rodri@@ guez is regarded as the main suspic@@ ious to have spent years over an anti @-@ aging clinic in southern Florida @-@ promoting funds .
after a legal dispute the lock was still reduced to 162 meetings .
&quot; the le@@ ague could even have done a favour for the year 2014 , because I played 20 years without a break , &quot; said Rodri@@ guez back then sweet . &quot;
&quot; again , his f@@ arewell @-@ days did not go silent . &quot;
&quot; while many bas@@ eball legends have once again get the big stage once , Rodri@@ guez had to sit on the bank frequently . &quot;
&quot; my job does not include a f@@ arewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job includes trying to win each game , &quot; Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ardi . &quot;
&quot; after all , Rodri@@ guez was married to the actress of Cameron Di@@ az and the relationship with Pop@@ star Madonna and actress Kate Hudson can@@ cel@@ ed , li@@ ces of fans of the Y@@ ank@@ ee Arch@@ ri@@ vals Boston Red So@@ x . &quot;

Olympia 2016 : Chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are first dop@@ ing@@ es . &quot;
knowing : because of a positive Dop@@ ing probe &apos;s Personal Ziel@@ inski from Poland in Rio do not start .
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 will be over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ amine .
a caught Ath@@ let@@ in would have nearly one Medal .
the first official dop@@ ing of the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro has become known .
&quot; Chinese Sch@@ wim@@ mer@@ in Chen X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter fork sho@@ oters in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa from Bulgaria and the Polish weight of Adrian Ziel@@ inski were positi@@ vely tested and excluded - immediately before the beginning of the already critic@@ ized athle@@ tics cont@@ ests . &quot;
&quot; at Chen , on Sunday we have been proven the di@@ ure@@ tics for hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de , which is used as a masculine means for dop@@ ing@@ sub@@ stan@@ der . &quot;
the International Sport@@ gericht@@ shof in the Friday morning confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games .
&quot; on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old had covered the fourth place in the final over 100 m butter@@ fly , just around 0,@@ 09 seconds , she missed the bronze . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , he would have to take part in the lectures of over 50 m Fre@@ estyle . &quot;
Chen at the International Olympic Committee ( I@@ OC ) the opening of the B @-@ sample and a hearing apply .
&quot; the national association take the matter &apos; very seriously and demands of Chen full cooperation with the studies , &quot; quoted X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sport@@ gericht@@ shof in CAS and will accept the judgment . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in history , it is no longer the I@@ OC but the CAS for the punishment of athletes with positive cases . &quot;
also at the night of Rio sick@@ ens the news about the positive sample at Dan@@ ek@@ owa by the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went to the offensive .
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my four test was positive , &quot; this was an unbelievable shock , &quot; she said the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; it may be inno@@ cent , &quot; the only explanation could be nutritional supplements , &quot; explained the athle@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; according to the report , it should be applied to the bot@@ her@@ ed substance to act the blood dop@@ ing EP@@ O . &quot;
&quot; Dan@@ ek@@ owa was also susp@@ ended sus@@ pen@@ sive , according to B@@ NT , the B test will also be positive . &quot;
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bo@@ y@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ ov reported as soon as criticism of the athl@@ ete .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes do not draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; We Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot;
&quot; thus , about all weights from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing nation cannot take part in Rio . &quot;
&quot; on Friday also the case &quot; &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; , &quot; the London Olymp@@ ics champion in the class up to 85 kg has been tested positive to the an@@ ab@@ ole ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ rol@@ on . &quot;
&quot; both are riding the intake , but they are not allowed to start up to 94 kg . &quot;
before the start of the athletes especially the case Dan@@ ek@@ owa is another heavy blow for the reputation of the entire sport .
&quot; the IA@@ AF Marcotec had the entire Russian team up to an exception for systemic dop@@ ing the start , also the run@@ away Kenya produced in Rio numerous bad news . &quot;
the flo@@ at @-@ sports also had the earlier exp@@ atri@@ ation in China for fier@@ ce disp@@ utes between athletes .
so the Fr@@ ench@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ ou@@ t the Chinese Olympi@@ ad Sun yang har@@ ass .

&quot; when I see the podium over 200 m Fre@@ estyle I will hand , &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ id@@ t on the French radio . &quot;
sun was at the heart of a confrontation with the Austr@@ ali@@ ans M@@ ack Hort@@ on .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing sc@@ amm@@ ers , &quot; said this . &quot;

dat@@ ashe@@ et : so per@@ fi@@ de er@@ pres@@ et h@@ acker her ran@@ som
programmer of black@@ mail malware are currently targeted companies - and they are successful .
&quot; according to a recent survey of the malware of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes among 540 companies in North America , the UK and Germany 40 percent of the survey@@ ed companies in the past twelve months have been at least once , partly victims of attack with com@@ pres@@ ser software . &quot;
in Germany nearly 20 percent of the companies have already been the goal of a Ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail .
40 per cent of the victims are rel@@ u@@ ct@@ antly rel@@ u@@ ct@@ antly by the perpet@@ rators called for the requested systems and data can be used again .
the perpet@@ rators speci@@ alize their Er@@ pres@@ ser software according to the observ@@ ations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes in attacks in company networks .
&quot; if they are successful there , the potential to educ@@ ate ran@@ som is considerably higher than for private users . &quot;
&quot; we observe a fright@@ ening rapid evolution of the damage , &quot; Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ boss Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ z@@ yn@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , most Mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs were still designed to send advertising to advertising . &quot;
then the perpet@@ rators discovered ext@@ ortion software for itself .
&quot; first we were only useless the target , but the change to company attacks took place in the past few months . &quot;
&quot; Ran@@ som@@ ware is working according to a simple pattern : once on the computer of a victim , it searches for un@@ long modified files such as Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ e- or database files as well as for archives of pictures and videos . &quot;
these files encryp@@ ts the Ran@@ som@@ ware and Del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
subsequently the software presents the demands of the pres@@ ser .
&quot; to get the files to the files , the victims must pay money - mostly in the form of Cryp@@ to@@ nutrition &apos;s bit@@ coin . &quot;
&quot; however , where in private use the personal photo database on the game stands , it goes with companies for sensitive customers data or project databases without which the production itself . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the damage falls off when a ran@@ som@@ ware strikes . &quot;
&quot; 22 percent of the German companies affected by Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent were even forced to break business operations , in case of a case , people were in life @-@ threatening . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , several hospitals have been victims of attacks , whose patients can be threatened by the loss of sick@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; we say to the victims always : pays not , it only promotes the problem , &quot; explains Kl@@ ec@@ z@@ yn@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; however , 80 to 90 percent of the companies that pay , get their data again . &quot;
&quot; for managers , it is difficult to reject the demand of perpet@@ rators in the operation of the perpet@@ rators . &quot;
the h@@ acker in turn know this and try to establish a good reputation .
&quot; in a recent study , the security researcher of F @-@ Secure the usage of use and contact with the presses are to be investigated and come to the result : the perpet@@ rators are trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money . &quot;
&quot; they will explain their victims by chat , how they can pay by bit@@ coin , freely accessible support sites or de@@ cryp@@ t free example . &quot;
&quot; and will rede@@ em individuals after payments of a few hundred euros , companies must be partly hard to negotiate and five @-@ dig@@ it su@@ ms to get their data un@@ encrypted . &quot;
&quot; given the potential high and relatively low @-@ risk profits from Ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail@@ ing , the h@@ ackers become more professional and share the work , explains security experts from antiv@@ irus provider Sophos : &quot; a single person can write a Ran@@ som@@ ware circa within a week . &quot;
&quot; however , it is more likely that it is three or four persons . &quot;
the programmer sell their poll@@ ut@@ ants then in the form of a software building on the actual black@@ mail@@ ers .
&quot; the previous malware Kits were created by using the malware themselves , advice and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars . &quot;
&quot; included is an adaptation tool that can be modified smaller configur@@ ations , look and bran@@ ding , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ewski . &quot;
the presses are then looking for further h@@ ackers to spread the fresh and purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service industry .
&quot; so you log@@ ged in one of the forums in the underground , purchases the set by an crimin@@ als and asks a further way to install the software on many PCs as possible . &quot;
the payment is made per un@@ authorized computer .
&quot; usually over@@ wear the crimin@@ als then sp@@ amm@@ ers with the spread , &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ewski . &quot;
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known by many companies that secure their data better .
more than 50 percent of the companies @-@ IT @-@ entities in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey rely on it to convert Ran@@ som@@ ware by file @-@ back @-@ ups and sc@@ ann@@ er@@ software .
&quot; accordingly , the perpet@@ rators already pursue new strategies . &quot;
&quot; if the encryp@@ tion of data alone is not sufficient threat to successful adoption , the perpet@@ rators instead of the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing &quot; , &quot; Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ boss Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ z@@ yn@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the loss of all data is even higher than before . &quot;
&quot; in future , the perpet@@ rators could take completely new goals in the internet of things in the future . &quot;
&quot; on the Hack@@ er@@ Conference Def@@ con demonstrated the security researcher , as they could have received thermo@@ stat under their control . &quot;
in the middle of winter the activation of such a blocked heating could quite be worth a ran@@ som .
&quot; if the do@@ ers then instead of the heating in the future block a whole production road in a factory , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a theme in the Industry 4.0 . &quot;

Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and all @-@ day @-@ day
&quot; in the small HR @-@ V , Honda wants to pack all this : a little SU@@ V , a little cou@@ p@@ é and also the versatility of a min@@ iv@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; it sounds rather un@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , that has been constructed on the same new platform like the new jazz , proves in everyday life as extremely flexible . &quot;
&quot; although the only 1.60 m high HR @-@ V rather small acts , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the f@@ ond , it does not affect any point . &quot;
&quot; the materials of the interior are well finished and work pleasant , just the cock@@ pit @-@ top falls off as something . &quot;

&quot; there is not just a trunk of 45@@ 3 l at high @-@ ranking and 10@@ 26 l with folding @-@ out back@@ rests , but there are the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is less magical when it sounds like the seat of the back@@ bank , like the chin @-@ flo@@ cks , and thus provide storage space , which is high from the floor up to the ceiling 1.@@ 24 m high . &quot;
&quot; the trunk is well loaded , but the Lad@@ der above is a little higher than at the comparable Peugeot 2008 . &quot;
&quot; the tested 1,6 @-@ l @-@ Diesel with 88 kW / 120 HP speeds the HR @-@ V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in large speeds of very powerful . &quot;

cred@@ ited vac@@ ation@@ ers after their trip will only get money back if the cause of the disease is undoubtedly free in the hotel .
&quot; however , this is only the case when more than ten percent of the guests have discussed the same symptoms . &quot;

but the organis@@ er was only driving shortly before leaving the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs .
he had to assume until then the sea water was fine .
&quot; so he did not hurt his information , so the judgment . &quot;
especially since the rehear@@ s@@ als of the water are not found contamin@@ ated .

&quot; de Ma@@ izi@@ ère said , according to the refugees of violence in Würz@@ burg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people would have taken care of further proposals . &quot;
the state must be ob@@ struc@@ ted and decided at the same time act on terror at the same time .
&quot; sure , our country will not answer the power of the perpet@@ rators with hate and split . &quot;
this triumph we will not treat the terrorists .
&quot; if crimes would have to leave faster the country , the security and strength also increase the consent of the population for the refuge@@ e policy . &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère wants to achieve an implementation of proposals until the Bundestag election .
&quot; he also announced a further personnel strengthening of the security forces , namely &quot; in medium @-@ scale sizes over several years . &quot;
sympath@@ ies for terrorism must be back under punishment .
&quot; video surveillance should be improved , that the ce@@ as@@ ef@@ ight@@ ing can be used quite so , especially the purchase of weapons on the Internet . &quot;
the last much discussed swe@@ at work for doctors should remain intact after de Ma@@ izi@@ ères words .
&quot; however , he wants to look for solutions in dialogue with the physicians , as the endanger@@ ing of the citizens could be reduced , he said with a view of about psych@@ ic symptoms . &quot;
&quot; to counter a radi@@ cal@@ ization of refugees , the Minister keeps a better social support necessary . &quot;
teachers would have to be better prepared for dealing with trau@@ matic people .
the persecution of crimin@@ als in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) plans to plan de Ma@@ izi@@ ère the use of covered investig@@ ators .
&quot; SPD manager Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to increasing safety . &quot;
it is important that the Interior minister have clearly spoken against shar@@ ehol@@ dings .
&quot; this was a ear@@ ring for the sni@@ ff@@ ers in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel said the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke MEDI@@ EN@@ G@@ RU@@ P@@ PE ( Friday ) . &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had previously rejected ro@@ uter from the Union to a Bur@@ ka ban and the abolition of the double nationality .
a gener@@ ative ban on perfection is constitu@@ tionally problematic .
&quot; one cannot cover anything , what you reject , and I lo@@ aves the wearing of the Bur@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; today , one could talk about rules about in traffic or for witnesses before judgment . &quot;
&quot; green @-@ boss Simone Peter cast the Minister , he wanted to simul@@ ate with always new anti @-@ terror par@@ ishes and wr@@ ong@@ ation . &quot;

better traffic on the motorway exit
it looks regularly on the map @-@ road - here a picture of November .
but this should change : the legal agreement should be extended .
&quot; this is good news for all Auto @-@ drivers , who are standing in professional traffic on the ambient road every night in the St@@ au , when they drive over the highway to go to Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) . &quot;
&quot; the country @-@ company was extended by the coming Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between the Hammer Street and the exit Wes@@ eler Straße , the right @-@ bo@@ iler station around 700 meters . &quot;
drivers can then go directly from the Hammer street on the right .
&quot; the great advantage : the traffic shares early @-@ time , thus reducing the complete charge of the Bundes@@ straße 51 will be improved . &quot;
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U Group in the districts of Münster @-@ West .
the driving force on the Zu@@ br@@ inger N@@ ER@@ VT is the driving driver especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
week@@ days dates back to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ her Road and sometimes also beyond .
the reason is the con@@ i@@ fers at the B 51 shortly before the exit Wes@@ eler Straße .
&quot; from here , traffic is only accessible via the motorway bridge . &quot;
the second track had to be returned to a quarter of three years ago .
&quot; the reason : static calculations had revealed that the bridge is no longer required force , in order to first absor@@ b the heavy traffic bil@@ ingual . &quot;
&quot; as long as this Eng@@ pass , and the associated denomin@@ ator will not take place , the competent authorities cannot say . &quot;
&quot; however , with years to calculate : because the bridge has an official le@@ ase duration up to the year 2034 . &quot;
&quot; for the extension of the legal agreement , the country has become aware of the busi@@ est time in the school holidays , because with disabilities is to be reck@@ oned . &quot;
the traffic will take place on Tuesday and on Wednesday at the site .
intercultural travel : cultural activities for schools
&quot; the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the theatre &quot; &quot; The invisible house &quot; . &quot; &quot;

&quot; the association N@@ ima &apos;s association enables young people with mig@@ rational and refuge@@ e cross , cultural institutions in Münster . &quot;
the &quot; class International &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Kinder@@ haus has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; The invisible house &quot; of the Young Theater Münster .
&quot; in the context of the association N@@ ima &apos;s &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural journey &quot; &quot; we visited 19 students between eleven and 15 years of st@@ aging in the small house . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the association , which has set up the cultural integration of young people with mig@@ rational and refuge@@ e background , schools with welcome classes , as part of this project cultural institutions in Münster . &quot;
&quot; most young people in the class were between September 2015 and March 2016 , among others from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria had come to Münster , and br@@ acket little German . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the chore@@ ograp@@ hies , the scen@@ ographic images and vide@@ oc@@ ations would have been possible to follow the course of action , so the press release of the boys Theater Münster . &quot;
&quot; the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az Wester@@ berg , and the Young Theater will work together in the coming season as part of a musical history project . &quot;
&quot; from October to December youth@@ s , young people with and without flu@@ ences and migration background between 14 and 20 years the opportunity will receive professional courses in the fields of singing , dance , acting , and music . &quot;

rain instead of star@@ ving : hope on weather @-@ better
the weather has the observ@@ atory gu@@ ck@@ ers in the southwest of Germany in the night to Friday a con@@ rich through the bill - but there is still hope .
&quot; the night be well suited for clouds and rain , the cel@@ est@@ ial spect@@ acle to observe , said the Chairman of the Observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Fri@@ day@@ morning . &quot;
our hope lies on the night to Saturday .
&quot; the weather should be good , then we certainly see many star@@ ches on the sky . &quot;
&quot; in the star@@ shed , it is per@@ sil@@ ken , which are with 216@@ 000 kilometers per hour at the fastest stars . &quot;

relaxing night : tips for ins@@ om@@ nia
&quot; in the evening , one finds himself etern@@ ally around , at night there is ho@@ oting long , in the morning it is long before the wake @-@ up sl@@ ing no longer to think about sleep . &quot;
this is anything but relaxing .
&quot; after all , one has been with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute about a quarter of adults sle@@ e@@ om@@ nia and over ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently rather relaxing . &quot;
how do you think about sleeping problems or sleep ?
&quot; there are several forms of sleeping disorders , and there can be many different causes underlying them , empha@@ sizes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ i , a member of the German Society for sleeping @-@ research and sleeping . &quot;
&quot; but what you understand , is the In@@ som@@ nie , therefore a single and diarr@@ hea . &quot;
&quot; moreover , many people feel as uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , says Jens Wag@@ en@@ ne@@ cht , member of the Board member in the German house physician , with practice in the &quot; &quot; Nieder@@ s@@ ächs@@ ische Var@@ el &quot; . &quot; &quot;
what is behind sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ?
the causes of ins@@ om@@ nia are complex .
&quot; it can be organic , psychological , or contamin@@ ated factors , but also medication . &quot;
it is not rare is the sleeping disorder expression of a different disease .
&quot; very early w@@ aking up is especially in depression often , &quot; &quot; says We@@ e . &quot;
and it may be that various factors face each other .
&quot; for example , who has a band &apos;s name can lie poor , wake up all the two to three hours and begins to p@@ onder@@ ous about all day issues and take care of p@@ onder@@ ing , there is such an example . &quot;
&quot; this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible . &quot;
when should one be with ins@@ om@@ nia to the doctor ?
&quot; who has not sle@@ eps over a period of one month in at least three nights per week and is affected by the day , should go to the doctor , betra@@ ying We@@ e . &quot;
&quot; the impair@@ ment can look quite differently : one is down@@ cast , tired , un@@ exhausted , has difficulty with the attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood fluctu@@ ations or physical complaints such as stomach or head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; to re@@ lie@@ ve the ins@@ ul@@ sive disorder , it is important to find out their causes . &quot;
&quot; as the treatment options include code changes , cognitive behavi@@ oral therapy or even drugs - classic sleeping tablets only in emergency waste and most for two weeks - in@@ query . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , Prof. Ingo Fi@@ etze , Head of the interdisciplinary sleep at the Char@@ ité Univers@@ ität@@ smedi@@ zin Berlin . &quot;
&quot; for this reason you should contact sleep , first in sleeping . &quot;
it can be resolved with exam@@ inations if the problems have a physical cause .
who should go into the sleeping laboratory and what happens there ?
&quot; to examine in the sleep laboratory care physician , for example when snor@@ ing with breathing difficulty , in sleeping @-@ minded day @-@ fatigue or if one does not find the cause of a diarr@@ ho@@ ea , explains bul@@ lets . &quot;
to prepare for exam@@ ining it is actually not necessary .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; only please do not make lunch &quot; , &quot; says Fi@@ ber . &quot;
after the wir@@ ing one goes to the bed of his normal time .
&quot; in addition to the electro@@ des on the body , one carries a nose @-@ br@@ ille , a chest strap and a cycl@@ ist on the finger . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a camera stands on the blank@@ et to the sleeping . &quot;
how can the problems get the problems get into the handle ?
there are quite a lot of set @-@ bol@@ ts at which you can put for a better sleep .
&quot; We@@ ap@@ ses counts on : regular sleeping and ste@@ al times , not too long in bed are not to sleep , not far away to sleep , alcohol or at night - then you start immediately to expect , and that is quite and not con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve . &quot;

&quot; in a country where a Olympi@@ ad 20.000 € 20,000 , and a jungle k@@ ick@@ ed 15@@ 0.000 € should no one should be surprised about missing Med@@ als , wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old on the night to Friday on his Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; the convey@@ ing system in the swimming @-@ sport is bad , the Dop@@ ing@@ controll@@ able however very good . &quot;

airport : Ban@@ de of Car@@ rier
professional th@@ iev@@ es at the airport Düsseldorf
&quot; civilians of the Düssel@@ dor@@ fer , on Thursday the arrest of two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 years . &quot;
the Tatra susp@@ ects had been committed to as a ban@@ en for multiple pick@@ po@@ ckets and baggage di@@ vers .
&quot; against 21.@@ 30 p.m. , civil servants took up a gang in the area of the airport Düsseldorf a gang , which was known for polic@@ emen from past theft . &quot;
&quot; the two women and two men had committed several del@@ ights since mid July this year , and were very professional , worked and especially professionally . &quot;
&quot; the specialists of the cid @-@ Com@@ miss@@ arians 34 may have entered the th@@ iev@@ es , the peculi@@ ar of crimes against Germany were submitted to four actions . &quot;
&quot; they had a total of over 15,000 euros . &quot;
&quot; built @-@ in , a few Lind@@ b@@ äum@@ chen , a few Lind@@ enb@@ ach@@ et : the Riga Street in Berlin @-@ Friedrichs@@ hain has not been working on the first glance , but the police are among the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; walk down the street from the east to the west , one passes to play grounds , a fresh@@ en nur@@ sery and a Bi@@ ol@@ ades . &quot;
&quot; to the fac@@ ade of a gray house , someone has ugly ! &quot; spra@@ yed . &quot;
&quot; in front of a Li@@ dl , who is to be demol@@ ished soon , is already built : up to 2017 , it is supposed to be a house with high windows and 133 new rentals . &quot;
&quot; article about this &quot; trendy neighborhood &quot; , &quot; as the permanent real estate company Friedrichs@@ hain is called in the last weeks , however , preferred by burning cars . &quot;
&quot; the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile have occupied the inhabitants of le@@ athers , but on the ground floor are still spaces occupied and are used for events . &quot;
especially the Berlin Inn@@ ens@@ en@@ ator H@@ enkel had been around since the beginning of the year several times for a hard procedure of police against the project called &quot; No @-@ Go @-@ Zone for polic@@ emen and the 94 as a starting point of autonom@@ ous violence .
&quot; after 22 June the rooms were cleaned on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ smith , with 300 police officers , the police took three weeks to official statements according to 30 to 40 officials and three Mann@@ ec@@ ey on the ground , blocked parts of the road and held visitors to enter the house with the number 94 . &quot;
meanwhile the renovated building workers in order of the un@@ familiar home@@ owners the rooms .
&quot; on July 13th , a Berliner Board agreed that the clear@@ ance was illegal , and one day later the police and builders under the rejo@@ icing of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents . &quot;
&quot; in this summer morning the street peac@@ ef@@ ull : parents go with children , sitting on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others are talking about it . &quot;
in the immediate vicinity of the building projects are a primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens .
&quot; le@@ ft@@ ist violence is not the main concern of many residents : Kerst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer that lives in the area since 1999 in the area , and Jana * , who runs here three children from the police officer . &quot;
with the inhabitants of the building projects they share the concern of rising co@@ aches and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
it does not sound after a Kie@@ z who wish to find mostly polic@@ emen in front of v@@ andal@@ ing Left .
the dit@@ ch which the Berlin Inn@@ ens@@ en@@ ator and the police between the occup@@ ants and their neighbours does not exist .
&quot; Friedrichs@@ hain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working quarter , which also has a low average age compared to the rest of the city . &quot;
&quot; also land@@ lords and the two @-@ born projects are a long time to the Kie@@ z : 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , among them almost the whole Main@@ zer street very close to the Riga . &quot;
&quot; while the Main@@ zer had been cleaned in a down@@ right street , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Riga and partly still inhabited by the people they occupied 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the district has become increasingly becoming a magnet for tourists and elect@@ oral liner from around the world : with them now residents of GDR are now sharing their neighbourhood . &quot;
&quot; this also makes it noticeable in the Mi@@ eten , which has risen almost 60 percent since 2009 . &quot;
&quot; many of the buildings in the Riga are attacked as symbols for this development : one recogni@@ zes them in r@@ asp@@ ed sli@@ ces or fresh@@ ly painted fac@@ ades , which were raised with color cut@@ ters . &quot;
no other road was mentioned so often together with the words &quot; left @-@ autonom@@ ous violence . &quot;
&quot; one reason for this not all neighbours that could be seen as a problem , could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : off@@ ences as body vulnerable , according to statistics according to polic@@ emen . &quot;
the biggest part of the criminal off@@ ences do justice from that tend to be more the new@@ builds and newly renovated houses .
&quot; for Kerst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a rental house next to the controversi@@ al 94 for 17 years , can no talk of uncertainty . &quot;
&quot; in terms of violence , it is more important : people in the 94 are their neighbours , who would not have been that . &quot;
also the famous burning cars put it right at the Riga had no longer any longer .
&quot; for the studied lady , her street is not a cid focal point , on the contrary , &quot; here you will find each other , lives together on the street and gets more each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has moved to the Riga Street and remained .
&quot; therefore , it was also so important that the residents returned to their street : from the police , politics and the media , which in July all suddenly claim the interpretation of the city in July . &quot;
&quot; but in the eyes of In@@ habit@@ ants such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road will continue to take away : by the se@@ al@@ ous re@@ constructions in former buildings that im@@ pris@@ oned the ancient inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; these are finally con@@ domin@@ ium that are not interesting for many here - here rather people who are not so well concrete , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; violence and destruction I cannot produce absolutely healing . &quot;
&quot; but what should be done , if one does not listen to someone ? &quot;
&quot; there is also frustration on all aspects of frustration , also with the police and the inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; for re@@ drawn , who like more than colour bom@@ bs , Kerst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the rash and the left scene belonged to the neighbourhood . &quot;
&quot; who desc@@ ends , should be aware of it - just like anyone who moves into a pub district there can be bad about noise . &quot;
all people only agree with names of pre @-@ names are asked not to be called by their right names
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is a new refuge@@ e
Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person for integration and organis@@ ators .
&quot; furthermore , it is social working . &quot;
since July Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is the refuge@@ e prison for Ur@@ bach .
the social ped@@ agog@@ y supports the team of managing Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
&quot; she sees himself as contact person for all actors : refugees , workers &quot; refuge@@ e aid , administration , authorities and who else will be mis@@ erable . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine client of the labor force indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the hum@@ ili@@ ating wool wool , which above all has a problem . &quot;
&quot; thus , some - less sp@@ ot@@ ting than rather on the multitude of sublime tasks focused - meant as the administration wanted to write . &quot;
&quot; looking for a administrative force with a talent for languages and people , connected with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social labour , just a thri@@ ving wo@@ unds . &quot;
&quot; but administration is not its central area , Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le mean . &quot;
&quot; above all , it is about organization , work with local people and also behind the scenes as well as networks . &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for approximately six weeks .
it has a 50 @-@ percent spot over three years .
&quot; it was highest time , &quot; Reg@@ ine client says that Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le Ehr@@ ing and the full @-@ time actors supported . &quot;
&quot; there are large and small problems , organis@@ ational , human and understanding problems . &quot;
soon there are new containers in the Was@@ en@@ strasse
&quot; a serious problem , it has been recognized for some time , apartments for the inter@@ loc@@ alities who have been recognized . &quot;
for the connection provision the municipalities are responsible .
you need to accommodate the refugees in your own or rented living rooms .
the cost of the construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must carry the municipalities themselves . &quot;
the responsibility changes from the Land@@ scape with local and Job@@ center .
&quot; problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer its apartment . &quot;
the search has been designed for some time than very difficult .
de fac@@ to finds the administration no private apartments .
&quot; it does not work so far , in this case you are dependent on priv@@ atives , so d@@ eu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; therefore , our enemy &apos;s apartments must be ins@@ ulated as it is so beautiful . &quot;
&quot; so , soon new containers are placed in the wash@@ basin . &quot;
but only with apartments it is not done .
&quot; perspective is the keyword , the Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le agree . &quot;
&quot; besides a fixed stay , there are tra@@ inees , training courses , school@@ grounds , One @-@ euro @-@ jobs and caring activities for refugees and migrants who have to be established or furnished . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer . &quot;
&quot; many work in the construction farm or help m@@ ates , do non @-@ profit work - and motiv@@ ates and very neat , such as Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
it hopes that the work leads to a positive influence on a positive influence .
that was &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
activity but not only work .
&quot; the day does a solid structure , say D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le and customer . &quot;
the people would have to develop a belonging .
&quot; so , there are offers such as sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses . &quot;
professional courses are rare .
&quot; so , you also jump to administration and volunteers . &quot;
&quot; it is central that the refugees get the feeling , they were welcome in Germany and welcome . &quot;
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; you must declare the refugees that it just takes and it can make sense for them , for example with language courses . &quot;
&quot; if some of you have developed the feeling , he could not work in ur@@ bach anyone or may not work , and be useless , who will never be integrated . &quot;
the distinct majority is motivated .
&quot; but there are also , customers are honest , &quot; people in which nothing goes on . &quot; the work of D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le and Customer is therefore always willing to motiv@@ ate others . &quot;
all this is already an &quot; mam@@ mot@@ h task . &quot;
&quot; a difficult question : did the two of the most recent inci@@ dents are afraid of radic@@ alisation , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; no , Reg@@ ine client says quite clearly , &quot; &quot; what is some become nai@@ ve . &quot; a resi@@ dual risk could and would not turn it out . &quot;
sensitive were the hel@@ pers already .
these inci@@ dents are also subject to refugees .
they would have fear that the attacks bring them completely in dec@@ ei@@ ving .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer . &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
&quot; thus , the main and community of volunteers do need to look for activities in the region and in the region . &quot;
they always keep in the background that soon a new impact on refugees and migrants would come to Ur@@ bach .
need Germany a cap ?
&quot; this question is clear to answer , ref@@ ute the policy . &quot;
&quot; actually , it is unfair to put them hel@@ pers on the ground . &quot;
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we have not yet arrived , where we want to go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; no new refugees , which would be able to relax . &quot;
Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bacher are already doing so that the people have been reasonable .
&quot; currently , these are about 100 people , mostly young men . &quot;
&quot; but when people are in need , they must help them are both women agree . &quot;
the political situation is so complicated since there is no easy answers .
Sp@@ orn@@ dorf : bur@@ gl@@ ars with helicop@@ ter wanted
the police helicop@@ ter flew about one hour long in different areas - un@@ successful .
two unknown men are penet@@ rated at Friday morning at 8.@@ 50 am and penet@@ rated into an apartment in a multi@@ run house in the Lind@@ en@@ weg .
the inhabitants surprised the two and beat the un@@ hol@@ low into the flight .
&quot; the two men were about 1,@@ 65 to 22 metres tall , probably mas@@ cot , both Blu@@ e@@ je@@ ans and black hoo@@ ded pul@@ lis . &quot;
they were in the direction of the city center .
&quot; for the icing , the police took several stri@@ pes , as well as a police helicop@@ ter . &quot;
the flag@@ ging ran without success .
maybe the unknown was actually near the apartment or on their escape .
