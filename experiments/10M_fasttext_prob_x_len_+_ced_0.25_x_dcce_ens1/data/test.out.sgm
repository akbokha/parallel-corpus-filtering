<seg id="1">Clinton and Trumps Economic Policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">"we invest in infrastructure and prevent trade agreements TTP, both Clinton and Trump."</seg>
<seg id="3">"however, the two U.S. presidents are however on the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental request."</seg>
<seg id="4">"differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a basic, rather philosophical difference."</seg>
<seg id="5">The role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep in doubt rather small and be warned about how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulators.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Clinton wants to testify the economy to death and regulate death, he says."</seg>
<seg id="8">"for it itself would be quite different, Trump claims."</seg>
<seg id="9">"he will turn to the regulations, and he will be strong for a wide tax reform with lower tax channels - for individuals and for companies."</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton said: the state has certain tasks to meet, he disadvantaged chances and needs money. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"therefore, taxes for the rich would increase, says it."</seg>
<seg id="12">"interestingly, both are very close to infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in which it must be invested, Trump and Clinton said almost literally."</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic Candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in the infrastructure are classic democratic policy and are strictly rejected by the state-critical Teatiy-wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So on Trump you might still have an impartial discussions.</seg>
<seg id="17">"clearly, the differences in energy and climate policies are concerned."</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-power plants and back the coal-promotion in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil's oil is also possible to be possible to terminate the Paris climate agreement as far as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Clinton, Clinton wants to extend and calls for renewable energy with their investment Programme:" "a country becomes the superpower of clean energies and create millions of jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I will say that we are."</seg>
<seg id="22">"however, not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other."</seg>
<seg id="23">"TPP, the transporter, do not want to sign."</seg>
<seg id="24">"at the same time, both the US does not want to isolate the US not only from international trade - but simply to protect American jobs."</seg>
<seg id="25">"that should then be better paid, calling for about Clinton."</seg>
<seg id="26">"the current minimum wage of 7,25 US dollars is a hunger."</seg>
<seg id="27">It will increase her to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"what Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says, he says, he says, he should not be changed."</seg>
<seg id="29">But the great discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the control policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the one hand, Trump, who wants to dismiss the economy and citizens to boost growth."</seg>
<seg id="31">"his critics hold him in front of him, so that the budget deficit would only be even bigger."</seg>
<seg id="32">"on the other hand Clinton, who wants to ask at least from the rich that they pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution."</seg>

<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are overweight.</seg>

<seg id="22">"it is not exaggerated to say: every woman who comes here, has made her escape experiences with sexual violence," says Bahr. "</seg>

<seg id="31">"even here, women would often be regarded as inferior and worse than inferior and worse."</seg>
<seg id="32">"this means that about 90 percent of women who live in the accommodation in the Munich north, traumatized them."</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children certainly have not voluntarily developed."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women were so used to say nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or she does not dare to speak openly about the experiences, because the shame is too big."</seg>
<seg id="36">"as they often do not help to assist, there is more accommodations only for them, calling for bear."</seg>
<seg id="37">In Bavaria the seven districts of refugees are in charge of the accommodation of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="38">"on the question whether they are wasted from a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction, answer some with no."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in the Oberpfalz and Oberfranken, there is something like something in the ties of the government."</seg>
<seg id="40">"even in Schwaben alone, women are not divided separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, Pressenprecher of the government."</seg>
<seg id="41">"in Oberbayern, Lower and Mid-Franconia, are available in some common meetings or own homes only for incoming women and their children."</seg>
<seg id="42">"the exception is Lower Bavarians, there are two central accommodations solely for women."</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended up a crisis.</seg>

<seg id="4">"but when Vladimir Putin took his Turkish counterplayer in gold-plated room of St. Petersburg Palastes in the reception, I can not oppose the intrusion that Ankara will most want this reconciliation."</seg>
<seg id="5">"there was the precipitation, yes."</seg>

<seg id="7">"Recep Tayyip Erdogan however repeatedly spoke of his" "dear friend" "- according to a report all five times."</seg>
<seg id="8">I could no longer count.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also spoke that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but can even improve."</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day described a newspaper that Erdogan could have heard so as if it would never happen a bit worst.</seg>
<seg id="11">I seemed to be a enthusiasm rather to suggest the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin radiant, sustainable coolness showed that the state of Russia had forgotten nothing."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing that he mentioned in his introductory marks: the shot of a Russian fighter plane in the Syrian border by Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow at the time was wutary burned.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Putin condemned and provoked Ankara, Russia to be fallen into the back."</seg>
<seg id="16">Leaving was even greater since it was committed by a alleged friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Unbalanced again will be difficult if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"for months, the state-controlled media led a fierce, unrestricted attack on Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at once, it seemed as would the Turks for everything to blame."</seg>
<seg id="21">"serious officials were the allegations of conductive officials that had benefited their own family from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria, which will be controlled by the so-called Islamic state."</seg>
<seg id="22">He did this vehement.</seg>
<seg id="23">"but in St.Petersburg the official message was, that it is time to look forward."</seg>
<seg id="24">"finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received from the President Erdogan the excuse he wanted to hear."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a sort of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Ankara, the advantages of a cease-fire is clearly obvious."</seg>
<seg id="27">"Erdogan needs first and all the friends, which he can get, after having spent last month at a failed coup in almost his ministry."</seg>
<seg id="28">Repetitive terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him also.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on Charteristics, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year."</seg>
<seg id="31">The number is gone by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in Russia, travel agencies and charter companies will be easier, if the flights are added again."</seg>
<seg id="33">You are counting on a late-seasonal onslaught of the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week prognostic cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agrarian imports will be allowed again.</seg>
<seg id="35">"a report in Vedemosti forms it as follows:" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is furiously angry at the West as it has been response to the tried to take power over a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">"to this end, the persistence Groll come across the snail-accession negotiations and Putin - the pike to pull out from the cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the west."</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian leader won in Ankara with security a bonus that he had requested for the elected coup in favour of the elected state organe.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is well-deserved for Moscow a self-evident that even has a deep fear of regimechange.</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit in this glanzful Palace at the sea allowed Russia and Turkey, one as it once described me an analysts of once described," alliance of outsiders "depicted: two countries that can be confused by the West and are badly treated and now."</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two still."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the greatest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave the role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey are contradictory pages."</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be signifying that after almost three hours of first place the President at the press conference said that they had not even striped the issue.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the president of Turkey rent it clearly on a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize."</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no definite consensus on how a common denominator can be found to Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">"but after months of open hostility - and in the light of potentials for a perfect discaster, as NATO member of Turkey aboss the Russian fighter jet, it is certainly better that the two leaders are at least talk with one another."</seg>

<seg id="8">1972 in the Estonian capital Tallinn, he made his degree at the renowned State of Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in Tokyo. "</seg>
<seg id="9">On the web site of the Kremlin it was (in Russian) that he later was the manager and staff members of the government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"about his appointment he said to Putin," "thank you for your trust."</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as a state leader regarding legislation and controls the implementation of your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday with that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convince the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergey Ivanov was for a long time one of the narrowest trusted Vladimir Putin's and works as he was for the Soviet secret service.</seg>
<seg id="16">As a rod captain he was one of the most powerful men of the country.</seg>

<seg id="21">"but the official claim - that a man, who once was called to be potential President, he would like to guide the Russian environmental policy - came across great scepticism."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in his comments on Putin, which is quoted on the website of the Kremlin, Ivanov said it is true that I asked you in early 2012 in a conversation I could almost say - to trust this very complicated post for four years."</seg>
<seg id="23">"as it turns out, I have been Chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months."</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously he was Deputy Minister and Defence Minister.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin former member of the SGB's security services.</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the late 1990s, when Putin was Chairman of the Bundessicherhouses (FSB) was appointed by the KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his deputy."</seg>
<seg id="28">As a Putin on the power he called Ivanov as one of five people whom he was most familiar.</seg>
<seg id="29">"once, Ivanov was named after Putin's second term as president of Russia, as a third term in the coup against the Constitution."</seg>
<seg id="30">"but this post was taken from another, closest allies Putters, Dmitry Medvedev."</seg>

<seg id="2">The SPD and Green My: investors should in future be much stronger in the future.</seg>
<seg id="3">How does one react to the bad news that Brunswick will lose nearly 1300 to the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="4">The SPD is proposing a "action concept for the next step."</seg>
<seg id="5">But dispute is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">Primarily is the question: who is supposed to build the cheap apartments actually?</seg>
<seg id="7">A policy is missing.</seg>
<seg id="8">"SPD leader Christoph Bratmann writes:" "we are committed to the Greens: who wants to build on urban areas in the future 20 per cent of all the housing as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="9">"however, the cheap apartments can also arise in the stock."</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the town hall of the town hall, however, as Bratmann:" how do you want to build investors, who want to build on private surfaces? "</seg>
<seg id="11">"we want investors to build on such areas at least 10 per cent, but as possible as 20 percent of housing as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="12">"a new urban housing program, which will cost millions of cost and will still be financed, must provide for incentives."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the problem, as Bratmann:" there is no agreement between the groups at the moment. "</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to make investors as few as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left is still aiming for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">"regardless, as Bratmann, flag is an intensification of the situation on the market-market."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the action concept is implemented, which will provide additional tasks in the construction administration."</seg>
<seg id="18">More personnel is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">"however, the program is not entirely different: for the around 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but how do you compare the loss of further around 1300 cheap apartments, whose funding will run in the coming years?"</seg>
<seg id="22">It will be 500 apartments alone until the year 2020.</seg>
<seg id="23">"to prevent this, the planational Speaker Nicole Palm, should now be sold out of the city now."</seg>
<seg id="24">"furthermore, the apartments would have to be thought to get back into the delivery."</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the west city.</seg>
<seg id="26">On one stroke the problem can solve.</seg>
<seg id="27">Because in the west town there are the annual dates back to the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments one could get there back into the price connection for affordable housing.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: these are the owners who do not want the owners.</seg>
<seg id="30">"for the number of social housing in the Western town is again dramatically, it is removed from the goal of the so-called diarrhea."</seg>
<seg id="31">There is no longer a concentration of social weak in just a few neighborhoods.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens expect that there will be movement in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">"leader Holger Herlitschke says:" "for a wide majority must use the CDU into the boat."</seg>
<seg id="34">I have concentrated on more construction sites for family-families.</seg>

<seg id="4">"at Pokemon Go, it is about to get people from the sofa to get more active."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the time on the screen was initially on TV, then limited to video games and last on smartphones."</seg>
<seg id="6">"therefore, it is great to see that technology and activities cannot be mutually exclusive."</seg>
<seg id="7">"of course I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an App which is based on the characters, first created for videogames in the 1990s (later emerged from a drawing series, game cards and other spin-offs)."</seg>
<seg id="8">"like many phenomena of the Popculture, the interest in front of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand in the beginning of July."</seg>
<seg id="9">Launching in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that the server overloaded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days Pokémon Go more users than Tinas and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">"in short, players go outside with their smartphone to the outside and search for Pokémons that are followed by a GPS as soon as they were once found," photographed "(on a screenshot on the phone) or" captured. ""</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was even younger than she joined the Wahn and sprang out for the sofa.</seg>

<seg id="15">"Cardiographs, a App for Apple Watch, the 35.000 users reprosecuted, distributed by the Washington Post recently concluded that within two days of the launch of the game, the number of nights followed by 45 percent to 53 percent."</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays the Pokémon Go - it just sees the raw data to improve performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"many public advice campaigns for health, people want to take a" 30 minute time "to come from the sofa" and "to be active every day, because many public messages are boring to health and come from people who look elly."</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overrated."</seg>
<seg id="19">Who regularly drives sport regularly reduces its chances of cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">"physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but the wonderfull of Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something in the open, that gives them fun."</seg>
<seg id="22">"thus, three pillars of health covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine, and fun."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people are close on the hunt even new friendships.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always there is mürric gamation that have always to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">"and yes, someone might run against a door."</seg>
<seg id="26">What is it meant to be?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even when a smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to follow our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to do sports such as this game does."</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its charm and the use will be refreshed with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, due to Pokemons's success there will be more games to join the apps and virtual reality with the activity in the real world and will help many people on the hunt, active, fitter and healthier."</seg>

<seg id="4">"before the distractions of each object, it used a luminometer to show themselves and to show us on what he will get."</seg>
<seg id="5">"but the experiment, which was filmed under the title" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "brought some surprising results to the daylight."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the thought, the dishwasher of a train toilette, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive but actually there are in a kitchenette more bad bacteria."</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe Mr. Wright with doctors and medical experts talk about the promotion of intestinal bacteria as well as his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">"fortunately nothing left, what he did, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known to test the firmness of his intestine by travelled through the world and ate peculiar as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">"from public funds to train stations up to dishwasher of toilets, the task made his immune system definitely under a sample"</seg>
<seg id="11">"in the film he told:" already as a child I was relatively unconcerned about what my health is concerned and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and sammable water. "</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he was definitely righteous in his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"the only thing he ablished, was a dirty public toilet in Russia."</seg>
<seg id="14">Its commission-line showed a half-range of over 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">"compared to this, the Luminous number of fresh washed hands is less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but there was a Russian toilet, which he refused to postponed, after its lapse-number over 4000 units was, while fresh washed hands a little less than 60"</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of Milk Products Valio produced the Reisefile 's Guide to Inner Strength' that shows the bacterial number of different places like the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the film he says," This comes the worst, what I have to do in a toilet, close. "</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing scarlet than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I'm going to do nothing here because it is here inside.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, was produced in collaboration with Finnish producers of dairy products."</seg>
<seg id="22">"the company performs Mr. Wright with Valve Gefilus, which contains both Lactobacilli and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="23">Validation Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "we really wanted to offer the consumer something new."</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time the benefits of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">"we led crazy Brainstorming through, the so that we said, Let us call us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in intestinal health is to a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">"instead of speaking about the products we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in the intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide more information on an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">"Tom Hakala, who led the direction of the film, added:" "let me say so - I had gotten my respect for Ian, if he had put some of the things that I have directed to him, just like the ekelective Russian toilette that will be shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">"of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to bring them, and others, with which this was quite difficult."</seg>
<seg id="32">I am glad we recorded some of these dirty delicacies.</seg>
<seg id="33">"in one of valiant survey conducted by 2015 joined 84 per cent of all respondents, especially with the wellness of stomach and intestine and 58 percent said that they use at least occasionally products that included both Lactobacillus."</seg>

<seg id="25">And with some points - in the imtreatment of Gedi for example - the question arises: what does this really have to do with security and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">"yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terror."</seg>
<seg id="27">"but it cannot be put into departure, that the assassinations of Ansbach and Würzburg Refugees were."</seg>
<seg id="28">"furthermore, many people were worried about the high level of refugees concerned about safety."</seg>

<seg id="2">Lonely men middle age love records.</seg>
<seg id="3">"before you go to the comment section, to sow him under the pseudonym of non-lack of men with rinsults, this statement is derived from the current data."</seg>
<seg id="4">"according to YouGov, the multiplication of sound-plates do not want to welcome on a boom in millennials who want to welcome the novelty of physical objects but to midlife nostalgia."</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have recently bought a record are all foresight after the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact the age group of 18-24 is the most likely kid group.</seg>
<seg id="7">"it is also not a hordes through hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older sheet-players keep their feelings more likely to spend (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it, alone time (69% vs. 66%)."</seg>
<seg id="8">But do the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">"if this blog would be a news report on TV, I would follow me the camera while in the midst of a busy road in Soho's walk, a humble way I consider, my hands hold and something to say like:" so, let's take a closer look at it. "</seg>
<seg id="10">"so, let us take a look at it."</seg>
<seg id="11">"even if the heart is slowly moving to its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent seller is located - there are still a handful of fantastic record."</seg>
<seg id="12">"I would probably ask the cameraman, to turn the camera to the next part in which I am standing in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind through observation."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Stuart Tank from Glasgow, 55, whom I am from Sister Ray (Data attendees: eight men aged men) into the Reckless Records (Data attendees: eight men middle age), a woman, probably around the 20), is a day long because of a meeting in London and passes through the shops to fill the few hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collectors I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I already appreciate," says he. "</seg>
<seg id="16">"I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates."</seg>
<seg id="17">"this soundboards, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I am not followed to him), dress the walls of his sitting room."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles, the result of his available income: he is now able to buy plates when they appeared and again buy objects that he sold, when he was young and pless."</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy, are from the late sixties, early 70s who appeared when I was 11 or 12. things, where I probably was too young to buy them," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"he is true that those who buy plates, more introverted and would like to spend time alone, and adds:" I don't smoke and I drink not very much. "</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my Laster.</seg>
<seg id="22">"WEZ, 25, who works with Sister Ray, believes that many customers who meet, to meet the YouGov profile."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, he has also noticed a new wave of people who have influenced by the media of the media, people who have heard about the comeback and causes you to buy their old records again."</seg>
<seg id="24">"from the talks I have led, people usually have emptied in 1998 or 1999 of their collection."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers who once bought their records in order to buy CDs, sell their CDs to buy their records again," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom to the towing of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a shop like Phonica to recognize that record stores a soothing community of equals.</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to WEZ, some of the older customers participated in the contactless payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to withdraw to the stability of familiar sound-plate linens of objects to alert the happineeship.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the colt of a void or possession of the possessions as a kind of consolation," says WEZ. "</seg>
<seg id="32">This is as collectors I am so and I think it is so in many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to employ spiritually.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "we are like their social worker!" "we have a staff of a record-pile."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a survey of the ICM in April unveiled that nearly 50% of the people, the last month have bought a record, they have not yet heard."</seg>
<seg id="36">"the survey also found out that 41% have a record player that they never use, while 7% of those who buy one plate, do not own record players."</seg>
<seg id="37">"at this time of the news report, I would probably look very concerned while I blossoms through a pile of Bossa Nova Comilations."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (Data: three men middle ages) has noticed a" "trophy" "of the precinct."</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone recently came here purely and said," I have never got a record player, but I would like to buy a radiostead record, so that I can put it into the shelf, "</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is not a big percentage, but it is definitely happening."</seg>
<seg id="41">More products-lasty, less musiclastig. "</seg>
<seg id="42">"we have people who say," I have no turntable. "</seg>
<seg id="43">"these are younger people, not older, who only slowly come."</seg>
<seg id="44">"Fopp, which has almost a whole floor, has a blower audience when I follow."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenager and women middle ages."</seg>
<seg id="46">"even if the atmosphere is a little less relaxed than in the aforementioned stores, Wild Beasts neuester Synthesizer- and sexed Pop instead of experimental jazz and accustomed from the loudspeakers - it is good to see such diversity among customers."</seg>
<seg id="47">"neither of them sees peculiaringly lonely, but nagging psychic traumas are difficult to be adjustable if one stands next to someone over 30 seconds."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Elanora, 27, runs around in the store for some minutes and looks at the varietaker of sale."</seg>
<seg id="49">It is more likely to make a mannequin than a big one.</seg>
<seg id="50">"it does not deserve a lot, so the collection of records is not a real option, says it."</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs much.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it is easy to hear music from a computer or other way, but the beauty of records is..." it drives with a loving sigh. "</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it really is unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">"my last stop is a business, which is said to have inspired a new generation of turnaround: urban Outfitters."</seg>
<seg id="55">"as I give the voucher to sample the jeans hotspots that group for a moment about Polaroid cameras, before a father and his daughter is superior to buy a crosley turntables."</seg>
<seg id="56">"on the left there is a staircase, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"no one sees them - perhaps because they are only purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to grasp them."</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record-art."</seg>
<seg id="59">"but considering that every attraction for these objects could mean more money for the industry and to send some customers in the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain."</seg>
<seg id="60">"it is not a surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, even the one that is most common for luxury items like plates."</seg>
<seg id="61">"even if my research shows that the results of YouGov vote, let them at least in turntables in Soho, the great number of female collectors and record owners who exist in reality, record stores and in Onlineforen."</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard in school or in offices.</seg>

<seg id="12">"it grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years an Hockeyschläger in hands (her two older sisters played the sport at the Drexel University), with 16 years she was the national player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team."</seg>
<seg id="13">They missed the Olympiad in 2008 because they could not qualify for the cadre.</seg>
<seg id="14">"then came the year 2012, in which for her and her team was all shifted."</seg>
<seg id="15">"in the subsequent year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, coach of the National Team and thus began to turn things to better."</seg>
<seg id="16">"a cultural change, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam. "</seg>
<seg id="17">We did not have the working space in London that we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have the rod completely around.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening Bam opened the Torreigen in the first half of the game with a retreat from the closeness.</seg>
<seg id="20">India was gone without a victory in the tournament but the team showed themselves surprisingly heavy and held the game stand from 1-0 to the third quarter up to the play in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">"she accomplished one sprint with the flat ball on the left side flank, then moved to the center and invited the ball into the gate to get the Americaners 2-0 guidance."</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quartet.</seg>
<seg id="23">"the Shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the door-keepers of the USA, Jackie Briggs which previously had to book a gate in any of the previous games."</seg>
<seg id="24">It has a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">Just like Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"we are in a good position" said Parnham, but how well is on Saturday from the result of the next game on Saturday. "</seg>

<seg id="1">"amid the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline"</seg>
<seg id="2">"wherever you are, how late it is, there are the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro feel resistant and inescapable to be a rapid increase between competition and aspirations.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is as if the olympic fackel itself is a burning stab, which is used by the braceans on the turn for the turn to the turn."</seg>
<seg id="5">"you cannot read the TV, read a paper or listen to your neighbors in the queue in the queue without about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos."</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is still Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Dooley who is the first time for the first time in the Olympic Games and a women's black with dimples, could certainly have been sent to the Prime Time, built up to Prime Time, built by sponsors and well-good TV advertising if he would be a swimmer, turner or even freal."</seg>
<seg id="8">"but Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting in the olympic trampolines around gold."</seg>
<seg id="9">The olympic flame does not illuminated any event identical.</seg>
<seg id="10">"further from the center, partly in the shadow are the sports that are not generally recognised: air conditioning, archery, badminton, Taekwondo."</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast swimming and let it be long.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but if I might want to make humble arguments for my particular darling, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="13">"although the trampoline jump already since 2000 a olympic event, when it had been in Sydney since 2000, it was perceived to be the last 16 years so many that, I didn't know that it is a Olympiasportart at all."</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">"although the USA sent athletes to the competition, it has never had a medal in a trampoline and had made up a athletes that has made it up to the end."</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and Russians tend to share the prizes for the men and the Chinese and Canadians share the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Si from China and Roshe MacLennon from Canada this year will defend their gold medal from London.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the trampoline jump a certain outdoor hotel, partly because it does sound for the unenlightened ear more suitable for a clowning school than that sounds for the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am not an expert but only a bearer enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">"it has humorous potential - the cartoily trembling of his never to end, but also the refinement of the rotation and diving, the two sports that it essentially combines."</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El trampoline as much means as "springboard."</seg>
<seg id="22">"firing winners jump on a giant trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a series of falling movements (rotate, clave and saltos) before landing on the feet."</seg>
<seg id="23">"you will be evaluated according to the official Olympiad after execution, difficulty and" flight time. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"two-eight athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women are to compete in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">"hoping to go further in their pursuit of gold, faster, upwards and drüber, sometimes up to the finish, sometimes back and back, up and down at the bottom of the playground."</seg>
<seg id="27">They are not only the accordion or the starting point but in the television transference is also another height: the world or the Olympiad.</seg>
<seg id="28">"the purposeful aspiration is nobel, admirable, even fanatical - and it is enough to get even a spectator to tears."</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I feel when watching these games as something tiresome.</seg>
<seg id="30">It offers trampoline an atempause.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A preceding movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">"he or she bounced, seemingly hard-elos like an astronaut, go up, then down, then effortlessly back up."</seg>
<seg id="34">"there is also a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, just the dreamy, elegant uplifting of time and gravity."</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition with the Olympic Games could only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the qualifying and ends of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in the streaming about 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00."</seg>

<seg id="6">"over the last ten years, it was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid association of West with a fast growing economy."</seg>
<seg id="7">"but in the past few months, protests against the government the country and turned into more and more areas."</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people rushed to the streets and slowed fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The answer of the government was unmerciful according to human rights organizations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses given that policemen were killed on zig-armed protesters and killed.</seg>
<seg id="11">"in circulation, videos over the protests, which are probably from the last or beginning of this year, show how security men can hit young people with shocks while these were forced to make a handstand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The Chief of the UN Agency for Human Rights is now calling for an outgoing investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it was always difficult to maintain this country and will even become more difficult," "said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group."</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is still the most populated country of Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopian forces to fight terrorism across the region, particularly in Somalia. only few countries in Africa, if at all, get so much western aid."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopian economy expanded in the temporal tempo.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">"roads are usually quiet, safe and clean."</seg>
<seg id="19">"although Ethiopia is far from being a model for democracy - human rights organizations have ongoing suppression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted, with dispensate effective to silence."</seg>
<seg id="20">"many were sent into exile or prison, killed or driven to the wilderness of the desert."</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you are suppress people and these no other options have to protest out, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopian. "</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protest.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protest.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous ailments which cover everything from the bumps to stranglehold in relation to power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">"after a widespread choice last year, the ruling party and its allies got the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time, the tensions continue along the border to Eritrea; a battle for these jagged, controversial line for June hundreds of life."</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists as the Oromo-liberation front or the national liberation front of the Ogaden which were more or less imposed over the last few years and arms themselves.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness after years of divultures under the surface now explode.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only in recent years, many Ethiopian were able to communicate using social media, as cheap smartphones have always been more common and improved services."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government lock the access to Facebook and Twitter what they are at regular intervals, especially with protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxies that hide where they are staying."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopian gave them that they gathered so as protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"since elons, Amharas, continues to come from Ethiopia, mainly Christian highlands, in politics and economics, while the Oromos exploit, of which many Muslims are living and living in lowland areas."</seg>
<seg id="37">But even this is changing straight.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are going to coordinate under a umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos. "</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests were in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many Amharas and Oromos have dominating the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray that are approximately 6 percent of the population and that are dominant in the secrecy, trade and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr Meles, a former rebel leader, was up to his death in a non-publicized disease during the year 2012 17 years of Ethiopian Prime Minister."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was regarded as tactical genius, a man who could think of the corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that it was especially versibly to make early signs of dissatisfaction and unauthorized to use opponents and to make them undamaging.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the present regime is lacking in this basic skill," "said Mr. Abdi, a conflict-analyst."</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopian new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, has been selected for relatively recent reasons to take the position of Mr Meles. "</seg>
<seg id="47">"unlike Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray region in northern Argentina, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he enjoys not enjoys the confidence of the security of the Tigable security services.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time Ethiopia was witnessed such a turmoil was in 2005, after thousands against elections, the according to the statements made by Analyst's apparently originated by the government and then stolen."</seg>
<seg id="51">"during the subsequent raids were killed many protesters, even if there were less than in the last months and this time of unrest went relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"developing experts praised Ethiopian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commoners, as well as for their measurable progress in poverty alleviation."</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the internal misdeeds of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"the last month of the protesters in Gondar, an amharhic city, of Tigray guided businesses and the hate opposite the Tigray will always be more common in the social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that protests are the USA and other Western allies to a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American government used Ethiopia as a basis for pressurfers via the neighboring Somalia, even if they were recently deed that it has closed this base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"while the West will clearly support democracy, he does not want to collapse that his exile in an already volatile area collapsed."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," "said Mr. Abdi," "is a very thin congratulations."</seg>

<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Grönlandhaie usually come only in winter to surface.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to a study on board the Sanna's approach to the sea.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and swims with a good 1 km / h by the North Atlantic - to date.</seg>

<seg id="9">This of long-term life-made lifestyle seems to be a patchiller for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues are reporting in the magazine" Science "at any rate of a Greenland, who could be 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="11">"insanity," said Alexander Scheuerlein by Max-Planck-Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life-span, which means a world record for vertebrates. "</seg>
<seg id="12">Indeed the evolutionary biologist has long been that Grönlandhaia are stony.</seg>
<seg id="13">Just lacking the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Grönlandhaie are difficult to observe, eventually they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the low density coast of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen."</seg>
<seg id="15">"because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees centigrade, dive at the surface usually only in winter."</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland researchers according to little.</seg>
<seg id="17">Her timlupentempo maize them when they built up six animals with a transmitter.</seg>
<seg id="18">"prey do this sharks nevertheless: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbones of a young ice-bears."</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly they are sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the Eismeeres and are looking for carcasses that are from higher water layers to bottom torches.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Julius Nielsen and his colleagues investigated 28 Grönlandhaie, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in Greenland or Spitsbergen from the depth of the North Atlantic."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the smallest Shark was just 81 cm long, while the biggest 502 centimeters."</seg>
<seg id="22">"to determine the age of the animals, they are using the carbon-14 method to the lenticists of sharks."</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eyelid is already born before the birth of the sharks which are contained in the proteins will no longer be renewed.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had strikingly much carbon-14 in the lens.</seg>
<seg id="25">"after the early 1960s, your birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s, as nuclear-weapon trying larger amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in which with 220 centimetres length third-smallest animal contained the lens-14 from the nuclear-weapon-14, it is likely to have celebrated his 50th birthday in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="27">All major Grönlandhaie had in their lenticism against normal carbon-14 amounts that arises from cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">"in fact, the carbon-14-clock showed a 493 cm long Greenland, a age of 335 years, during the record shark with 502 centimeters even 392 years old might be old."</seg>
<seg id="29">"the Greenland-female only then get offspring, when they are longer than four meters, was known."</seg>
<seg id="30">"now, the researchers have been able to assign up the length of the length."</seg>
<seg id="31">"as one of the animals were at the threshold with 392 centimeters at the threshold to the sexually mature couple and his age was determined with 156 years, Greenland sharpened with the multiplication obviously at least one and a half centuries."</seg>
<seg id="32">Also this is likely to be a Worldrecord for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusaleme live mainly in icy waters is not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">"also the previous record holder, a 211 year old Grönlandwal, in whose bacon the neck an 120 year old Harpopunk pointed out, was captured before Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="35">"due to the low temperatures, the organism and the body of the living animals live in asflames."</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and intslower.</seg>
<seg id="37">"to keep in cold water warm, the animals are also often particularly big."</seg>
<seg id="38">"because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal feed heat."</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much larger than at one gram elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should concentrate on it, as soon as possible as many offspring as possible, explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein."</seg>
<seg id="42">A very big animal should invest his resources more likely to invest in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="3">"for me, it was the biggest attraction of Heathrows, just as at that time in 2012, when we operate a great deal of effort to ensure that all of our nations and regions were profited."</seg>
<seg id="4">The Olympiad brought great advantages for Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And we will be able to achieve new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.</seg>

<seg id="8">It was told me that England will never be ready for the games and that we will blaze on the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">The two-flats in 2012 are wrong and they are also wrong with Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="10">"there are always obstacles to the overcoming, but Heathrow answers every question."</seg>
<seg id="11">Like the Olympic Games is Heathrow for many and not for single infrastructure project.</seg>
<seg id="12">"enlargement is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion in witty growth and to leave a bequest of skills and employment both to leave the airport and in the whole UK."</seg>
<seg id="13">"we have made a great team in Heathrow, which has been implemented a £11 billion most expensive infrastructure program in time and budget, from the T5 - the five years in a row to the world's best airport."</seg>
<seg id="14">"now, they are ready to deliver a third catwalk, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment."</seg>
<seg id="15">The London Games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is time to expand this olympic mind and create Heathrow as well as our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment to be proud of England.</seg>

<seg id="2">Programmer of blackmail malware are currently targeted companies - and they are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">"according to a recent survey of the malware of Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, the UK and Germany 40 percent of the surveyed companies in the past twelve months have been at least once, partly victims of attack with compresser software."</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany nearly 20 percent of the companies have already been the goal of a Ransomware blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 per cent of the victims are reluctantly reluctantly by the perpetrators called for the requested systems and data can be used again.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize their Erpresser software according to the observations of Malwarebytes in attacks in company networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">"if they are successful there, the potential to educate ransom is considerably higher than for private users."</seg>
<seg id="8">"we observe a frightening rapid evolution of the damage," Malwarebytes-boss Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world." "</seg>
<seg id="9">"in 2008, most Malwareprograms were still designed to send advertising to advertising."</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered extortion software for itself.</seg>
<seg id="11">"first we were only useless the target, but the change to company attacks took place in the past few months."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Ransomware is working according to a simple pattern: once on the computer of a victim, it searches for unlong modified files such as Word-, Excele- or database files as well as for archives of pictures and videos."</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypts the Ransomware and Deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">Subsequently the software presents the demands of the presser.</seg>
<seg id="15">"to get the files to the files, the victims must pay money - mostly in the form of Cryptonutrition's bitcoin."</seg>
<seg id="16">"however, where in private use the personal photo database on the game stands, it goes with companies for sensitive customers data or project databases without which the production itself."</seg>
<seg id="17">"accordingly, the damage falls off when a ransomware strikes."</seg>
<seg id="18">"22 percent of the German companies affected by Ransomware, 13 percent were even forced to break business operations, in case of a case, people were in life-threatening."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Germany, several hospitals have been victims of attacks, whose patients can be threatened by the loss of sickness."</seg>
<seg id="20">"we say to the victims always: pays not, it only promotes the problem," explains Kleczynski. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"however, 80 to 90 percent of the companies that pay, get their data again."</seg>
<seg id="22">"for managers, it is difficult to reject the demand of perpetrators in the operation of the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="23">The hacker in turn know this and try to establish a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">"in a recent study, the security researcher of F-Secure the usage of use and contact with the presses are to be investigated and come to the result: the perpetrators are trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they will explain their victims by chat, how they can pay by bitcoin, freely accessible support sites or decrypt free example."</seg>
<seg id="26">"and will redeem individuals after payments of a few hundred euros, companies must be partly hard to negotiate and five-digit sums to get their data unencrypted."</seg>
<seg id="27">"given the potential high and relatively low-risk profits from Ransomware blackmailing, the hackers become more professional and share the work, explains security experts from antivirus provider Sophos:" a single person can write a Ransomware circa within a week. "</seg>
<seg id="28">"however, it is more likely that it is three or four persons."</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmer sell their pollutants then in the form of a software building on the actual blackmailers.</seg>
<seg id="30">"the previous malware Kits were created by using the malware themselves, advice and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars."</seg>
<seg id="31">"included is an adaptation tool that can be modified smaller configurations, look and branding," says Wisniewski. "</seg>
<seg id="32">The presses are then looking for further hackers to spread the fresh and purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service industry.</seg>
<seg id="34">"so you logged in one of the forums in the underground, purchases the set by an criminals and asks a further way to install the software on many PCs as possible."</seg>
<seg id="35">The payment is made per unauthorized computer.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually overwear the criminals then spammers with the spread," explains Wisniewski. "</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known by many companies that secure their data better.</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 percent of the companies-IT-entities in the Malwarebytes survey rely on it to convert Ransomware by file-back-ups and scannersoftware.</seg>
<seg id="39">"accordingly, the perpetrators already pursue new strategies."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if the encryption of data alone is not sufficient threat to successful adoption, the perpetrators instead of the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing", "Malwarebytes-boss Marcin Kleczynski."</seg>
<seg id="41">"in this way, the loss of all data is even higher than before."</seg>
<seg id="42">"in future, the perpetrators could take completely new goals in the internet of things in the future."</seg>

<seg id="22">"problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer its apartment."</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been designed for some time than very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto finds the administration no private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">"it does not work so far, in this case you are dependent on privatives, so deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="26">"therefore, our enemy's apartments must be insulated as it is so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so, soon new containers are placed in the washbasin."</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">"perspective is the keyword, the Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree."</seg>
<seg id="30">"besides a fixed stay, there are trainees, training courses, schoolgrounds, One-euro-jobs and caring activities for refugees and migrants who have to be established or furnished."</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," says Regine customer. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"many work in the construction farm or help mates, do non-profit work - and motivates and very neat, such as Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="33">It hopes that the work leads to a positive influence on a positive influence.</seg>
<seg id="34">That was "no employment therapy."</seg>
<seg id="35">Activity but not only work.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the day does a solid structure, say Deuschle and customer."</seg>
<seg id="37">The people would have to develop a belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">"so, there are offers such as sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses."</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">"so, you also jump to administration and volunteers."</seg>
<seg id="41">"it is central that the refugees get the feeling, they were welcome in Germany and welcome."</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"you must declare the refugees that it just takes and it can make sense for them, for example with language courses."</seg>
<seg id="44">"if some of you have developed the feeling, he could not work in urbach anyone or may not work, and be useless, who will never be integrated."</seg>
<seg id="45">The distinct majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"but there are also, customers are honest," people in which nothing goes on. "the work of Deuschle and Customer is therefore always willing to motivate others."</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already an "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">"a difficult question: did the two of the most recent incidents are afraid of radicalisation, even in a small community like Urbach?"</seg>
<seg id="49">"no, Regine client says quite clearly," "what is some become naive." a residual risk could and would not turn it out. "</seg>
<seg id="50">Sensitive were the helpers already.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have fear that the attacks bring them completely in deceiving.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine customer. "</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">"thus, the main and community of volunteers do need to look for activities in the region and in the region."</seg>
<seg id="56">They always keep in the background that soon a new impact on refugees and migrants would come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Need Germany a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">"this question is clear to answer, refute the policy."</seg>
<seg id="59">"actually, it is unfair to put them helpers on the ground."</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we have not yet arrived, where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle. "</seg>
<seg id="61">"no new refugees, which would be able to relax."</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbacher are already doing so that the people have been reasonable.</seg>
<seg id="63">"currently, these are about 100 people, mostly young men."</seg>
<seg id="64">"but when people are in need, they must help them are both women agree."</seg>
<seg id="65">The political situation is so complicated since there is no easy answers.</seg>
