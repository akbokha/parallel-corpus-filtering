Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not exactly at ease .
the two wanted to discuss the implementation of the international agreement as well as about Teh@@ er@@ ans dest@@ ab@@ ili@@ ating actions in the Middle East .
&quot; but at the meeting , it should also be the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two @-@ state solution . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu was charged for years .
Washington has critic@@ ised the permanent settlement of Israel and thro@@ ws Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will during the peace process .
&quot; through those of Obama , Deal with the Iranian nuclear program , the relationship of the two continued wor@@ sen@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; in March Net@@ any@@ ahu had held a controversi@@ al speech at the call of the Republi@@ can before the US Congress , which partly was considered an aff@@ ront to Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not talking with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with regard to the election of the imm@@ in@@ ent election in Israel . &quot;
&quot; in a cl@@ amation , Professor , his girlfriend shot down &quot;
in a cl@@ amation Professor Sh@@ annon , with a somewhat z@@ itt@@ y voice of the police , that he has shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house . &quot;
&quot; it was important to emphasize that his &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; but still live and probably be excited , and he said , the family out@@ ed of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; within the house the officers took the Lei@@ f of Amy Pr@@ un@@ iss and a hand@@ written note that was f@@ ritz@@ ed on a white block , I could not return , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
&quot; he had no indication that he experienced in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland , Mississippi , accommod@@ ated , already 300 miles to the school grounds , E@@ than Schmidt , shot at the door to his office and killed . &quot;
Delta State University Poli@@ sten@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard the Sh@@ oot at 10 : 18 a.m .
he said he has made his g@@ ful Emer@@ ging some@@ time after that .
&quot; by the end of the day , there was another death : lamb took the life when the police took him into . &quot;
&quot; a day after the shooting in the university , the students and teachers were forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what he &apos;s motivated . &quot;
&quot; the details published by the participants at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees , who knew him , helped him to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher to record . &quot;
they said they were looking forward to his instruction .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ iss died , he did not have a history of violence or criminal pre@@ history . &quot;
&quot; he was mentioned in a book written by him in one of him , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both were lab@@ eled in the Department of Social sciences and History , whose fac@@ ulty has 17 members , and many students visited courses of both . &quot;
at the same time there were some tenden@@ cies towards problematic behavi@@ ors .
&quot; he &apos;s a student , Bran@@ don Be@@ a@@ vers he &apos;s pra@@ ised , he also seemed a little excited and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that Lamb told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
he had previously asked the Delta State University to have asked a be@@ g for health reasons and told that he may have some health problem .
this year he has only collected two online courses .
&quot; the latest changes in the employment policy of the university meant that the promotion , which he had worked for so hard , would not represent a guarantee of an automatic way to an adjustment when assistant Professor . &quot;
&quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs idea . &quot;
these are questions which he cannot answer any more .
&quot; after the flight out of the campus , the police took place Lam@@ bs Spur , when he returned to Mississippi from Ark@@ ansas . &quot;
&quot; before he could be arrested , he kept it with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents &quot; house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , said Washington County Cor@@ niche Meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car went still to the dri@@ v@@ eway .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why lamb went to this house , but Johnson said she thinks he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
Lamb grew up in the area .
&quot; he began his work at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a town with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and established Ge@@ ography and Pa@@ ed@@ ago@@ gi@@ k . &quot;
he pro@@ mo in the spring of ped@@ agog@@ y .
&quot; one of many years of friends Lam@@ bs spoke it as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny . &quot;
&quot; Carla H@@ air@@ ston said , she was 15 and he was 20 , when they met through joint friends . &quot;
&quot; she and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool older guy who tried a few years to teach you the guitars . &quot;
he was then at the time of women &apos;s black .
&quot; all the girls were mel@@ ted for when he was there , &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson subur@@ b of Bran@@ don . &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ iss were obviously some time together .
&quot; in the cl@@ amation one said , &quot; I have killed my wife , &quot; but there was no matter of a marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick building , which is adjacent to a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier . &quot;
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ un@@ iss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ ste@@ en , said they were di@@ vor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and one daughter who now was 19 years old . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed at the floor , &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en over his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ ste@@ en said he never met , but he did not hear his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail , he was interested in music and blues playing . &quot;
Lamb met Pr@@ un@@ iss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail started both three years ago on a summer volume .
&quot; later , they played together one or the other gig . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ ste@@ en said , his daughter writes and sings their own music . &quot;
Pr@@ iss was a nurse who worked out online for various businesses .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a b@@ art@@ ender and sometimes entertaining co @-@ ordin@@ ator at The Jul@@ ep Room , a weak@@ ened bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he &apos;s Lamb and Pr@@ un@@ iss Night at night 5th of September did it end prior to a sp@@ ard@@ ent audience . &quot;
there was no signs that something was not right .
&quot; simply a happy couple , &quot; he said . &quot;
we were at the beginning of austerity and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of pleas@@ ant@@ le .
&quot; Schmidt , the Dead Professor , led the first semester @-@ in programme and specialised in American u@@ cle@@ ans and colonial history , &quot; said Don Allan Mitchell , a English Professor at school . &quot;
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Emp@@ oria State University in K@@ ansas and was the president of his Fr@@ at@@ ernity and the student &apos;s Committee .
&quot; at the Delta State campus in Cleveland , on Tuesday evening , about 900 people , including teachers , employees , students and members of the community participate in a cand@@ l@@ el@@ ight memorial ceremony . &quot;

Amy and Ro@@ gel@@ io Soli@@ s reported from Cleveland , Mississippi . &quot;
&quot; associated Press authors Em@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report . &quot;
&quot; this story has been correct@@ ed to dis@@ agre@@ es that the police now says that he had shot the call , and that Lamb sh@@ aken in his call of pron@@ unci@@ ation as his wife , but there was no indication of that the two have ever got married . &quot;
Toys R Us plans to set up less work@@ force for Christmas time
&quot; Toys R Us says that there will not be so many Christmas season employees as last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give up the current time with him employees and the season &apos;s employees , to work more hours . &quot;
&quot; the company said that it was planning to present 4@@ 0,000 people in shops and marketing centres in the whole country . during the Christmas season there were even 4@@ 5,000 workers . &quot;

&quot; while the holidays are even more months away , the Christmas markets get closer , and businesses are preparing to hire out periods to equi@@ p shops with employees that sell , ship and products deliver . &quot;
Michael J. Fox j@@ okes about his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a big moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theatre waiting for the Roy@@ als , and I mer@@ ke that the seat is empty beside me , and it will gradually give me clear that Princess Diana is sitting next to me , &quot; &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the film begins , and it comes to me that I have a si@@ mu@@ red guest@@ ps and a working length of it , with the princess of Wales at a date . &quot;
&quot; back in time , a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Lea Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and the producer Steven Spiel@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; back for the Future &quot; was 30 years ago .
&quot; it really is for me , &quot; said toy , &quot; un@@ du@@ ly the greatest newspaper film , ever was ever shot . &quot;
&quot; back in time &quot; will be on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cinemas in October . &quot;
&quot; UN leader says , there is no military solution in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Secretary General Secretary General of K@@ i @-@ Moon says , its response to Russia increased greater military support for Syria : &quot; &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of nearly five years of lasting conflict , and more weapons are mer@@ ged against violence and misery for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN @-@ boss calls for once more parties , including the UN Security Council , to unite and integr@@ ative negotiations to finding a political solution . &quot;
&quot; B@@ an said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to discuss the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the end of the Ministers meeting of the General Assembly in this month to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
he deeply regret that the divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers have in@@ sol@@ vent .
&quot; B@@ an called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria , that they have proven to have proven nuclear deal with Iran in achieving a nuclear deal . &quot;
&quot; 8 Exten@@ sions , showing that Donald Tru@@ mp is serious to take . &quot;
some have tried to hit him as a flop to brand @-@ brand brands .
others have done him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tru@@ mp from the upper ranks of surveys , it has ( yet ) not working . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tru@@ mp in the double @-@ dig@@ it area , and some begin to wonder what it means for the chances of nomin@@ ation of the real estate . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is still too early in the election @-@ period . &quot;
none claims that Tru@@ mp will probably win the rep@@ ubli@@ can nomin@@ ation .
experts emphas@@ ise that at that time in 2011 Rick Per@@ r@@ ys was given a tour on the rising Herman Cain , who did not win a state into the nomin@@ ation process . &quot;
there are many reasons why he would have had to fight in a general election .
but out@@ going groups like J@@ eb Bus@@ hs Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognise tur@@ mo@@ il per@@ sever@@ ance and begin to flow their dollars to rush him .
here are some current conversion values that suggest that the real estate @-@ Mo@@ gu@@ l is not only a temporary phase :
Tru@@ mp@@ s Beli@@ fi@@ red values have turned around 180 degrees .
&quot; shortly before Donald Tru@@ mp has announced his can@@ did@@ acy in the middle of June , a survey of Mon@@ mouth University was that only two of ten Rep@@ ublic@@ ans saw the real estate in Mo@@ gu@@ l . &quot;
until the middle of July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
&quot; now , six of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive opinion of Donald Tru@@ mp . &quot;
about three out of ten say that they have a negative opinion .
and these figures remain in those early states .
a quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in Iowa has found last week that 60 percent of the Republi@@ can have a good opinion of Tru@@ mp .
two thir@@ ds of the GO@@ P voters would be happy with Tru@@ mp as candidates .
&quot; in a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week 67 percent of rep@@ ublic@@ ans , they were either &quot; &quot; thrilled &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; satisfied &quot; &quot; when Tru@@ mp was nominated . &quot;
&quot; only two of them are saying they were &quot; angry , &quot; if he would be the candidate . &quot;
&quot; only Ben Car@@ son creates roughly the same enthusiasm as Tru@@ mp ( 43 percent say they were &quot; delighted &quot; vs. 40 percent , who say the same over Tru@@ mp ) . &quot;
the next in matters of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of rep@@ ubli@@ can voters say that they are &quot; &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; angry &quot; , &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favourite of the Est@@ abl@@ ishment , a candidate . &quot;
a majority of the Republi@@ can sees Tru@@ mp@@ s temper@@ ament as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tru@@ mp is widely critic@@ ised for its bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive @-@ winning statements , 52 percent of the Republi@@ can Irish voters assume that real temper@@ ament should have the right temper@@ ament for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number is in the first pre @-@ state state of the nation , the state of Iowa , where the same 52 percent of the Republi@@ can think that he has the personality for a Supreme Commander , according to Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to execute effectively and say nearly six of 10 Independent that his temper@@ ament is not to the White House P@@ asse , so ABC / Post . &quot;
Republi@@ can voters acc@@ ust@@ om to the idea .
&quot; when they set up their money , rep@@ ubli@@ can voters Tru@@ mp for real . &quot;
&quot; if they are asked , who most sought the GO@@ P nomin@@ ation , say after a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C from the past week four out of ten that Tru@@ mp was the best bet . &quot;
this is a change from time when four out of ten end their money down to J@@ eb Bush .
complete disclosure : GO@@ P @-@ voters had not been the clear@@ est crystal @-@ ball in the past .
&quot; at this time in the last cycle four out of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans , that Rick pul@@ ler had to win the nomin@@ ation over only 28 % for the final candidates of Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot;
yet that a variety of GO@@ P @-@ voters shows that a variety of GO@@ P @-@ voters &apos;s campaign can be plau@@ sible .
&quot; even when the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans gathered around a different Candi@@ date , Tru@@ mp will still strike almost everybody . &quot;
&quot; some experts point out that the sh@@ atter@@ box is likely to contribute to Tru@@ mp@@ s leadership , while the anti @-@ tru@@ mp support is spread over more than a dozen other candidates . &quot;
&quot; but a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ race between Tru@@ mp and most other rep@@ ubli@@ can candidates , Tru@@ mp have re@@ ap@@ ed the most advanced support . &quot;
&quot; he has written before Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points ahead , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , ahead of Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally in front of Paul , John Ka@@ dir and Chris Christ@@ ie 33 points . &quot;
it is a head @-@ an @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who strikes it ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ an @-@ race .
a scar@@ let majority of Donald @-@ Tru@@ mp @-@ fans says that they have formed their mind .
&quot; a new pol@@ l of CB@@ S / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters , support the Tru@@ mp , say that they have chosen their votes . &quot;
&quot; of course , a lot can happen to change that , and no one can truly say never to change the opinion . &quot;
&quot; 46 percent said they let the door open , in order to change to other candidates . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless Tru@@ mp@@ s is the strongest competition at the moment of other out@@ sider , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters said that they have formed their minds are twice as common for Tru@@ mp . &quot;
six of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they coinci@@ de with Tru@@ mp in the subject of immigration .
&quot; since then Donald Tru@@ mp was called in his election , two months ago &quot; &quot; immigrants from Mexico &quot; &quot; was called immigration and fishing in the public dis@@ course . &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tru@@ mp will hold the key Hisp@@ ano @-@ Americans from the Republi@@ can party and to damage the re @-@ orientation efforts .
&quot; but after the new ABC / Post survey of Monday , six of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans had to agree with Tru@@ mp in issues related to immigration . &quot;
&quot; so long as the immigration to the li@@ mel@@ ight remains , Donald Tru@@ mp will apparently do . &quot;
the frustration of the government climbing on new high@@ s .
&quot; by Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son , there is now half of the support of rep@@ ubli@@ can voters , especially through their out@@ sider @-@ status . &quot;
six of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days survey conducted by ABC / Post ; they prefer a political out@@ sider as someone with government experience .
and they are also angry at Washington .
a survey conducted by D@@ es Mo@@ ines Register / Bloom@@ berg in Iowa two weeks ago showed that three out of four Iowa Rep@@ ublic@@ ans over the rep@@ ublic@@ ans in Congress are frustr@@ ated by 54 percent .
&quot; Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co. : the five most exclusive living in Germany &quot;
here in the H@@ ook@@ out residence you find the most expensive homes - with a view over the North @-@ East River .
in the street it costs a square met@@ re of a territory in the section 7@@ 3.@@ 300 Euro .
&quot; on Sy@@ lt , the offer of objects is naturally limited , i.e. it says in the study - hence the high price . &quot;
a new study reveals in which particular l@@ ests a square meter the most cost .
&quot; of course , € 18,@@ 70 per square metres for a student in Munich are not really little . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to Germany top locations , one of the price does not come from a pe@@ anu@@ ts . &quot;
the real estate service providers of Engel &amp; Völk@@ ers has released a rank@@ ings of the most exclusive German living sites - with square met@@ abolic rate in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
&quot; there are some ten thousand Euros - per square meter , well @-@ master@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; well , who can do it ... &quot;

Champions League : Bavaria @-@ dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ z
two @-@ time sc@@ orer in Pi@@ re@@ aus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller made simply a run .
a happy setting by Thomas Müller eb@@ ald the FC Bayern the way to a earned 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Piraeus - then went .
a sou@@ l@@ ull of the Champions League season .
&quot; the World Champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ z have described the FC Bayern in the Hex@@ enk@@ essel by Piraeus a dream start to the &quot; &quot; Mission Milan &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the team of trainer P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won her kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek record Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Doppel@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and id@@ ol@@ es hits ( 8@@ 9 ) deserves a 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth start @-@ fold in series will be the first step towards the finale on 28 May 2016 in Italy where Guardi@@ ola will finally fetch the H@@ enk@@ el@@ ter to Munich in the third time .
Müller received at his 28@@ th hit in the Champions League for Bavaria @-@ guide ben@@ edi@@ fication of Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ go@@ alie Roberto which pass an as fl@@ ank shot of the champion .
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate it , &quot; had Bavaria @-@ Captain Philipp Lah@@ m in front of the game in Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ akis @-@ Sta@@ dion promised to appear before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 of hot @-@ flower fans - and the Munich &apos;s speech . &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated idea without sh@@ ines .
&quot; Pi@@ re@@ aus had won his most recent six hom@@ ec@@ games in the Royal @-@ class , including well @-@ known clubs like Manchester United , Atlan@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
2011 stum@@ bled here also Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
&quot; but Bavaria , in seven European elections were not defe@@ ated with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim . &quot;
&quot; they went cour@@ ageous , with their offensive efforts , but often to her works . &quot;
the attacks have been initiated too often by playing on the left @-@ left Douglas Costa Rica operated by the former Braunschwei@@ ger Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller made from right more fortunate than his fl@@ ank from the right hemisph@@ ere in the left upper right To@@ re@@ ck .
during the 6@@ 7 minute the world champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
at first when Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ stor@@ ms Ide@@ ye Brown hit the head ball of Poland on the line ( 26 ) .
&quot; then by the head , the go@@ alie Roberto with the knee was par@@ ked . &quot;
&quot; although the Bavaria had brought up their usual play , he was able to get Piraeus . &quot;
on go@@ al@@ ter Manuel Neu@@ er was Lost .
so about when he was a shot of Ide@@ ye about the Lat@@ te l@@ ull ( 5@@ 6. ) .
&quot; before Neu@@ er , Guardi@@ ola left a quad@@ rup@@ ed with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng who did it well . &quot;
&quot; Mario Göt@@ z , according to muscular problems back in the bo@@ charger , first sat outside . &quot;
&quot; the WM hero was only given after the sl@@ ing workout , he said was Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; who wants to make something different from it , that is already v@@ icious . &quot;
&quot; even at the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sl@@ ey Com@@ an for the Lew@@ and@@ owski Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 58 ) . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ z was late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( 7@@ 6. ) and made 13 minutes later everything clearly , per El@@ f@@ meter finished Müller . &quot;
in front of the game it had come to Kra@@ v@@ alle .
&quot; after a smaller group of partly verm@@ eit@@ ed Bavaria fans in their viewer &apos;s blo@@ cker apparently had prov@@ oked the supporters of hosts Piraeus in words and gesture , the security forces went and went with bat@@ ching against the mun@@ ich trailer . &quot;
at least one Bavaria &apos;s fan was in@@ ju@@ red around the stadium .
&quot; smok@@ es , has a higher risk of losing teeth &quot;
&quot; who car@@ es , not only the lungs , but also the teeth - this lies a Potsdam @-@ long @-@ long @-@ term near . &quot;
the good news : in deci@@ ding the risk quickly .
smokers have a significantly increased risk to lose their teeth early .
&quot; this is from the long @-@ term study of an international research teams , including several members of the German Institute of Food Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to non @-@ smokers , there was a risk to lose their teeth at an early stage in order to scale the 2,5@@ - up to 3,@@ 6 @-@ fold . &quot;
the scientists had observed more than 23.@@ 300 participants .
&quot; primary causes for dental decay in car@@ ies and inflammation of the g@@ um , stres@@ ses the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
for this peri@@ odont@@ itis , smoking is a risk factor , acc@@ entu@@ ate the authors . &quot;
the connection between smoking and tooth loss therefore go back to frequent peri@@ odont@@ itis in smokers .
&quot; not clari@@ fied , although smoking also increases the risk of car@@ ies . &quot;
&quot; people who have stopped having smoking , their risk could be reduced within a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it could take over ten years until the haz@@ ard goes back to the level of non @-@ smoking , in the first @-@ author Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; people need to persu@@ ade people to be non@@ smoking , stated study manager H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; smoking short@@ ens the lifetime . &quot;
not to smoke is good for lung and bowl and bring to our knowledge also to good dental health down to the very old age .
&quot; over 20 per cent of the population at the age of 65 to 74 years are affected by fl@@ essness , the DI@@ f@@ E shared . &quot;
previous investigations have already noted that smoking affects the risk of early dent@@ al@@ ment .
the new long @-@ term study the findings .

EU @-@ Commission defe@@ ats new court in dispute
&quot; for the stri@@ de of dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement , the EU Commission has proposed an extensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot;
the controversi@@ al private all@@ es@@ scope for disp@@ utes between companies and states should therefore be replaced with a transparent system which matches significantly more traditional dishes in his functional way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that trust the citizens &quot; , &quot; explained the competent European Commissioner in Cecilia Malm@@ ström at the presentation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Swe@@ de has plans to introduce the proposal as European negoti@@ ating positions into the free trade agreements with the US . &quot;
the German government announced support .
&quot; by TTIP , there is to be the largest free @-@ trade area in the world with 800 million people . &quot;
the plans to re@@ forming the current arbit@@ ration proceedings were in concrete terms that the EU states and the US select independent judges for a new investment agenda .
&quot; they are supposed to come from the EU , the US and from third countries . &quot;
provided for the first time also a second instance .
it would allow it to raise against judgment .
&quot; hi@@ therto the proce@@ eding participated in each other on refer@@ ee , a obj@@ ection to the jud@@ g@@ ments against their jud@@ g@@ ments . &quot;
in the discussion of the past months it became apparent that citizens of the old IS@@ DS system in matters of fair@@ ness and justice do not be trusted .
in the long term it wants to go for own information on an International Investment Court .
&quot; there could be clari@@ fied disp@@ utes between Chinese companies and EU states , for example . &quot;
the Invest@@ or @-@ Sta@@ ats for the most requested investment arbit@@ ration ( IS@@ DS ) are considered one of the main reasons for the big resistance in Europe against TTIP .
&quot; the traditional arbit@@ rators are critic@@ ized by opponents as a kind of parall@@ el@@ rating , about the company loss of loss of tax@@ pay@@ ers , national laws and can deliver a reduction of consumer and environmental standards . &quot;
&quot; in the first statements , anti @-@ TTIP organisations like Camp@@ act took the proposals by the European Commission to be inadequate . &quot;
it has been critic@@ ised particularly that they are not intended to apply to the free trade agreements with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) for the already negoti@@ ated free trade agreement ( CE@@ TA ) .
the German economic Secretary of Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) noted the plans on the other hand as a great progress .
&quot; the Commission considered essential points , the Federal Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel worked in spring with other European trade ministers . &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ration was from the table .
even the French government greeted the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European business band Busin@@ ess@@ Europe warned that break the possibilities of economy through too many new rules .
&quot; very small and medium businesses could be dis@@ advant@@ aged , it was called . &quot;
when the talks on TTIP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be completed on Wednesday further .
the negotiations have been running since the middle of 2013 .
but the subject of potential invest@@ or has not yet been discussed with the US .
&quot; originally , a framework for the agreement was already at the end of this year . &quot;
this date is no longer valid .
del@@ e@@ ater Folk by Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens in Hamburg
&quot; eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens is sitting on the stage in the Köl@@ ner Prime Club ( now : Lux@@ or ) .
&quot; next to him stands a fli@@ p@@ chart , that the mid@@ ly acting Folk@@ s@@ änger has recorded the picturesque US @-@ state of Michigan with felt . &quot;
&quot; the entire audience , about 40 persons , is almost taken by Stev@@ ens lecture . &quot;
&quot; he talks on the basis of various places that he wrote again and again on the map , wor@@ ding his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ous and tender songs . &quot;
&quot; where they came into existence and how it looks , in his homeland . &quot;
since then Stev@@ ens has been a wonderful creative man .
&quot; with the 2003 and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State &quot; &quot; appear clever songs that for@@ ged them harmon@@ i@@ ously close to American Folk in the late six@@ ties , but at any time the great op@@ ul@@ ent drift . &quot;
&quot; the ru@@ mor , &quot; Michigan , &quot; would be the first part of a series of series : each of the 50 U.S. states should rise in a row . &quot;
&quot; however , in 2004 and in the Rhine is already having appeared &quot; &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; and breaks off positi@@ vely . &quot;

the album rises to the American Bill@@ board charts and is not missing in any annual list of influ@@ ential music media .
&quot; after thoroughly productive experiments , Stev@@ ens then served themselves to &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) . &quot;
&quot; this sixth @-@ record studio album is still largely orchest@@ rated , but supported by program@@ med sequences or be@@ ats , and plays with all lead effect and Hall . &quot;

&quot; although here nearly 2000 guests have been forced to sit in their chairs , the significantly mature Stev@@ ens goes back to intim@@ acy and to folk . &quot;
&quot; without direct a word to the audience , the group plays excellent musicians through the wide range . &quot;

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ no debut on the Prime Minister of Prime Minister
since his election Mr Cor@@ by@@ no has expected the Prime Minister of Prime Minister with excitement because of his election .
the new Labour Chair Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n is meant to be his debut in the Prime Minister of Prime Minister and David Cameron on his first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise up in order to cope with the first of his six pre @-@ given questions shortly after their performance of the media is likely to be checked by the media and the Labour Council .
he called on &quot; fewer theatres and more facts &quot; on this weekly event .
he also said that he could be ski@@ pped some sessions to leave her colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ by@@ no leadership , as it returns to its appointment as a member of the shadow of the cabinet , and after his speech at the TU@@ C @-@ Annual Meeting on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the decision of the Labour Party was prov@@ oked during a commem@@ oration ceremony of the 75@@ th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , cr@@ iti@@ ques of a number of T@@ ory MP@@ s , and stands at the center of several world @-@ pages stories in the newspapers . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ no decision , not to sing the National hy@@ m@@ ne , has drawn attention to himself &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said , he would have been &quot; &quot; respect@@ ful of silence &quot; &quot; and he recognized the &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in aer@@ os@@ ur@@ ry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ no Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ ab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two @-@ night program , he gave the Labour president to sing the Nation@@ hy@@ m@@ ne , &quot; independent &quot; of his faith that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of sh@@ adows ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ no peak , and she called to dis@@ agreements with the Economy , Defense and foreign policy , while less than a six @-@ du@@ el of the parliamentary party originally supported him as a leader . &quot;
&quot; the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences emerge within the Labour , and after Mr Cor@@ by@@ no pronoun@@ cements to the European Union and the limitation of ra@@ ins . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference to put the Labour Party in order to remove the whole idea of a single limitation .
&quot; hours later Mr Smith , the sh@@ adows and pensions specialist , that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that they only be against the ruling party that limit the limit of 26.@@ 000 £ to 23,@@ 000 £ . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader , David Cameron , since he has been T@@ ory boss , since the last decade there has been over the Dis@@ patch @-@ Box in the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; the Labour president , who has promised another policy approach , says that &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for issues to Mr Cameron and he has given him more than 30,000 comments . &quot;
&quot; Is@@ lington North MP has said that the challenges of the Prime Minister has become con@@ front@@ ational , and that it has under@@ gone both &quot; Imp@@ act &quot; and the dispute with counter@@ bar@@ b , and rather focus on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and challenges for young people . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Merkel , the shadow of economics , will represent him if he does not participate - for example , if Mr. Cameron on travels abroad . &quot;
&quot; he has also brought the idea into conversation , that other colleagues occasionally take the word and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the spokes@@ man of the child , in order to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he was a leader in 2005 he said Mr Cameron that he wants to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le Theatre &quot; , &quot; which is often associated with the question of Prime Minister . but a few years later he realized that he has failed . &quot;
&quot; since the TV was sent on TV first in 1990 , the question@@ er with the Prime Minister as a major Bar@@ ometer has been argu@@ ed with his leadership in the House of Commons and his position under his parliament@@ arians , although critics have argu@@ ed that it had become a caric@@ ature and require considerable reforms . &quot;

&quot; the po@@ und desc@@ ended according to data , showing a rise in the wage @-@ growth of the United Kingdom . parallel to this the FT@@ SE 100 was intensi@@ fied by the goal of SA@@ BM@@ iller . &quot;
between May and July the result of no bonuses in the United Kingdom increased by 2.9 % compared to the same pre @-@ year period .
this percentage was the fastest and ass@@ ass@@ ed ass@@ essm@@ ents at the time of a rate of interest .
&quot; the Po@@ unds increased by more than 1 % compared to $ 1,@@ 55@@ 05 and up to 0,@@ 84 % compared to the euro on 1,@@ 37@@ 30 € . &quot;
the FT@@ SE 100 Index closed with an increase in power % to 6.@@ 2@@ 29,@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding activ@@ ist on the market and made a leap of 20 % after tak@@ eover offer by the Riv@@ al AB In@@ Be@@ v .
&quot; a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies of the world and brands like Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch . &quot;

the head of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages put the expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK employees could mean more buying power in the po@@ ckets of potential customers .
&quot; but it is unlikely to be the higher labor force of his company at the same time , he says . &quot;
&quot; the costs could make the expan@@ sion@@ ary of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are less additional jobs . &quot;

Met@@ cash starts working with the step @-@ to @-@ step campaign to combat Al@@ di@@ - In@@ ci@@ dent
met@@ cash is trying to protect the Ig@@ A stores in South Australia and Western Australia .
&quot; food whol@@ es@@ alers met@@ cash has started a stand @-@ fast campaign , in order to defend the market share of Ig@@ A retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion . &quot;
&quot; during Al@@ di , the opening of two sales offices and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia will be prepared next year , making Met@@ cash and Ig@@ A stores their relations with local food suppliers and build the brand Ig@@ A through mainstre@@ am marketing and marketing on the social media , as well as events such as Adelaide @-@ Show . &quot;
&quot; Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers have to jump on board , with brands like E@@ ish@@ ni@@ ers S@@ immo from D@@ uns@@ borough , who distri@@ butes tickets to all stores in Ig@@ A shops and shop owner who sell tickets for the South Australian soccer le@@ ague to loyal customers . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Met@@ a@@ cash will publish more details of its defence strategy on September 29 , when the wholesale distributors for food , alcohol and devices will lead its annual invest@@ or strategy . &quot;
there is a lot of stores on the game because South Australia and Western Australia almost 30 percent of Met@@ cas@@ hs Ig@@ A stores masks and higher gains as a Met@@ cas@@ hs Ig@@ A @-@ network in the East @-@ State .
&quot; shopping in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ally provincial and Ig@@ A retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia in comparison to about 14 per cent in the U.S. states . &quot;
&quot; however , an@@ alyst@@ s like Morgan Stanley that Al@@ di will take twelve months after the opening of its first markets around five percent of the food market in these two states and will take off all existing actors , but mainly self @-@ independent individual tra@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; in a review published in this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ itt@@ ath published by Morgan Stanley that Ig@@ A retailers will lose 360 million annual revenues per year and cash cash 250 million $ until the end of 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this pro@@ gn@@ osis is based on the assumption that Al@@ di has opened 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA in the next year , and generates sales of 500 million $ and 600 million $ in every market . &quot;
&quot; the loss in food and food store and in the quantities of Met@@ cas@@ hs high fix@@ ation basis could cost Met@@ cash around 13 million $ earnings before interest and taxes , said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Met@@ cash market shares in the Baltic States , mainly to Al@@ di and CO@@ LES , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan found that Ig@@ A k@@ ais@@ le are the faithful . &quot;
&quot; Morgan Stanley assumes that Met@@ cas@@ hs increases sales in food and food business by 3.8 per cent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.@@ 1 per cent in 2018 will be reduced to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; last week , the leading Fond@@ ation Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , at a business meeting in Melbourne , making it most likely to disappear inside a decade . metal cash will disappear . &quot;
met@@ cash decl@@ ined to respond in public to the comments of Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is understood that a board of met@@ cash has been in contact with Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s last week .
&quot; I@@ GA@@ s market share has decl@@ ined from 18 percent to 14 per cent , and income from Met@@ cas@@ us food and grocery stores , which has roughly 1,@@ 200 Ig@@ A retailers in 2012 , which reflects the operating system of debt settlement in simultaneous pressure on turnover and mar@@ gins . &quot;
&quot; however , the wholesale distributors have resi@@ sted and investing more than 150 million $ to provide sales prices with CO@@ LES and Wo@@ ol@@ owed by hundreds of products every week to improve fresh foods and to deliver better choices of private @-@ label foods . &quot;
&quot; Met@@ cas@@ hs &apos;s main guides Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adap@@ table and store programmes are to be found , and hopes that the whol@@ es@@ aler in 2017 will return for the first time in four years back to a pay@@ growth . &quot;
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis was supported by President of the Australian At@@ it@@ ands of Steve Heal@@ y
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis deserve better praise for his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis was one of the &quot; coll@@ ater@@ als &quot; in the shortest time around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gi@@ os and deserves to view the President of the Australian At@@ tun@@ es and Steve Heal@@ y rather praise as a criticism for his own behaviour .
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ akis , the younger of talented Du@@ os , which is always called &quot; special &quot; &quot; framed by the in@@ famous examination of Kyr@@ gi@@ os with St@@ an W@@ aw@@ rin@@ ka at the Montreal Masters in the spotlight . &quot;
&quot; in a fier@@ y qualifying game in Cincinnati soon after that , Kok@@ kin@@ akis and his opponent Ryan Harrison took place twice through the arbit@@ rators , and Harrison did not have to beat Kyr@@ gi@@ os and I should strike the child . &quot;
&quot; while he was seen most recently as he sm@@ iled a tennis court , after a cr@@ amp@@ er had an potential US Open @-@ victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ akis was def@@ ended by Heal@@ y . &quot;
&quot; she is currently in Glasgow , in the competition with Sam Gr@@ oth at the second place in the individual behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ finals against Great Britain . &quot;
&quot; one thing which I feel fairly brave , is the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi , a little was drawn into the contro@@ vers@@ y , &quot; said Heal@@ y . &quot;
&quot; he has broken one r@@ acket as he lost due to a cr@@ amp in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken down a r@@ acket from Fr@@ ust with himself broken , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of that . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he really beh@@ ave in the US Open extremely well , even among the fairly pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Harrison , and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I believe that he was treated a little too strictly . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 @-@ old , he works very hard , and he has never worked out a problem with the other players , he is trained in the locker area , he is trained in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged before his own wor@@ ries . &quot;
&quot; Heal@@ y also supported the decision to consider Kyr@@ gi@@ os at the important pre @-@ decision which started on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right for all , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term solid component to the team . &quot;
&quot; firstly we wish that the team is fully focused at the competition and not to all the contro@@ vers@@ y around &#91; Kyr@@ gi@@ os &#93; , &quot; said Heal@@ y . &quot;
&quot; and I think that Nick was very quickly made the Ascension , and he has made some of the critic@@ isms that he gets , but we try to help him to give him the consequences of his actions . I consider it to be adequate for him , and it is best for the team and it is best for him . &quot;
&quot; refuge@@ e crisis : Hungary decl@@ ares up , closes the limit , holds refugees back &quot;
&quot; Hungary explains the emergency and drew the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday , and held all the feast to try to reach illegal into the country . all with the goal to stop the inf@@ low of migrants . &quot;
chaos followed by the limit when hundreds of migrants gathered in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and he responded to the officials with horror .
the people who fled from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a strip on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled down there .
but frustr@@ ations went up .
&quot; as a police helicop@@ ter over them sm@@ ashed , the migrants would add &quot; Open the border &quot; opening the limit ! &quot; and cried out damages against the Hungarian read@@ ability police . &quot;
some are made of protest food and water back .
&quot; Serbia &apos;s foreign minister stated that migrants would be returned from Hungary , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral harm .
&quot; it will have to take discussions with Brussels and other countries in the coming days , said Iv@@ ica Dac@@ ic in Prague . &quot;
the turbul@@ ence at the Hungarian @-@ Ser@@ b border came a day after the 28 @-@ nations @-@ block in Brussels could not agree a common immigration policy .
&quot; the ministers agreed , however , to share responsibility for 4@@ 0,000 people who were re@@ sum@@ mon@@ ed over the next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would conclude that the EU states would include further 120@@ .000 refugees among them . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria demanded a special summit of the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis in the continent .
&quot; however , Hungary however didn &apos;t put its hopes on a balanced action from Brussels or from its neighbours . &quot;
&quot; the emergency took place on Tuesday in two southern regions , authorities gave more powers to get out of the crisis , so they could accelerate streets and asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plane the construction of a thorn @-@ wi@@ za@@ fü@@ red around his border with Romania , in order to stop the inf@@ low of migrants through the country - after it con@@ cludes a fence along the Ser@@ b border . &quot;
&quot; CB@@ S News @-@ correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even pris@@ ons were used in the race , the thorn @-@ wire z@@ aun between Hungary and Serbia . &quot;
in recent months Hungary has become a considerable Eng@@ pass in the last months and elsewhere in the Middle East .
&quot; Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insi@@ sted that most vulnerable business refugees who are seeking a better life and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws passed by midnight in Hungary in force , make the crossing of the border or corruption of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high fence to build the government along the southern border with Serbia , to a crime . these laws also create higher adhes@@ ion for convic@@ ted human tra@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the emergency , &quot; said government of Z@@ ol@@ tan Kov@@ á@@ cs rep@@ or@@ ters in the southern city of Sz@@ eged . &quot;
we say it very clear : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must again agree with the use of the military , which is expected for next week , but rep@@ orter of Associ@@ ated Press reported on the border with heavy vehicles and dogs already for days . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ org@@ y Bak@@ on@@ di , country @-@ security advis@@ ors for Or@@ ban , said that authorities cross over 45 people when trying to cross the border , 15 others have already penet@@ rated into the country . &quot;
&quot; they are coming over by def@@ ending the fence , they are now in police forces and are accused of crimes against the new laws . &quot;
authorities are there to repair the fence quickly .
&quot; Hungarian officials opened two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia , after an inter@@ rup@@ ed with sp@@ iny runs to close the borders , arrived . &quot;
chaos revers@@ ed the main border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke in Hungary as the Hung@@ arians have opened a small office in a metal container to handle the data of people and op@@ pres@@ et a crowd to get there .
&quot; about 20 people succeeded to arrive , but thousands stayed outside . &quot;
&quot; a further group of migrants blocked the most important highway connection from Serbia and Hungary , and said that they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary . &quot;
choice of 2016 : Hill@@ ary Cl@@ int@@ ons Vor@@ sprung before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey
&quot; the former US Secretary of Hill@@ ary Clinton remains a double @-@ dig@@ it lead in the democratic race for nomin@@ ating at the national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders is winning their opposite to the floor . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has now supported by 47 percent of the democratic voters in the elections ( 58 percent before ) , while another is second to 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet proclaimed whether he can vote for the post office , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic voters of the elections . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the pre @-@ elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion states the candidates they are supported . &quot;
but Cl@@ int@@ on supporters are more resistant in their choice than those of the other candidates .
&quot; since the CB@@ S @-@ News survey , Clinton have lost in a series of demo@@ graphic groups while some wins some wins . &quot;
Clinton is holding a great lead in women and moder@@ ates but these origins have been reduced .
&quot; their support in the men is much decl@@ ined , and S@@ anders is here only with 5 points . &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ int@@ ons must benefit from democratic voters in 50 years , and they are now on the same level . &quot;
&quot; however , Clinton has a great lead in the older voters . &quot;
&quot; the last month Clinton had been in a double with double @-@ dig@@ it advantage at the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead at this group . &quot;
about half of the democratic voters of the pre @-@ elections that they would like to support to Clinton if they were nominated by the Party .
&quot; a quarter would support them with some reservations , and another 15 percent would only support them , because they have the can@@ did@@ acy . &quot;
six percent would not support them .
&quot; perhaps not surprisingly , that Cl@@ int@@ on &apos;s current supporters are all about it . &quot;
the views are stronger with those who do not support Clinton - just about one quarter would love them .
&quot; while 48 percent of the democratic voters say that they would like to support Clinton with enthusiasm , they say less rep@@ ubli@@ can voters using their nickname for Donald Tru@@ mp ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; if Cl@@ int@@ on Supp@@ or@@ ters are asked in an open question why they want it to be the can@@ did@@ acy , is the most common answer that it has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the point that it is time that a woman is president ( 13 percent ) and that it is the best can@@ did@@ acy for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
Cl@@ int@@ ons &apos;s supporters will also make their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 % ) .
consent to the handling of problems and voters are also quoted .
&quot; as the Vice President poses a potential for the presidential office to the scale , 57 percent of the democratic voters would like to see him in the race - even though a third believes it should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if the elect@@ orate will be asked of the sel@@ ections , who would be a second choice for the party is Bi@@ den at the top . &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ int@@ on &apos;s followers say more than half , that be@@ den would be their second choice far from S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; decide be@@ ech , not for nomin@@ ation of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s leading advantage is raised from S@@ anders , from 20 points with bi@@ den in the race at 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; five @-@ five percent of democratic voters consider Clinton as a candidate with the best opportunities to win , but this number of 78 per cent of the last month has decl@@ ined . &quot;
&quot; bi@@ des is by far a second part of this measurement , but the percentage of the ones that considers it to be &quot; dial@@ ects &quot; has risen . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , on the question of what is more important to a candidate , call the voters regarding voters . &quot;
&quot; similarly as in the last month , there is no single democratic candidate , or potential candidate for the voters of the pre @-@ elections as unacceptable . &quot;
the Democratic candidate or potential candidates deliver good results with some important characteristic of the voters of their party &apos;s sel@@ ections .
&quot; maj@@ orities are viewing Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den cuts for the three candidates at best , while Cl@@ int@@ on &apos;s strength is the lead . &quot;
&quot; thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that over S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not have any opinion of it . &quot;
&quot; in general , democratic voters of the pre @-@ elections see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ological in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; with all these measurements , about one quarter of the Democratic Party has no opinion of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; as questions concerning Hill@@ ary Cl@@ int@@ ons use a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the term as Secretary of office , most of the Democratic voters are still satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it did not affect their opinions overall . &quot;
but it is a different story in the American public domain .
half of the Americans are uns@@ atis@@ fied with its declaration while only about one third is satisfied .
&quot; public opinion about this was in March , just after the issue of light came , split . &quot;
&quot; most Americans also said that the e @-@ mail contro@@ vers@@ y had no impact on their general opinions by Clinton , although 36 percent said their opinion of it was still worse . &quot;
&quot; they are mainly rep@@ ublic@@ ans , over six of 10 , who say that their views of Clinton have been worse . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is regarded by the voters of their party to be honest and trust@@ worthy , this is still a problem for them under registered voters in total : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points lower since May . &quot;
62 percent of voting rights they do not hold for an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
at the same time 55 percent of the elect@@ orate people see right also Tru@@ mp as not honest and not trust@@ worthy .
&quot; Clinton and Tru@@ mp , however , will give good music in the lead . &quot;
&quot; of the six recent candidates , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush are best at honesty . &quot;
a majority looks more likely to be honest but as with Car@@ son many do not have any opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample sample from 351 Democratic leaders in the pre @-@ elections is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son re@@ sum@@ ed with land@@ es@@ on survey near Donald Tru@@ mp
Ben Car@@ son is located at the latest pol@@ l of CB@@ S News / New York Times close behind Donald Tru@@ mp
&quot; on the two candidates , half of the support of voters in the new pol@@ l are now losing dramatically and others lose dramatically . &quot;
Republi@@ can voters support nation@@ wide far@@ mp in great numbers . the support is growing by 23 % in the last CB@@ S survey conducted by Fox News Deb@@ ate last month to 27 % in the survey of Tuesday .
but Car@@ son took the same period of 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son comes with demo@@ graphic groups well and Tru@@ mp hon@@ ors the rep@@ ubli@@ can voters with high school education .
&quot; the rest of the field , except for car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ ze , is struck with Wiscons@@ ins governor Scott Walker , which is at least 10 % of support last month at now 2 % . &quot;
&quot; the former Florida Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush , the former governor of Ark@@ ansas Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida @-@ Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio are located at the third place . &quot;
the bug@@ fix@@ ing of the sample @-@ dress by the 3@@ 76 people of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was conducted in September .
&quot; the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey conducted last week shows that Car@@ son rises in the surveys - he laun@@ ches 19 % support for rep@@ ublic@@ ans , behind the Tru@@ mp with 32 % support . &quot;
the recent survey conducted by ABC News / Washington Post revealed Tru@@ mp clearly before Car@@ son .
&quot; facing a last week of asc@@ ending Car@@ son Tru@@ mp took some side of side@@ car for the former Neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son re@@ ap@@ ologi@@ ze to question tru@@ mp@@ s faith . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tru@@ mp last Saturday last Saturday during a campaigns of the show in Iowa . &quot;
&quot; pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm . &quot;
&quot; even if prime values only be measured in the distance , sufficient for bathing loud@@ speakers is already a trip to the Mediterranean , to suggest a warm water . &quot;
a bath in the north and Baltic Sea is likely to be a short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
&quot; some of the sea is no longer going into the sea : maximum 18 degrees , the water level in the North and Baltic Sea in this week , shares the Deutsche Wetter@@ dienst ( DW@@ D ) . &quot;
&quot; by contrast , bath temperatures do not continue to offer the Mediterranean Sea : in the East it is even up to 29 degrees . &quot;
&quot; in the Adriatic , it is only 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees . &quot;

five members of the Br@@ otherhood with the death of a Bar@@ uch College @-@ Ne@@ ul@@ ings
&quot; nearly two years , after a student died during a dis@@ appoint@@ ing ritual of a student association in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , pre@@ f@@ ated complaint against five people . &quot;
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College Pi @-@ Delta @-@ Br@@ otherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an intro@@ duc@@ tory ritual in September 2013 and destroyed its transport to the hospital which has contributed to his death .
&quot; officials said that he had been charged with a 30 Po@@ und @-@ pack full of sand and repeatedly , while trying to enter a goal on a frozen field . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Den@@ g compl@@ ained by head@@ aches , then he fell unconscious . &quot;
&quot; the members of the Pi @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Br@@ otherhood did not sh@@ out@@ let the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g was impot@@ ent and wa@@ ited for an hour before they brought him into a hospital , so the police . &quot;
&quot; however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothes , his symptoms of goo@@ gle and Andy Men@@ g , to contact the national president of the Br@@ otherhood , in order to bring advice , the police officer Chris Wagner said it at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point , the members , U@@ ten@@ si@@ ls started to hide and posed the welfare of the Br@@ otherhood , in general about the von Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ sten@@ ef Wagner . &quot;
&quot; he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died in the next morning at his wo@@ unds . &quot;
&quot; after an aut@@ op@@ tic stop , Den@@ g has to be repeated with de@@ af strength inj@@ uries , head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s . &quot;
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the sham@@ ans of the Br@@ otherhood . at least one student dies since 1970 every year onwards , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ s Family , in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; member states and their members must be held to account and this step by authorities is very important . &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe received an indic@@ t@@ ment because of the third counts for the first five members .
&quot; two @-@ eight members of the Br@@ otherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of sham@@ eful attacks and formation of a criminal . &quot;
&quot; we do not only want to take care of the individuals involved , but if there is an organisation that - official or official - this has agreed , we will also take them to account , &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the Bar@@ uch College has forbidden the Br@@ otherhood , and the national Br@@ otherhood has to withdraw its affili@@ ation to the town . &quot;
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases the interest
&quot; in@@ filtr@@ ation comes , and the ra@@ fts shall come to the banks , from Rend@@ sburg to loans , and the economy will push into a recession . &quot;
we know that .
what we don &apos;t know is how long this all last and how long it will stop .
&quot; in particular , the history of the economy offers only small guidance for the process . &quot;
a recession came within just 11 months after the first rate of interest and lasted more than 86 months .
&quot; the aggression of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , if not always , a factor here , how the economy and the financial investments respond . &quot;
&quot; therefore , representatives of the US Central Bank have stressed that investors should not focus on it when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather to the period that is needed for norm@@ alisation . &quot;
in fact several variables play a role .
&quot; in the end , market members could notice that the whole excitement because of a fence may be over@@ done . &quot;
&quot; the first raise of the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inev@@ it@@ ably interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chef at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradu@@ al return of US interest to normal heights , but still at the lowest level to se@@ is@@ mic shock , that many to fear . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that there will be no effect . &quot;
here is a historical trends based on historical trends that could react to how some areas of the economy could react :
&quot; as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interests may make things for a while . &quot;
once the increase occurs is the effect is not so dramatic .
&quot; there is apparently a tendency that wealth mines must be taken from 12 to 24 months after the first raise , what perhaps again reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank Analy@@ st in a recent study about what happens according to interests of the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; more precisely , the market is mostly in popularity - about 14 per cent - on the road to inser@@ tion , fairly flat in the last six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to an current analysis that Bob D@@ oll , Head of a Strategic Management at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , near Bar@@ ron &apos;s . &quot;
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tend to occur later in the tro@@ ut cycle and restore the return to it .
&quot; rec@@ essions are a fact of economic policies , but interests inter@@ rup@@ tions often promote them . &quot;
&quot; in current instance , the F@@ ed is faced with some conditions which had not existed before and which could accelerate the recession . &quot;
extremely remarkable is that the gross domestic product is in the proximity of its lowest point in terms of in@@ serts in F@@ ed .
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 advoc@@ ates since 1950 was only twice the nominal GDP in 4.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; although the second quarter of 2015 was at 3,@@ 6 percent , few are expected to last and expect the third quarter at the Atlanta F@@ ed within 1.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; in@@ calcul@@ ating on a so fragile economic background could be ris@@ ky and throw the question to , &quot; &quot; whether it is this time different , &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; market divi@@ dend raised the whole year to a interests of F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week which ends on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many Strategic and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could have an increase in this session , the Fut@@ ures trade is only a probability of 25 percent . &quot;
&quot; in our study all the H@@ eight@@ y@@ cycles have taken place in 1950 to today in a super cycle with increasing de@@ forest@@ ation while taking b@@ IP and pre @-@ rec@@ essi@@ ans are placed very quickly after the beginning of recovery in the shade , &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow rest of what the worst recession in the observed phase was observed . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest , that the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession , the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months . &quot;
&quot; the solid income was also vol@@ at@@ ile , since the market takes an in@@ serts , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market . &quot;
the main difference is that the effect in bonds is faster than in shares when its strategic target will change .
&quot; for loans , the return to shift does not seem to change , as soon as the first increase / decrease in the cycle takes place . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the H@@ eight@@ eenth cycle , the An@@ lei@@ gh @-@ cycle will fall immediately , said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
strateg@@ ist by Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase in interest rates will result in revenues and lead to a waste of the curve between longer and shorter bonds .
&quot; bonds often bring in such a climate better revenue , although &quot; &quot; we are still careful to expect higher y@@ ields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come @-@ An@@ alyst@@ s in Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; interesting , it says Jones that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed Strategy expectations . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the drop of in@@ activity , there are several indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of greater monetary policy &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; short term interest rates have increased , the increase is increased and the vol@@ at@@ ility has risen and the vol@@ at@@ ility has risen - all the characteristics of the market if the F@@ ed is ex@@ ac@@ erb@@ ated their strategy . &quot;
&quot; in the large and whole of these companies , who can dra@@ in the greater part of their business activities in the U.S. to benefit from interest rates when interest rates are increasing and local products will become more attractive . &quot;
multin@@ ational companies with high debt will be worse because an increasing dollar off their products on the global market is expensive and also financing its deb@@ ts .
&quot; the history shows that &quot; quality &quot; stocks tend to react very positi@@ vely , three months after an initial interest amo@@ unting to react very positi@@ vely , &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analy@@ st in a report for the customers . &quot;
companies with strong balance sheet have exceeded the company with a weak balance sheet after each of the interest interests in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 at an average of 5 percentage points . &quot;
companies with high capital @-@ returns as well as low vol@@ at@@ ility at its shares also met their counter@@ parts with lower quality at an average of 4 ( percent@@ points ) and 3 ( percent@@ points ) .
debt is a big problem .
companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will lose most and said Gold@@ man .
outside of the pure corporation , consumers will also benefit from increasing dollars . &quot;
&quot; as@@ parag@@ rap@@ hs could see profits by higher y@@ ields , even if experts are different opinions , how fast it will take place . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , member of the MP Andrew B@@ ingham &quot;
&quot; the conserv@@ atives of Parliament critic@@ ized the transmitter because of its &quot; &quot; de@@ duction &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is not able to distinguish it from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also noted on the BBC Music Awards and said that she is only The Br@@ its im@@ itable
Parliament T@@ ien Collins The show The Voice on and said that this is not very original .
&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; conver@@ ts &quot; to Classic FM , maintains a leading parliamentary committee and raises new pressure on the transmitter to show that he does something that does not do the private station . &quot;
&quot; the conserv@@ atives Andrew B@@ ingham said also the BBC @-@ bos@@ ses , that the public @-@ legal radio @-@ radi@@ ant &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; and will no longer be distinguished from its commercial competitors . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 appears - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; dum@@ b &quot; - but it seems to become Classic FM , &quot; he said . &quot;
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards that started last December .
&quot; the BBC Music Awards , who started last year , The Br@@ its appear only under a different name . &quot;
&quot; so if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneous examples mentioned in which you actually only have to im@@ itate , which is already on the market , &quot; &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham . &quot;
BBC @-@ General @-@ director pointed out the accus@@ ations and argu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial ri@@ vals when it comes to live music and clari@@ fication of the public .
what I learn from Radio 3 learn that I will learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; and to find the commitment of Radio 3 , new music and to give new works on behalf , I consider it really important . &quot;
&quot; earlier this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey , that they need to be lab@@ elled to engage in the public when the British were less informed about classical music in the past . &quot;
&quot; however , radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC @-@ production resulting during the hearing in the Committee on the choice of culture , media and sport for it under fire , the commercial ri@@ vals on the feet . &quot;
T@@ ory @-@ MP Dam@@ ien Collins grip The Voice on - the musical talent @-@ show of the BBC decided by the Dutch producer of Tal@@ pa Media for estimated costs 22 million £ .
&quot; see why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not particularly striking ? &quot;
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 @-@ Show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - &quot; in a special BBC @-@ way . &quot;
&quot; he added , he would like that the company &quot; &quot; find a hit from our home @-@ in barn &quot; &quot; where the next time was a entertainment series . &quot;
&quot; however , it refused to join the order of further rows of The Voice in the future or to spend money in bond@@ age for other entertainment formats . &quot;
Internet revenue was in August at the slow@@ est and the Black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 there were seven percent increase in online sales .
in the last month there were the lowest result since the beginning of the record in 2000
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones to shop
experts believe that the Black Friday in November has checked the expenses
&quot; for over a decade , the virtual shop has geb@@ ur@@ om@@ t , and many of the major shopping streets of Great Britain have turned into Spirit &apos;s cities . &quot;
&quot; however , experts say that there are now signs that the online revenue is stag@@ nat@@ ing after new figures only showed seven percent in the first three months of 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in August , the total expenditure of August presents the lowest rise in growth since the beginning of the record in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year . &quot;
experts say that there are signs that online sales will be st@@ agn@@ ant after new figures only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for the years and until 2000 , it has ever developed over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ RG @-@ Verkauf@@ sin@@ ians of the Guardian . &quot;
&quot; he explained that the on @-@ line sales increased by three years ago , as a buyer , offering their cell@@ phones to buy . &quot;
&quot; it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa . &quot;
&quot; but now , the thing is comm@@ uting , and we may possibly experience that growth dimin@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon , which was imported from America , is considered a reason for the re@@ ass@@ uring revenue . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that buyers have held their sh@@ opp@@ ings before this event , which will take place on the last Friday in November . &quot;
&quot; last year Sch@@ arte extends five times the average number of buyers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer @-@ sites inter@@ viewed . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that Black Friday , in which the buyer might be fought for bu@@ ckl@@ ing , buyers of which can be sold . &quot;
a study of the British Retail Con@@ sortium found that a total of 5 will have spent a little more than 1 £ online .
&quot; for some products such as television and washing machines , more than one third of the purchases are now available via Web @-@ Shops . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , more than one quarter of the people are buying clothes and shoes online instead of in the mos@@ ets in the inter@@ iors . &quot;
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca at the crane @-@ accident prevention - Bin Laden &apos;s family becomes s@@ cour@@ tion@@ ed
&quot; the corp@@ ses from 29 deaths are supported by Mos@@ l@@ ems , among the first bur@@ ners in Mec@@ ca by the streets . &quot;
Saudi Arabia lays down the collapse partly from the vast aci@@ dic Bin @-@ Laden @-@ group
&quot; the Ministry of Health said that in total of 3@@ 94 people were viol@@ ated , after the crane rus@@ hed &quot;
&quot; hundreds of Mos@@ l@@ ems were gathered together when 29 of the victims were carried by the streets to bury the dead , who were killed as a crane in Mec@@ ca Grand@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee . &quot;
&quot; back@@ filled , largely in white dressed , the circuit to end@@ ate their respect as the first of the dead appeared their last trip to the Al @-@ Mo@@ ew@@ em cemetery . &quot;
&quot; the funeral proc@@ ession went in the holy place , where only the days before a building cr@@ ats through the ceiling of the mosque and then rus@@ hed to the praying . &quot;
&quot; the corp@@ ses were released for the funeral , as the Saudi King over the construction company of the family Bin Laden due to the catastrophe , which also had 3@@ 94 h@@ ended , a punishment . &quot;
&quot; the corp@@ ses of 29 suffer@@ ers who were killed , considered a crane by the Great Central mo@@ sch@@ ee Mec@@ ca , were carried through the streets . &quot;
&quot; among the dead , Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram was made of Bol@@ ton , Gre@@ ater Manchester , father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage , was over@@ thrown the crane . &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram was at the heart of the Grand Mos@@ que with his parents at the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ ren .
&quot; Saudi officials already accum@@ ulated that the H@@ add@@ alena is going to Mec@@ ca by thousands who continues to come to city , go on . &quot;
&quot; today King Sal@@ man , the Bin @-@ Laden @-@ group had failed to leave the arm of the crane , when he was not used . &quot;
&quot; an Arabic version of the deco@@ der , published by the state Saudi State Agency , said that the Bin @-@ Laden @-@ Group was responsible for the collapse . &quot;
&quot; the English @-@ language service of the news agency reported this detail , but said that the leadership of the company was prohibited from abroad . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning of this week Sal@@ man ob@@ sc@@ aled which caused the overthrow of the sick , rus@@ hed to a courtyard of the Grand mosque where hundreds of Mos@@ l@@ ems of Muslims came in front of the H@@ add@@ sch that gathered later this month . &quot;
&quot; the Bin @-@ Laden @-@ group has published no statements concerning the collapse of the Crane , and their representatives was not available for an opinion . &quot;
&quot; the Royal Dec@@ ree did not im@@ pe@@ de the group because of non @-@ current security measures , and because they did not cooperate with met@@ eor@@ ologist . &quot;
do@@ z@@ ens of cranes surround Mek@@ kas large @-@ mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive client that is managed by the Bin @-@ Laden Group .
the family bin Laden is connected for decades with the gl@@ acial family of Saudi Arabia and assumes bigger construction projects .
&quot; the late leader of Al Q@@ a@@ eda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a bom@@ bing son who has been kid@@ n@@ apped in the family in 1990 . &quot;
&quot; the crash of the crane arrived in the midst of strong winds and rain , just few days before arrival of millions in the kingdom for pilgrimage , which is at least once in a life of every healthy Muslims . &quot;

&quot; Véronique Lau@@ ry , new chair@@ men of King@@ fis@@ her who owns the construction markets chain , said that a large increase in the number of qualified people from Eastern Europe , offer the services to bass prizes in the meantime . &quot;
&quot; therefore , King@@ fis@@ her plans to open more than 200 new Scre@@ w@@ fix shops that connect to craft@@ smen and 60 out@@ lets from B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to explore more women in B &amp; Q @-@ Shops , for eight out of ten purchase decisions in the store are made by women . &quot;
at the moment ou@@ tw@@ ei@@ gh the men .
&quot; she said it was necessary to face the growing demo@@ graphic trends that have more female single budgets , make more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our stores .
we need to move this more towards a balance .
&quot; basically , half of our customers consist of women with 80 percent of decisions concerning the purchase of articles by women . &quot;
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of just five women at the head of a British in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index en@@ listed companies , has also re@@ struc@@ ted their top team to reflect the same number of men and women in leaders . &quot;
&quot; king@@ fis@@ her is almost the only company , which has exactly 50 percent of the teams occupied with women , including its management and financial situation . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - variety is here an important issue .
it was not difficult to find good women for our supervis@@ ory board .
King@@ F@@ isher decl@@ ares an decline in half @-@ year profit and re@@ els after the group was liable for the cost of closing the shops .
&quot; due to the trends , King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q has opened 200 new branches . &quot;

the def@@ endants are not guilty of this .
one of them had also been charged with am@@ t@@ sm@@ ages .
&quot; by this accus@@ ation , he was legally as@@ cert@@ ained in May . &quot;
the current process has been post@@ pon@@ ed .
&quot; according to Ober@@ sta@@ ats@@ var@@ usa Robert Ri@@ che had cryst@@ alli@@ zed in the pre @-@ investigations into the years 2006 to 2011 ass@@ aul@@ ts of the association , about which they have voted in their functions , for private purposes . &quot;
&quot; the damage is occupied with about 400,000 Euros . &quot;
the sport@@ b@@ ars are also charged because of finance .
&quot; this fact , the President of the Sh@@ ore Council , directed Michael Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot;
it should be negoti@@ ated at a future date .
the re@@ pro@@ ach of the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity laid the defense that the association did not have a current asset for the association at any time .
&quot; the sport@@ clubs could only have registered on damages and the sports club , for whom they had been working from 1982 to 2011 and invested a lot of time and money in the year 2001 - the passi@@ va reli@@ es about 60@@ 0.000 Sch@@ illing ( rd . 44.@@ 000 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; at that time we stood before the situation : do we conduct the club and lock ourselves up ? , &quot; told one of the accused , in the bread of gener@@ osity of the financial year . &quot;
&quot; with his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ endants , he decided to take this task . &quot;
with all risks .
&quot; we have advanced money , swe@@ ating our li@@ vi@@ enn@@ ings as security at the bank , &quot; he said at the intru@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; the association has been agreed : you can manage the money , it must not be made no deb@@ ts . &quot;
widespread - in appropriate financial and success the payout of the quantity @-@ actions have been adopted until 1991 .
&quot; so , one may have been a part of the quantity @-@ damages at the time , namely from the year 2003 when a plus has been paid to the account . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it was also ra@@ ining and not detail@@ ing not@@ ations , the former president of the former president . &quot;
&quot; the accounts and A@@ spar@@ aries managed the two def@@ endants in common , the second def@@ endants said . &quot;
why the withdrawal of the association did not appear in detail and the judges asked .
&quot; the association has not been interested in detail for the financial drawing , it is important for debt relief , so the answer . &quot;
&quot; as a year of 2011 against the cost of a functioning out of Am@@ t@@ sm@@ iss@@ ants , an amount of 120@@ .000 euros was transferred to the Association &apos;s account . &quot;
&quot; these were back@@ rest , the accused . &quot;
&quot; this bank account ran into the name of the second accused , and was not aware of the association according to their asser@@ tion of the association . &quot;
&quot; why ? , I wanted to know the judge . &quot;
then the respon@@ dents knew no answer for that .
&quot; he finally said , he believed that this was the best for the club . &quot;
&quot; if something happened to him , nobody would have cried a little of that money , the pro@@ secutor placed in the room . &quot;
the accused may have been informed of the working of the functioning of the working .
&quot; this refer@@ ral was formulated as a &quot; &quot; damages &quot; . &quot; &quot;
why Bra@@ in@@ dem@@ nity ? who wanted to know the judge and pro@@ secutor .
&quot; the first accused , he did not agree with this wor@@ ding , because the association was never a def@@ ect . &quot;
&quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; With this you are all out of the T@@ ail@@ or . &quot;
&quot; am I a legal ? &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the function of the working , he has never made a cent content , he has only im@@ od@@ ly and di@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; at di@@ ets , he has made an invoice at the organization of 1,000 euros per month , but the actual effort has been much higher , however he added . &quot;
accurate documents for the early years were not able to demonstrate the accused .
&quot; these were according to a de@@ mar@@ ic , in which everything was judged as correctly , no longer had been preserved , said they said . &quot;
Milestones also had the second def@@ endants .
&quot; all containers were done in cash , for this reason , he had to lead to lead from his home international fair to lead to lead , he stated in his statement . &quot;
the main trial will continue on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .

&quot; the US @-@ Technology Group is planning to launch 25,000 and 30,000 positions in its company customer service . &quot;
&quot; thus , costs in the amount of € 2,@@ 7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) are saved , divided the business at the end of the project . &quot;
the step will result in a charged load of around 2.@@ 7 billion dollars that will fall on the fourth quarter .
&quot; the ongoing reduction of 5@@ 5,000 jobs has not yet been completed . &quot;
&quot; HP worked for the end of the fis@@ cal year 2013 / 14 still around 30@@ 2,000 employees . &quot;

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : non @-@ stop at the Ser@@ bian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police took place at the Ser@@ b border near R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ en@@ as and a h@@ ew@@ ash against several hundred blo@@ ated refugees .
Eur@@ on@@ ews @-@ correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witn@@ essed the non@@ stop on the bor@@ derland
he reported by telephone :
a group of refugees broke out the border .
&quot; behind it , a police line had formed and behind the polic@@ emen , a water@@ system was ready . &quot;
&quot; 40 to 50 refugees began to throw away with stones , sticks and plastic bottles according to the officials . &quot;
the police were first conducted in@@ variable pepper spray .
then the police were Tr@@ än@@ en@@ as .
much Tr@@ än@@ en@@ as has been spra@@ yed towards the refugees .
thus the group was dis@@ b@@ anded .
the refugees have now de@@ duc@@ ted something now .
a pregnant and apparently the last woman was removed from the zone .
&quot; kids , who had met the Tr@@ än@@ en@@ a , cried . &quot;

time of decision on interest rates for the US database
&quot; the world ob@@ serves if the U.S. database to two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , comes together to make the important decision whether for the first time now , interest rates are raised above or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey of 80 econom@@ ists who were inter@@ viewed by Reu@@ ters , found that a little more than half the last week &apos;s view was that the F@@ ed will do this now , now thinks that the F@@ ed will continue a little longer and keep the interest rates on the current state of 0 - 25 percent . &quot;
it is a historical event because it is seven years ago since the F@@ ed interest rates on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time we are approaching a situation where a major central bank may possibly leaves the zero area and start a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bi@@ de , leader of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. economy is on a relatively good performance , Bil@@ li@@ onen &apos;s dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate just a small inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less@@ er view of global circumstances . &quot;
they have warned the markets to raise up in an increase but the signs point out that chances against such a step are good .
the decision will be announced at 20.00 CET on Thursday
op@@ harm at the Delta State University
&quot; after the shooting and k@@ ill@@ ings of his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he killed his colleagues on the day - wrote Sh@@ annon &apos;s a note to say that he could make him &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; in the first murder and wanted , &quot; he could make it un@@ happen , &quot; said authorities on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , Mississippi , said that Lamb , lect@@ urer for geography and soci@@ ative Education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number against 10 : 00 on Monday morning &quot;
and he said he got on someone and killed someone .
Lamb told the staff of the emergency that the police officer must send to his home .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I created my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; would be in the house , but &quot; nobody disturbed will , &quot; but probably be excited . &quot;
the police asked the call@@ ers for his name but he did not give it .
he was not an explanation for his shots .
&quot; when police took the scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ er@@ iss , 41 , and a hand@@ written notice of Lamb , 45 , who said , &quot; I am sorry I could not return . &quot;
&quot; I loved Amy , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
&quot; after writing the notice he took 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he did E@@ than Schmidt , a professor for history , killed before he finally took his own life on Monday night as polic@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs idea . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday , he was supposed to believe that Pr@@ iss had also had a relationship with Schmidt , the authorities on Tuesday , there would be no information , no evidence of a &apos; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ iss was given by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ ste@@ en , who said she had been married approximately seven years , as a &quot; &quot; good man &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were taken over 15 years ago , but remained friends . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ iss would have been a daughter who is 19 , and she was destroyed . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ iss their daughter were &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ un@@ iss worked online from home , according to statement from Lin@@ s@@ day Know@@ les , identified by Sun Herald as a close friend of Pr@@ un@@ iss . &quot;
&quot; Know@@ les said that Pr@@ iss , who had a dog called Light@@ ning , he had experienced it for about three years . &quot;
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; said Know@@ les &quot;
&quot; the police said , he experienced relatives at a certain moment on Monday to say to them , &quot; he go not into prison . &quot;
&quot; when polic@@ emen took him on Highway 1 close to Green@@ ville , later that night depart@@ ed his car to the side , fled to foot , ran into the forest and sle@@ w himself with a shot . &quot;
he &apos;s represented in the Spring 2015 from the Delta State University a PH@@ D chapter as his lifestyle marked on the site of the university .

all this is certainly calling for its toll .
Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa is expanding the Group
Lufthansa is planning a large group of companies .
half a billion euro in the year wants to save Lufthansa @-@ Group alone with a better organization .
150 of the world around 1000 ex@@ ecu@@ tives will cost the employment area around more than 1000 ex@@ ecu@@ tives .
the Pil@@ ot@@ en@@ ge@@ union is one of the new negotiations .
Lufthansa is expanding its corporate structure and values the assets of Euro@@ wings .
&quot; the aim of the real@@ ign@@ ment is a contribution of about 500 million Euros per year out of cost and rede@@ mp@@ sy@@ ner@@ gies , divided the airline operations . &quot;
among other things with Lufthansa is no longer a member of the board for the passenger .
the Bil@@ lig@@ flu@@ gl@@ in@@ ie Euro@@ wings should thus be developed as independent as possible .
&quot; in the event of talks to Mr. Carsten Sp@@ ear , will in future be responsible for Karl Ulrich Her@@ adt for Euro@@ wings . &quot;
&quot; with the re@@ position , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ scores the importance of Euro@@ wings , with which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet . &quot;
&quot; until now , the organization of the 120 000 employees has been complex . &quot;
the airlines will operate under the roof of the Passage Air@@ line Group which represents three billion euros in the annual revenue of 30 billion euros .
new negotiations with the pilots
in the Tari@@ ff Con@@ fli@@ ct with the Pil@@ ot@@ en@@ unification Cock@@ pit ( VC ) the negotiations are to be added to the judi@@ cial strike on this Thursday .
this shared the union .
the issue of discussions should be the resting regul@@ arity for pilots .
&quot; cock@@ pit may &quot; come into a year with a pro@@ g@@ nostic record result , &quot; as soon as possible to load @-@ bearing results . &quot;
the conflict between union and airline led to various strikes over the past few months .
&quot; background is next to the trans@@ itional supply of the pilots , the &quot; &quot; Spar@@ concept &quot; &quot; Wings . &quot;
it looks that the Lufthansa is in the fight against competitors on the Group &apos;s own Bil@@ li@@ gl@@ in@@ ie Euro@@ wings .
under the title &quot; Dawn in the South &quot; there are paintings of Le@@ ena Kr@@ üger in Künst@@ l@@ erhaus .

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can not play months because of double fac@@ tions
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double fre@@ ight from Manchester to PS@@ V Eindhoven a double fre@@ ight of his right hand .
&quot; during this , the left external def@@ ender has brought to the wines and ex@@ clude him for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al will not give hope that Sha@@ w can play again this season . &quot;
the injury was caused by a rec@@ kl@@ ess attack by Hé@@ c@@ tor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20 years old Sha@@ w was built into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for 9 minutes in the field and needed oxygen before he was transported to hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double track structure and is located in the hospital . &quot;
&quot; he will then be transferred to Manchester or perhaps one day later and then in Manchester . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it has very difficult and then fantastic , and then happens that . &quot;
&quot; in the cabin , he had an oxygen @-@ mask . &quot;
he cried .
&quot; I am not a doctor , but if you have a double fre@@ ight , it will take 6 months and he will not play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope that he can play this season again .
&quot; Moreno seemed happy to escape a Red map , and the suspension of a lean @-@ meter escape . &quot;
Nicola R@@ izz@@ oli an arbit@@ rator , has not pun@@ ished the Mex@@ ic@@ ans . &quot;
van Ga@@ al suspected that the Italian arbit@@ rators would be mist@@ aken .
you can judge for yourself if I say that a mo@@ f@@ meter and a red card were sus@@ cep@@ tible .
it was a very worse attack on both feet .
&quot; a twe@@ et on Sha@@ ws account was : &quot; &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I am coming back again . &quot;
&quot; based : Manchester United has suff@@ ers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w , a defeat at PS@@ V &apos;s defeat . &quot;
the England Def@@ ender has an additional incentive in France to recover from June until the coming June .
Philli@@ p Coc@@ u the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer said : &quot; it is a very serious injury . &quot;
&quot; if a player left with this type of injury the place , everybody is very sad about it . &quot;
&quot; it is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Moreno suffered a stran@@ ds , as Mexico had played against Van Ga@@ as Holland team at the World Cup 2014 . &quot;
&quot; he is very hard because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent and if you then hear that it is a very serious injury , it is not good , &quot; &quot; said Coc@@ u . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball , which was in another direction , so it looked as if he &#91; Moreno &#93; was touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 said Moreno , &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard to be such a thing . &quot;
I feel very bad about it . I am sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also launched in hospital - after a f@@ oul@@ l@@ ude by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron wants to know The Lor@@ ax better ?
&quot; it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not last long until you know it nearly any@@ time . &quot;
unless you are David Cameron .
&quot; when he was asked by a provider of child care systems to call his favorite children &apos;s book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , the 1971 constit@@ uted eco @-@ label of Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , Cameron writes in a message on the website of the company Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; fun , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I would like to read my children , for it seems to always have a picture or a message that we have missed . &quot;
&quot; everything nice and well , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron reported the act of the book , descri@@ bing a summary of the movie version of 2012 , the new characters and details added to the fairly short original text . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams to see , fulfilling her desire to see a real tree , he reads a love @-@ interest , his real name Theod@@ or Se@@ uss Geis@@ el lau@@ d and the 1991 died , but completely unknown . &quot;
&quot; as if this is not yet suspic@@ ious enough : the text is still not suspic@@ ious enough : he is present on the website of the Lor@@ ax movie , which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database , and so begins : &quot; &quot; in the w@@ alled city Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , hopes a boy called Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he seems to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron &apos;s action of the book seems so little familiar . here , an Un@@ named Boy , like the local environment by the mer@@ cen@@ ary , trees wr@@ apped , th@@ need stri@@ ck@@ ly once , that is referred to in the name of the trees . &quot;
&quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a worker , who has not read a child for 20 consecutive times in a child . &quot;
down@@ ing Street @-@ Spe@@ aker said that the text probably came from Camer@@ ons &apos;s voting office .
&quot; Camp@@ s confirmed that the text by Camer@@ ons was delivered to employees , but gave no more immediate comments . &quot;
&quot; Adam Ly@@ th has clearly been threatened with the exclusion of England &apos;s crew , but it is still hard . &quot;
&quot; having viol@@ ate Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , is a difficult task , but if you have selected the cad@@ re that has selected the UK for the tour , is a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series of defeat is not on my map . &quot;
I would not have to ex@@ clude a money victory .
&quot; Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ ooks page may have less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good sp@@ in@@ ers in the batt@@ ing position and the communal spirit is strong ; they will not bear in 2012 with a youth@@ ful of 2012 just a youth@@ ful @-@ positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball Mo@@ een Ali develops as a spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if it represents an unknown size on test layer is an option for attack . &quot;
&quot; here : Adam Ly@@ th , re@@ tires from England @-@ Test @-@ K@@ ader and is replaced by Alex Hal@@ es . &quot;
&quot; allowing decision to allow Adam Ly@@ th , is of course hard to analyze in Yor@@ kshire , difficult to analyse . &quot;
&quot; at his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but harsh reality is that po@@ cket@@ ball@@ ers are based on results . &quot;
&quot; there were no question signs when Joe Root , for example , and this led to the nomin@@ ation , there - and I told that - players are their best selection . &quot;
&quot; long ago it would have extended the run of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own fate . &quot;
&quot; if he hopefully rounds more rounds of Yor@@ kshire , is another chance . &quot;
&quot; England Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss pra@@ ised his position , even if he did not deliver good performances , and that would not surprise me ; he is mainly a team man . &quot;
the question of how much time is going to get a test stroke to put his mark is difficult .
&quot; Ly@@ th has got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him , while Nick Com@@ pt@@ on nine got . &quot;
only Com@@ pt@@ on got the chance for home@@ work and down@@ wards .
the only re@@ pro@@ ach that can be raised was that England was first sum@@ mon@@ ed at Jonathan Lev@@ in in the Caribbean - as a ly@@ th - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex Hal@@ es comes in and he is a stroke that I highly appreciate .
&quot; he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , what we saw in Yor@@ kshire early in this season when he received 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us . &quot;
&quot; he has to receive at least the same chances as those before him , but of course it depends on the mass submission in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s beat the idea of Mo@@ een next to Cook , which would bring an extra @-@ spin @-@ bow@@ ler and four buttons , I got up , and I have nothing against it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a stroke will not beat there , and this left @-@ hand man has already shown that he is a devil &apos;s cri@@ cket player . &quot;
&quot; perhaps he has done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , yet he is a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference . &quot;
my former team @-@ mate Just@@ in Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests on the first drop before running in 2001 as Open@@ er .
he immediately introduced a three hundred che@@ us and did not look back .
Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes into the c@@ ader as Back @-@ up sp@@ inner and in my limited way of dealing with him he was very impressed as a young man .
&quot; people might see themselves on their statistics - an average 31 with the r@@ acket and 35 on the ball - and think it &apos;s a p@@ unt , but there is no large number of back@@ packs that raise their hands and the trainers have decided to youth up for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the team , England has made a few smart additions in the trainer . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ es , the Bat@@ sman from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the testing play could be a master@@ head . &quot;
&quot; it is one of the nic@@ est ker@@ le of the game , which will bring a wealth of experiences because it has played under all conditions and against all attacks . &quot;
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood occurs for the white ball stage of the tour and brings energy and a powerful deployment into the setup .
&quot; I always felt that he is created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices in the locker rooms can bring fresh wind , even if the news are in line with the previous mess@@ enger . &quot;
&quot; coll@@ ision team @-@ m@@ ates at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not inserted at the One Day@@ ers , Root was a similar pause against Australia and I haven &apos;t had any problem with it . &quot;
&quot; some will not agree , but co@@ aches and team@@ leaders do not determine the schedule . &quot;
and you must remember that as with players their jobs will depend on the results .
such decisions will not be made light .

&quot; David Camer@@ ons un@@ balanced rest@@ art strategy to stick to the UK in the EU , even without the choice of the ingen@@ ious Jerem@@ y &quot; Is there yes or no ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n became the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , which were viol@@ ently opposed to Europe on Tuesday . &quot;
foreigners have also their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Nig@@ el Far@@ ages .
&quot; a European diplom@@ acy liber@@ alism stated that some member states , so deeply ent@@ angl@@ ed in different crises , such as the EU is now and not always from own gu@@ ilt , Britain himself created agenda with split @-@ rep@@ ancies and distur@@ bing contrac@@ tions that they usually do not want to be filled . &quot;
&quot; in Brighton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it may not be if they risk the social protection . &quot;
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ fie agenda .
&quot; Prime Minister and Finance Ministers meeting on summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a picture of himself in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they will win allies for reforms . &quot;
it is always about me .
&quot; my European friend , who wish to see a looked outside the UK in the interior of the EU - &quot; L@@ ass us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and he en@@ vision@@ ed that more and more short @-@ sight@@ ed ministers and officials in some capitals to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we stay or go . &quot;
&quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel is a allies , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office until it looks bad for them as it has been bad for them like Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
French François Hollande looks on his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
he is also a bl@@ ass@@ uring force .
&quot; Poland has soon found a nation@@ alistic right government , Spain a left wing . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to imagine that it will become a ball to help the sel@@ fie @-@ British to help prevent their energy better to prevent from the UK - something that they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ at@@ ist trends . &quot;
&quot; therefore , some such ministers may even tend not inten@@ tionally un@@ helpful comments , entirely in the SN@@ P style , during the British referendum ste@@ a@@ ign 2017 , in order to accelerate the Bre@@ xit process , however , my friend . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bread@@ th &quot; and &quot; Great Britain has won nothing of value from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the Europeans know how pu@@ ber@@ ish the fle@@ et Street may be on its costs , and which EU sc@@ ep@@ tics is the oligar@@ chy of the press Bulletin , but as they did during the Tony Ben@@ n inspired referendum in 1975 but did not support our entrance in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 . &quot;
&quot; you can remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ euro @-@ opportun@@ ists who has made a name of an &quot; EU @-@ judgment of the Brussels &quot; Brussels @-@ correspon@@ dent in the early 90 @-@ s . &quot;
&quot; with all its mad@@ ness , Ed Mili@@ band , who were his enemies . &quot;
&quot; the med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear @-@ inking , telephone @-@ h@@ ack@@ able foreigners , and the pseudo non @-@ invention , which have the most of our major newspapers . &quot;
&quot; actually Tony Bl@@ air looked similar to her , but it notes that when you sit in a c@@ age with a hot Gor@@ illa in a c@@ age , to be better ban@@ anas , to diver@@ t him instead of having lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , mil@@ itia was more Bl@@ ai@@ ri@@ ans as Bl@@ air itself , when he was opposed to Camer@@ ons refer@@ en@@ du@@ ms@@ wir@@ bel , for Bl@@ air had rejected the principle of the failed Constitution of the EU , which was rejected by French and Dutch constitu@@ ents in 2005 that opened it a back@@ door . &quot;
the press never let him go .
&quot; but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly g@@ aps on the back in Westminster - I told him that he did not waste time any time for me - seems to repeat itself in danger , Neil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cott Mur@@ ten strategy of the 80 @-@ er years , a mistake at that time and today . &quot;
&quot; it can take , but it has to develop a co@@ her@@ ent strategy to gain the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ sofa has left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ no &apos;s official position on Europe - I want to be friendly - in development .
he says that we should remain in a reform@@ ist EU .
&quot; well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ bons and the wil@@ der rep@@ lica of Tor@@ y Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can probably be said to everyone to say yes . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s what Hil@@ ary &quot; One Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and TV said this week as the sc@@ outing of him strug@@ gl@@ ed to admit that Cor@@ by@@ no appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell as a push @-@ tail was a bad idea . &quot;
he reminded me of the 70 @-@ er years when his old father were trying to guard his loyal to his Labour cabinet without losing too far and losing his Cabinet .
Hil@@ ary &apos;s battle was more attractive .
&quot; to fight in order to remain under all circumstances - Benn@@ ett &apos;s expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , what J@@ C told his comrades and MP@@ s after all reports on their cl@@ ause on Monday evening . &quot;
whatever the tou@@ ch@@ less bottom @-@ up image of the Cor@@ by@@ n gives - remember that he even stir@@ red me - News @-@ Dis@@ ci@@ bility remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the spiral of Social Media , a breeding ground of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal . &quot;
&quot; it is correct to give Cameron no free card for Europe which allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the referendum , like Mc@@ Donn@@ ell it said . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins will certainly think so .
&quot; but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ no fundamental am@@ big@@ u@@ ities to EU membership - in line with its Benn@@ ite Bel@@ ager@@ ungs economy , its anti @-@ capitalist debate - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussions among the left dis@@ si@@ dents , for which the nar@@ cis@@ s@@ ism of the small sub @-@ conflict is one central principle of dog@@ matic disp@@ utes . &quot;
&quot; as with its am@@ big@@ u@@ ities to N@@ ato - Tom Wat@@ son is rocky firmly convinced that J@@ C will not start campaign for re@@ sign@@ ation , foreign diplom@@ ats are obliged to try to find in all a sense of their supervis@@ or at home . &quot;
why should Paris or Berlin become a political capital - they also have mist@@ rust@@ ful elect@@ ors - to make conc@@ essions to the British if this can be all meaning@@ less ?
&quot; the U.S. is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded of what British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum was called . &quot;
experts critic@@ ise the report of Public Health England via e @-@ cigarettes
&quot; asser@@ tions of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigarettes are less dam@@ aging than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people , some with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot;
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) un@@ Lanc@@ et by joining the public health of England ( p@@ he ) in her report about e @-@ cigarettes .
p@@ he published the &quot; Manifest@@ ations &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers have question@@ ed the stress of data question and directed toward the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
&quot; an Editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ ated basis &quot; on the p@@ he turned his most important conclusion .
&quot; two more researchers are written in BM@@ J , and they asked to build their claims &quot; on stone or sand . &quot;
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the detection of effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; they said that the public is expected that e @-@ cigarettes is based on p@@ he that &quot; the present best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes are approximately 95 % less harmful than smoking , &quot; on a detailed review of evidence and mod@@ elling . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were called to develop a model for multiple criteria Analysis ( Multi @-@ Crit@@ eria Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to demonstrate their opinions about the damage of various nic@@ otine products ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ised in a research report . &quot;
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ a@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health company whose executive director had previously served by British American Tob@@ acco ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also wrote the references from BA@@ T to Public Health in a Sustainability Report .
&quot; one of the 12 participants in the meeting stated to receive funds from an e @-@ cigarettes manufacturer , but not the financing that he had received after reports of the tobacco company Philip Morris International . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for selecting the members of the committee are not delivered , but these are several popular e @-@ cigarettes champ@@ ions , some of which also provide a branch of industries in the paper . &quot;
some other participants in this session are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the meeting the tobacco was attended by p@@ he .
&quot; the research work of the group &quot; admit , &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; tough evidence for the damage of most products in most criteria , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot;
&quot; however , no of these links or limitations in the p@@ he report will be discussed . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said the asser@@ tions of p@@ he said that &quot; &quot; there has been no evidence that e @-@ cigarettes could be used as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smokers . &quot; &quot;
&quot; prof Kevin F@@ enton , Director of health and well @-@ being with p@@ he , said that had already been respon@@ sive to BM@@ J &apos;s asser@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; he said : &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigarettes are essentially less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smok@@ er dies in his addiction .
&quot; all evidence suggest that the health risks of e @-@ cigarettes compared to that low , but that we continue to study the long term impact . &quot;
&quot; he has the unique duty to inform the public about what is evidence of evidence and what is not , especially when there is so much public confusion about relative dangers down to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; almost 8@@ 0,000 people die annually to a disease with respect to smoking , and smoking costs the national health system two billion £ per year . &quot;
&quot; due to the clear set of current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes is not without risk , but only a fraction of the infection caused by smoking , we fulfill our national jurisdiction . &quot;
&quot; BBC should give up East@@ in , says former Chief of Channel 4 &quot;
&quot; the former chair of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said the BBC should stop to give programs like East@@ ron and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give her right arm &quot; for Hit @-@ Shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said that the radio station should only be used to do the type of programs that cannot be sent by other UK transm@@ it@@ ters .
&quot; he critic@@ ized the BBC , that it will be seen publicly @-@ legal programs that are probably to be seen by a smaller public , hard @-@ controversi@@ al time in order to place the most popular shows of its ri@@ vals and sen@@ ators like BB@@ C4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC @-@ General Director , Tony Hall , told the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried for six years at channel 4 without success , with the BBC in contact . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs could be commissioned or sends them clearly not tac@@ kled ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson the Ober@@ haus @-@ communications committee in the context of his investigation about the future of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the round table fee , which I consider medi@@ oc@@ - or long @-@ term not for a good idea , one should work out at least the programs that others do not do or give orders . &quot;
&quot; they send The Voice in a prime moon window , because they want to achieve a wide support for their future as far as possible . &quot;
&quot; the idea that otherwise no one would show this is a joke , it is ridicul@@ ous , it is of course non@@ sense . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said , &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax was financed , which could also be financed without subsi@@ dies . &quot;
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ in@@ ders is another but ad@@ mitt@@ edly both peculi@@ ar@@ productions . &quot;
frank@@ ly I would give other channels to her right arm .
I am trying to see how this is public to be public .
I don &apos;t believe that this would reduce the BBC at all .
&quot; Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for seri@@ ousness , the Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 led , said that the BBC is working on the hunt for reviews &apos; because of the amb@@ itions of the people working there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on the most popular shows of the BBC give this again what the former manager of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ diary presentation in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC shows how East@@ ders should sell . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal N@@ ischen programmes &quot; to BB@@ C4 , &quot; however , they are not able to see their duties , and they can ar@@ gue that if they have created their apparent missions to just@@ ify about 4 billion £ broad@@ cast@@ ers , &quot; Well , of course , we have seen all these ob@@ sc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a tim@@ es@@ window in which no one they ever wanted to see .
&quot; to the radio station , Johnson said to the Committee , &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions that can obtain the best value . &quot;
&quot; of course , remember that one gets a great value for 150 £ a year here , but for people who &apos;s for the 150 £ a lot of money ask me whether that &apos;s true , because they consume not much from the BBC . &quot;
&quot; the former Sky@@ team and Channel 5 @-@ chief David El@@ stein , who also said before the Committee on Tuesday , requested that the BBC should examine their Rei@@ th@@ ian mission . &quot;
&quot; he said , only little by the BBC @-@ production would now officially be classified as education - he said that it should be 1 % of their TV @-@ production and 0.1 % on the radio - and it should be addressed to the public @-@ legal television stations in Australia and Canada as an example . &quot;
&quot; on the issue of partnerships said El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like that of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a hand@@ ful of television can be shown , and with the commercial bands alli@@ ances come to make everything available online . &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ ogen@@ etics &apos; can control brain cells by sound @-@ waves

&quot; the tiny nem@@ ato@@ des alter the direction in the moment in which they have with sound imp@@ ul@@ ses , which have to be heard for the human hearing too high frequencies . &quot;
the imp@@ ul@@ ses are working through the switching of Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells that are gene@@ tically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultras@@ ound channels .
further on this subject : researchers read and write brain @-@ activity with light
&quot; the researchers said that the wor@@ ms showed the power of a new procedure , called Son@@ ogen@@ etics , where ultras@@ ound can be used to activate a range of brain , cardi@@ ac and muscle cells outside of the body . &quot;
&quot; Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian , that the procedure of one day could replace the depths of the disease stimulation , a invasive procedure that gives electric imp@@ ul@@ ses into the brain of people to treat symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; mer@@ cil@@ ors usually do not respond to ultras@@ ound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani reported that they did it if they were surrounded by a fluid with micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic bub@@ bles . &quot;
&quot; b@@ lowing , he found out , rein@@ force the ultras@@ ound shafts , which then penet@@ rate into the wor@@ ms . &quot;

&quot; the sound system effect the opening of these I@@ on@@ enk@@ ins , and activate the cells in which they are assigned , such a report Nature Communications . &quot;
&quot; to create ul@@ tr@@ asonic @-@ controlled Nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani changed the wor@@ ms , that some of their mot@@ ion@@ ships TR@@ P @-@ 4 channels can wear . &quot;
&quot; when he turns ultras@@ ound to the altered creatures , the sound is reinforced by the micro@@ ves@@ icles and transferred to the wor@@ ms , where they turn the changed Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on@@ . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some similar@@ ities with Op@@ to@@ gen@@ etics , a tra@@ il@@ blaz@@ ing tool that enables scientists to inter@@ connected with stimul@@ us of light and switch . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ ogen@@ etics would have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light , that has to be sent to an optical fiber to the desired location in the brain , be able to pass low @-@ ul@@ tran@@ oise tissue , and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the sk@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily pr@@ one human neur@@ ons temporarily pr@@ one to the ultras@@ ound treatments in a clinical attitude for certain neurological treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
other applications could focus on muscle cells and ins@@ ulin @-@ producing cells then added .

eight golden rules for the life in students
&quot; eleven years ago I moved as self @-@ for@@ got@@ hic 19 @-@ year @-@ olds in a student dormit@@ ory , but only now I remember the tense of those who I have anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , long @-@ minded complaints about others . &quot;
&quot; most of what I have learned , can be dist@@ illed in eight simple rules . &quot;
the entrance into a student dormit@@ ory is from easy nerve @-@ wr@@ acking up to absolutely fright@@ ening .
&quot; it is temp@@ ting to sh@@ wat@@ ts : people tell from where you come from wherever you &apos;re in terms of Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; frank@@ ly Mar@@ mite does not love nor hate , because it &apos;s just a stap@@ le Ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
&quot; it draws the conversation and helps you find out the people you like in contrast to those with which you would not speak , even if your eyelashes would be blow@@ n out on fire and that fire extingu@@ ishers would be . &quot;
leave people .
&quot; the rooms of people often transform themselves into beverages account , film @-@ night venues and municipal meeting places , but they are also the points where people draw and under@@ wear their under@@ wear . &quot;
related to : do not think about the university with a relationship
intro@@ vert ally referred to as a cru@@ de treatment at the university .
&quot; their room should be a retreat , but many student dormit@@ ories are a space @-@ to @-@ room @-@ B@@ um@@ mel culture , which can be friendly and social and can lead to life @-@ long friendship . &quot;
&quot; this can be the Hell for someone , trying to recover . &quot;
&quot; nothing in culture allows you to say , &quot; I like you and I want to go on that our friendship is continuing , but you have to go away so that I get the energy back for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a pe@@ er@@ ant of con@@ vivi@@ ality is exhausted - and send it an SMS instead of kno@@ ck .
A@@ pro@@ pos ank@@ lo@@ ps : do you do it .
a guy in my students had the idea that a non @-@ wearing door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close through baking .
&quot; since you begin the Uni at the height of the back @-@ man@@ ie , the clo@@ ister begins to introduce the doors of people to get a bit odd than the welcome of 1950 @-@ er years &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I &apos;m going to give you something . so , and now please smile as I ask you a few personal questions . &quot;
homemade treats is a good way to make friends .
your ro@@ omm@@ ates feel obliged to enter@@ tain themselves and will end up perhaps your face with a delicious surprise .
naturally it depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
&quot; bad missed cl@@ ump of flour , sugar and fat , cause people to be sleeping , if you drop off . &quot;
ste@@ al food is an indispensable crime in students .
&quot; of course , the cl@@ aws of chicken is a theft , but is it the taking a drop of corn for your tea also ? &quot;
verify the with the dairy owner .
&quot; chances are good for they say to operate , even when they cook in the inner . &quot;
&quot; if anyone is missing your things , this is annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to handle them as my ro@@ omm@@ ate who added to their milk a dishwasher , to pun@@ ish th@@ iev@@ es . &quot;
it is now in prison .
they should make no noise which keeps people from sleep or from work .
&quot; it is not just a question of being a decent human being , but that you are in the tru@@ est sense of pro@@ verb to the people that sit in the greenhouse . &quot;
&quot; a girl in my hall@@ way asked her neighbors , whether it turns into it a thing , Drum &amp; Bass somewhat qui@@ eter , for it was three in the morning , and she had a test in the morning . &quot;
you re@@ acted to it with still more loud music .
&quot; when they stopped at 5 am when she stopped by her neigh@@ bor to sleep two hours before she ended up their own music , shut their door and came to her three @-@ hour test . &quot;
would it not be romantic if your future spouse would have acci@@ dentally reached in the same student dormit@@ ory ?
&quot; conver@@ sely , it would not be fl@@ aw@@ ed deep embarrass@@ ed when you are going to keep a ro@@ omm@@ ate for your future spouse , stick to her again and then experience them every day and maybe sometimes experience how they get all common friends up to it ? &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart passes his own way - but when a hot ro@@ omm@@ ate is definitely not your future couple of sp@@ ouses , try to speak at least , your shelter a little reason . &quot;
&quot; in the exciting moment , in which you notice that someone can leave his key in its not sle@@ epy rooms , the border between a Ul@@ k and har@@ as@@ sm@@ ent as it seems . &quot;
&quot; a good stroke is funny , but it only takes moments , until he becomes an bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
give a valuable and am@@ using lesson on security - but do not swe@@ at someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sh@@ ampoo .
&quot; close their door , and place their key in a glass of water , which you then put in the freezer - however , push your pos@@ sessions on the ceiling no more than twice . &quot;
&quot; town@@ houses for refugees , all@@ uring , high @-@ ear@@ ning &quot;
the real @-@ contract Markus G@@ ild@@ ner builds for people who do not have much money on the mid@@ market square .
&quot; for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; not only refugees need to take housing , but also the alone mother and the t@@ ear@@ ners of the Ger@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; I show how to still build a cheap and well build today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in the interview &quot;
thousands of refugees arrive on the market @-@ market as well .
entrepreneurs Markus G@@ ild@@ ner believes how quickly get cheaper housing can be created : he builds in one project town@@ houses for refugees .
&quot; Mr G@@ ild@@ ner , a lot of refugees will be pushing for the market . &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : mass accommodation in containers or gymn@@ ast has no sustainability .
because people stay here to a great extent here .
&quot; given the refuge@@ e stro@@ ma , we also need plenty of living room in the next few decades . &quot;
a very special , three @-@ sto@@ rey house @-@ house is the solution . &quot;
G@@ ild@@ ner : a town house needs the least place .
it makes things easier .
it is different if people are working in fl@@ aming .
&quot; each of the six houses , which are currently built in the pil@@ oting project , consists of three units for four asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room . &quot;
&quot; it can be that many refugees shall say , it is peace , I go back . &quot;
then the houses can easily be converted according to their respective needs .
how high are the costs ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : the price for 160 square meter living space per house w@@ ashes up to 184 euros without a plot .
this is over@@ looked .
six months the construction has taken .
this is reasonable .
do the requirements set their plans complic@@ ates ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : how do I have drawn my project correctly .
particularly complicated it is always the imp@@ ending D@@ amo@@ kl@@ es@@ cher worth special construction and the set @-@ up order .
gray @-@ noise .
it is still supp@@ ress who creates three apartments in a ty@@ re @-@ house three apartments needs at least three pitches .
only in cities is missing the place .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the inhabitants react to their Rei@@ h@@ amm@@ ate project ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : there were those who have provided me super@@ vised super@@ vised super@@ properties for asylum seek@@ ers .

but do you not ex@@ ac@@ erb@@ ated the competition for paid apartments ?
&quot; G@@ ild@@ ner : it is true that we have had a construction boom in Germany over the last five years , but build luxury apartments that hardly can afford one more . &quot;

&quot; iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone OS , when Apple update is released &quot;
&quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the setup app , in &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; and then &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; . &quot; &quot;
when it is ready you give the phone an option to download and then to install .
&quot; some are pushed for installation to problems , since they get an error message that the &quot; &quot; Software Update fails &quot; &quot; is fail@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; to get around the issue , users are advised to wait either to wait until the rush goes back or trying to update via iTunes . &quot;
the phone itself leads you through the rest of the process .
&quot; this may mean the delet@@ ing of apps to create space - but Apple has made it easier through the deteri@@ oration of the updates . likewise , it will be easier to do so when you need a special tool to delete apps and then re @-@ install it as soon as the process is completed . &quot;
&quot; it is worth to make sure your mobile phone is loaded during up@@ dating or located near a charger , so the battery is loaded . &quot;
&quot; if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue , since the phone could potentially lead to half way and could result in a break@@ up of the updates . &quot;

Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ büro is direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the Alten@@ center Anton@@ ist@@ i@@ ft have joined together under the Mant@@ le of the social stiftung and opened at the Graf St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Square .
&quot; besides consultations , one can also take part in courses . &quot;
the social inc@@ it@@ ement runs it down from the mountain to the city center .
&quot; more specifically , the Graf St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz . &quot;
there was recently opened a new qu@@ arti@@ ce office .
&quot; here , directly next to the market , you immediately get sen@@ iors and advis@@ ors information on questions such as to the care insurance or to the performances of health care and care . &quot;
&quot; for years , we have established itself alone with our out @-@ patient care provider , that many often used families alone are to be left alone . &quot;
&quot; yet , there are infin@@ itely many questions . &quot;
&quot; too often many services of the cas@@ ings are not in demand because the complexity of the insur@@ ances is hardly understood , &quot; &quot; explained the new landlord in J@@ utta W@@ eig@@ and , who will be responsible for the out@@ patient management , as well as for the out@@ patient service &quot; Amadeus . &quot; &quot;
&quot; besides the consultation offers the new Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ field , but also prevention , health care and wellness . &quot;
the sal@@ u@@ dis has been taken with the boat .
&quot; therefore , you can use additional offers such as modeling , remin@@ ders or a physi@@ otherap@@ eutic treatment . &quot;
the offers from the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in an ideal way .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and re@@ hab . &quot;

at this stage the group was at the level of b@@ ft pet@@ rol station .

Dr. Frank Müller took over practice ri@@ ck@@ ausen and invested 3@@ 10000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ resi@@ ausen .
&quot; it is also very pleased to have Managing Director Bernd Bor@@ mann , Economic Affairs in Uta Sei@@ m @-@ Sch@@ wart@@ z and As@@ endor@@ fs Mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert . &quot;
&quot; in many places at the country there are doctors - As@@ endorf , on the contrary , Dr. Frank Müller took over the practice of Fel@@ resi@@ ausen on 1 October . &quot;
&quot; while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ i@@ ausen noted in the retirement , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich will show his successor during the next few months with half a place . &quot;
&quot; after a conversion phase , Müller opens the practice on 12 October until then he invested 3@@ 10000 Euro into the premises at the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 . &quot;
&quot; it was sympathy at first glance , when the Fel@@ lows of years ago met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ g , who are currently involved in practice their medical degree in the den@@ dener Hospital . &quot;
&quot; we always had in mind that the Müll@@ ers would fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ resi@@ ausen and laughs . &quot;
&quot; when it was ready , I simply ph@@ oned them . &quot;
the couple Müller made the idea to make his own practice in the future .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact to the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot;
&quot; we want to get to know the families over the years , and join . &quot;
&quot; as an advantage , he will be able to soon be its own boss . &quot;
&quot; and so you agree , the rub@@ b@@ ish also bought the house with practice . &quot;
staying here will still be staying in Bru@@ ch@@ hausen Vil@@ sen .
&quot; there , the two @-@ fold family @-@ father Frank Müller has grown up with its medical scholar@@ ship in Hanover , followed stops in several healthcare practices as well as in the hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , N@@ ien@@ burg , and Rot@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; currently he worked as a specialist in Sul@@ ingen , in 2009 he was appointed to the executive consultant in the circle of Di@@ ep@@ ony and involved in DR@@ K @-@ willingness Bru@@ ch@@ hausen in 2009 . &quot;
&quot; from 19 September , the practice for the new boss is being prepared . &quot;

&quot; Müll@@ ers , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle down as home@@ opathy . &quot;
&quot; the End@@ os@@ copy therefore comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll . &quot;
after the reconstruction the rooms will look modern .
we will offer more ultras@@ ound exam@@ inations as well as long @-@ term and stress @-@ EK@@ GS and need a single @-@ speaking part .
&quot; furthermore , the computing system will be completely renewed . &quot;
&quot; suppl@@ ying a total of 50@@ 000 Euro , the gar@@ bage collection received within the framework of a funding range from the district of the district ( 12@@ ,000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; that shows how proud and glad we are , that practice is continued on the practice , &quot; says Sam@@ t@@ gemeinschaft leit@@ ner Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; about 2000 patients according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , every quarter performed in the practice of Fel@@ resi@@ ausen , in the North German average practice there are about 500 . &quot;
in As@@ endorf there is another general practition@@ er .
a positive effect of the practice by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ resi@@ ausen in As@@ endorf .
if no successor would have found it would have gone .
&quot; who visited Müll@@ ers , by the way continues to look mainly in intimate faces : takes over the seven medical meeting and the cleaning power of the field . &quot;
&quot; with their departure con@@ cludes in As@@ endorf an era , after all the doctors have taken a job for 30 years . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; Ur@@ sel Fel@@ resi@@ ausen noted . &quot;
a little hes@@ am shi@@ fted it after the long time already .
&quot; but we are still living in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and many patients will certainly see , &quot; says the Inter@@ ni@@ st@@ in . &quot;
your husband is compl@@ em@@ ented : &quot; we have a 6000 square meter disc .
&quot; so far I have always pushed me to gardening . now , this could be different . &quot;
also the pair has two grand@@ sons and travels .
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees from &quot;
&quot; now the border @-@ controlled shi@@ fting also to our southern border , &quot; said Minister of Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain u@@ pri@@ ght in parallel .
&quot; finally , it is clear that anyone who wants to ask a asylum @-@ motion to do so &quot; &quot; of course &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the supply and safety of the people stand in the fore@@ ground .
&quot; but it is clear that it is clear signals , &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; people need to know that we don &apos;t accept limit@@ less migration flows , nor on the Austr@@ o @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot;
it takes a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia is denied
&quot; the Croatian government had previously announced , even Slovenia plans to leave the coming refugees towards Austria and Germany and under certain circumstances build cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees . &quot;
&quot; so , it did not look at the interior of Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach however . &quot;
&quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely unacceptable , &quot; Slovenia is rather the monitoring of the border - above all to Hungary - intensi@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; the border with Croatia is as an outer limit of the cabinet , which is already heavily controlled . &quot;
&quot; as the minister stressed , Slovenia wants to get its limits for refugees but not Cal@@ abri@@ an . &quot;
&quot; every EU member must fill out its commitments , otherwise the system can not work , &quot; &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; as the Croatian government un@@ divided , the first refugees were already temp@@ ted in the night hours for Tuesday to travel at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d in order to avoid the registration . &quot;
the Croatian police could take it up in the near corn@@ fields .
&quot; according to local media , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik works constantly meet police cars with new refugees . &quot;
&quot; it was mainly about Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children . &quot;
rescue services and the Red Cross as already in operation .
&quot; in the coming days his country is charged with around 4000 refugees , &quot; said Minister of R@@ anko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; in addition , buses come from Pres@@ evo to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border which had brought many migrants to the Hungarian border in the direction of Croatia , reported Croatian and ser@@ bian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in Belgrade , the government in Belgrade go there , however , that they wanted to make certain routes , certain routes : &quot; neither can we do , nor do we want to do that , &quot; was it . &quot;
&quot; according to the media report , in the morning , a first bus with around 50 refugees arrive at the Ser@@ b border city Si@@ d , during the course of the day further buses were expected . &quot;
&quot; about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
the passengers were travelling all the night off the 500 kilometres away from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border through Serbia .
&quot; we have heard that Hungary has agreed , so we said to the police that we should drive here , &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria further . &quot;
&quot; in that way , it could actually be a previous post @-@ ob@@ server shift in the previous Balkans route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a somewhat further west of the route . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive possibilities on the border control &quot;
&quot; Croatia &apos;s Minister of O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously marked , that his country was prepared for the case of a strong stat@@ ute of refugees and plans for possible outcomes . &quot;
&quot; but he did not go , but he pointed out that Croatia as non @-@ Schengen have &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities on the border control &quot; . &quot; &quot;
they provide strict controls to qualify for membership in Schengen .
&quot; Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , and since 2007 the EU partners make a good witness to what is concerned with the Standard of the border . &quot;
on ser@@ bian side we still stuck behind the Hungarian border fence around 300 refugees .
&quot; according to Bel@@ gra@@ der media report , they would have spent the past night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , who was transferred to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; according to the Hungarian authorities the two bor@@ der@@ ies of Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i bre@@ g remain fully closed .
whether the remaining refugees are now going to travel on the Croatian border is still unclear .
&quot; the ser@@ bian Minister of N@@ ebo@@ i@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic tried to calm the wo@@ ke early in Hor@@ gos , while the debate about Altern@@ atives of refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed , early for waste . &quot;
it would not be a very high level of refugees .
&quot; could not yet say if they were able to continue their journey across Hungary , Croatia or other country . &quot;
hel@@ pers advise migrants to - dangerous - Altern@@ atively
&quot; however , private Hungarian refugees have already begun to distribute the maps that alternative routes are marked by Croatia where alternative routes are marked by Croatia . &quot;
&quot; however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the bor@@ derland there are also 20 years after the end of Croatia &apos;s war still not clear@@ ed min@@ e@@ fields . &quot;
in the weekend afternoon the Croatian police were known that a team of min@@ e@@ per@@ ch were sent in the border region .

&quot; over and over and over again , little discussions will develop on the action , about life , dealing with death . &quot;

&quot; the earnings per share thus stood at the $ $ per share , just below the $ 44 million per share , the twelve of Z@@ acks Investment Research analy@@ zed an@@ alyst@@ s . &quot;
sales rose by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion .
six of the h@@ acks asked an@@ alyst@@ s expected 12.@@ 23 billion $ .
Fed@@ Ex has in recent years a fall at the international priority @-@ university disp@@ atch , which brought back sales in its unit Express disp@@ atch . &quot;
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at Fed@@ Ex Ground .
&quot; in the last quarter sales rose by 29 per cent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs of major packages and self @-@ assurance . &quot;
&quot; the Express Unit based on higher income due to higher prices , while the result of higher labor costs in the fre@@ ight business . &quot;
&quot; in the pre @-@ market trade , about an hour before opening , s@@ ank the Fed@@ Ex @-@ shares at 3,@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , on 15@@ 0,15 $ &quot;
on Tuesday they closed 11 per cent of loss for the year and 17 percent under a record highly on 11 June .
&quot; on their most anticipated conference in the year Federal Reserve Strategic Partners spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot @-@ Honduras Mah@@ ag@@ oni table meeting to decide whether it is time for the first time since nearly a decade to up@@ lift it . &quot;
&quot; threatening over them at an end of the ench@@ anted , two @-@ sto@@ rey seats , there is a wall of the United States . &quot;
the map is a reminder of that the F@@ ed Chair Jan@@ et L. Y@@ et and her colleagues should put down the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank made a two @-@ fold contract from Congress : maxim@@ ization of U.S. occupation and prices here stable .
&quot; however , since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have recognised that there is a un@@ veil@@ ed third mandate - financial stability . &quot;
this third mandate could be the X @-@ factor in a decision which is too tight in order to pre@@ dict them . it is being announced on Thursday if the U.S. economy is ready to get acc@@ ust@@ omed from the un@@ preced@@ ented prop@@ elling since the end of 2008 .
&quot; although most data of the economy show that it grows solid , the most recent tur@@ mo@@ il will push the recent tur@@ mo@@ il to rein@@ force this vol@@ at@@ ility by lifting the interest to federal govern@@ ors - and be it only a quarter percentage . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation is primarily the most important thing to observe what they are watching , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , Head of chef at the Mak@@ ler@@ ome Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think when looking for a pre@@ text to increase the interest rate , the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough just@@ ification , continues to wait , &quot; she said . &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed is doing what itself is uns@@ ett@@ led on itself the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists who have been question@@ ed by Bloom@@ berg have predic@@ ted this week .
&quot; financial markets await the F@@ ed with a key indi@@ an , which shows only a 30 % chance of an increase . &quot;
&quot; this indicates a decline in the stock market , in case the F@@ ed increases the proposition , unless the strategies hit the impact by speaking that a further increase is far away . &quot;
&quot; at Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial average rating by 2@@ 28,@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % on 16.@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 &quot;
&quot; the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy keeps the sentence in this week , John Lon@@ ski , chef at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would take the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if she does , &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in her statement to put the financial markets , so that they don &apos;t get into panic . &quot;
&quot; other experts argu@@ ed that a tax applying to the financial markets would be re@@ ass@@ uring , because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed will act . &quot;
&quot; a month ago , the F@@ ed appeared in good ways to increase the set of 0,25 percent@@ ages in this month , the first little step in a slow intensi@@ fication of mon@@ et@@ ric conditions which would test the strength of recovery in the US . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ell@@ as had said in spring and early summer , that in this year they would be more economic progress this year despite the complaints from liber@@ als that would expect more economic progress . &quot;
&quot; although the job creation in August slow@@ ed down , improvement in the labour market was solid throughout this year . &quot;
&quot; the rate of unemployment rate to 5.4 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and close to the level the F@@ ed sees as full employment . &quot;
wage conclusions have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; and although inflation was constantly negoti@@ ated within 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason is the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and take it because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d@@ son , chef at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot;
&quot; but financial markets throughout the world came together at the end of last month , after China had prevented his currency . &quot;
&quot; the Dow Jones Industrial Volunte@@ ers value fell in May at more than 16 % below its maximum @-@ rate , as investors feared that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would increase the global growth of th@@ rot@@ tles . &quot;
&quot; this month , the market has reco@@ vered in this month , the Dow is now at almost 10 % below the och of May . &quot;
for the F@@ ed representatives the market turbul@@ ences affect the complex calculation as to increase interest rates .
&quot; if the events occur in the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last couple of weeks , Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fellow at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former associate of the U.S. database . &quot;
&quot; now he says that they are at least one month to wait to get the effects better into the handle . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the U.S. economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot;
&quot; the health of the global economy is one of the leading suppliers of the F@@ ed , therefore it should not be involved in the process of decision @-@ making . &quot;
&quot; however , in the final effect the F@@ ed Monetary Affairs is the world . &quot;
the influence of the central bank has been huge in recent years .
&quot; the mere note of the then Leit@@ ner Ben S. Bern@@ anke in the year 2013 , that F@@ ed her mon@@ eti@@ arian expansion &quot; could conc@@ ise , serious confusion around the globe . &quot;
&quot; in a world , in the markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , it can be realised by the F@@ ed representatives that they will not only monitor the developments elsewhere , but also with other central banks and experts to get a better understanding of the global economy . &quot;
&quot; your decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary car@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeffrey l@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month , that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transitions on financial market movements that cannot be linked to economic fundament@@ alists . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ackers , harmon@@ authorized member of the Federal Open Market Committee , advoc@@ ates for aud@@ its , author@@ ised decisions taken in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to cut its benchmark points in three sessions , despite limit@@ less recogni@@ z@@ able effects on growth in the US , &quot; said l@@ acker . &quot;
a year later the F@@ ed Represent@@ atives made these cuts .
&quot; F@@ ed was to put aspects of financial stability only during a severe economic crisis such as the Mark@@ tz@@ usam@@ men@@ bruch 2008 to the first place , Adam S. Pos@@ en , former Member of the Committee on the sponsor of the Bank of England . &quot;
&quot; the most recent tur@@ mo@@ il do not come near this level , he said . &quot;
&quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of a interests , because the markets increased , &quot; said Pos@@ en , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act continues to involve the double mandate and not mentioned the financial stability , and until that is changed , I don &apos;t believe that it should be predic@@ ted . &quot;

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Leben@@ sh@@ ilfe for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany this day .
&quot; to prepare a warm welcome , does not go without the un@@ committed voluntary community of volunteers . &quot;
&quot; also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da , there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seek@@ ers in the city . &quot;
among them are Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is with body and soul teacher .
she also taught her 74 lessons with her 74 lessons .
&quot; every Thursday , she is doing it in the asylum seek@@ ers at the D@@ ill@@ inger street . &quot;
&quot; there , it helps refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan , to learn the German language . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is of course different classes than at a proper school . &quot;
Brazil &apos;s pa@@ edi@@ atric Society Rio Grande promotes diet for healthy styles
the Brazilian pap@@ al organization Spr@@ S attempts to elu@@ ci@@ date women about how important good diet is due to breastfeeding complaints . it does this with the presentation of images of babies which are painted with presentations of un@@ healthy food .
&quot; breast milk is made up of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates , to give babies to all nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; because of the additional energy requirements , pregnant women and young mothers try to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake around 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research results points out that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adjustment to the mothers . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ors . &quot;
unfortunately un@@ healthy diet of the child can have a negative effect on the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Sp@@ orth@@ alle
pri@@ or@@ at Bern@@ ried approved the total amount to the 2.3 million euros expensive sp@@ orth@@ osis .
and he made an exception .
the roof is allowed to become an operating system for a solar plant .
the plans for the long @-@ level turn@@ tables at the Bern@@ rie@@ der Sport@@ age are step forward @-@ step forward : in the recent municipal council meeting the worked panel was un@@ spoiled without great discussions .
&quot; among other things , the panel on among other things had decided on a request for &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion from valid Beb@@ au@@ gment . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; was the permission for a special form on the attic . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , a &quot; s@@ addle @-@ roof &quot; &quot; was to be er@@ ected with no @-@ quality First and roof @-@ up . &quot;
&quot; background of the planning is the advanced use of the umbrella organisation for solar installations : &quot; &quot; we get a wonderful great Süd@@ d@@ ach together , &quot; &quot; declared Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; liberation , &quot; in turn , it was again about the prop@@ ensity which should be prescribed for energy reasons - anders other than in the Beb@@ au@@ ge plan - under ten degrees . &quot;
the volume of the hall is significantly reduced .
&quot; a &quot; deli@@ ver@@ ance &quot; was therefore necessary because the Beb@@ ob raises no &quot; exceptions regarding the roof@@ ing tendency , indic@@ ating the vul@@ ge typically rather restri@@ ctive when liber@@ ating orders . &quot;
&quot; however , at the turn @-@ rever@@ ber@@ ation , this is no recur@@ ring project : &quot; we do not create preced@@ ence , such as St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the exercising section at the sports center is a community project in the community and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
&quot; at the cost , some 2,3 million euros are rede@@ em@@ ulated . &quot;
grants are expected from debt and lat@@ itude promotion .
&quot; next proce@@ eding , the construction fee for the 18 x 36 meters large hall now will be presented to the maps . &quot;
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg Hospital should be joined as planned - namely 2016 .
&quot; at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is the new Doctor of the hospital Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot;
the station as well as the majority of employees move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg with to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
these are witn@@ essing the surprisingly plans of the hospital GmbH of the county in Andrea Jo@@ ch@@ ner @-@ Weiss .
&quot; a decision on the matter of the Super@@ vis@@ ory Board , and the dar@@ es on the coming Wednesday , 23 September . &quot;
&quot; if the plans should be put into action , all of the nearly 50 employees would under@@ go to the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg . &quot;
the vast majority should lead to fishermen and the next existing interior station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms were present .
&quot; people who are not able to travel back to Sch@@ ong@@ au , is to be offered a place in W@@ eil@@ heim , so Jo@@ ch@@ ner @-@ White . &quot;
the employees were informed about the plans .
&quot; triggered by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who only has been the termin@@ ate director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic until the beginning of the year , is now changing at a private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital . &quot;
&quot; the question of who to join the follow @-@ out came , came to Jo@@ ch@@ ner @-@ White , the name of &quot; Fischer &quot; into the play , who agreed , from 1st October to take the direction and exchange with his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot;
&quot; in each case the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au takes this in every case a &quot; appreciation &quot; and a wi@@ dening of the range in the field of &quot; internal medicine , &quot; so Jo@@ ch@@ ner @-@ White . &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for cardiovascular and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized in the interior of gastro@@ enter@@ ologic disorders .
&quot; at the moment for the next two years Fischer has to take part with his team , when the Super@@ vis@@ ory board has to vote , both houses will perform , until next year the former hospital of the boy@@ hood , which has a total of 35 beds , which has been defin@@ et@@ ely closed for almost 140 years . &quot;
hi@@ therto the land was planned for 2018 if the current restoration at the hospital is completed by 2018 .
&quot; the president of the Super@@ vis@@ ory Board , who is also the Chairman of the Super@@ vis@@ ory Council , re@@ aps out what the house is in possession of the Bundes@@ kn@@ ap@@ ery , in future to be used as accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; I close it out . &quot; &quot; as it goes on with the property I could not say Jo@@ ch@@ ner @-@ White , there are several considerations . &quot;
&quot; at present , there is a short @-@ time @-@ care of the Car@@ itas and a daily psychiat@@ ry . &quot;
&quot; what b@@ other could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come back , &quot; says Fischer over the Qu@@ asi @-@ Move to the Le@@ ch , which has been well received by the employees &quot; positive and very understanding . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a real perspective for the house in which Fischer has been working as a chef for over 30 years , did not exist . &quot;
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer &apos;s colleagues to take the post of medical director .
&quot; the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) has always been threatened with closure for the past few decades , for example the surgery and the birth@@ days . &quot;
the palms of all the Rhein @-@ N@@ eck@@ ar Lions are called in the Berg@@ isches HC today ( 20.@@ 15 pm ) .
&quot; the table @-@ leader of the Bundes@@ lig@@ a is in Wuppertal , the clear favourite , occasion for the tension , there is none . &quot;
in the last season the bad@@ ener at B@@ HC went a painful defeat and still have some g@@ utz@@ .

after a re@@ us@@ en@@ cing a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man was serious injury and were brought into hospitals .
&quot; how exactly it could come to the accident , was at first unclear . &quot;

a Tat@@ ar@@ susp@@ ect has led the police to the corp@@ ses of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palatinate .
&quot; in the inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation of the 20 year @-@ old , the young people were killed and their corp@@ ses were thrown into a channel in rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot;

refugees need accommodation : this study leaves in front of residence l@@ ücke
the location on the German market is tense .
more and more refugees are looking for a paid stay .
the pressure on the market @-@ market grows .
the social housing structure is facing a challenge .
the part@@ itions in the German market @-@ market have long since started .
&quot; with the coming refugees and job@@ seek@@ ers from the EU increasingly pushing for more people on a market , which is already over@@ bur@@ dened in many cities . &quot;
they compete with income citizens to wake up the last inexpensive apartments .
&quot; in order to cover the demand for paid apartments , it would have to be built in 400,000 new units by 2020 . &quot;
in this outcome comes a study on behalf of the debate with social affairs . &quot;
&quot; by comparison : this year we will finish in Germany 26@@ 0,000 units . &quot;
with that there are 14@@ 0.000 apartments .
&quot; after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer required to live in asylum seek@@ ers in a initial stamp . &quot;
many come then on the market @-@ market and lined up in the long ser@@ p@@ ents before the su@@ bl@@ ends .
&quot; according to the Austrian Federal Office , in the last year there were less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers for rent . &quot;
&quot; however , the negative development of the housing market lies not only to the rising refugees . &quot;
the study also makes considerable fail@@ ures in residential policy of the last few years .
Germany move a residential defic@@ it before itself that will be greater from year to year .
&quot; recently , in the metro@@ politan areas have already been occupied by 77@@ 0.000 residential units , by Matthias Günther , author of the study . &quot;
many professionals have therefore lived in large cities in large cities .
&quot; young adults stayed because of the dol@@ ly on the market , un@@ volunt@@ arily last longer in &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in large cities the number of square meters per cap@@ ita in the past years has decl@@ ined again .
&quot; in order to solve this problem , the alliance &quot; Social Self @-@ Building &quot; is propos@@ ing a rest@@ art . &quot;
thereby new incentives to boost social housing .
&quot; in this way , the underlying tax would be disp@@ ens@@ ed and the tax tax exemp@@ ted for funded apartments . &quot;
&quot; moreover , according to alliance &apos;s attractive tax de@@ preci@@ ation options are needed . &quot;
the funding programme for refugees from the Staats@@ bank K@@ f@@ W comes from both cities and communities .
&quot; a good week after the start was at the Monday evening with 184 million Euros , more than half of the available approximately 300 million euros have been spent . &quot;
&quot; now , the project could even be infl@@ ated . &quot;
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia has to set up a cor@@ ridor
&quot; after Hungary there is practically no enforcement , then more refugees choose the way across Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb Anno@@ un@@ ces that travel through Slovenia to North without hur@@ dles .
but the route is still dangerous .
Croatia wants to bring Slovenia to the establishment of a cor@@ ridor for refugees .
&quot; I talked to the Sloven@@ ian inter@@ minist@@ ress and when it is necessary we will organize a cor@@ ridor , &quot; said the Croatian National Minister R@@ anko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
Slovenia is situated between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; EU @-@ Land &quot; &quot; Croatia is not yet a Schengen area . &quot;
&quot; after the de@@ fl@@ ashing of the Ser@@ bian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to get from there to Western Europe . &quot;
500 people were born on the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik and the Croatian television coverage .
Hungary had closed its border for refugees in the day before .
&quot; new laws , which entered into force on the same day , will make this ordinary asylum procedures in Hungary virtually un@@ necessary . &quot;
Croatia wants to pass the refugees
&quot; Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic said , &quot; You can go through , and we prepare for this possibility . &quot;
&quot; these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and to achieve something . &quot;
but people who do not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police had taken up the first refugees on the border of Serbia on the morning of Serbia .
&quot; most of the media coverage was reported from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
the bus and tax@@ is arrived at the Ser@@ bian border city see both by bus and taxi .
&quot; immediately after their arrival , they would have been temp@@ ted to get on foot over the green border to Croatia . &quot;
at the Croatian @-@ Ser@@ b border the refugees arrive not on the boundary .
&quot; this ent@@ ails the border , and other dangers : there are sharp leads from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 90 &apos;s . &quot;
the Min@@ en@@ ography will now swi@@ ft@@ ly take a secure passage .
&quot; after Hungary , the border of the border hardly come to refugees . &quot;
on Tuesday the police were numbered 36@@ 6 people .
shortly before they were on Monday there were 93@@ 80 .
the new Hungarian laws stages the over@@ coming and corruption of the bor@@ derland as a crime .
in the south @-@ Hungarian border city Sz@@ eged were therefore 35 criminal .
the left @-@ part dro@@ ught ran@@ ds up to five years and exp@@ ulsion from the country .
&quot; according to the entry of the immigration authorities , the newly appointed &quot; &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ ions &quot; &quot; establ@@ ishes a total of 94 ana@@ esthesia , almost all - 93 - at the most important transition R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; among the players were 13 families with small children , as well as two elderly people . &quot;
on Wednesday morning there were 40 refugees to have stopped .
&quot; practically , no one has got a view to get granted in Hungary A@@ sy@@ l . &quot;
&quot; after the Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; safe third country . &quot; &quot;
the an@@ su@@ mp@@ tuous asylum seek@@ ers should get down there .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ one &quot; &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke gathered only a few hundred refugees . &quot;
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke began working to be lev@@ elled .
they gathered the tr@@ ash that left the tens of thousands of people in the past weeks at the road@@ side .
block@@ boards were destroyed and one of the recording @-@ camps in the bor@@ derland was converted .
&quot; to the end of this building , nobody wanted to express themselves . &quot;
Austria after the closing of the border between Serbia and Hungary only a few refugees arrive .
the country also has its border operations .
&quot; the 20,000 migrants lost their way to government , but still in the country . &quot;
in Salzburg about 1400 people are waiting for the further trip to Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning on the German authorities .
in Shim@@ ass@@ ing regularly met smaller groups of refugees on foot .
Mayor of the may@@ ors &quot; stran@@ ded over the border
&quot; we were after the bridge on Sunday with the house@@ wife , when suddenly ten people were standing with travel off@@ s at the entrance of the tent , &quot; said W@@ ern@@ st@@ eins Mayor Alois Stad@@ ler . &quot;
tourists who wanted to get to Pass@@ au by train to Pass@@ au .
&quot; but because Germany had been surprising with Austria by the refugees on Sunday , but for them in W@@ ern@@ stein , &quot; &quot; Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his aid and put the bases together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars on the border into the Nah@@ e Pass@@ au . &quot;
before we tried the un@@ hop@@ ed guests only once again with j@@ ause and drinks .
&quot; we were immediately said , we bring them by car to Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; this was self @-@ evident as the &quot; &quot; Stad@@ ler &quot; &quot; in the O@@ Ö@@ N conversation . &quot;
you were very grateful .
a man did not let it take a generous donation - 100 Euro for fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; this made us very happy , &quot; &quot; Urban qu@@ aters . &quot;
&quot; the flo@@ ated en@@ cro@@ ach@@ work were at the Sunday night in Wels by an ICE in a regional direction to Pass@@ au , for it was set after the short notice that the railway traffic was set to Germany after the short notice , but still beyond the border . &quot;
the regional train was put at the Inn in W@@ ern@@ stein near the Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein it is generally too high in the border @-@ border in general .
the bridge @-@ party linked to the Bav@@ arian neighbours on Sunday night long @-@ lived and organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
&quot; Viktor Or@@ b@@ án has now sent other tens of thousands of people , is a logical result of a seem@@ ingly good policy : &quot;
&quot; instead of aid in the camp of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , in the establishment of structures to help humanity , our Chancellor is highly ac@@ le@@ ased , publicly publicly the attitude of the Hungarian government to the Dun@@ st@@ iture of National Socialism . &quot;
bodies of these policies are not only those Austri@@ ans who are faced now in the boundary zones with chaotic conditions .
&quot; also the p@@ oul@@ try will notice that the &quot; &quot; pra@@ ised country &quot; &quot; that they invited and welcome , nothing but a further refuge@@ e camp . &quot;
&quot; it will be a great challenge , in view of the continuing refugees of refugees and the upcoming winter , to create decent conditions for en@@ seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; and it will be even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;
&quot; Konrad , searching for 3@@ 5,000 over @-@ winter@@ ing lists &quot;
Konrad has full hands of refugees with the Refu@@ gee .
Christian Konrad is used to bear in mind that his word has weight .
the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen Bank to set Qu@@ arti@@ ere for thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the Fir@@ st@@ ann@@ el Centre Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already got a grip on .
&quot; we have no hom@@ eless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported by his first success . &quot;
&quot; the accommodation of the 20.000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was without a big host , said Konrad , and pra@@ ised the organis@@ ational &quot; Championships . &quot;
the Ministry of the Interior spoke on the contrary of a &quot; crisis @-@ critical situation . &quot;
&quot; total , Konrad , a total of 8@@ 5,000 residents in a he@@ ed year . &quot;
&quot; in order to fulfill the number , in the coming weeks will have to be found EUR 3@@ 5,000 accommodation in the coming weeks - 20,000 should provide the countries , 15.@@ 000 of the Bund . &quot;
&quot; should there be more refugees , we can do it . &quot;
&quot; but it is not a barrel without a ground , &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot;
with the cent@@ ur@@ ions he has already led to talks .
this would have promised him also to create qu@@ arti@@ ere for the coming refugees .
&quot; in Ober@@ österreich it works well , &quot; &quot; says Ferry Ma@@ ier . &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
&quot; tomorrow , there will be a meeting with Card@@ inal Christoph Scho@@ born , will be clear@@ ed as the church will help . &quot;
&quot; great expectations is the asylum @-@ ordin@@ ator also to the OR@@ F action &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ps as we . &quot;
on the platform you can offer private individuals and easily .
&quot; furthermore , one hopes for hotels that are empty in winter . &quot;
Konrad and Ma@@ ier critic@@ ized the standards of accommodation as &quot; highly high . &quot;
&quot; in times , it could not be that Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ ors must maintain a certain height of the wrist@@ s or size of the th@@ under . &quot;
&quot; for a short time , &quot; &quot; Not@@ ification &quot; &quot; would have to apply &quot; &quot; standards &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; that in contrast to the Interior , he is more successful in keeping with accommodation , based Konrad with his experience . &quot;
&quot; I am an older gentl@@ eman , that man cannot speak without further into the face of un@@ truth . &quot;
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
&quot; Konrad and Ma@@ ier the republic cause no costs , as they themselves explained . &quot;
your employees will want to increase them to three to four .
the own arti@@ fact @-@ search has not yet been successful .
Konrad wanted to set up a container at the Steph@@ an@@ splatz .
but there are apparently problems with the permit .
Linz is calling for a better break@@ down
&quot; first , Open@@ ing City Hall and other buildings such as hin@@ ts arena and design center for keeping refugees planning the City of Linz . &quot;
&quot; this is not necessary , since one could currently under@@ go the latter without these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lug@@ er ( SP ) . &quot;
&quot; however , for the emergency , other sites should be checked on their pig@@ ment . &quot;
cr@@ iti@@ que of the city &apos;s commitment to the division of refugees within the Bundes@@ land .
also other areas must also contribute to their contribution .
Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer : &quot; borders are not sealed . &quot;
in a longer telephone call by the Bav@@ arian Prime Minister Horst Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer ( CS@@ U ) on Monday the further action in the refuge@@ e question being split .
Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer gave me back@@ rest that the German borders are not sealed .
the further voy@@ age of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany continues to be possible .
&quot; however , there are now the appropriate limit control . &quot;
special benefits with refugees to Germany will not be given any more .
the prot@@ ector would however be brought to Germany with regular journeys to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , we once again called for increased solidarity in the refugees of refugees . &quot;
&quot; that now Austria is back to controls at its borders , is a logical result for stir@@ r@@ ers &quot; as a logical result &quot; from the procedure of the Germans . &quot;
the next R@@ unt@@ astic is a matter of time
the &quot; new ship@@ yard &quot; of the &quot; New ship@@ yard &quot; in the len@@ til@@ er industry is officially completed .
&quot; four of the six floors of the office and production building , the three @-@ owned IT Group S &amp; T was pul@@ led , the rest ( 2700 square meters ) is to be rented from young , innovative companies from the technology area . &quot;
&quot; in IT , the wise head of our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T @-@ boss Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
he can imagine to invest in start @-@ up firms of the New ship@@ yard and later on which ones .
&quot; from the beginning , S &amp; T wants to co @-@ operate with the new neighbors - in which it promises something new : &quot; the next R@@ unt@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; 1.7 million euros have been invested by S &amp; T in the location , 3.2 million Euros from the Tech@@ center , which one belongs to a third of the City of Linz , the country Ober@@ österreich and the Con@@ federation ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building is operated by the Linz AG for 60 years an S &amp; T and Tech@@ center .
&quot; 30 per cent of 2700 square mile area in the building are rented , for another 40 percent give it requests . &quot;

since yesterday the new shop was in operation .
previously several weeks ago was re@@ constructed .
&quot; but I have long under@@ lined , if I still have to open a store , &quot; &quot; says broad . &quot;
&quot; decisive for the decision was among other things that the Fur@@ la producers who are at home in Bologna , from the idea of an own location , where only their hand@@ bags were sold out . &quot;
&quot; we are the only ones in the Gre@@ ater Linz , who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who has Italian roots . &quot;
your fashion interest has been widely received by her mother in the cradle .
&quot; most importantly , when a bit develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices . &quot;
why so many woman looks at sight of a nice pur@@ se on ad@@ rap@@ ture , the woman cannot answer to the last safety . &quot;
maybe it is because a nice p@@ ouch has been upgra@@ ded every out@@ fit .
der Br@@ ull@@ jes@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
&quot; the Pf@@ al@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tru@@ mp came from a place , whose inhabitants was called . &quot;
&quot; this property also connects man@@ holes with the billi@@ on@@ aire , the U.S. president wants . &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp ( 69 ) is always good for pur@@ po@@ inters .
&quot; whether foreign ownership is manifest@@ ing , journalists dis@@ es or knowledge in international crisis policy - the applic@@ ant is power@@ fully strong on the U.S. presidential office . &quot;
and cuts out well .
this will also be registered in the Ga@@ el@@ ic K@@ all@@ city where the grand@@ parents of the real estate of the estate .
the New Yorker with the F@@ öhn@@ fr@@ is@@ ur is a concept for many thanks to the win@@ zer@@ land .
man@@ holes in the 1200 @-@ inhabit@@ ant @-@ place is about -@@ zig Cor@@ ners with it related .
&quot; his grandfather was born in K@@ all@@ stadt in the Palatinate : Donald Tru@@ mp , here in a ro@@ oting . &quot;
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ t Simone Wen@@ del revol@@ t a film about Tru@@ mp .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about its purpose to become the authorized man of the world ?
&quot; I think that they find it exciting , but are not so deeply impressed by the sound of the sound , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ t has turned out a am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous bl@@ oss@@ aries , among which Tru@@ mp also counts the Ket@@ ch@@ up family Heinz . &quot;
Tru@@ mp is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y comes to &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) too much - so with the statement that he would be sure that he would be successful in K@@ all@@ city .
&quot; for the King of the hearts , he did not have it there . &quot;
&quot; though there is respect for the performance of the family , but also tend to give that Tru@@ mp &quot; was a bit of a big mouth , &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; alleg@@ edly the nickname , the K@@ all@@ city in the radius , &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ jes@@ macher &quot; &quot; - for hoch@@ deutsch : the Off@@ er , she says . &quot;
Tru@@ mp thus comes from the village of the offer .
the Tru@@ mp &apos;s success story began in 1885 when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and in the USA opened a pub for gold dig@@ gers .
corn@@ erst@@ one of the property @-@ concerts were first property sales in New York .
&quot; the life of grand@@ parents was not free from carrier : your desire to return to the long time in the homeland , the Bav@@ arian State to which the Palatinate had belonged to the Palatinate . &quot;
&quot; he did not record Tru@@ mp because he was once without permission , the director of the Institute for He@@ ating History and People &apos;s findings , Roland Paul , says to the film . &quot;
Tru@@ mp was the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
it is a contrast to the highlights of the follow @-@ up .
he had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the United States and demanded the construction of a border wall to pick out illegal immigrants .
&quot; like the pol@@ arity , this is not so sympathetic &quot; , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distance relationship of Tru@@ mp@@ s ( &quot; The Gran@@ ny was a born Tru@@ mp , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the win@@ eg@@ rower in retirement sees the Americans more dist@@ anced , &quot; &quot; he is always so up@@ setting . &quot;
believes that Tru@@ mp is coming ?
&quot; that I cannot imagine , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; he never took care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ on@@ ika Sch@@ ramm is mentioned like man@@ holes c@@ all@@ stad@@ ter , that a desc@@ endant of the family Heinz during a visit to something for the church def@@ ects , which is generally well rank@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; this I cannot imagine myself of Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; it is better that if he won &apos;t know if he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot;
&quot; if those who had the ages at the time of his grandfather in the U.S. would have been like him , &quot; would he never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ ke Sarah . &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; my president is not &quot; , &quot; says it . &quot;
and : &quot; the grapes are ripe without the President Tru@@ mp . &quot;

the great novel@@ ty for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former mass star of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; the new drama about a recently re@@ wit@@ ted father , which con@@ cludes with his two children on the coast of New Zealand , achieved a very impressive number of 1,@@ 219 million spect@@ ators . &quot;

the result of yesterday evening be@@ lied this with a clear &quot; Yes . &quot;
&quot; the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1,@@ 136 million spect@@ ators and struck slightly The Block ( 8@@ 38.@@ 000 ) and T@@ b@@ l Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26.@@ 000 ) . &quot;

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secret revealed ? ...
&quot; Lana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki probably have been ignor@@ ant who sees The Bachelor &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; finally the woman , at Sam Wood at The Bachelor eventually , was veil@@ ed in largest sec@@ rec@@ y . &quot;
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not award if she is the one that has received the last rose .
&quot; but when we were with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , Sne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and Lana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows the day before coming from three two by check@@ out , you may have acci@@ dentally given an indication of who will be the winner . &quot;
Sam Wood continues his lips up to the finals on Thursday fixed
&quot; all three women have dra@@ ined in ly@@ rical mode , why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of humor , amb@@ ition , family values and positive attitude as reasons for why they would like to be interested in his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; If not you , who should become Woods &apos;s final rose ? &quot; &quot; could their answers to the game cor@@ k who won the heart of the Bachelor &apos;s . &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mar@@ os@@ ki called both fast - except itself - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went into the house and ( Sarah &apos;s ) and Sam@@ s ener@@ ge@@ tically noticed , I felt that they were quite compatible with that , and I did that throughout the course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah is at both feet on Earth , it &apos;s so much fun to be together with her &quot; , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added . &quot;
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
you feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple .
&quot; from her perspective , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the owner &apos;s visit last week made it clear to her that Wood &quot; &quot; A &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; once I saw him with my friends and family , I realized that this obviously is not just a game - I &apos;m now un@@ conditi@@ onally put on him , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when she was asked who Wood was to go , if not she , she was pu@@ zz@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; I do not know if I can say this , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the remaining girls alike - it is a draw between Sne@@ z@@ ana and Lana .
&quot; the Bachelor is on Wednesday , 19 : 30H , on Ten sites . &quot;

J@@ arr@@ y@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams working after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
&quot; but Hay@@ ne decided the San Francisco 49@@ ers and Trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula , and it looks like a wise decision . &quot;
&quot; some coach would have known Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a c@@ ousin , as did the Aussie Rug@@ by League dem@@ nific@@ at during his first p@@ unt return on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minnesota . &quot;
&quot; but Tom@@ s@@ ula entru@@ sted to his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to a P@@ unt return , and also in the ongoing game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush . &quot;
Tom@@ s@@ ula continues to show his true face in the tables to the game .
&quot; instead of doing his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team , he encouraged them to h@@ ort@@ ise them . &quot;
Tom@@ s@@ ula strengthened Hay@@ ne also publicly at his press conference after the game .
&quot; the 49@@ ers Sport@@ rep@@ orter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by Speci@@ alt@@ e@@ ams @-@ Co@@ ordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who advised him to forget his dar@@ ed catch and care for the next game . &quot;
&quot; J@@ arr@@ y@@ d Hay@@ ne pat@@ ts with a p@@ unt , which was restored in the first game of the Minnesota Vik@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; it was certainly not the start , the Hay@@ ne and his massive Australia company for his N@@ FL @-@ record . &quot;
&quot; Hay@@ ne left after the F@@ um@@ ble flu@@ ous the game field and later was behind the Australian radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy in 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he cannot conc@@ eive the worse start to his N@@ FL career , &quot;
&quot; that was a thing that now happens , one takes care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot;
&quot; Hay@@ making is@@ hable the se@@ ater with his own Orig@@ in at that time in 2007 , when a pass was carried out in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area a T@@ ry for Queensland . &quot;

&quot; otherwise , we will get deb@@ ts in the Bav@@ arian Educational System . &quot;
the highway of the Free voters said to Friday in the fran@@ con@@ ian Commun@@ e .
&quot; actually , all other main themes were planned . &quot;
but the record number of refugees is now dominated by the Free voters meeting .
&quot; of course , the topic of A@@ sy@@ l will be over@@ lay the cl@@ amping , &quot; said A@@ iw@@ anger . &quot;
&quot; As@@ iw@@ t@@ äl@@ ven called for the establishment of the UN shelter for refugees in Syria , just as he had existed during the Yugoslavia in the n@@ ine@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; thus it is not going further , we must go to the causes , &quot; &quot; said the Free voters . &quot;
maintained asylum seek@@ ers want to push the free voters as soon as possible .
&quot; therefore , A@@ iw@@ anger also demanded more personnel for the administration of directors that are responsible for asylum seek@@ ers : &quot; we also need at least fifty new asylum @-@ arbit@@ ers , &quot; said A@@ iw@@ anger . &quot;
&quot; the FW body critic@@ ized that several Bundes@@ länder will not be consistent : &quot; &quot; we nation@@ alists nation@@ wide standards of Bundes@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bavaria p@@ one , others not . &quot;
&quot; we must be hand @-@ capable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , the state policy should not fall under the table . &quot;
a long@@ standing tor@@ ch remains on the agenda : the policy of education .
&quot; for the new school year K@@ ult@@ us minister Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) was launched at 47 gymn@@ asi@@ es for three years , during which an extension of the school @-@ stage medi@@ as has been tested for three years - in the result it will take nine years until the score . &quot;
but that goes not far enough .
&quot; the topic G@@ 9 must be acceler@@ ated , &quot; said the FW body . &quot;
we call for freedom of speech to all gymn@@ asi@@ es that want to .

&quot; Dh@@ ak@@ al Pr@@ as@@ ad Dh@@ ak@@ al , leading District Court , said that there were more than 1,000 prot@@ esters outside of a police station , with some of you war@@ n stones and bran@@ d@@ om@@ bs . &quot;
&quot; Mr Dh@@ ak@@ al said , the police have Tr@@ än@@ en@@ as and then shot down into the air before pulling it back to a story @-@ story . &quot;
&quot; 20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were wo@@ unded , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the used rubber @-@ stories , from which are known to kill , but traditionally produced as a less deadly alternative , apparently only produced a high percentage of death . &quot;
&quot; the conflict was the last in weeks for@@ ci@@ vious protests in Nep@@ al@@ ese levels , where members of the ethnic group of M@@ adhes@@ ion say that new provinces , which would be formed under the proposed new constitution . &quot;
&quot; there were protests in the western part of Nepal known by the ethnic group of the Laz@@ arus , who want to have their own state . &quot;
&quot; at least 40 people , including 11 polic@@ emen , were joined in violent break@@ down since 10 . &quot;

Google starts dou@@ bling cash campaign to collect 11 million $ for refugees
&quot; Google Inc . ( GO@@ O@@ GL . O ) announced a dou@@ bling @-@ donations campaign that should help thousands of refugees who have passed by thousands of refugees , as they have passed from war from wars and im@@ pover@@ ished countries . &quot;
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach in the announcement of donations under his blog .
&quot; instead of going to make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google co @-@ worker who was shot with her family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old , about her personal experiences . &quot;
&quot; among our journey were many dark tracks and buses , as hunger , thir@@ st , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
I was fortunate .
but as the refuge@@ e and migrants &apos; crisis has grown in Europe are looking for a lot of people like my family des@@ perate after help .
&quot; donations will go to four non @-@ profit organisations that provide help for refugees and migrants : doctors With@@ out limits , International Res@@ c@@ ue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot;
&quot; Google said , that the first global accum@@ ulated in donations until the $ 5.5 million will be doubled in googl@@ e.@@ com. &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Europe is confronted with its worst refuge@@ e crisis since World War II , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year . &quot;

coverage from Y@@ as@@ me@@ en Ab@@ ut@@ al@@ eb ; editing by Christian Pl@@ um@@ b
for easily obes@@ e diab@@ etics can be helpful and helpful .
the advantages of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last for a new study at least five years .
it is still early to tell if slightly overweight people with diabetes after the weight loss surgery live longer than those who have non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mort@@ ality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert the weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial comment on the new study in J@@ ama Surgery . &quot;
&quot; weight loss of operations or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach . &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the bodi@@ ly ability to absor@@ b food .
obesity has been proven to aid in obesity operations for the treatment of type 2 diabetes but most studies were conducted with people who have been obes@@ e with a body @-@ Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I : some degree of weight in relation to size is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.@@ 9 .
BM@@ I of 25 or more shows that someone is obes@@ e and men with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered to be obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ gov / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v
&quot; the researchers used the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital Data , which they have collected since 2007 in a study and compare two kinds of obesity and mag@@ icians - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight . &quot;
&quot; the average BM@@ I under those who under@@ went this operation , decreased from 31 to 24,@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study . &quot;
meanwhile the BM@@ I remained with those who did not @-@ surgical diabetes treatments were approximately equal to 29 .
&quot; among those who subjected to a surgical procedure , proce@@ eds with 36 % of the diabetes disease , and at 28 % partially . &quot;
&quot; in the medic@@ ally @-@ treated group , diabetes leads only by one percent and partially at only about two percent . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results were on the controls of blood pressure , the tri@@ gly@@ cer@@ ide and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL Cholester@@ ols &apos; generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group &apos; , the authors have found out . &quot;
&quot; the researchers also monitoring the patient &apos;s blood levels of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar values in the course of time . &quot;
hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c is best held under 7 percent and write the researchers .
after the surgery the average hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c level rose by about 9 percent to around 6 percent .
&quot; however , in the medical treatment group , it remained stable at about 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as is reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c level , has not decreased mort@@ ality in five years , so the leading researchers said Dr. chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also has average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year the B@@ yp@@ ass surgery group had lost more weight ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) a larger v@@ int@@ ages in BM@@ I ( 7.1 % vs. 2.1 % vs. 2.6 % vs. 2.6 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
&quot; while the new study has no survival rate of surgery after five years , there are notes from a study hard men in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study it was overweight people who under@@ went to an obesity surgery , approximately 29 per cent less likely to die over the course of 15 years - in comparison to a group that tried un@@ conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study is no advantage for survival in the surgery patient , Black@@ stone , it was re@@ ass@@ uring for people with a BM@@ I below 35 , who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because she says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , without increased risk of death or kidney illness , she said . &quot;
&quot; Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should begin to take weight seriously as soon as the patient lies with its BM@@ I between 27 and 30 . &quot;
&quot; I think that we are waiting too long until we take people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think that once they have gathered these genetic changes that have linked their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really hard . &quot;
love story playing in the H@@ uns@@ rück
&quot; it is a theme that is currently being noticed in Bell@@ et@@ rist@@ ik : a young woman , leading to school times and un@@ sight@@ ly , meets after years the flock of her youth again , and he is in love with them . &quot;
&quot; so also in the recently published novel &quot; actually , we are not so &quot; by Luisa Bin@@ der . &quot;
&quot; beyond the love of love , the novel is likely to be interesting for H@@ uns@@ rück , since he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding resorts . &quot;
the full @-@ life author has grown up in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she could put her home town a literary monument .
it &apos;s impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; &quot; &quot; Europe could not take up all refugees , the Dalai Lama answered and added that the real solution of the refuge@@ e crisis in the Middle East is concerned . &quot;
the Tibetan @-@ Buddhist guide called upon to end violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of the ongoing refuge@@ e crisis in the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford which is dedicated to eth@@ ics studies .
he demanded that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of the Western European countries is well ad@@ mired to the refuge@@ e crisis but the situation is not adequate .
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dalai Lama &apos;s Dalai Lama and Austria &apos;s efforts to get out of the crisis , he emphas@@ ised that it was a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; being able to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but meanwhile you have to think about long term solutions , such as a true peace and genuine development , primarily by education , for this Muslim countries can be created . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , we must think about how the killing is reduced in their countries . &quot;
we need to reduce the use of force .
&quot; the use of force never solved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
the Dalai Lama promised to speak the problem of violence and commented George Bus@@ hs to the terror@@ ist attack from September 11 and turned out that the violent response from the USA moved a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
&quot; after September 11 , I have expressed my sympath@@ ies in a letter to President Bush , and I said to him , The way to solve this problem lies in non@@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his mot@@ ives have been good , but he put violence and this has caused unexpected consequences , &quot; the Dalai Lama promised . &quot;
four @-@ time increase of intake of hand@@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the past 4 years
&quot; tox@@ ins in the United States report on an almost 400 @-@ imp@@ ly increase in the number of children under twelve years , which swal@@ low and non @-@ alcoholic craft@@ smen , as Georgia Po@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenue generated from Hand@@ des@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with children under 12 years of age , report from 3,@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children are increasingly coming to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in emergency , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot;
he said that some children drink a dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant while some are doing it to im@@ press their friends or for a mut@@ ing in the social media .
videos on YouTube show how young people drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants only because of a cheap adventure .
young adol@@ esc@@ ents have supp@@ osedly dism@@ ant@@ led dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with alcohol @-@ based mouth @-@ water to get a tough@@ er drink .
younger children can be shock@@ ed by attractive sc@@ ents of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those who are par@@ ental .
&quot; there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange , which are very appe@@ aling to children . &quot;
hand@@ some dis@@ inf@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 per cent alcohol .
particularly in inf@@ ants you can already run a few sy@@ ringe for alcohol det@@ ox@@ ification .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; told Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , Medical Director of the University of the University of K@@ ansas , the station Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you would leave no si@@ p whis@@ ky around you , but people leave this hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children are coming from it , then it is a rapid way to consume much alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ ij@@ ah Russell , a six @-@ year girl who had recently been taken four sp@@ lash of according to straw@@ berry ou@@ tre@@ ach in@@ ect@@ ants in school , was taken in a emergency response to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; your bleeding concentration was 179 , twice higher than the thresh@@ old that is applicable in an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor who treated them in the G@@ winn@@ et Medical Center outside Atlanta . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ ij@@ ah laugh@@ ed her words and was not able to go when they arrived in the emergency .
doctors were watching her overnight in a separate children &apos;s disease house for signs of deer @-@ trau@@ ma because the girl had fallen due to the alcohol and turned out to the head he said Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; that was very fright@@ ening , &quot; Or@@ toria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ ahu &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot;
it could have been more deadly for my child .
Lop@@ ez has parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ oral books on the range of the child .
about alcohol det@@ ox@@ ification were some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants associated with deaths .
&quot; in 2013 there were two women in Ontario , following the swal@@ low of dealers , which contained a tox@@ an , non @-@ clear@@ ed ingredient . &quot;
&quot; employees of health authorities assume that the product eth@@ anol contained , a fatal solution , rather than eth@@ yl@@ alcoholic , which has been noted as an active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in January , three students in the fourth class in the state New York to det@@ ox@@ ify their &quot; teacher train@@ ee &quot; in the case of anti@@ bacterial products in the classroom . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to the ham@@ mo@@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant and t@@ amed them out of their space .
the police regarded the negoti@@ ated plan as &quot; St@@ ation@@ tz &quot; and dism@@ ant@@ led measures to the school authority .

&quot; there are ru@@ mo@@ urs of di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y at Celtic Glasgow , what was rejected by Griff@@ i@@ ths . it insi@@ sted that he and his team amer@@ af@@ ads are not under increased control because they prepare for the confrontation with the Dutch market leader . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t believe that we feel at pressure , I think that players are looking forward to it . &quot;
the lack of title competition in Scottish football boring Dutch - de Bo@@ er
former ran@@ ger @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national players from the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans are interested in Celtic because there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the lea@@ der@@ ers .
&quot; Bo@@ er , currently an Ambassador to Ajax , said : &quot; in Holland they show no high@@ points of the Celtic Games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the lea@@ der@@ ers are not there .
people are talking about not only about the return of the leaderboard .
they talk about Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and this is what they are interested .
&quot; there is a lot of tension in the Old Fir@@ m games , and it is not just the people in Scotland that want to see those games . &quot;
I will rot@@ ate things around .
Ronn@@ y D@@ eil@@ a has accepted that Celtic has to fight , but the Norwegian boss fluctu@@ ates to turn things around . &quot;
&quot; after the defeat against Malmö and the subsequent f@@ ade from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , who are now clearly at the top of the table with five points ahead . &quot;
&quot; D@@ eil@@ a said , &quot; &quot; Celtic had already had bad times before , and we will come back again . &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
&quot; I know it is very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens . &quot;
we feel this just so - but we have to go on .
&quot; we really need , truly the support of Celtic , because that the player makes better . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; now , this is so important . &quot;
War@@ bur@@ ton take care in January @-@ transfers

&quot; the players who come in the summer have this pre @-@ season time to integrate , what you have seen with our own group this season . &quot;

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the UK it is increasing . &quot;
&quot; unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged in May until July period at 16@@ 4,000 while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1,@@ 82 million . &quot;
&quot; Scotland &apos;s employment rate of 5.7 percent was above the amount of Ukrain from 5.5 per cent , as the figures of the offices for National statistics ( ONS ) showed . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , employment fell in Scotland for 12.@@ 000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2.@@ 6@@ 12.@@ 000 . &quot;
the employment rate for Scotland fell over the quarter of the quarter to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a number above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented the latest numbers and said : &quot; the long term plan of the government has placed the corn@@ erst@@ one for a stronger economy .
it is almost exactly a year ago that Scotland has made the historical decision to stay part of the UK .
in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements on the Scottish market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment .

why I become witnesses in Okl@@ ah@@ oma in Okl@@ ah@@ oma
&quot; some@@ time later today , except in a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death . &quot;
&quot; when it happens , and I hope that it is not happening , I will sit in an audience gallery in the Okl@@ ah@@ oma State pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is ex@@ ited by the tox@@ ins . &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
&quot; the invitation was already done for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shock@@ ed I agreed . &quot;
&quot; closer , I began to fear . &quot;
&quot; so , why should I do it ? &quot;
&quot; I agreed , because I thought it would be a great way to talk the whole story about the death penalty . &quot;
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists should be seen in the U.S. and since more applic@@ ants are available as places available , a mak@@ ab@@ ere lot@@ tery takes place to decide who is chosen . &quot;
Okl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
&quot; who is selected , it will be emotional . &quot;
I cannot do that .
in addition to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps I &apos;ll face my own relationship over the months with tel@@ eph@@ ants and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
&quot; the prison authorities say that I can not be a witness and a journalist , so I will not allow myself to record a not@@ ebook and take a pen , in order to record what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remember all the details .
&quot; a journalist from Okl@@ ah@@ oma descri@@ bing me on Twitter , my im@@ parti@@ ality . &quot;
here is the lesson .
&quot; tell the story of the house , how he wants , and you get access . &quot;
I determine myself with her .
&quot; it adm@@ its that they could &quot; make it better , &quot; but they still thinks that it is wrong to what I do . &quot;
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had problem with some of the things I said and written .
&quot; he does not tell me what I have to write , and I would not do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
&quot; but he wants an international rep@@ orter to be present , in order to write there . &quot;
&quot; when he dies , he thinks that the public relations of the movement against the death penalty is going to help . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ y@@ ware , a rep@@ orter of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the event , please hear the series of pod@@ casts I &apos;ve made . &quot;
I will not want to go here again at all details .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is inno@@ cent .
his actions after the ass@@ ass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would blame him to be a benefici@@ ary of action .
&quot; however , I believe that a strong lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood is that he is not guilty of the mur@@ derer . &quot;
I certainly believe that there is not enough evidence to just@@ ify a bl@@ ur@@ ce .
I believe that its execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will die .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other rep@@ or@@ ters that you can apply for this .
&quot; what you are getting of me is what it is called to see a man an un@@ necessary death . &quot;
&quot; man after hum@@ id police per@@ chase pre@@ fers , coming from the c@@ anning River to come &quot;
&quot; the c@@ anning V@@ ale police remained dry , when he spoke the man of the c@@ anning River . &quot;
&quot; attemp@@ ting to obtain a man from Perth , the police have been un@@ successful when he was in sil@@ ky and sw@@ amp@@ y water , just a few meters away from a police officer , who tried to over@@ pass it gently to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of c@@ anning V@@ ale was launched on Tuesday at a domestic event in Beck@@ en@@ ham .
&quot; when they discovered the suspic@@ ious , they tried to escape to them in the direction of C@@ anning River . &quot;
but he did not come too far .
&quot; he stood in the water and said &apos; I did not come out , come and get away , &quot; &quot; said Senior S@@ and@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; mal@@ able Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too excited to make his uniform wet , so he turned a reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; &quot; A good police force is negoti@@ able . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
Master@@ mind Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
&quot; in 2006 , C@@ ous@@ ins hit his car in the dit@@ ch to escape an alcohol control and then tried to swim over the Swan River . &quot;
&quot; his efforts were un@@ successful , but inspired locals to the hum@@ orous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ ins @-@ Bi@@ ath@@ lon . &quot;
Peter Moo@@ dy claimed that st@@ ew@@ ards tried to make it clear and threatened to end the racing sport .
Peter Moo@@ dy claimed that st@@ ew@@ ards from Racing Victoria tries to install a sp@@ y in his st@@ ables and thre@@ aten to finish the race immediately .
he aimed at the st@@ ew@@ ards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they scratch their personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai due to a rac@@ etr@@ day treatment that led to the last straw on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media as he has always tried to do what is best for racing sport and he himself found himself under difficult conditions when it comes to the positive Cob@@ alt Tu@@ horses in Li@@ dar@@ i that cannot explain .
&quot; in 18 months he had returned for the es@@ pi@@ on@@ age accus@@ ations , and did not want it to be like a high suspension grapes . &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about it and I have long seen it , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot;
they know that it continues .
&quot; sometimes you will react , and you have to live with the consequences and I have to live with it what I said . &quot;
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; I would like to go about it , and I want my owners to remember that I try my best for them . &quot;
&quot; if they begin to think , I don &apos;t do that , then I should no longer be a co@@ aches . &quot;
I must consider what I do with my license .
&quot; before , Moo@@ dy had to make the Bom@@ b in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , that the integrity section had tried to make his barn . &quot;
&quot; before eight@@ een months , Terry Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart in a room with a man - I will use when I &apos;m asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do inside my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy to Rac@@ ing.com . &quot;
they obviously believe that I am a sc@@ am .
&quot; if that is the case , they should certainly put on their n@@ oses because they are trying to touch me . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the RU@@ L , David Moo@@ das , acting President of the RU@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ und@@ ry , current CEO of the RV@@ L , were aware of this at the time and are still today . &quot;
should I bring that in person that it is personally ?
&quot; has the RU@@ L sol@@ ub@@ ly beh@@ ave and perhaps makes people responsible outside of trainers , what is going on in the branch ? &quot;
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
perhaps people think out there that I am .
&quot; perhaps they must take my license to me and exp@@ ire me , and I have no doubt that what I say to you now think about it . &quot;
&quot; but I arrived at that point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad . &quot;
this really makes me sad .
&quot; I will put pressure on them , and push them to make a decision . &quot;
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the most of the coach of the trainer have built up with the long @-@ long co@@ alt study at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching led to that he could &quot; take his license on the table . &quot;
&quot; Moo@@ dy , best known for his preparation of the un@@ created Master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , called the Mon@@ days treatment course &quot; ridicul@@ ous &quot; after a pack t@@ ended or sound on the le@@ ver@@ age had been forced against the rules . &quot;
&quot; it is opposed to the rules of racing .
&quot; I have to assume full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one of my employees is sw@@ ayed mud on the leg . &quot;
it could have been so yesterday evening .
it could have been the whole day yesterday and so was .
but it was so on the race day .
Moo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the pack on the race . an examination of this matter has been opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules do not know about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here it is too far gone , &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot;
man after I was arrested
the police took a man on the weekend a man after a crash with a cycl@@ ist and subsequent refuge in Cob@@ ram .
the cycl@@ ist was supplied with helicop@@ ter in the Royal Melbourne Hospital with severe injury left after being hit by a car on the Saturday morning at the Murray Valley .
&quot; the police said , the motor@@ ists continued to stop without stopping , in order to help the final rider . &quot;
&quot; on Monday , there was a 50 year old man from Nath@@ alia , police in Sh@@ ep@@ part@@ on . &quot;
it is expected to be charged with c@@ ursed and sub@@ tract and due to other traffic @-@ lists .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy strikes back against ri@@ vals for ten@@ ants to ring tor@@ ches
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy has criticism of tac@@ kling his player as &quot; Agenda setting &quot; by two Premier League Favorites of the NR@@ L .
Sydney Roo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson told that the refer@@ ee will have allowed the Storm player &quot; Ring@@ bi@@ e &quot; with his team during the high storm @-@ winners in the Sydney event in Sydney on Friday night .
&quot; Brisbane Bron@@ co Trainer Way@@ ne Benn@@ ett made a little hidden comment to the Storm team after his crew had won the final victory against North Queensland Cow@@ boys on Saturday evening . he called the game a &quot; model event &quot; of Rug@@ by League and said that the two from Queensland do not &quot; too good &quot; in w@@ rest@@ ling .
&quot; Bell@@ amy def@@ ended the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his crew and said , that at the tac@@ eous one was only on their &quot; contact . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading trainers will be confident of his team , as it was dist@@ ute that they were worried about the storm @-@ team . &quot;
&quot; that always appears - I did not hear that Tr@@ ent Robinson has talked about ring competitions than they took us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; I can guarantee that nothing happened at our broken system or techniques throughout the year . but over the past six weeks we have done our contact with tac@@ kl@@ es a real main focus , and this has provided for us the sol@@ st@@ ice . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . he therefore is probably not used to get used to it , so it was a bit of shock for him . &quot;
it is aw@@ k@@ ish as this has to be seen again and again at this time of year .
&quot; Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; &quot; exciting football &quot; &quot; and remember@@ ing that Benn@@ ett St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dragons has won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football . &quot;
Way@@ ne speaks of exciting football .
he has compared his game on Saturday evening with our on Fri@@ day@@ evening and how exciting their play was . &quot; Bell@@ amy .
&quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was a boring team , and Way@@ ne said that he will take care of it at a s@@ ag . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and that we consider exciting , especially his young players at their speed . &quot;
&quot; this is the ball@@ room , which you want to play when you have this type of player . &quot;
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his way of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt , so that they can play . &quot;
&quot; I build a stronger trust because they say these things , because they are a little concerned to play against us . &quot;
six weeks ago they didn &apos;t think of us when it was about the Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against Roo@@ ster achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ co against cow@@ boys .
&quot; the game of Bron@@ co was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two other attempts at our game , but is that an exciting game ? &quot;
or are Pau@@ l@@ sen and no points to take a little gri@@ pping ?
for me it is the maps .
&quot; when they mention us , it means that we will still meet at this stage in a phase . &quot;
the Storm team is free at this weekend because they won the right to receive either North Queensland Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks on the next Saturday evening at the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales will start from next service tomorrow .
&quot; nap@@ per , $ 200,000 for drug ad@@ mon@@ tion &quot;
&quot; a man who could possibly get a life @-@ long penalty because of its use , in the possession of 40 kil@@ ograms of Kok@@ ain that were re@@ acted to Queensland in a deposit of 200,000 $ 200,000 . &quot;
&quot; Marko Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug at the Yacht Sol@@ ay , who came across South America and in August in Co@@ om@@ era . &quot;
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed how he met his ro@@ su@@ ed in the course of the previous year and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police met 40 kil@@ ograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
&quot; despite a possibly life @-@ prolonged punishment for an attempt to own a commercial set of co@@ operations , argu@@ ed the lawyer by Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic that there was no evidence that he tried to own the whole crowd and that there might have been a harmless cause in the café . &quot;
&quot; the judge of the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was concerned about the escape of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he declared the court on Wednesday . &quot;
for the trial he made the police about his wher@@ e@@ ab@@ outs .
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ mov@@ ics mother and step@@ father had offered a deposit of 200,000 dollars as security together to achieve its release . &quot;
&quot; after reading the com@@ bi@@ ous explanations of the two persons , it is clear that the issue of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; said judge F@@ agan . &quot;
&quot; but that alone will not be sufficient to keep him from , not to be out , he warned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was fre@@ ed against deposit , under the conditions that he mel@@ ted his Australian and Ser@@ bian passport which is mel@@ ted daily at the police and stick to an exit from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;

Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used by the phone of girls to pra@@ ising ped@@ oph@@ ile to the sending of images
a ped@@ oph@@ ile used the phone of a 11 year old girl to claim images of child abuse .
Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g has received the telephone of the girl as this as@@ le@@ ep claimed to be sent to an online mess@@ aging service from which he was sent by a number of imp@@ lic@@ ting pictures of children who were sent to him by another user .
the girl wo@@ ke up later and discovered that the telephone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping bag .

&quot; the police took care of it and saw the five pictures , analy@@ sed later computers that were found in the address and discovered &quot; concerned &quot; web @-@ research , which were used for the search for impro@@ per pictures of children . &quot;
&quot; H@@ og@@ g said then to the officials that he did it , since it would lead to &quot; pa@@ ed@@ ophil@@ es in the internet , &quot; and he then called &quot; there to be a polic@@ eman in order to terri@@ fy them . &quot;
&quot; the Staats@@ oper E@@ ili@@ ie Robert@@ son said the Dun@@ dee Sher@@ i@@ ff court : &quot; &quot; he said it would be an addiction , - that he was ad@@ dic@@ ted to fri@@ gh@@ ten people . &quot;
&quot; he gave that the Search on the computer were done by him , but said it was done , because he wanted to claim a polic@@ eman in order to terri@@ fy pa@@ ed@@ ophil@@ es . &quot;
&quot; he was asked for his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures , and he asked him to send more photos . &quot;
he said that he did so to l@@ ure them .
&quot; he said he was sick in my head , when he drink , and he wants to see pictures of rape and murder . &quot;
&quot; MS Robert@@ son added : &quot; when the girl found the messages on the telephone , she called her mother and was on the trem@@ bling . &quot;
she then saw the inde@@ cent images on the phone and confronted the accused .

on Friday there can be no longer the sun .
the mass makes it : every two years show the motor@@ ways at the I@@ AA their news .
2015 is mainly movement in comp@@ actors which are currently particularly well selling .
&quot; cars from the compact class are currently in particular demand : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new appro@@ vals , fell according to the force of the Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) alone in August to this segment . &quot;
this is also reflected in the I@@ AA ( public days 17th to 27@@ th of September ) .
between all the futur@@ istic concept @-@ witnesses and new Ober@@ kl@@ as@@ se@@ - and luxury cars this year are presented above all a lot of new compact models .
&quot; one of the greatest preview for the German auto industry is the Opel Astra , which will be standing in the autumn by the dealers . &quot;
&quot; Opel is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel @-@ boss Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; in order for the volume model , the volume model is also to be sold well , the new Astra should not be much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; Opel introduces a entry below the biggest compet@@ itor VW Golf in view , which starts at 17 650 euros . &quot;
the current Astra costs starting from 16 9@@ 90 Euro .
the Astra is available with a new 1.4 @-@ l@@ iter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; in addition , the H@@ esse provide other diesel and pet@@ rol engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 b@@ hp at which also included triple @-@ cylinder gas@@ oline . &quot;
&quot; unlike the main competitors of VW Golf and Ford Focus , Opel Astra is first only five thousand . &quot;
&quot; as a second variant will follow the spring of the Com@@ bi , which is also already at the I@@ AA . &quot;
and what will happen next to the Astra at the I@@ AA to new comp@@ iler ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of his Astra @-@ compet@@ itor Mé@@ gan@@ e in the race .
at the fair the Mé@@ gan@@ e is only used as a fi@@ br@@ ator in a conventional and one stressed talent GT racing .
in the trade he comes next to the beginning of next year and also as a com@@ bi .
Infin@@ iti : completely new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan @-@ spin wants to find his position in the strong growing segment with the new model .
&quot; this includes the compact op@@ iti with its curved lines full in the design line of the brand . &quot;
the basic model is equipped with a gas@@ oline engine with a power of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
but also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
&quot; Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , the celeb@@ rates in Frankfurt today . &quot;
the model is offered with gas@@ oline engines including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ l@@ iter @-@ Tur@@ bom@@ b and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is the maximum torque at 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
sales start of the bal@@ eno in Europe is spring 2016 .
DS 4 : not brand new but completely renewed is the compact class DS 4 which is at the I@@ AA .
outside the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n tra@@ der mainly laid hands on the front line : here the cooler grill has re@@ drawn and the changed spotlight with LED technology .
&quot; in the interior , above all the Inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system was moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons were reduced by a tou@@ ch@@ screen and is integrated as Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play for the first time . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , at the I@@ AA in the compact class , there are a number of revision and new variants like the new Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 308 GT@@ I . &quot;
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ T@@ egel : five square metres cells are des@@ erted
the Federal Constitu@@ tional Court has been given right for one ex @-@ in@@ mate of the pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary courts and was housed in a small cell in a small cell .
&quot; because of the injury of its human dignity , prisoners are in principle eligible for financial compensation when they are housed in too small cells . &quot;
this decision has decided the Bundes@@ ver@@ fassungs@@ gericht in a European Parliament on Wednesday .
suffer@@ ers may even expect the judges even if only a few days in the close rooms were im@@ pris@@ oned ( A@@ z . : 1 Bv@@ R 112@@ 7 / 14 ) .
&quot; thus , an ex @-@ in@@ mate with his constitutional complaints were successful in Karlsruhe : he was housed in the pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary Berlin @-@ T@@ egel between June and November 2009 in a single plot with about five square meters bottom surface ; the toilet was spatial . &quot;
&quot; after that , the man who has been moved to his An@@ wal@@ ts by now on an open walk , has moved to a larger cell . &quot;
his term report because of the un@@ worthy war conditions against the country Berlin failed .
but the constitutional judges took the judgment of the chamber music in Berlin and referred to the case to return .
they see the man &apos;s man hurt .
chamber dish now decides on the level of compensation
even if for legal reasons of the question@@ able period a few days in prison for the compensation are decisive whether the result was decisive .
&quot; otherwise , &quot; a den@@ sing of the legal protection of the personality would be feared . &quot;
the chamber dish now needs to clarify the level of money .
the constitutional complaints have often strengthened the rights of pris@@ pris@@ als in the past .
&quot; thus , they spoke first in April of a pris@@ oner , because he was naked in a cell . &quot;
&quot; life worthy is a decision of 2011 , according to the multi @-@ lay@@ out of a cell with no separate toilet . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitu@@ tional Court , who had agreed a decent accommodation in November 2009 in a parallel case in November 2009 . &quot;
the then @-@ time Kl@@ äger stayed over three months a day between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in Karlsruhe .
the Berlin pris@@ ons had also come into the headlines during the last weeks because of the lack of personnel .
&quot; pris@@ oner will therefore always be included in 23 hours , the aggressi@@ vity , even to but@@ chers , should be due to the tense situation . &quot;
&quot; according to information of the Just@@ iz@@ press@@ est@@ elle , 21 places in T@@ egel because of leg@@ ged qualified labour have not been occupied , 19 should be dropped . &quot;
&quot; Angela Merkel and the refuge@@ e policy : &quot; &quot; we are creating this &quot; &quot; &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the German Chancellor is determined to accept it .
what to come in Germany ?
&quot; about 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers are coming to Germany according to forecasts of the federal ministry in Germany , according to statement from vice @-@ ch@@ anc@@ ellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to take up a million refugees . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated with the unusual challenge of determination : &quot; I say again and again : we can create it and we create that .
what is coming to Germany is provided by the following overview .
&quot; they are used for different perspectives between the 350@@ 000 ( estim@@ ation of the federal ministry ) and 400@@ 000 ( estim@@ ation of the pest@@ el Institute ) , each year - namely the next five years . &quot;
this is almost twice as much as it has been built ( 250@@ 000 fl@@ ats ) .
&quot; dramatic is the lack of living space but above all in paid dra@@ fts : annually fall 60@@ 000 to 80@@ 000 social housing from the le@@ ase @-@ relationship , and around these particularly favourable apartments will also apply to refugees . &quot;
&quot; by currently , Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the funding from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros . &quot;
far too little is that from the point of view of the plague of the situation : 80 000 social housing has to be created annually and would need to invest in the amount of 6.8 billion per year for the Bund .
&quot; today , scientists and federal states agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investments in housing construction . &quot;
estimates of the Institute for labour market and vocational research is to assume that 55 percent of the refugees can be bought in Germany in the long term .
&quot; however , refugees in Germany would not be system@@ atically asked about their qualification to help them when you get started , Claudia Walter , project management for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation . &quot;
but for the integration of refugees is crucial as if they find jobs in Germany .
&quot; work is the key to social contacts , for the esteem in society society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of the immigration , says Mig@@ rations to Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt , there has been a political turn@@ around : a worker offered for refugees to recognise work . &quot;
&quot; while there was a working mon@@ itors for asylum seek@@ ers by up to five years ago , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the resi@@ dences of asylum seek@@ ers to a residence . &quot;
&quot; in society - also because of the lack of qualified labour , mostly the visibility hin@@ ts that refugees should enable rapid access to the labour market faster . &quot;
a great hur@@ dle for access to the labour market are missing languages .
&quot; until now , there is no sufficient offer of general and successful language courses . &quot;
studies also show that jobs are most commonly asked by personal contact .
the view of networks is therefore to view from Thr@@ än@@ hardt the König@@ s@@ weg to work integration .
&quot; the Berlin school administration has established that only a few fl@@ edged parents to spend their children in the k@@ ittens , it is estimated at ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the ro@@ ot@@ hed parents , it is only once very important to hold the family , &quot; says Il@@ ya Ko@@ schem@@ es , spokes@@ man for youth and family in the Berlin council administration . &quot;
&quot; to persu@@ ade the family from the advantages of the K@@ ita , distributed the administration of hand@@ writings in different languages . &quot;
&quot; should the need for educ@@ ators increase greatly by the great number of refugees , the Berlin Senate attempt to increase the educational capacity - about , by sending more medical schools . &quot;
in the countries pupils without German courses are being prepared for classes in welcome classes .
&quot; but they are not always taught by a educated teachers , but as in Berlin , even by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no short@@ coming , says Be@@ ate St@@ ay from the Berlin school administration . &quot;
the German Stud@@ enten@@ werk estimates that 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany .
&quot; in principle , no German asylum seek@@ ers or Ged@@ or , study - the only exception was Berlin , Inn@@ ens@@ en@@ ator Frank H@@ enkel ( CD@@ U ) has given up his position however . &quot;
study @-@ will@@ ed refugees could be facilit@@ ated access to the university .
&quot; for refugees with a common @-@ sight@@ ed or th@@ ul@@ ence do not get services after asylum @-@ seek@@ ers , more when they begin a study . &quot;
&quot; the latter is not given a BA@@ Fö@@ G , since they do not fall under the group of b@@ af@@ ov@@ arian persons . &quot;
&quot; the comp@@ ul@@ ant refugees had to have lived for four years in Germany in order to be entitled to a BA@@ Fö@@ G , from January 1st 2016 , this gap was short@@ ened to 15 months . &quot;
&quot; but this funding gap must also be closed , and request Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the Deutsche Stud@@ enten@@ werk . &quot;
the students should immediately get BA@@ Fö@@ G .
&quot; in future , Islam is going to play a more important role in the future , for many refugees are Muslims , and for many are the religion of an important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should oppos@@ e the same rights as opposed to the same rights as they have the churches , and the existing state of churches to develop into a new State of religions . &quot;
&quot; it would also be the founding of an Islamic welfare trade association , which takes care of the new@@ com@@ ers . &quot;
among the rights are also obligations .
&quot; in this way , the representatives of Islam must be in clear contact with some people and willing to work with the state in many areas and give him certain control options . &quot;
&quot; this also includes the read@@ iness , har@@ ms to religious fundament@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; the Chairman of the Central Bank of the Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Ma@@ zy@@ ek , vo@@ iced the concern , religious conflicts could also be registered in Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted to be carried out in Germany now immediately will have their right to stay here in Germany , in Germany , he said in the Bay@@ rische Rund@@ funk . &quot;
he proposed to translate the fundament@@ als to Arab@@ ian .
integration will in future be much more than today a topic of the whole society today .
&quot; this will also change the majority government , the dism@@ ant@@ ling of discrimination and rac@@ ism will change . &quot;
Germany has - as a result of European decisions - a anti @-@ discrimination situation and a gender equality law .
&quot; but it lear@@ ns very slowly , as the N@@ SU @-@ M@@ ord@@ serie , in the police and authorities the rac@@ ist motive system@@ atically ignored . &quot;
equal opportunities for everyone : what mig@@ rating organizations and stakeholders are calling for a long time and why international agreements like the Anti@@ rass@@ is@@ mus@@ sen &apos;s Germany must be a reality in the next few years when the country will remain peac@@ efully and its new citizens should be able to take advantage of their new opportunities - for the benefit of all .
&quot; generally Germany , Germany is unable to supply the expected refugees who have so far been volunte@@ ering : Frank Ulrich Mont@@ gom@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; regarding Man@@ - Power and capacities , we create that , &quot; &quot; said the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
&quot; however , it requires additional money to flow into the system . &quot;
&quot; in order to avoid bott@@ oms , Mont@@ gom@@ ery , meets all deriv@@ atives in the case of regist@@ ering health types . &quot;
generated services could later be settled in the federal states .
&quot; and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able as many people see with the limited quality catalogue , which can be received by the asylum @-@ seek@@ ers . &quot;
otherwise doctors especially make the language barriers to create .
&quot; so far , the Berlin health @-@ scientific scientist the@@ a Bor@@ de has been proven that migrants are in@@ fer@@ ior to their diseases as other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in clinics , also in medical offices , would have to be accepted for interpre@@ ting costs . &quot;
&quot; however , many refugees would also have been helping with more all @-@ general medical meetings in the emergency @-@ out . &quot;
and with another diagnostic view .
refuge@@ e deal about approximately there is much more untreated dis@@ infection and the young people go to HIV education .
&quot; with the sometimes other disease pictures , German doctors were taken from her education , but it means Mont@@ gom@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; paras@@ ite in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation or tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis are not as difficult to recognize . &quot; and as far as the appetite is concerned , the refugees would possibly be even le@@ asing in sight . &quot;
Syri@@ ans would have developed an high @-@ developed educational system ; some refugees were even doctors .
&quot; to practice the practice , they would have to im@@ pose their qualification and look at once again ex@@ ams . &quot;
at least half of those in Germany &apos;s coming refugees has been considered psych@@ ologically psychological therapy ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) psych@@ ic : most suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic loading of treatment or from depression .
&quot; refuge@@ e &apos;s refugees , says Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot;
a recent study of the Technical University of Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refuge@@ e camp trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
&quot; who is suffering from a post @-@ trau@@ matic line@@ W@@ treatment , among other things suff@@ ers from so called fl@@ ash@@ backs with breathing condition , di@@ zz@@ iness , cardi@@ ac and fat@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; further symptoms are ins@@ om@@ nia and concentr@@ ations , strong sc@@ aff@@ ability and emotional de@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; to prevent that the symptoms would be chron@@ ically , an early treatment is necessary , explained am@@ mun@@ ition . &quot;
&quot; thus far , only four percent of psych@@ ic sick refugees have received a psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; although , Psychological and asylum seek@@ ers can provide a motion for a psych@@ otherapy , but the processing usually takes several months . &quot;
&quot; moreover , in the social @-@ nations of the most state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ state workers or doctors who are not educated about the psychological diseases , whether therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; these often lead to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z . &quot;
Man@@ ege invites to dream
&quot; with the new st@@ aging &quot; Passion , &quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst looks back to the traditions of cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to draw every age group into the spell of fascinating Ac@@ rob@@ atics , Tier@@ dres@@ sage and its unique entertainment . &quot;
now the Circus Pro@@ bst invites to the Man@@ ege on the brick and wash down to dreams .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can not imagine to live without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Stephanie Pro@@ bst , veterin@@ arian and Jun@@ e@@ orch@@ ef@@ in . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; - under this motto the current defic@@ ien@@ cies stands . &quot;
&quot; for more than 33 years , the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family . &quot;
the gift to inspiration lies the family in the blood .
&quot; it is important to take away people from their everyday life and take them away for two hours to a totally different world , &quot; the 27 @-@ year @-@ old juni@@ or o@@ bey . &quot;
&quot; Man@@ eg@@ enco@@ ck@@ ene with cos@@ mopolit@@ an Fl@@ air , &quot; says Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst looks . &quot;
50 cities on the almost 3 000 km long tour can now experience this fl@@ air .
the cir@@ cus is convinced by talented artists from all around the world .
&quot; excellent at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ aro@@ v Clow@@ n Family draws the audience with w@@ it and charm in their spell . &quot;
also the Castillo Brothers understand their craft .
with the heroes of the rod @-@ movies there will be the Cub@@ an duo loose .
light@@ ness and ag@@ ility - with these words identify themselves .
your hum@@ orous art at the mast is to conquer women in the storm .
&quot; apart from numerous salmon sal@@ v@@ ities , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus Pro@@ bst looks also with t@@ act and laughter . &quot;
with the wheel on a bul@@ let bal@@ ancing ?
for He Yuan is no problem .
slim people fascin@@ ate and sc@@ are at the same time .
Wang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of the ac@@ rob@@ atics like little other and fascinated with their mot@@ ility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every sense .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; Steph@@ an@@ ies mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
ab@@ normalities in the attitude of cir@@ cus are only too often subject to various animal protection organisations .
&quot; Stephanie Pro@@ bst looks at her stand , &quot; &quot; Are you not good for our animals , nor does it work well . &quot;
approximately 80 animals from five different continents enjoy every spin @-@ on unit .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artistic &quot; &quot; works , as it is called loving , is sent after the possibility of any wish from the eyes . &quot;
we want to cooperate with the animals and have fun with them .
&quot; do not feel that animal does not feel good , it does not want to put it into the arena . &quot;
&quot; so , the top Command@@ ment is : good for the animals . &quot;
&quot; especially on their zeb@@ ro@@ id jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ ine Pon@@ y@@ h@@ gr@@ i and a zeb@@ ra @-@ stu@@ te , the family are proud . &quot;
the two animals have gathered eight years in a c@@ ages and nothing has happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
&quot; the zeb@@ ro@@ id is not yet ready for the ege , but for this it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Circus Pro@@ bst . &quot;
for each visitor something might be a bit of this .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; &quot; says Stephanie Pro@@ bst : &quot; &quot; whether five or 1 200 people , we always give our best and with all my heart . &quot;

Sim@@ bab@@ w@@ es Robert Mug@@ abe is holding false speech in the parliament
&quot; Mr Mug@@ abe , Africa el@@ dest guide , fell down at the beginning of the year from a podium down the stairs . &quot;
he remained in@@ ju@@ red but the video of the case quickly became popular over the social media .
&quot; the opening of the parliament was also arrested by members of the opposition , that they received anonymous death and had warned them to be called by Mr Mug@@ abe to be called &quot; &quot; Mr Mug@@ abe &quot; . &quot; &quot;
last month they took him and took him during his speech to the situation of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he was repeated on Tuesday .
&quot; the spokes@@ man for democratic change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven Opp@@ os@@ itions will receive SMS messages on their phones , they warned that they warned , Mr. Mug@@ ab@@ es . &quot;
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but she said the title &apos; death &apos; , he said journalists to Mug@@ ab@@ es . &quot;
&quot; it war@@ ns the Parliament negoti@@ ates that the imm@@ unity in the Parliament will end , and as soon as they leave the Parliament , their parliamentary imm@@ unity is no longer effective . &quot;
&quot; the boss , said that of Morgan T@@ sv@@ angi@@ ra@@ i a party is &quot; worried &quot; about the dangers of the politicians . &quot;
Hewlett @-@ Packard will de@@ generate up to 30.000 jobs
Hewlett @-@ Packard is expected to generate 25.000 to 30.000 jobs in the framework of restructuring and saving effort at the service of the company .
HP will later split up into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast growing company hardware and service providers .
&quot; the expected job market leads to a burden of over 2,@@ 7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett @-@ Packard Enterprise , &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chair@@ s and Chief Executive , which shall lead the unity to the separation . &quot;
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more foc@@ uss@@ ed as it is today and we have a wide and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support companies with the transition to a new style of business . &quot;
as a stand @-@ alone company we are better set up as ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our clients around the world .
&quot; Hewlett Pack@@ Packard Enterprise has more than 50 billion $ annual revenue and will be focused on providing un@@ achieved , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; such an explanation of the company . &quot;
it was issued a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s from the gradu@@ ates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard in order to manufacture electr@@ o @-@ plants and called the Palo Alto garage to the birth@@ place of Sili@@ con Valley .
HP has under@@ gone a massive restructuring around the conversion of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
&quot; the measure of HP , the world &apos;s largest PC @-@ manufacturer and one of the largest US tech company , is the newest in this area based on conviction that closely focused businesses will focus on a better performance . &quot;
FC al @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that te@@ amm@@ ates just before the game against the Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere must face
&quot; pointed out against Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only in September and if its rehabilitation is decided to plan , there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas . &quot;
&quot; this optim@@ istic scenario means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly do at least the next four games for England and in view of his history , its involvement in the next summer is certainly still un@@ certain . &quot;
&quot; the great shame on this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate Kn@@ u@@ ckl@@ ing inj@@ uries , and then returned to its old weak@@ ening during the season . &quot;
&quot; this kind of injury is not threatening the career , &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
&quot; there is a bone , which is not good . &quot;
it is not a greater matter .
this was only an accident .
it was not in connection with his an@@ kl@@ es or with the inj@@ uries that he had previously .
&quot; this may be true of purely medical point of view , but like Wen@@ ger also approved , there is the corresponding risk of further inj@@ uries , always when a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it is also developed an un@@ pleas@@ ing pattern .
the examination of Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd. marked 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut in six years ago .
he also played in just 65 of ar@@ sen@@ als and about the last five game times .
the wider picture for ar@@ sen@@ al is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six of eight times since 2007 / 08 .
&quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a v@@ icious circle , but sen@@ al believes that an improvement in the viol@@ ators of injury during the last season will last . &quot;
&quot; sometimes if you come back from an injury , you have a random period , a time in which you need to strengthen your body and win fight @-@ power , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope his body stabili@@ zes out , I am confident that he will do it and he will run a career of the kind he ear@@ ns . &quot;
&quot; ar@@ sen@@ al starts its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ sp@@ ur in the coming Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger presents itself a rotation within the team . &quot;
&quot; Hé@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey traveled not to Croatia , which means that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ uch@@ y and Art@@ eta are allowed to launch . &quot;
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ ro@@ ud instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and the players who need to get a small break @-@ up , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; although ar@@ sen@@ al of clear favorites include , through Group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir &apos;s stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the largest inti@@ mid@@ ations in Europe . &quot;
Dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign launched in the last season .
the stadium was under@@ lined on Tuesday evening by an earthquake which was measured on the Richter scale .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
&quot; Wen@@ ger is the opinion that ar@@ sen@@ al has drawn from the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco , and remains driven by far @-@ away hope to lead the association to his first European parliamentary triumph . &quot;
&quot; this drive is imm@@ en@@ sely , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it has never worked with ar@@ sen@@ al .
&quot; we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic . &quot;
we are ambitious but we are not dre@@ amy .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the com@@ edy @-@ Show that gave us serious lessons of mens friend@@ ships
&quot; the lack of similar represent@@ ations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up , now has more des@@ perate than ever before , how self @-@ regul@@ ates in young men on a 15 year high . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important cause of deaths in men at the age of 20 to 45 in Britain , and it remains 3 times more common in men than women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to address the issue , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - campaign against a ab@@ ject Life ) 2015 than the year of a man , with the aim of asking the culture to seek help if they need it . &quot;
friendship is the heart of fighting to tackle this challenge .
&quot; a recent study with more than 2.000 High @-@ School studies with de@@ press@@ ants symptoms noted that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficient high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , semi @-@ rec@@ ated a circle of spiritual healthy friends the risks of mental problems . &quot;
&quot; but of course you have to become friends only , so that a friendship can work . &quot;
&quot; in the age of about social media , with its focus on style on substance , the imm@@ in@@ ability of the answer is often more important than an important contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital life have the need to appear strong , life @-@ fun and successful , dou@@ bles , even if in reality the isolation is domin@@ ating . &quot;
&quot; this superf@@ icial success is dominated by the domin@@ ologist extr@@ in@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much more deeply . &quot;
&quot; and like a vide@@ os@@ iel @-@ inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can really not buy it . &quot;
the Beautiful in Friends was that this focus was on the head .
&quot; every character was not defined by his work , but by his personality , which sh@@ ines through the interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the humor of Jo@@ ey and Chand@@ ler &apos;s frequent h@@ ugs , Mom@@ ents at soccer player in cozy arm@@ chairs and longing for Ross - all this came out of knowing that men can refer to each other , even if they often try to keep completely their feelings . &quot;
&quot; as an employee of the phone care , I explained : ... &quot; my audience call for people who feel de@@ pressed , and self @-@ mur@@ der@@ ous , showed me really clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
&quot; the men who contact us , are often not able to talk to friends . &quot;
&quot; the old Rede@@ mption &quot; &quot; come right with it &quot; has an enormous effect , as the feeling of being perceived as weakness when talking about problems . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to my mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it presents itself clearly the little moments of mens friend@@ ships .
&quot; so much my objective exceptional status over the phone may also help the people in moments of despair , but the long term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
and so when you visit this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the celebration of the day exploring the completely new scenery ! why don &apos;t take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
&quot; or , even better , if you want to sit in Star@@ bu@@ cks someone on your own , give him a smile and say hello . &quot;
one never knows what makes your friendship could make .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from beginning to end - full of 236 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
&quot; di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to help Hunedoara
angel Di Maria celeb@@ rates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Edin@@ son Cav@@ ani after its hit against Malmö .
&quot; di Maria meets at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday , helping PS@@ G to proceed to Malmö . &quot;
here are the review and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Edin@@ son Cav@@ ani held on Tuesday when Paris Saint @-@ Germain began its champ@@ ions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malmö in the Prin@@ cen@@ ary Stadium on Tuesday .
&quot; di Maria met less than four minutes after starting his Champions League Deb@@ ü@@ ts as PS@@ G player who brought the French champion on the way , but afterwards they missed a number of opportunities before reaching a head jump than Cav@@ ani during the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in the group A , Paris needs a strong start to the Swedish masters , since they are not only concerned the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out l@@ aps , but an improvement in the way to the four @-@ quarters in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they got the points , there was no class from Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Zlat@@ an Ibra@@ him@@ ov@@ ics . he was later in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the association , with whom he began his illustr@@ ating career in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it is not easy to win home or up@@ ward in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to gain some circumstances and look back , even though there are certain things we have to have to master in the course of season , &quot; said Blanc . &quot;
&quot; this is a good sign .
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we didn &apos;t have one or two more gates . &quot;
&quot; Ibra@@ him@@ ovic was returning to his injury in one of three changes to the Paris @-@ Team , on weekends a 2 : 2 Un@@ decided at its own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but it was ej@@ ected during the fourth minute by Di Maria . &quot;
&quot; the Argentin@@ ean wing @-@ stor@@ ms has been referred to as the man to take the PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe when he went to Manchester United in the last month , and he pointed out why , when he finished in Marco Ver@@ r@@ att@@ is Pass , before Johan Wil@@ and is passing by beautiful in the long corner of the network . &quot;
&quot; if however , someone believed that PS@@ G would win a great victory that was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malmö , the Celtic to reach a play @-@ off to reach that level , came across the field at An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was a five @-@ man defense and two deep positioned in Central America . &quot;
&quot; but besides a shot of Nik@@ ola Dj@@ ur@@ dj@@ ic , who went far to Kevin Tr@@ apps P@@ fo@@ sten in the 34@@ th minute , offered them little in the attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G itself was sometimes referred to , with some mis@@ ses and bad sl@@ ug@@ es , not least by Ibra@@ him@@ ovic , who had not least been counted by Ibra@@ him@@ ovic in the first half alone and then after Cav@@ ani continued him after rest@@ art@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; however he pointed out much more skill , when he brought his fellow musicians to the game and it was a pass of Ibra@@ him@@ ovic , the Di Maria was transformed into a shooting , which was directed by Wil@@ and at the 5@@ 2nd minute ... &quot;
&quot; finally , the second gate came finally shortly after the hours of Cav@@ ani . the Uruguay began its sixth season , after Ibra@@ him@@ ovic had a left side of Max@@ well . &quot;
&quot; it ended up all thoughts that Malmö could return to the game and only have an outstanding intervention of Wil@@ and from recent distance to David Lu@@ iz , before spare player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi was a gate at the end . &quot;
&quot; the coach of Malmö , Age Har@@ eide , was later announced that PS@@ G played a class on his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; &quot; our last Champions League game was last December last year . &quot;
since then we played only in the Swedish le@@ ague &apos;s le@@ ague that did not have the same level .
the qualifying sessions are not enough . &quot;
hut in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !

&quot; to remember : in summer 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern . &quot;
Guardi@@ ola was the cause that X@@ avi is not inter@@ s@@ inter@@ ed
the change did not come about .
the crucial man for this work is now working for the German record : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
X@@ avi explains why : &quot; Bar@@ ça has taken Guardi@@ ola under contract and I played a great EM . &quot;
PE@@ P told me that I would not change that he could not imagine the crew .
&quot; with this he has been defe@@ ated . &quot;
who knows how Bay@@ re@@ am &apos;s Play@@ time 2008 / 2009 would be mer@@ ged with X@@ avi .
&quot; X@@ avi stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter @-@ finals of the Champions League against Bavaria about the entire distance on the law@@ ns , down@@ stream the reds out ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated at the end the Royal classes . &quot;
Matt Dam@@ on plays diversity in film production
Matt Dam@@ on met the af@@ ro@@ American filmm@@ aker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about diversity and said they won &apos;t get behind the scenes .
&quot; during a series of Sunday night from HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown broke out when this was the need for alternative perspectives while in relation to a black prot@@ agonist in the selected script of the project . &quot;
&quot; when we talk about diversity , then do it during the occupation of the film and not the occupation of the show , &quot; Dam@@ on . &quot;
Brown re@@ acted shock@@ ed with off@@ ended Un@@ believe and called &quot; ho@@ o ! Wow . okay &quot; when the comments of the actor by The Mar@@ tian was wor@@ ded .
Dam@@ on and Brown closed the producer of producing Ben Aff@@ l@@ eck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show @-@ fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to be demanding people to think about - who will always be the director - as they treat the character of the Harmony , &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot;
&quot; the only black person , and she is a wh@@ ore which is be@@ aten by their white sp@@ rop@@ or@@ tions . &quot;
the producer of De@@ ar White People sat down for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio of the direct rights to the movie ; Dam@@ on war@@ med that their direction &quot; ended up to something we might not want .
&quot; after the discussion was aired , the social media was le@@ ased from dis@@ appro@@ ve of ladies . &quot;
&quot; Twitter followers Mr Po@@ oni thr@@ ust his w@@ ut about the clip , saying &quot; Matt Dam@@ on says about the only black person in the room , so he can explain her variety - that &apos;s SO MU@@ ISS that it does hurt . &quot;
&quot; the twe@@ et serves more than 5,000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 Li@@ kes since its publication . &quot;
Dam@@ ons comments will come at a time when the exact r@@ acial representation in the media is at the top of social discussion .
&quot; after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white police officer , the movement hit Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter came into effect and betra@@ yed legislation and regulatory authorities . &quot;
&quot; in February , the singer also made a reference to the movement during the introduction of the appointed albums of the year at Gram@@ my Awards . &quot;
&quot; album quiet ( albums ) &quot; &quot; ( albums have still their meaning ) &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; like books and black life , albums are still their significance . &quot;
&quot; during this time the leader of Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter had published an explanation and in response to the question of the Fox @-@ News @-@ personality Elisabeth Hassel@@ beck , if the group should be viewed as a hate group . &quot;
&quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love @-@ group , &quot; said the leaders . &quot;
&quot; recently , Dam@@ on was announced on a list of entertain@@ ers , producers and media gu@@ ts that were invited to visit the Pope to discuss about the representation of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot;
&quot; whether he accepted the invitation or hit the Pope , is unclear . &quot;
&apos;@@ American Ninja Warrior &apos; Kr@@ ön@@ t first Champion
&quot; professional Sport@@ forum and operator Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero was the first athl@@ ete , who won the American Ninja Warrior on Monday night and took the Grand Prix of 1 million $ . &quot;
&quot; the competition which completed just their 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who could shut down all levels of his obstacle course . &quot;
&quot; during the season of the season there are two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and c@@ amer@@ aman &apos;s j@@ ubil@@ ee , down to the finale . &quot;
the last task part of climbing on a 75 foot long Kletter@@ rope in 30 seconds .
&quot; B@@ ritten ended the task within the time , with which he was the first athl@@ ete , completed the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior . but , Cal@@ di@@ ero ended this challenge full three seconds faster than that made him winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! News after hard @-@ fought victory , still under shock over winning the Great prize of 1 million $ . &quot;
&quot; I mean , it is amazing to think about that , I have never had more than 10,000 $ or a life , &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap money . &quot;
as suddenly .. as I can not even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the finale and why B@@ ritten , although he did the first at all to win the race , not some prize money . &quot;
after the rules the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alists , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot;
how much the money is a wonderful price and the life changes he receives the great Gr@@ ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t believe that he has had any resent@@ ment on this .
he is just so happy to have done what he did .
it was awarded by fans from the awards .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; If I should be be@@ aten by someone , then I am happy that it is Isaac . &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt the same when they missed the roles .
&quot; America Ninja Warrior was extended for a prestigious season , which will start shooting in spring 2016 . &quot;
Detroit Tig@@ ers secured with Minnesota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ OL@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
&quot; formerly they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers stand on the last place in the American League Central . &quot;
&quot; however , the Tig@@ ers have been reduced to their role as a spo@@ iler , but they played perfect on Tuesday with the Minnesota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in target Field . &quot;
the tw@@ ins don@@ ated a chance to climb within one leg of the Houston branch for the second American League su@@ card @-@ Platz .
&quot; Detroit , although only for one evening , it was a return of three letter F Word to summar@@ ize a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all vict@@ ories are fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; told Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Aus@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; Tiger Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon gave up his early offensive supporting , than Detroit three times in the first two internal , once again in the sixth and then again in the ninth . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) had six times in the 1 / 3 Inn@@ ings and made up three R@@ uns .
it was only a third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to finish this year much , &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to throw at the Bull@@ ring of each game , and therefore I really want to go into the game . &quot;
&quot; the designated Tiger @-@ Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and stayed in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BI@@ s since the middle of August . &quot;
&quot; it was the first thirty @-@ hit game of Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits to the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6 . &quot;
&quot; he has the p@@ board well curved , &quot; said Aus@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at his training ( stroke ) , looked much better at the bull@@ pen , and he brought it straight to the game . &quot;
&quot; with three R@@ uns in the background at the end of the seventh internal , T@@ wins had the best chance to get back into play . &quot;
center F@@ iel@@ der Byr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton ended the inning with a double on the left wheels .
&quot; right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks reached a t@@ unt , and Simon gave his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to the ke@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Hard@@ y . &quot;
Hard@@ y went to the only man to face the designated Rookie @-@ stroke Miguel S@@ ano who had been a two @-@ run before the designated Rookie @-@ stroke Miguel S@@ ano who had a two @-@ run .
one pair of run@@ ners and the finishing in the second brought to the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe on a double play .
it was this year the major League &apos;s leading 27 times in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe suggested a double play
&quot; after Detroit added at the end of the ninth inside an Insurance @-@ Run , the wall gained a R@@ BI double against the Cl@@ os@@ er of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and recorded the stand of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; however , the left @-@ handed sla@@ p on three Pit@@ ches for his fifth save . &quot;
Detroit prof@@ ited for the start of the game from an unknown Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
&quot; the Tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two in@@ ings against the right @-@ handed @-@ veter@@ an who had been ri@@ pped in front of the game from the viol@@ ators , after he had left over a month for a back . &quot;
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wished for me , &quot; &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; &quot; but I felt better than I started doing and felt that I was able to make some pretty good pit@@ ches out there in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; after having received the Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ Bat@@ ter , Hus@@ bands gave a single at Second B@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into the game , which was awarded a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game . &quot;
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z made his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the Run@@ ners in the Scor@@ ing position .
&quot; the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed by a single on the right hand side , managed to get another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third of what the threat ended . &quot;
the Tig@@ ers laid on on the second sco@@ red one One @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a two @-@ out single from Center @-@ F@@ iel@@ ding Anthony G@@ ose to the 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; it was a great blow , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul mol@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; he did not see particularly well , but he got the right place . &quot;
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a Pit@@ ch @-@ Count had no points in the third inning before going through the re@@ lics A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter was replaced .
&quot; at Hu@@ gh@@ es , there came to three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four stri@@ ke@@ es . &quot;
note : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ chez was due to a violation of the worm treatment .
he is studied by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who work the shoulder of San@@ chez in 2007 .
San@@ chez in the middle of August on the off@@ ending list because of a shoulder setting should be activated for the start on Wednesday .
&quot; with San@@ chez from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris from the viol@@ in@@ ist list drops to start fighting against the tw@@ ins . &quot;
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at 4 starts with the Tig@@ ers since he was purchased in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he has been missing since 20 August due to a spark in the right hip .

Isch@@ ia : German military measures in Syria an option
&quot; the head of the Munich security conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , considers military measures with a German involvement in Syria for an opportunity . &quot;
&quot; I think the thinking about military action options may not be held without Germany , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
he cast the European States &quot; collective @-@ looking . &quot;
four years ago we have been glad that the chal@@ ice of a military involvement in Germany has gone .
&quot; now the conflict t@@ ends to go ahead of our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot;

&quot; the Austrian Secretary of Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner declared on the Tuesday evening at the Austrian television station OR@@ F , to Hungary no one will now be returned . &quot;
Germany no refugees returned to Austria in Germany too .
&quot; no , that is so agreed , &quot; she stated . &quot;
&quot; on the question of an agreement , after which Germany could include a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , said Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , I already given this relevant discussions between the Direct@@ orate @-@ General for Public Safety and representatives of Germany . &quot;

Germany had started on Sunday with a temporary border control .
the European states have so far failed to engage in some common action in the crisis .
&quot; the EU &apos;s ministers want to take a new startup to the binding distribution of further 120 000 refugees on the coming Tuesday ( 22 September ) .
&quot; in the face of the strong refuge@@ e sand@@ ran@@ ch in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries with the initial and distribution of people . &quot;
&quot; the Con@@ federation is going to be taken along with the countries , announced on the late Tuesday evening after almost four hour discussions with the Prime Minister in the ch@@ anc@@ ellor of Berlin . &quot;
&quot; Merkel under@@ lined , those people , the protection of bre@@ aches , converted it too . &quot;
&quot; but those who have no lead @-@ weights , could not remain in Germany . &quot;
this idea was op@@ pres@@ sive in the lap .
the ch@@ anc@@ ellor stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a &quot; huge stren@@ uous effort . &quot;
thousands of dou@@ b@@ ted refugees have now stuck in the Baltic route .
Hungary had closed its 175 kilometres long border with Serbia on the night of Tuesday .

no diet fruit - man@@ goes contain a lot of sugar
man@@ gan@@ ese are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
but who wants to watch out on his slim line will often rather be dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
because Mang@@ os contain a relatively lot of sugar - especially su@@ c@@ rose .

&quot; when buying , man@@ goes should not be too soft or too firm and cra@@ w@@ ling . &quot;
the work @-@ color alone does not say anything about how mature the fruit can - thus can taste green man@@ gan@@ os very delicious .
you should stop at room temperature and within a few days .
then taste them pure or in sweet dishes .
&quot; however , there is also a man@@ go , but there is a special touch . &quot;
it l@@ essen the slightly bitter taste of some let@@ tu@@ ats such as Chic@@ ra@@ e and Radi@@ c@@ cio .

Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz
almost 500 years after the Reformation there is now a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz .
&quot; in the presence of San Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino at Wednesday , a previously und@@ less place in the park on the Opp@@ io @-@ Hill had been bapt@@ ised in the name of the German reform@@ ators . &quot;
in the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; he is now known as the &quot; German Theatre of the Reformation . &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome next to the Colos@@ seum .
the nam@@ ing was applied by the work community of the Protest@@ ant churches in Rome .
&quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Luther@@ an Church in Rome , was reminded that the Protest@@ ants in the city of the pop@@ es have lived as a minority often only in secret . &quot;
&quot; in that way , I am visible in symbo@@ lical manner that their tradition of the Christian faith in Rome is welcome . &quot;
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) remained as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k for the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a couple of months in Rome .
he conceived the city at that time as a real scap@@ ego@@ able .
his negative impressions are likely to be pun@@ ished in his later fight against Rome in his later fight against Rome .
Luther had then introduced with his thes@@ es against the exp@@ ir@@ ruption of the Church of Western Church .
hammer artists invested three years into the personal interpretation of the Bible
&quot; Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) Dor@@ nen@@ kr@@ one is one of the main buildings , the Ot@@ mar Old for his Bible . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and a bi@@ ble text .
in the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not with the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which is now released with glorious pictures . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning the picture was formulated for Ot@@ mar Old , who has formulated his very personal inter@@ pret@@ ations of biblical tales on paper and canvas . &quot;
his &quot; speech &quot; with colorful colors and fant@@ asi@@ ev@@ ollen made the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but what is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; images .
&quot; on the contrary , the individual topics are adapted , this can be quite dark . &quot;
&quot; about three years , Ot@@ mar Old has worked on his bi@@ ble project , for which he has made a subjective artistic selection from the many topics &quot; &quot; book of all books &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; arose cycles , which dev@@ ote themselves to topics like cross@@ roads , pl@@ agues , bi@@ ds or pat@@ ernity . &quot;
&quot; thus , he has been fascinated by several partners : this applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with his the@@ ological focus as well as the Kettler @-@ Verlag , with its focus on art books . &quot;
&quot; and since it is mainly the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , which faced based on painting with the respective Bible . &quot;
&quot; he has interpreted the form of Ot@@ mar in the chosen scrip@@ tures , and thus translated into the present state , into current co@@ her@@ ences . &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirror of Al@@ ts painting .
&quot; nestled between the original Bi@@ bel@@ z@@ itat , Martin Luther and one set of the artist , who has put his personal thoughts on the situation here . &quot;
the jewelry @-@ band has golden liz@@ ers .
&quot; thus , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows twice a deep insight into his soul , its emotions . &quot;
this is a high level of intim@@ acy .
&quot; emotions were ultimately born to be a trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Old , 1940 in W@@ ern@@ ig@@ er@@ ode and raised in Berlin , comes from a family who belonged to the strict Protest@@ ant Herr@@ n@@ der Order . &quot;
&quot; then the education was already done with the pel@@ ot@@ stock , &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Old . &quot;
&quot; I have tried to re@@ work that , in order to be able to toler@@ ate myself again with the Lord &apos;s father . &quot;
his second concern is to assist in art in qu@@ icker time again : &quot; the perception of sculpture is today shaped by advertising and that is loud .
symbol@@ ism will be constra@@ ined .
artists have a different desire and Pleas@@ ure to show things .
pictures have always something myst@@ ical and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Old wants to let the viewer in the images of &quot; &quot; go @-@ colored &quot; &quot; to discover them and feel that strength they have : &quot; the image is looking for his counter@@ part . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was founded on Tuesday at the presentation of Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Faith in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , which has always been a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Art . &quot; I like , as he understands with his pictures . &quot;
&quot; not to take care of the Bible fully , but it was important for him to fully grasp the Bible . &quot;
&quot; this was not collaboration at the anter@@ ior height , &quot; &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; here it is about the images , the text is explained . &quot;
&quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler of Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and to find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pictures speak for mosquit@@ oes both the ( biblical ) language of love and responsibility .
part of the origin@@ als - paper and cloth materials - is presented for the first time in an exhibition that will be opened on November 15th in Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation .
starting @-@ start for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn comm@@ uter
&quot; plans made , place found , company deleg@@ ates , past@@ ors for a circuit model@@ ed : one year later was almost everything ready - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X @-@ Bahn was already at the end again . &quot;
&quot; fail@@ ures in politics and management pain@@ ters for embar@@ ras@@ sm@@ ent , especially for residents who did not toler@@ ate the trains . &quot;
&quot; so hill deport@@ ed , new place sought - now with formal planning and application of building permit . &quot;
&quot; the approval will be in October , the First Con@@ greg@@ ate Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck could now inform you in the kinder@@ garten and youth affairs committee . &quot;
&quot; I hope that this year &apos;s more visible , she said . &quot;
&quot; it should then be started without &quot; &quot; further mem@@ or@@ atory &quot; &quot; with the works at the former Hall@@ enb@@ one . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; the football matches the escal@@ ating situation in Germany and sec@@ ures the policy its help in addressing the cont@@ ag@@ ious problems . &quot;
&quot; I think this is the greatest challenge of our country since the re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; when no one can say , I have nothing to do , I have nothing to do with that . &quot;
&quot; you must be interested in getting this issue into the handle , &quot; said DF@@ B @-@ chief Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; at the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September , he wants to intensi@@ fy the refuge@@ e situation in Germany intensi@@ vely . &quot;
&quot; I am the next Wednesday in the ch@@ anc@@ ellor , and re@@ efs there the State Department of Mrs O@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the ch@@ anc@@ ellor . &quot;
&quot; thus the subject will certainly play a central role , &quot; he announced . &quot;
the football could and wants to help .
but the crucial woman must put politics .
the German soccer le@@ ague therefore has extended its refuge@@ e @-@ initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; at four years .
&quot; about the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation , we ensured that this program runs through 2019 , &quot; explained ren@@ bach on the edge of the UEF@@ A conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
also some Bundes@@ lig@@ ists support this program .
this weekend would indicate the 36 Pro@@ fi@@ ver@@ - a clear sign when they are on the left tri@@ cot@@ po@@ orer place instead of the otherwise normal sponsor@@ ship &quot; we help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot;
&quot; we want to make it clear that everybody should help , where and how they can , &quot; &quot; said Lever@@ k@@ usen to the &quot; picture &quot; paper ( Tuesday ) and posted the project as &quot; self @-@ evident . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refuge@@ e @-@ drama goes to everyone , nobody can take away . &quot;
&quot; we can use soccer power , our influence and our opportunities to help the many refugees who have so incredibly well suffered , &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
H@@ auf@@ hei@@ ms Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig talked of a &quot; emin@@ ent signs of the League . &quot;
&quot; for the EM @-@ Quali@@ fication game against Hungary on this Friday , the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale . &quot;
&quot; Nier@@ s@@ bach signed the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; a large communal work in German football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 licens@@ ing had started its own projects in their places is great .
just as magnificent is that small and smallest associations are active .
&quot; the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome , &quot; which we have spent will be lived in football . &quot;
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said . &quot;
in this and the next year the association will provide together with the DF@@ B selection and the Federal Government of 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees .
&quot; the clubs have already launched the whole of 2015 , &quot; said Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot;
reports : SAP Net@@ at@@ ch@@ ef loses an eye on the accident
&quot; the Board of Directors of Europe &apos;s greatest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has lost several reports according to the left of July the left eye . &quot;
&quot; in the accident at the staircase in the house of his brother in the United States , he fell to midnight for a waterfall , which he worn in the left hand , reports the &quot; &quot; economic week &quot; &quot; on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; it is almost ble@@ eds , then power@@ less , took out straight down on the road - it he told us so last week , &quot; c@@ ited the &quot; Wi@@ b &quot; SAP @-@ co @-@ founder Has@@ well Platt@@ ner . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could possibly take his work out .
&quot; beginning of October we meet at the Super@@ vis@@ ory conference in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; says Platt@@ ner . &quot;
54 years old managers were at the meeting and &quot; fully functional . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday issue ) , he will come back to Germany in October and lead to the software group . &quot;
&quot; I am full for SAP , full of my job . &quot;
&quot; of course I was in regular contact with the supervis@@ ory board and its president Has@@ well Platt@@ ner , &quot; &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t comm@@ uting usually between Germany and the USA , but since summer he was no longer in the German SAP Head@@ quarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; it is important to be dealing with such personal history to the public , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; said : &quot; everyone can happen in such a thing . &quot;
&quot; important is to stand up again , if you really like . &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ replacement pilot @-@ Magn@@ us@@ sen besides skir@@ m@@ ish ...
&quot; Magn@@ us@@ sen t@@ wit@@ ter@@ te a corresponding photo and stated that he suffered the violation , as he was over@@ thrown by the wheel . &quot;
&quot; along with the after@@ work in Singapore a little comes as a reservation for the two tribe of Fernando Al@@ onso and J@@ en@@ son Button , such as a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan . &quot;
football : B@@ VB without Re@@ us against Kras@@ no@@ dar
&quot; at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes to com@@ eback a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us in the first group play of the Europa League . &quot;
the national player will be missing the table @-@ leader of the soccer le@@ ague of the Bundes@@ lig@@ a at the F@@ K Kras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7.@@ 00pm / Sky ) .
&quot; unfortunately we can not withdraw from him , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; whether Re@@ us will be back on Sunday at the Bundes@@ lig@@ a game against Lever@@ k@@ usen , the B@@ VB coach will be open : &quot; we expect a return from him to training on Friday . &quot;
&quot; given the high load of its pros , Tu@@ chel will not only change its Stam@@ atic position on the Re@@ us position . &quot;
&quot; so , he announced a change on the door@@ ke@@ epers position . &quot;
therefore Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is taking the place of tri@@ b@@ art@@ ender Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; he trained on an absolute top level , pra@@ ised the soccer teacher the world champion . &quot;
whether you want to use Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the future in all Europe @-@ le@@ ague for action left Tu@@ chel however .
with high probability he will be riding the second match .
&quot; the for@@ sche statement of fellow @-@ players Re@@ us that the Fin@@ als for the B@@ VB is to be the target , it holds mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian W@@ eig@@ l for understandable : &quot; so Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
&quot; I think that we have a good chance to access the title . &quot;
Robot@@ er@@ au@@ tos : government wants to take the lead in Germany
Germany shall be according to the will of the federal government for the change of the car technological for@@ bear@@ er .
&quot; the cabinet d@@ lock on Wednesday a Strateg@@ i@@ ep@@ ap@@ ier from the house of traffic , Alexander Dob@@ r@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which among other things investment in the expansion of digital infrastructure . &quot;
Dob@@ r@@ ind@@ t said on Wednesday in Frankfurt at the border of the Autom@@ esse I@@ AA from a &quot; new mobile system . &quot;
&quot; automated , and connected driving will increase the road safety and provide less stress , said Dob@@ r@@ ind@@ t . &quot;
he also wants to discuss the issue with his counter@@ parts from the G@@ 7 states that come together with representatives of the industry also with representatives of the industry .
the Strategic Department of Transport is emphas@@ ised among other things the importance of mobile broad@@ band construction and a generous uph@@ e@@ av@@ al on digital radio station .
the testing of new technology is currently being created a test @-@ line on the highway 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; with the driver &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks , &quot; &quot; the federal government wants to review the legal framework &quot; and , where necessary , to adapt to the new developments . &quot;
&quot; for example , Germany int@@ ends to stand for example in Germany that the per@@ mis@@ sible maximum speed is raised for auto @-@ driving cars from 10 to 130 km / h . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Government wishes to stand up for a change in the Vienna Convention , so far only the human being used as a driver . &quot;
&quot; automated driving takes over in increasing the car the lead , the driver becomes more and more to passenger . &quot;
the technology is primarily based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in sec@@ uring fast .
&quot; according to a study by the Ministry of Education , Bosch will be technically possible to drive high@@ ways to 2020 technically possible . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , driving cars on public roads are expected to be expected only far after 2020 . &quot;
&quot; the value added in the field of chassis transfers , and the high @-@ automated functions of the Federal Republic of Germany estimate the authors of the study for 2025 to around 8,@@ 4 billion euros . &quot;
&quot; the digital networking of the PK@@ s can lead to more safety and efficiency in traffic , &quot; said SPD @-@ traffic @-@ policy S@@ ören Bart@@ ol . &quot;
the question of liability in accidents and the security of personal data of the driver must be clearly understood .
yet the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars are sc@@ ep@@ tical - a lot more than the French or the Americans .
&quot; an on Wednesday at the AA propos@@ es survey conducted by the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the testing process of DE@@ K@@ RA , that only 8 percent of Germans believe that autonom@@ ous cars in the next ten years would have gone through , 32 percent would not even believe in it at all . &quot;
&quot; in France , 21 percent of respon@@ dents come to 2025 with aut@@ on@@ om driving cars , in the US 33 percent . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the drivers in Germany are not yet ready to run on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle . &quot;
&quot; after collecting the digital use of Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to agree with control throughout the journey through all roads . &quot;
&quot; on the highway , that in flowing traffic can be reached at least 15 per cent , in the St@@ au 45 percent . &quot;
&quot; well , every Fourth would leave the car under no circumstances . &quot;
B@@ oll says mult@@ is@@ ki@@ h and double @-@ start at table tennis @-@ EM
&quot; the Düssel@@ dor@@ fer will be present at the title of the title , from 25 September to 4 October only in single individual . &quot;
the final decision will be handed down at the latest on 22 September .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; the guys have experienced it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; but we are strong enough to take the title even without Timo the title , &quot; &quot; said Bun@@ dest@@ ing Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf , during the EM @-@ Lehr@@ fall in Düsseldorf . &quot;
B@@ oll was at this time on the flight to a long @-@ term re@@ funded sponsor@@ ship in China .
the 34 years old German champion is expected on Friday .
&quot; without Timo is the dis@@ advantage , we are no longer such a clear favorite &quot; , &quot; said individual Eur@@ y@@ man Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot;
the Ham@@ el@@ ner who passes the her@@ es@@ ist in Ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg and rec@@ ti@@ fied to the EM 2013 in Sch@@ ern@@ at .
&quot; back then Timo also left him , and we have been the eurozone . &quot;
&quot; therefore we should be oriented , &quot; stated the wel@@ ve figure @-@ Fifth . &quot;
the English soccer player Luke Sha@@ w by Manchester United has gained a serious injury on the right side .
&quot; in the Champions League game at the PS@@ V Eindhoven , the def@@ enders was hit with a tac@@ at@@ tire of Hé@@ c@@ tor Moreno and after a long treatment . &quot;
the first diagnosis indicated for the 20 years old fellow @-@ players at Bast@@ ian ra@@ ins on a railway sector .
Gaul@@ tier is too old for an en@@ ant TER@@ RI@@ BLE
it is a combination of very large mo@@ den@@ seal and a watch@@ dog image : the designer Jean Paul Gaul@@ tier ( 63 ) wrote an exhibition on Wednesday in Munich on Wednesday .
the highlights : - HAN@@ G@@ ERS
&quot; they carry the spectacular creations of the French designer , which was among other things with Mad@@ onn@@ as a stage out@@ fits to the great star of the fashion scene - and so that he put men in tubes . &quot;
&quot; I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant TER@@ RI@@ BLE of Haute Cou@@ ture , because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; earlier it was ble@@ ak , meanwhile it is real , &quot; &quot; says Gaul@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for visitors to the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , that will be seen from September 18 at Kunsth@@ alle des Mort@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is a lucky that the Mo@@ des@@ ch@@ öpf@@ er has changed his first con@@ sol@@ ation attitude towards a show about his person . &quot;
&quot; actually , he was against it , for me , an exhibition sound@@ ed a little after death , &quot; he said . &quot;
when you die when you get into the museum .
the impressive collection had previously made the Montreal Montreal in Montreal and went to Paris station .
&quot; it is so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; the director of Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ whose . &quot;
&quot; it is a tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society . &quot;
the exhibits offer an insight into which hardly ever written work of the man who wrote in fashion history without ever creating a training .
&quot; chron@@ ologically , the show is not built but it is an excellent chore@@ ographer , for which there was a lot of effort : to have the dolls , for example , a styl@@ ist is engaged . &quot;
14 ton materials have hon@@ oured the makers according to the contact of the ator Thierry @-@ Max@@ ime L@@ ori@@ ot .
shortly before the start of the Okto@@ ber@@ fest there was also a special treat : a leather clothing out@@ fit with cor@@ set .
Heidi meets Madonna .
&quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , said Gaul@@ tier . &quot;
Gaul@@ tier &apos;s old Teddy is seen in the exhibition .
&quot; he stands for the first , z@@ ag@@ ly mo@@ an obe@@ ying the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) , he put his Teddy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , says Gaul@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; with a d@@ oll to play , his parents would not have allowed him to play . &quot;
the ab@@ e@@ ject of fashion designers will have brought himself later on .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and saw the dra@@ fts of other designers such as Gaul@@ tier in Munich .
later I bought it too natural .
he has not able to pay the Models for his first own fashion show .
&quot; they got nothing , but they did not want to keep the br@@ isk . &quot;
jewel@@ s instead of sheer curtains - Pl@@ au@@ ener Point as fashion @-@ niche
&quot; earlier , it went to the long embro@@ ider@@ y machines in and around Pl@@ auen , to make meters . &quot;
the embro@@ i@@ dered fabrics and tips produced in large amount for clients that they used for example for blankets and she@@ ers .
&quot; today , this alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the Mo@@ eb@@ itze Pl@@ auen . &quot;
&quot; instead , fashion is again important . &quot;
&quot; in the initial times of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Point , fashion played a bigger role , was then interrupted by the rep@@ lica industry and is now being re@@ discovered as a niche . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : top in jewelry , with accessories such as bags and with regional Tra@@ chten . &quot;
&quot; vintage fashion , that are so @-@ called vintage fashion , which are bor@@ row@@ ed at past sty@@ li@@ stic , a increasing order potential . &quot;
who served in the textile industry in Germany don &apos;t have any n@@ ical on the market .
with us they already make half of all orders .
Mo@@ eb@@ itze Pl@@ auen is a member of the industry @-@ connected Pl@@ au@@ ener Point and Emb@@ ro@@ ider@@ ies together with nine other companies .
only they are allowed to carry on the protected label .
in the last 15 years some 80 percent of the turnover have been broken .
private specialized stores and also wholesale there is almost no longer .
our products reach the customer in this way hardly any further .
the mass @-@ ware are produced a lot cheaper in the Asian room and almost exclusively their chains .
&quot; furthermore , the export of export is to be exported to Russia and into the United States . &quot;
enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; industry association has also tried to score with environmental awareness , such as Cord@@ ula Bauer by the Stick@@ per@@ le in Fal@@ ken@@ stein : &quot; since this year we introduce a quality level , that shows that we produce ecological and socially toler@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot;
he was a writer leader at the west@@ s@@ ächs@@ ische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - specialized in the Fac@@ ulty of Applied Arts - and is specialized in embro@@ ider@@ ies and tips .
&quot; to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian area , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products . &quot;
it needs time and courage .
&quot; there is a voltage @-@ line between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and the factories , that must be thinking of all economically . &quot;
&quot; therefore , an existing design is often only slightly varying , in order to keep a customer base . &quot;
a couple of years ago the textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter will re@@ build the historical wh@@ ore top of a few years ago .
&quot; here , the machine sends the machine to some places small chic@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; the Pl@@ au@@ ener Gold@@ smith W@@ master@@ in Bianca Hall@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Kr@@ au@@ ge was inspired by this : &quot; &quot; before , I was able to start with traditional Pl@@ au@@ ener Point . &quot;
now they are using the snow @-@ tops for its jewelry .
in a elaborate process they character@@ izes the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people in the region identify with the theme of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Point - young and old , &quot; &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot;
&quot; it also provides you in the United States , to Australia and Finland - especially to customers who have lived in Pl@@ auen and the surroundings and would like to have a mem@@ ento . &quot;
I see my jewelry as the modern Ambassador of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Point .
Disney is planning new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; film
&quot; legends should not be stir@@ ring , but Disney is still speaking to a new film of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to Entertainment Weekly , it is not going to make a new movie , but to be a kind of continuation , which 20 years after the first film plays with the magical n@@ anny . &quot;
it is about the experience of the N@@ anny with the B@@ anks of the N@@ anks in the age of the world crisis in England .
who P@@ opp@@ ins play more than 50 years after Julie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
&quot; but the director stands firmly : Rob Marshall , last with &quot; In@@ to the Woods &quot; in the cinema . &quot;
XI presses it to open the economy more broad@@ ly for the world
&quot; the economy must open up wider outside to promote growth , President Xi Jin@@ ping on Tuesday of a group that was commissioned with the lo@@ wering of the reform . &quot;
&quot; in doing this , China should use to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and to improve the strategies for business leaders , &quot; he said in a consultation on the 16th meeting of the Central Committee for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; to foster re @-@ ups and reforms , new moment@@ um and vitality will bring about new moment@@ um and offering new space for economic growth , said Xi . &quot;
&quot; the leadership group has adopted a number of policies adopted , including a neg@@ ative list on the regulation of the market access , relaxation of the bor@@ derland ( SO@@ E ) , priv@@ ates capital , and over@@ hau@@ l of the residents of Mel@@ is@@ ystems . &quot;
&quot; after the statement , a negative list is created , the sectors and companies are identified that we do not enter into question . &quot;
the system is gradually tested and improved by test programmes .
&quot; the initiative is crucial as it indicates the market a greater role in the division of resources , including a legal business environment and open the market as an open market , said the statement . &quot;
the government will also take control of the trans@@ vers@@ ing powers of the company and ensure that companies are deci@@ ding how they perform their business .
the statement also said that China borders will permit new models of cross @-@ border economic operation and new mechanisms to promote the regional growth .
&quot; in the context of a Off@@ er , state @-@ controlled sectors open , further areas will be open for private investment . &quot;
&quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and becomes the legally interests of foreign @-@ funded companies and to bring better services to them , &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , it will be easier for foreigners to request a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; by optim@@ isation requirements and makes the application process easier . &quot;
&quot; the right of lawyers to guarantee their activities , and to use professional judges and pro@@ secut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting . &quot;
at the meeting also Prime Minister Li Ke@@ qi@@ ang and important guides like Liu Yun@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli was part of the declaration published in a statement .
EU wants to double a mer@@ cury @-@ border in car@@ ni@@ ez@@ ers
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mer@@ cury in large pre@@ dat@@ ors and consumers therefore make a significantly higher dose of nerve gifts .
&quot; consumer organization Food@@ watch in the EU foremost , critic@@ ized the plans &quot; &quot; risks and side effects of lack of industrial and environmental policy , &quot; &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of Food@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , according to the border values of nerve material for large fish at the end of the food chain such as Hai@@ - or s@@ word@@ fish from &quot; &quot; economic reasons &quot; &quot; can be raised from one to two milli@@ gram mer@@ cury cycles of kil@@ ograms . &quot;
&quot; but today big car@@ ni@@ vo@@ res are already so strong with mer@@ cury , however , that on the basis of the still valid limit values will not be sold approximately 50 per cent of the subjects . &quot;
&quot; after dou@@ bling of the limit values , only 14,@@ 5 percent would be un@@ change@@ ably . &quot;
&quot; in return for this e@@ asing the EU wants to ex@@ clude the limit values among other fish from currently 0,5 milli@@ gram to 0,1 milli@@ gram mer@@ cury per kil@@ ograms . &quot;
&quot; Food@@ Watch , this is called &quot; trick &quot; because smaller cem@@ ented fish , such as the carp are mostly so low @-@ bur@@ dened , that they have already kept the planned maximum @-@ levels today . &quot;
&quot; the ab@@ sen@@ ing at Kl@@ einf@@ o was therefore &quot; a per@@ fi@@ des exp@@ o that helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; said Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot;
Mercury is a po@@ ison@@ ous for humans to reach the food chain mainly in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish .
the Federal Government is therefore warning that &quot; already small quantities are cause particularly cause in un@@ born inj@@ uries of the nervous system .
the Federal Ministry of the Federal Ministry explained in its homepage with regard to their current levels but that a &quot; health threat of the general population &quot; is not expected to be expected .
Mercury is primarily driven by the coal @-@ burning form in the environment .
&quot; according to the German coal @-@ fi@@ red power plants , according to a written information of the federal ministry , Ann@@ alena Ba@@ er@@ bock more than six tons of Mercury in the year , two thir@@ ds of the total population of Germany . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of Mercury in fish about in the Elbe , Rhine and Danube is &quot; permanent and widespread &quot; , &quot; the &quot; mirror &quot; had in March out of the paper . &quot;
last year we counted Europe @-@ wide warnings of mer@@ cury in fish already among the most frequent reported hot risks in the EU War@@ n@@ system RA@@ S@@ FF .
