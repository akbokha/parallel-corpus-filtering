Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as Teh@@ er@@ ans dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; in the meeting , however , there is also a conflict with Palestinians and the two @-@ States solution . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises the ongoing settlement of Israel and thro@@ ws Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
&quot; in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu has held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans before the US Congress . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with reference to the forthcoming election in Israel . &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor , to have shot his girlfriend &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ annon Lam@@ b told him that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house . &quot;
&quot; Lam@@ b was it important to emphasize that his &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said , the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone . &quot;
&quot; within the house , the officials found the body of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss , and a hand @-@ written note that was attached to a white block : &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted to undo it , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; &quot; this was the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that Lam@@ b , who lived in two online courses for Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds where he shot a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office and killed him . &quot;
Delta State University Poli@@ sher Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university employees have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lam@@ b has made the fatal emergency call at some point .
&quot; until the end of the day , there was another death : Lam@@ m took the life when the police took him . &quot;
&quot; a day after shooting at the University , students and lect@@ urers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lam@@ b motiv@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; the investig@@ ators on both ends of the state have published details , as well as what students and staff who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teachers . &quot;
students said that they were fre@@ aking up on his lessons .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he did not have any history of violence or criminal history . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt himself had mentioned Lam@@ b in one of his written book , in which he shared the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his ak@@ ade@@ mic life . &quot;
&quot; both under@@ lined in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose teachers include 17 members , and many students visited courses of both . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , there were some tendencies to problem@@ ati@@ cal behaviour . &quot;
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , the Lam@@ b praised , said he seemed too little excited and nervous , as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes said that Lam@@ m told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
Lam@@ b had asked the Delta State University to provide evidence for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
&quot; in this year , he taught only two online courses . &quot;
&quot; the latest changes in the employment policy of the university meant that the doctor@@ ate , for the Lam@@ b had worked hard for him , would have no guarantee for an automatic path to an appointment as Assistant Professor . &quot;
&quot; President William La@@ For@@ ge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lam@@ b and Schmidt , but of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s idea . &quot;
these are questions that lam@@ bs can no longer be answered .
&quot; after the escape from the campus , the police found Lam@@ b &apos;s track when he went back to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as . &quot;
&quot; before he could be arrested , Lam@@ b himself killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents house at the outskirts of his parents house at the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car ran into the entrance .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why Lam@@ m went to this house , but Johnson said that he knew that he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
Lam@@ b grew up in the area .
&quot; in 2009 , Lam@@ b began his work at the University that has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants , and subordin@@ ated geography and ped@@ agog@@ y . &quot;
&quot; in the spring of ped@@ agog@@ y , he was in ped@@ agog@@ y . &quot;
&quot; one of the long @-@ lived friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny . &quot;
Car@@ la Hair@@ ston said she was 15 and Lam@@ m was 20 when she met with joint friends .
&quot; she and her friends were in the High School , and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her guitar playing . &quot;
he was at the time of the women &apos;s b .
&quot; all girls mel@@ ted when he was there , &quot; said Hair@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot;
Lam@@ b and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; in the emergency call , Lam@@ b &quot; &quot; I have killed my wife , &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate from a marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the back@@ stone house , which is attached to a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier . &quot;
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was 19 years old . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed in the ground , &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en on his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lam@@ b , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lam@@ b was interested in music and played blues . &quot;
&quot; Lam@@ b met Pr@@ enti@@ ss , when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail met both on a summer @-@ year market . &quot;
later they played together one or another gig .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , his daughter writes and sings her own music . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a Bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he finished Lam@@ b and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night in the night . &quot;
there were no signs that anything was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said . &quot;
we stayed at the rooms and slept together .
&quot; I mean , they both had a good sense of sh@@ aving . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester seminar program and specialized in American uro@@ logy and colonial history , said Don Allan Mitchell , a English professor at school . &quot;
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Emp@@ oria State University in Kansas and was president of his brother and the student committee .
&quot; at the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and took part in Cle@@ vel@@ and on Tuesday evening around 900 people , including lect@@ urers , staff , students and members of the church at a candle light commem@@ oration ceremony . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ mid@@ ts Mrs. Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the M@@ ahn@@ awake , while the Univers@@ itä@@ tsch@@ or &quot; B@@ right Morning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang . &quot;
the lessons will be recorded on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students back to return , &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
&quot; Amy and Rog@@ eli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; Emily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana contributed to this report . &quot;
&quot; this story has been corrected to resist the police now says that Lam@@ b had shot the emergency call after he was shot , and that Lam@@ b was shot in his emergency call Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife , but there is no indication that the two ever married . &quot;

&quot; the company said that it plan to stop 40,000 people in shops and distribution centres throughout the country . in the Christmas period 2014 there were still 45@@ .000 workers . &quot;

the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater waiting for the Roy@@ als , and I realize that the seat next to me is empty , and it becomes clear that Princess Diana will be sitting next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for a forthcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot;

UN boss says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; Secretary @-@ General Ban K@@ i @-@ Moon says his response to Russia &apos;s reinforced military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of almost five years of conflict , and more weapons will cause violence and misery for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN boss calls for all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations on finding a political solution . &quot;
&quot; Ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to discuss the Foreign Minister of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the edge of the meeting of the General Assembly to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
&quot; he regre@@ ts that the divisions in the Council , and within the Syrian people and the regional powers make this situation in@@ sol@@ vable . &quot;
&quot; Ban called for the five permanent members to tackle the same solidarity and unity , which they have proven in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran . &quot;
8 . demand values that show that Donald Tr@@ ump is taken seriously .
some have tried to brand him as flo@@ p .
others have done it as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some Rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks of surveys , it hasn &apos;t worked . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in two @-@ digit area , and some begin to wonder what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of the Real Estate Mog@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is still too early in the election period . &quot;
no claims that Tr@@ ump will probably win the Republican nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts emphas@@ ise that this time in 2011 Rick Per@@ r@@ ys &apos;s leadership was given to the rising Her@@ man C@@ ain , not only a state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he had to fight in a general election .
but outside groups like J@@ eb B@@ ush@@ s Super PA@@ C and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognize dr@@ umps and begin to flow their dollars to overthrow him .
here are some current demand values that indicate that the real estate Mog@@ ul is not just a temporary phase :
Tr@@ umps Any@@ more values have turned around 180 degrees .
&quot; shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump passed his candid@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey of Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans saw the real estate Mog@@ ul . &quot;
&quot; by mid @-@ July , it was 40 percent . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
now six of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures keep in early states .

&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in a survey of CNN / she last week , 67 percent of the rep@@ ublic@@ ans , they were either &quot; thri@@ lled &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; when Tr@@ ump would have been nominated . &quot;
only two of 10 say they would be &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if he would be the candidate .
&quot; only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent ) , they would be &quot; thri@@ lled &quot; vs. 40 percent , which say the same about Tr@@ ump . &quot;
do you want to report this message ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of the Republican voters say that they were &quot; un@@ happy &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate . &quot;
a majority of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans see Tr@@ umps temper@@ ament not as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critici@@ zed for his bomb@@ astic and ins@@ ulting statements , 52 percent of the Iranian voters believe that the real temper@@ ament is the right temper@@ ament for a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week , the same number is considered in the first country @-@ country state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the rep@@ ublic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a Colonel , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to effectively manage his office , and almost six of 10 Independent people say that his temper@@ ament doesn &apos;t fit into the White House , ABC / Post . &quot;
Republican voters are acc@@ ustom@@ ed to the idea .
&quot; when they set up their money , republi@@ can voters Tr@@ ump hold for real . &quot;
&quot; if they are asked , who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , say after a survey of CNN / her last week , four of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet . &quot;
this is a change since the time when four of the ten end of July their money came to J@@ eb Bush .

&quot; at this point in the last cycle , four of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans thought that Rick Perry would win the nom@@ ination only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; even if the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump hits almost every one . &quot;
&quot; some experts argue that the split field is likely to contribute to Tr@@ umps leadership , while the anti @-@ Tr@@ ump support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates . &quot;
&quot; but a survey of Mon@@ mouth University at the beginning of September shows that in a hypothetical head @-@ an @-@ head @-@ race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republican candidates , Tr@@ ump sums up the majority support . &quot;
&quot; in front of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points ahead , Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points , and finally front Paul , John Ka@@ himself and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .

&quot; a new survey of C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of voters who support Tr@@ ump , say they have awarded their voices . &quot;
&quot; of course , much has happened to change that , and nobody can really say never to change the mind . &quot;
&quot; 46 percent said that they leave the door open , to change to other candidates . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , Tr@@ umps strongest competition at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ sur@@ geon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have their opinion are twice as common for Tr@@ ump . &quot;
six of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they agree with Tr@@ ump in the subject of immigration .
&quot; since then , Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign against two months immig@@ rant from Mexico &quot; &quot; rape &quot; , &quot; was the immigration turning point and fishing point in the public discourse . &quot;
&quot; some are concerned that the bomb@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump is decisive Hez@@ p@@ ano @-@ Americans from the Republican Party , and the new @-@ oriented efforts are damaged . &quot;
&quot; but after the new ABC / Post survey of Monday , six of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they agree with Tr@@ ump in questions of immigration . &quot;
&quot; as long as the immigration in the ra@@ mp light remains , Donald Tr@@ ump will apparently do it . &quot;
the fru@@ stration of the government climb@@ s on new heights .
&quot; on Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , around half of the support of republi@@ can voters , especially by their out@@ si@@ ders status . &quot;
&quot; six of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ si@@ der than someone with government experience . &quot;
and they are also angry at Washington .
&quot; a survey by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Bloom@@ berg in I@@ owa , two weeks ago , that three of four I@@ owa rep@@ ublic@@ ans were fru@@ strated with 54 per cent &quot; un@@ happy &quot; and 21 percent . &quot;

&quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; stated the competent EU Commissioner Cec@@ ilia Mal@@ m@@ ström in the presentation . &quot;
the Swedish government decided to introduce the proposal as a European negotiation position in the free trade talks with the US .
the German government announced support .
&quot; by TTIP , the largest free trade zone in the world will be created with 800 million people . &quot;
the plans for reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings indicate that the EU states and the US have jointly select independent judges for a new investment court .
&quot; they should come to the same parts from the EU , the United States and from third countries . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , there is also a second instance . &quot;
it would allow it to rise against jud@@ g@@ ments .

&quot; in the discussion of the past months , citizens of the old IS@@ DS system in terms of fair@@ ness and justice are not familiar , commented Mal@@ m@@ ström . &quot;
&quot; in the long term , they want to work according to an international investment firm . &quot;

&quot; the traditional arbit@@ ration courts are critic@@ ised by opponents as a type of parall@@ el@@ essness , on the companies of damage to the tax pay@@ er , national laws , or a reduction of consumer and environmental standards . &quot;
&quot; in the first statements , anti @-@ TTIP organisations such as Camp@@ act adopted the proposals of the EU Commission as inadequate . &quot;

&quot; in the spring of other EU trade ministers , the Commission was taking into account significant points in the reform of the reform of the Federal Economic Affairs Sig@@ mar Gabriel in spring with other EU trade ministers . &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ration courts is from the table .

Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister
&quot; since its election Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut is expected to be expected , with tension expected by the Prime Minister &quot;
&quot; the new Labour leader Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n will give his debut at the Prime Minister , and set up for the first time with David Cameron . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to set up the first of his six exempl@@ ary questions shortly after lunch , with his performance from the media probably and the Labour MEPs from the vicinity . &quot;
he called &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could ski@@ p some meetings to leave her colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , because it comes after his appointment to the member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the decision of the Labour leader , on Tuesday during the Sin@@ gen of the National@@ hy@@ m@@ ne at a commem@@ orative ceremony on the 75@@ th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , has prov@@ oked criticism from a number of T@@ ory MPs and stands at the centre of several titles of titles in the newspapers . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the National hy@@ m@@ ne , has attracted attention to himself &quot;
&quot; a spokesman for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he would have been &quot; in respect@@ ful silence , &quot; and he recognized the &quot; Hel@@ dent@@ um of the Royal Air Force in the air battle around England . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n Schatten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , Owen Smith , told the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ ne , regardless of his belief that the mon@@ archy should be aboli@@ shed . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they called on differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a six @-@ th of the parliam@@ ent@@ arian party was originally supported as a guide . &quot;
&quot; the political correspondent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also for@@ kli@@ ft within Labour , &quot; and according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation in winners . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour changes need to remove the whole idea of a limitation .
&quot; Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ work and R@@ ent Minister , said that the party was very clear that it was only against government plans to reduce the limit of 26@@ ,000 £ to 23@@ ,000 £ . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader , David Cameron , since he has been T@@ ory boss in the last decade over the Dis@@ patch box in parliament . &quot;
&quot; the Labour leader , who promised another policy approach , says that &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions about Mr. Cameron has given him more than 30,000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; the Is@@ lington North MP said that the Prime Minister is opposed to the Prime Minister , and that he will be able to concentrate both &quot; &quot; impact &quot; &quot; and the strike with resistance , and instead of concent@@ rating on serious issues such as poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow economy minister will represent him if he does not participate , for example if Mr Cameron is on the road . &quot;
&quot; he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally take the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the Lower House , addressed to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he was leader in 2005 leader , Mr Cameron said that he is associating himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le theatre &quot; which is often linked to the fac@@ tions of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; since it was first broadcast on television first in 1990 , the question@@ naire was considered to be the most important barometer of a leader and his leadership in the sub @-@ house and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics argue that they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and require extensive reforms . &quot;

&quot; inspired by the saying &quot; potato instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; on a poster of the Peg@@ ida movement , Al@@ ha@@ y potato and flesh put together on a sp@@ ear . &quot;
&quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Peg@@ ida demonstration with the wor@@ ding &quot; &quot; potatoes instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; , &quot; which he had seen acci@@ dentally in television . &quot;

Met@@ cash starts ground@@ breaking campaign for comb@@ ating Al@@ di@@ - In@@ fall
Met@@ cash tries to protect the I@@ GA offices in front of an Al@@ di march in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ alers Met@@ cash has launched a ground@@ breaking campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; during Al@@ di , the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA Super@@ markets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via the social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de show . &quot;
&quot; I@@ GA dealers and suppliers are jumping on board , with brands such as ice maker S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples and shop owners who sell tickets for the South Australian football league to loyal customers . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Met@@ cash will be released for further details of its defense strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and devices will lead to its annual investors strategy day . &quot;
it is much on the game since South Australia and Western Australia are almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA store stores and generate higher profits than Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the Eastern states .

&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in this week , the analyst Tom K@@ ier@@ ath presented by Morgan Stanley , that I@@ GA retailers could lose 360 $ millions of revenue per year and met@@ cash 250 million to the end of 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di has opened 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA , and will generate sales of 500 million $ and 600 million in each market . &quot;
&quot; the loss in the food and food business and in the quantities on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed costs could cost € 13 million profit before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Met@@ cash loses market shares in the Eastern states , mainly to Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recently conducted survey of Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal . &quot;

Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise as criticism for his behaviour .
&quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; &quot; in the short@@ ened storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gi@@ os and deserves the opinion of the President of the Australian Tennis Federation Steve He@@ aly more praise than criticism for his own behavior . &quot;
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , is always referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s . &quot; by the not@@ orious confrontation of Kyr@@ gi@@ os with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka near Montreal Masters . &quot;
&quot; in a fier@@ y qualification game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the arbit@@ rator , with Har@@ rison called : &quot; &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have to strike Kyr@@ gi@@ os , and I should strike the child . &quot;
&quot; while he recently saw a tennis ra@@ cket after a cra@@ mp@@ f hit a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , in the competition with Sam Gr@@ oth to the second place in the single , behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ finals . &quot;
&quot; one thing about which I was pretty good , is the fact that after my opinion Th@@ an@@ asi was a little in the dispute , He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; he has broken a bat when he lost due to a var@@ ic@@ ure in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a bat from Fr@@ ust with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he has in the US Open extremely well , even under the pretty provoc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves much recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around around , he has a great family around around , and I think he was a little too strict . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 @-@ year old , he works very hard and he doesn &apos;t have a problem with the other players he is working hard , he is well in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I believe he deserves it to be judged according to his own services . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision , Kyr@@ gi@@ os in the important decision of the decision that begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right for everyone , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term part of the team . &quot;
&quot; first , we wish that the team is completely focused on competition and not on all the controversy around &#91; Kyr@@ gi@@ os &#93; , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; in the eyes of the public , and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s best for him . &quot;

&quot; Hungary declar@@ es the not@@ ary and ri@@ pped the south border with Serbia on Tuesday , and held all the parties trying to stop illegal in the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants . &quot;
&quot; chaos followed by the border , as hundreds of migrants re@@ acted in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acted with indig@@ nation . &quot;
&quot; the people who fled from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a land strip on the road between the two control points of the countries , and settled down there . &quot;
but fru@@ strations asc@@ ended .
&quot; as a police helicopter about them , the migrants &quot; open the border ! &quot; and sh@@ rie@@ ve ins@@ ults against the Hungarian government police . &quot;
some reported from protest food and water .
&quot; Ser@@ bi@@ ens Foreign Minister said it was &quot; unacceptable &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be returned , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot;
( Serbia ) will be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
&quot; in the coming days talks with Brussels and other countries , I@@ vi@@ ca D@@ ac@@ ic said in Prague . &quot;
the turbul@@ ences at the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came a day after the 28 @-@ nations bloc with a str@@ ating meeting in Brussels .
&quot; however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who were seeking refuge in over@@ grown Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that the EU states would be more than 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria demanded a special summit in the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; however , Hungary , however , did not put its hopes on a bal@@ lot action from Brussels , or from its neighbors . &quot;
&quot; the emergency stand in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to tackle the crisis , allowing them to block roads and accelerate asylum procedures . &quot;
&quot; the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans to build a barb@@ ed wire fence along his border to Romania , to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after having completed a fence at the Serbian border . &quot;
&quot; C@@ BS News correspondent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison bre@@ eds in the race , the barb@@ ed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia were used . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a major bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck in Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insisted that most of the coming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and non @-@ war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , among them Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws , which occurred at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high Za@@ us , who built the government along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also lay higher prison sentences for condemned human traffi@@ ckers . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation caused by mass migration , the Hungarian government declared its emergency state , &quot; said government spokesman Z@@ ol@@ tan Kov@@ acs Rep@@ orters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;

&quot; the former US foreign minister Hillary Clinton still holds a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her opposite to the ground . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; Vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is candidate for the presidential office , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic voters . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the beginning of the elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is fixed to which candidates will support them . &quot;
but Clin@@ tons &apos;s supporters are more than one of the other candidates .
&quot; since the C@@ BS News survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups , while S@@ anders achieved some gains . &quot;
&quot; Clinton holds a major advantage in women and gem@@ s , but these occur@@ ren@@ ces have reduced . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; Clin@@ tons benefit from democratic voters under 50 years , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level . &quot;
&quot; however , Clinton still has a major advantage in the older voters . &quot;
&quot; last month , Clinton was in front of S@@ anders with double @-@ digit growth in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has now a 5 @-@ point lead in this group . &quot;
&quot; for about half of the democratic voters of the presidential elections , they would like to support Clinton if they would be nominated by the party . &quot;
&quot; a quarter would support them with some precau@@ tions , and further 15 percent would only support them because they are the candidate . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
maybe not surprising that Clin@@ tons &apos;s current supporters are especially impressed by her .
the views are more mixed with those who currently don &apos;t support Clinton - just one quarter would support them .

&quot; since the vice president is a potential for the presidential office in the commodity bowl , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - although one third believes that he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic voters will be asked to vote for their second choice , Bi@@ den is at the top . &quot;
&quot; from Clin@@ tons , more than half , that Bi@@ den would be the second choice far from S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den decides not to can@@ di@@ ble for the nom@@ ination of the demo@@ crats , Hillary Clin@@ tons increases the lead ahead of S@@ anders , 20 points with Bi@@ den in the race on 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; twenty @-@ five percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election ; however , this number of 78 percent fell in the last month . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den is a second in this measurement , but the percentage , which sees him as the &quot; &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; , &quot; has risen . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , at the question of what is more important in a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about the voting . &quot;
&quot; similar to the last month , no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters voted to be unacceptable . &quot;
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates bring good results with some important characteristics of voters in the voting elections of their party .
&quot; Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den are considered to be honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den cuts the three candidates best from hon@@ esty , while Clin@@ tons &apos;s strength is the leadership . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in general , Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; in all these measurements , approximately one quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; since issues concerning Hillary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the term of Foreign Minister , the majority of the Democratic voters are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it does not affect their opinions . &quot;
but it is another story in the American public .

&quot; the public opinion of this was in March , shortly after the problem came to light . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy has no impact on Clinton &apos;s general opinion , although 36 percent said that their opinion of her has deteri@@ or@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; it is mainly Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say that their views of Clinton are worse . &quot;

&quot; Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , receive good notes on leadership . &quot;

&quot; Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined about head@@ aches , then he fell un@@ conscious . &quot;

&quot; however , they had time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothes , to contact his symptoms to goo@@ gling and Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood to get advice , said Poli@@ tk@@ ef Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point , the members of the U@@ ten@@ sils began to hide and set the welfare of the Brotherhood basically about that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ tk@@ ef Wagner . &quot;

this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest
&quot; an interest of interest is coming , and the house will get back to the w@@ reck , returns to bonds , and the economy will gli@@ de in a recession . &quot;
we know .
what we do not know how long it will last and how long it will be .
&quot; for this purpose we would like to hear your opinion , wishes and suggestions . we kindly ask you to take about ten minutes to take part in this Online Survey . online Survey Information for survey participants &quot;
&quot; a recession came within just 11 months after the first interest rate , and lasted 86 months . &quot;
&quot; the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when lifting the interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments react . &quot;
&quot; therefore , representatives of the US Central Bank are so heavily stressed that investors should not concentrate on it when they begin to increase interest rates , but rather on the period that is needed for norm@@ alization . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot;
&quot; at the end , market participants could find that the whole excitement was potentially exagger@@ ated due to a interest increase . &quot;
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted as a signal for the end of the &quot; cheap money &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot;
&quot; contrary to this , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at low level to lead to sei@@ sm@@ al shock that many people seem to fear . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that there is no effect . &quot;
here is a focus on historical trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
&quot; as the market has seen in the last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest rates can be vol@@ atile for a while . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the increase occurs , the influence is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there is apparently a tendency that assets will be deduc@@ ted 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study about what happens to interest rates of the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to occur later in the recovery cycle , and the return of return begins to decrease . &quot;
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life but interest increases them often .
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that could not accelerate and accelerate recession . &quot;
&quot; it is extremely remarkable , that the gross domestic product is near its lowest point in an interest rate of the F@@ ed . &quot;

&quot; in our study , all Earth cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a Super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ing sh@@ ears very quickly after the start of recovery in the shadow , &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what is the worst recession in the observed phase . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is far from the longest , which has been waiting for the F@@ ed since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months . &quot;

the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than in shares when they change their strategic course .
bonds seem to change the direction as soon as the first increase / decrease in the cycle is done .
&quot; at the end of the recovery cycle , the bond raised immediately , the Deutsche Bank said . &quot;

&quot; high @-@ interest bonds often bring better yields in such a climate , although &quot; &quot; we are still cau@@ tious to expect higher yields , &quot; &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , fixed @-@ income analyst at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest has risen , the income curve is fla@@ w@@ less , lending has increased and the vol@@ atility is increased - all the characteristics of the market , when the F@@ ed has intensi@@ fied their strategy . &quot;
&quot; in the big and whole , companies that are taking advantage of the major part of their business in the US will benefit if interest rates rise and local products are becoming more attractive . &quot;
&quot; multinational companies with high debt are worse , as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive and the financing of their debt . &quot;
&quot; the story shows that &quot; quality &quot; shares tend to be extremely positive , &quot; said Goldman Sach@@ s analysts in a report for the customers . &quot;

&quot; outside of the pure stock , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar . &quot;

&quot; so , if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneous examples of which you actually only want to im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham . &quot;
BBC General Director confirmed the allegations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of his commercial competitors when it comes to live music and education .
&quot; what I learn from Radio 3 , I will not learn about classical music anywhere else . &quot;

&quot; at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey , that harder to work to engage the audience as it did in the past , because the British are less informed about classical music . &quot;

&quot; the funeral proc@@ ession went over to the Holy place , where only days before a building crane by the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then fell on the bed . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for the funeral , when the Saudi King passed over the construction company of the bin Laden because of the catastrophe that left 3@@ 94 the last , a san@@ ction . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 people who were killed when a crane was stor@@ med by the Great Central mo@@ sch@@ ee Mec@@ ca , were borne by the streets . &quot;
&quot; among the dead were Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage to the Kra@@ n . &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram was born with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
&quot; Saudi officials have already said that the H@@ add@@ sch to Mec@@ ca with thousands , who continue to come to the city , will continue . &quot;
&quot; today King Solomon said , the bin Laden group would not steal the arm of the crane as he was not used . &quot;
&quot; a Arab version of the decree , which was published by the State Saudi Press Agency , said that the bin Laden group was responsible for the collapse . &quot;
&quot; the English @-@ speaking service of the news agency reported this detail , but said that the company &apos;s leadership was banned abroad . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man came to reveal what the fall of the crane caused the fall of the crane , where hundreds of thousands of thousands of Muslims were held in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , which later took place in this month . &quot;
&quot; the bin Laden group has no statements about the collapse of the Kran@@ s , and their representatives were not available for a comment . &quot;
the Royal Dec@@ ret t@@ ad@@ ored the group because of non @-@ current security measures and because they did not cooperate with met@@ eor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mek@@ kas Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive construction project which is led by the bin Laden group .
&quot; the bin Laden family has been connected to Saudi Arabia for decades , and takes over larger construction projects . &quot;
&quot; the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a rebel@@ li@@ ous son who was de@@ ported from the family in 1990 . &quot;
&quot; the crash of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain , just a few days before arrival of millions in the kingdom for pilgrimage , which is at least once in life of each healthy Muslim . &quot;
officials said that 158 people remain in the hospital .

time of decision on interest rates for the US staff
&quot; the world is observed when the US staff at two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , come together to make the important decision whether for the first time for almost a decade or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey among 80 econom@@ ists who were questioned by Reuters found that a little more than half , the last week of view was that the F@@ ed will do this , now think that the F@@ ed will still remain a little longer and the interest rates on the current stand of 0 - 0.25 percent will be kept . &quot;
it is a historical event because it has seven years since the F@@ ed interest has been on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero @-@ area and start a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , CEO at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the US economy is on a relatively good performance level , tri@@ llion dollars are added to balance sheet and generate only a low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less raw view of global relations . &quot;
&quot; it has warned the markets to set up an increase , but the signs point out that the chances of such a step is good . &quot;

death cap at the Delta State University left ap@@ ologies
&quot; after shooting and killing of his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning , and before he later killed his colleague , Sh@@ annon Lam@@ b wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; in the first murder and wanted , &quot; he could not make it to it , &quot; said authorities on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi said that Lam@@ b , lect@@ urer for geography and social science education at Delta State University , called the emergency number against 10 : 00 on Monday morning . &quot;
&quot; and he said , he was shot , and he was killed . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Lam@@ b told the staff of the emergency call centre that police officers must send polic@@ emen to his home . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I asked my wife yesterday evening , and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; in the house , but no one will be upset , but probably excited . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the anchor to his name , but he didn &apos;t have him . &quot;
Lam@@ b gave no explanation for his shots .
&quot; when the police took the scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note of Lam@@ b , 45 , who said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted to undo it . &quot;
&quot; I loved Amy , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
&quot; after writing the note , Lam@@ b 300 miles to Delta State University , where he took E@@ than Schmidt , a professor for history , killed before he finally took his own life on Monday evening . &quot;
&quot; President William La@@ For@@ ge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lam@@ b and Schmidt , but of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s idea . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday , the Lam@@ b allegedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had also had a relationship with Schmidt , said authorities on Tuesday , there is no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was appointed by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said that she was married for seven years as a &quot; good person . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were divor@@ ced from 15 years ago , but remained friends . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss would have been a daughter that is 19 , and it was destroyed in the ground . &quot;
&quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss was her daughter &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss . &quot;
&quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who had a dog named Light@@ ning , met with Lam@@ b for about three years . &quot;
&quot; she wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; said Know@@ les &quot;
&quot; the police said , Lam@@ b gave relatives at a certain time on Monday to say &quot; &quot; he didn &apos;t go to prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United can &apos;t play monthly due to double frac@@ ture

&quot; while this is the left external distributor , Louis van Ga@@ al will not be able to play for at least six months . &quot;
&quot; the injury was caused by a declining attack of Hé@@ ctor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute , after the 20 @-@ year old Sha@@ w was embedded in the PS@@ V area . &quot;
he was treated nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before he was brought to hospital .

he will be moved tomorrow or maybe one day later and then in Manchester .

&quot; if a player goes with this type of injury to the place , all are very sad about it . &quot;
it is never the intention of our players to viol@@ ate an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ as Holland team at the World Cup 2014 .
&quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to viol@@ ate the opponent , and if you hear it is a very bad violation , it &apos;s not good , &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball , which was in a different direction , so that it looked as if he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke . &quot;

I feel very bad . I &apos;m sorry .

certainly knows David Cameron The Lor@@ ax better ?
&quot; it is a thing that all parents learn soon : if your child loves a book , it will not take long until you know it almost out . &quot;
&quot; it may be , you may be David Cameron . &quot;
&quot; when he was asked by a provider of child care systems , his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book decided to name his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , which was released in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of the company Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it is a book that I like to read my children , because it seems always a picture or a message we have missed . &quot;
&quot; all beautiful and good , except that the subsequent paragraph , in which Cameron allegedly describes the action of the book , writes a contents of the film version of 2012 , added to the new characters and details to expand the pretty short origin@@ al@@ text . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the surrounding city of Th@@ need @-@ Vil@@ le , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , met her desire to see a real tree . &quot;
&quot; as if this is not yet susp@@ icious enough : the text reads like the summary of the Lor@@ ax film , which will be presented on the website of the Lor@@ ax film , which is artificial and even the air is a commodity , hopes a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he wants to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron &apos;s action of the book is so little familiar . &quot;
&quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who has read The Lor@@ ax not 20 times a child . &quot;
a Down@@ ing Street spokes@@ woman said that the text probably came from Camer@@ ons &apos;s electoral office .
&quot; Super@@ camp confirmed that the text of Camer@@ ons was delivered to staff , but there were no other direct comments . &quot;
&quot; Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult . &quot;
&quot; on Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if one sees the Ka@@ der who has chosen England for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my map . &quot;
I would not exclu@@ de a down@@ ward victory .
&quot; A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks site is possibly less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in the Batt@@ ing list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars of 2012 , only a you@@ thful positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali as Spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size on test level , is an option for the attack . &quot;
this message : Adam Ly@@ th fails from the England @-@ Test @-@ Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
&quot; the decision to release Adam Ly@@ th is of course for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , difficult to analyze . &quot;
&quot; with his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that Kri@@ cket@@ Money is focused on results . &quot;
&quot; there was no question mark in Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said - players are their own best selection . &quot;
&quot; before a long time , the run of Ly@@ th would have been extended , but he had control over his own fate . &quot;
&quot; if he will hopefully release other purchases for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance is coming . &quot;
&quot; the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ li@@ ss praised his attitude , even if he did not have so good performances , and that surprised me not ; he is above all a team man . &quot;
the question of how much time a test drummer receives to set his character is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and down@@ ward .
&quot; the only accus@@ ation that you can raise , was that England first started Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance lies in the past . &quot;
&quot; Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a drummer , whom I have high . &quot;
&quot; he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket@@ player , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he achieved 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge . &quot;
&quot; it must be at least the same chances as those before him , but this depends on the team &apos;s position in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea to make Mo@@ een next to Cook , which would bring an extra spin @-@ bow@@ ler and get four Qui@@ cks , changed , and I don &apos;t have anything . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ handed has already shown that he is a devil @-@ player of cri@@ cket players . &quot;
&quot; Mo@@ een has not done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference . &quot;
my previous team mate Justin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests in the first drop before he joined the op@@ ener in 2001 .
&quot; he has managed three hundred ra@@ ms immediately , and looked not back . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes in the Ka@@ der as Back @-@ up @-@ Sp@@ inner , and in my limited handling with him he has impressed me as a young man . &quot;
&quot; people may see its statistics - average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it is a pun@@ t , but there is no big number of backup spi@@ ders who rise up their hands and the train@@ ers have chosen for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the team , England has made a few smart additions to the train@@ ee . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dene , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as advis@@ er for the test games could be a masterpiece . &quot;
&quot; he is one of the n@@ ett@@ est guy of the game , who will bring an abundance of experiences , since he has played under all conditions and against all attacks . &quot;
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes to the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and powerful deployment into the setup .
&quot; I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as players or as coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has views of which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind , even if the messages are in line with the previous ones . &quot;
&quot; post a message , in answer to the article &quot;
&quot; some will not agree , but Co@@ aches and Team members do not determine the schedule . &quot;
and you have to think that the players depend on their jobs from the results .
such decisions are not taken lightly in heart .

&quot; a European diplom@@ ats lawyer said that some member states , so deeply dist@@ orted in various crises , such as the EU it is time and not always out of own guilt , Britain itself created agenda with split conc@@ essions and disturbing changes that they usually don &apos;t want . &quot;
&quot; in Bri@@ ghton , TU@@ C decided that it would not like to je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze social protection . &quot;
we could also call Dave and Georges Sel@@ fie agenda .
&quot; Prime Minister and Finance ministers climb to summit meeting or bilateral meetings in foreign capit@@ als , a photo of himself from a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they are allies for reforms . &quot;
it &apos;s always about me .
&quot; my European friend , who wishes to be in the inside of the EU tent - &quot; L@@ ass us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and let us see that more and more short @-@ sigh@@ ted ministers and officials have come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter if we stay or go . &quot;
&quot; Germany cau@@ tioned cau@@ tious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an allies , but she has been in power and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as it looks bad for her , as it has been bad for her , like Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
France doesn &apos;t recognize legitimacy of the Russian elections in Crimea
he is also an inter@@ acting force .
&quot; Poland may soon have a nationalist right government , Spain a left . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to imagine that they are going to be out of a leg to help the Sel@@ fie @-@ British should be used to prevent the sel@@ fie of the UK - something that they do not want , because most of the similar separate tendencies have to be used . &quot;
&quot; therefore , some such ministers may even consider not helpful comments on the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s speech campaign 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my friend suspects . &quot;
&quot; the new trial was a P@@ lei@@ gh , and &quot; Great Britain won &apos;t win anything from the new trial . &quot;
&quot; the Europeans know how common the Fle@@ et Street can be on their cost , and which EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the Pres@@ seb@@ ar@@ one , as they did not have been inspired by Tony Ben@@ n , who supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 . &quot;
&quot; they can be weak to Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ opportun@@ ists who have made a name as a &quot; &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade @-@ Ban@@ ana &quot; &quot; correspondent in the early 90 @-@ century years . &quot;
&quot; in all his betra@@ yal , Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were . &quot;
&quot; this includes the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing sho@@ cks , telephone @-@ chi@@ ckens , and the pseu@@ do non @-@ domestic ones who have most of our great newspapers . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Tony Blair thought about her , but found that when you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you can get better ban@@ anas to di@@ stract him instead of having lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ iri@@ ans than Blair himself when he re@@ acted to Cameron &apos;s refer@@ end@@ set@@ ter because Blair had rejected the principle on the un@@ approved constitution of the EU , which was then opened by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which was then opened by French and Dutch voters in 2005 . &quot;
the press has never dec@@ eived him .
&quot; but the nice Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly cl@@ aps on Monday in West@@ minster - I told him that he no longer need time for me - seems to be in danger , Neil Kin@@ no@@ cks Bo@@ yk@@ ott Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 80 @-@ he &apos;s strategy , a mistake then and today . &quot;
&quot; it can take , but he must develop a coherent strategy to gain the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position on Europe is - I do it kind of - in the development .
he says that we should remain in a reform@@ ist EU .
&quot; now , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps traditional Bl@@ auf@@ arb@@ anes tendency and the wild plu@@ mage of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engli@@ sh@@ ism can probably say yes . &quot;
&quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; &quot; Ben@@ n im Radio and television this week , when the boy sc@@ outs in him did not admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell was a bad idea . &quot;
&quot; it reminded me of the 70 @-@ year @-@ old when his old father had tried to be il@@ loyal to his Labour cabinet , without losing too far and to lose his cabinet job . &quot;
Hil@@ ary &apos;s struggle was even more attractive .
&quot; but to fight for &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , even what J@@ C told his fellow members and MPs after all the reports on the Monday evening . &quot;
&quot; in the age of TV around the clock - News @-@ discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock , and above all things in the Stru@@ del of Social Media , a bro@@ ker of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal . &quot;
&quot; it is right to give Cameron a free card for Europe , allowing him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the speech campaign campaign for a matter of matter , as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly thinks so .
&quot; but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ity to EU membership - in accordance with their Benn@@ ite siege economy , its anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left dis@@ sident , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes . &quot;
&quot; as with its ambig@@ u@@ ity to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C is no campaign for the exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try , in all a sense of their superi@@ ors at home . &quot;
&quot; why should Paris or Berlin should waste political capital , - they also have susp@@ icious voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British if this can be meaning@@ less ? &quot;
&quot; the United States are already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , which I called at the start on Monday of something that British Influ@@ ence Security Forum called . &quot;
experts critici@@ ze Public Health England about e @-@ cigarettes
&quot; claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigarettes are less harmful than smoking originated from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot;
experts who write in British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined the Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing Public Health England ( PH@@ E ) in their report on e @-@ cigarettes used by e @-@ cigarettes .
PH@@ E published the &quot; basic set report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers have questioned the power handling of the data and referred to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
&quot; an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month , the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily w@@ indi@@ ge foundation , &quot; based on PH@@ E founded his most important conclusion . &quot;
two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether the claims are based on stone or sand .
&quot; Martin McK@@ ee , Professor of European Public Relations at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epi@@ de@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the evidence of efficacy . &quot;
&quot; they said that the public expects that &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; on a detailed review of the references and modelling . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who have been called to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria Decision Analysis - M@@ CD@@ A ) to create their opinions on the damage of different ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summari@@ zed in a research report . &quot;

&quot; he also wrote the references of BA@@ T to public health in a sustainability report , they said . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants attended the meeting to obtain funds from an e @-@ cigarette manufacturer , but not the financing which he received after reports from the tobacco company Philip Morris International . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for selecting the members of the Gre@@ mi@@ ums are not delivered , but this includes several well @-@ known E @-@ cigarettes champions , of which some also have a sector financing in the paper . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
&quot; at the meeting , the tobacco line took part in PH@@ E . &quot;
firm of the Year for Trade@@ marks and Un@@ fair Competition Har@@ m@@ sen U@@ tes@@ cher Firm of the Year for M &amp; A No@@ err Firm of the Year for Media Rau@@ e
&quot; however , no such connections or restrictions are discussed in the PH@@ E report . &quot;
McK@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; there is no evidence that &quot; there has been no evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are used as a way to smoking children or non @-@ smokers . &quot;
&quot; Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , director for health and well @-@ being at PH@@ E , said that BM@@ J has already responded to the claims by BM@@ J . &quot;
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies in his addiction .
&quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigarettes are low compared to this , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; PH@@ E has a clear obligation to the public about what is proof and what is not , especially if there is much public confusion about the relative dangers in comparison to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; almost 80@@ .000 people die annually in a disease with regard to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion Euros per year . &quot;
&quot; due to the clear preference of current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fra@@ ction of damage caused by smoking , we fulfil our national jurisdiction . &quot;
&quot; BBC should give up East@@ En@@ ders , former boss of Channel 4 &quot;
&quot; the former president of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop playing programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial rival &quot; would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not sent by other UK transm@@ issions .
&quot; he critic@@ ised the BBC for it to be publicly available to public @-@ legal programs , probably seen from a smaller audience , in tough controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their rivals and Sen@@ ders as BB@@ C4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC director , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he has tried six years in his time at Channel 4 without success , with the BBC in contact . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sent , which are also shown clearly by non @-@ subsidi@@ zed rivals , &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus communication committee on the future of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the broadcasting fee , which I don &apos;t want medium or long term for a good idea , you should not give up its production at least on programs that do not make others or order . &quot;
they send The Voice to a first @-@ class time window because they want to achieve a wide range of support for their future .
&quot; the idea that otherwise nobody would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridicul@@ ous , it &apos;s naturally non@@ sense . &quot;
Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is financed which could also be financed without subsidies .
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , assigned to both self @-@ productions . &quot;
&quot; honestly , other channels would give their right arm for this . &quot;
I &apos;m tired of seeing how this public television is supposed to be public television .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC ever .
&quot; Johnson , a business@@ man for series , Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC blame on the hunt for ratings &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on the BBC shows that the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , suggested in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart presentation in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows how East@@ En@@ ders should sell . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the rather publicly @-@ legal N@@ ic programs should go to BB@@ C4 , but they do not meet their tasks , and they can argue when they have created their apparent missions for justification of 4 billion £ radio fees , &quot; &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these ob@@ struc@@ tions programs that nobody has seen . &quot;
they put them into a time window where nobody wanted to see them ever .
&quot; on the radio charge , Johnson said : &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value here . &quot;
&quot; of course , you think all that you receive a great value for 150 £ per year here , but for people who are for the 150 £ a lot of money , ask me if this is true because they do not consume much from the BBC . &quot;
&quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 @-@ boss David El@@ stein , who also said before the committee on Tuesday , urged the BBC to check their Rei@@ th@@ ian mission to form and maintain . &quot;
&quot; he said , only little by the BBC production would now be classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of its TV production and 0.1 % in the radio - and it should change in the public @-@ legal television channels in Australia and Canada . &quot;
&quot; on the question of partnerships , El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas such as the pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television shows that only a handful of television will be shown to make everything online . &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells through sound waves
&quot; the video shows how the Nem@@ ato@@ den change the direction in the moment , in which they are broadcast with sound impul@@ ses . &quot;
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by dis@@ armament of sound waves .
&quot; the tiny Nem@@ ato@@ id changes the direction in the moment , in which they have sound impul@@ ses , which have to be heard for the human hearing at high frequencies to be heard . &quot;
impul@@ ses work through the switching of mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultrasound waves .
HZ@@ I researchers discover control centres in Y@@ ers@@ inia bacteria that initiate infection processes only at body temperature
&quot; the researchers said that worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics , where ultrasound can be used to activate a range of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; S@@ re@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of a day could replace the depths of brain stimulation , an invasive procedure , the electrical impul@@ ses in the brain of people to treat symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; F@@ aden@@ worms generally react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani proved that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ opic air bub@@ bles . &quot;
&quot; the bub@@ bles , found out , rein@@ force the ultrasound waves , which then penet@@ rate into the worms . &quot;
the enhanced ultrasound waves work on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and are found in the di@@ aph@@ rag@@ ms of some of the worms cells .
&quot; the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and enable the cells to which they are assigned , such a report Nature Communications . &quot;
&quot; in order to create ultr@@ asonic controlled Nem@@ ato@@ id , the Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ones TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels carry . &quot;
&quot; when it uses ultr@@ asonic to changed creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ waves and transmit into the worms where they turn the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a pioneering tool that allows scientists to switch neur@@ ons with impul@@ ses of light on and off . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light , which has to be sent to an optical fiber to the desired place in the brain , low frequency ultrasound waves can happen un@@ avo@@ idable and can be sent into the brain from top to the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily sus@@ cep@@ tible human neur@@ ons temporarily to make the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells .

eight golden rules for life in student homes
&quot; before eleven years ago I moved to a student home , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral Rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ sed smile of those who I have upset - and to the numerous , lengthy complaints about others . &quot;
most of which I have learned can be distill@@ ed in eight simple rules .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; student residence &quot; &quot; in student residence ranges from easily ner@@ ven@@ ding up to absolutely fri@@ ghtening . &quot;
&quot; it is temp@@ ting to sh@@ ish : people tell you where you come , whether and where you are in terms of Cor@@ by@@ n and why you are &quot; honestly told Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in Ernst , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract HA@@ HA@@ HA , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same . ask questions and show interest .
&quot; the conversation and helps you to find out people who like to find out in contrast to those who would not speak , even if your eyel@@ ashes would be in fire and these fire extingu@@ is@@ ers would be . &quot;
let people .
&quot; the rooms of people are often transformed into drinks recipes , film @-@ night venues and municipal meetings , but they are also the places where people attract and deal with their under@@ wear . &quot;
this is based on : don &apos;t remember to start with a relationship with a relationship
intro@@ ver@@ ted received a rough treatment at the university .
&quot; your room should be a Refu@@ gi@@ um , but many student resi@@ dences form a space @-@ to @-@ room bo@@ mel culture that can lead to life @-@ long friendship . &quot;
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
&quot; nothing in the culture allows you to say , &quot; &quot; I like you , and I want to continue our friendship , but you must go away so that I have consumed the energy I have used for the interaction with you . &quot;
&quot; try to feel when a coma is exhausted , and send him a SMS instead . &quot;
apro@@ pos ank@@ lo@@ ps : do it .
a guy in my student residence had the idea that a non closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close by baking .
&quot; as you start the university at the cli@@ max of the Back @-@ Man@@ ia , the clo@@ ck@@ ling at the doors of people to present themselves with a plate full of brow@@ nies , less strange than the welcome of the 1950 @-@ he years &quot; Welcome in the neighborhood , I have something to do with you . so , and now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions . &quot;
home @-@ made treats offer is a good way to close friends .
their ro@@ omm@@ ates feel obliged to enter@@ tain themselves and will associate your face with a delicious surprise .
&quot; of course , this depends on whether you are a permanent b@@ aker . &quot;
&quot; bad mixed cl@@ umps of flour , sugar and fat make people feel asleep when you fly . &quot;
&quot; to steal food , it is a common crime in student homes . &quot;
&quot; of course , the cla@@ ws of chicken is a theft , but is it the taking of a drop of milk for your tea too ? &quot;
check that with the milk owner .
&quot; the chances are good that they say to themselves , even if they cook inside . &quot;
&quot; if someone ste@@ als your stuff is the annoying thing , and you have my compassion - but try to be balanced as my ro@@ omm@@ ate , who added to her milk a washing agent to pun@@ ish thi@@ eves . &quot;
she is now in prison .
&quot; they should not make noise , the people of sleep , or of the work . &quot;
&quot; it is not just about being a decent person , but that you are in the true sense of the pro@@ verb to the people who sit in the glass house . &quot;
&quot; a girl on my fl@@ ur asked her neighbours if there is something that makes them something , drum &amp; bass , because there are three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning . &quot;
she re@@ acted with even lu@@ cra@@ tive music .
&quot; when she finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she left her neighbours to sleep two hours before she left her own music , closed her door , and came to her three @-@ hour examination . &quot;
would it not be romantic if your future sp@@ ouse would go into the same student residence in the same student residence ?
&quot; on the other hand , it wouldn &apos;t be very embarrass@@ ing if you hold a ro@@ omm@@ ate for your future sp@@ li@@ part@@ ing to come back again and see them every day , and maybe they can see how they all come up with all common friends ? &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart goes its own way - but if a hot ro@@ omm@@ ate is definitely not your future marriage partner , try at least to talk to your under@@ tak@@ er a little reason . &quot;
&quot; in the exciting moment , in which you notice that someone has its key in his non @-@ determination room , the border between a Ul@@ k and Mob@@ bing is fine when it seems . &quot;
&quot; a good song is funny , but it takes only moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
do you share a valuable and am@@ using lesson about security - but don &apos;t miss j@@ eman@@ ating the room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
&quot; close your door , and put your key into a glass of water which you then put into the freezer - but do not change their pos@@ sessions on the ceiling . &quot;

&quot; if it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install Inst@@ alling . &quot;
&quot; some have caused problems after installing problems , because they get an error message that is noti@@ fied that the &quot; &quot; software update failed &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to handle the problem , users are advised to wait until the ons@@ lau@@ ght returns or try to update via iTunes . &quot;
the phone itself leads you through the rest of the process .
&quot; this may possibly mean the del@@ eting of apps to create space - but Apple has more likely to do so , when you use a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install it as soon as the process is finished . &quot;
&quot; it is worthwhile to ensure that your mobile phone is loaded during the update , or is located near a charge device , so that the battery is loaded . &quot;
&quot; if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to be continued as the phone may switch on half way and could lead to a break of the updates . &quot;

Croatia : &quot; we leave refugees through &quot;
&quot; now the border controls are going up at our south border , &quot; said Interior Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
the controls at the Hungarian border remain in parallel to this .
&quot; as before , it is clear that everyone who wants to make an asylum application can also be &quot; &quot; naturally &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the supply and security of people stand in the for@@ eg@@ round .
&quot; but also , &quot; &quot; it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; people must know that we do not accept unlimited migration streams , also not about the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot;
it needs a controlled approach .
&quot; Croatia is considering &quot; &quot; cor@@ ridor &quot; &quot; - Slovenia &quot;
&quot; the Croatian government had previously communic@@ ated , also Slovenia wants to travel refugees towards Austria and Germany , and also have cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees . &quot;
firm of the Year for Trade@@ marks and Un@@ fair Competition Har@@ m@@ sen U@@ tes@@ cher Firm of the Year for M &amp; A No@@ err Firm of the Year for Media
&quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely unacceptable , &quot; Slovenia will rather become the monitoring of the border - especially to Hungary . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled . &quot;
&quot; as the Minister stressed , Slovenia wants to keep its borders for refugees , but not to be abri@@ dged . &quot;
&quot; every EU member must fill its obligations , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; like the Croatian government , the first refugees had been trying to pass over the night hours to Tuesday in East Croatia at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d to avoid registration . &quot;
the Croatian police could attack them in the near corn fields .
&quot; according to local media , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik has constantly met police vehicles with new refugees . &quot;
&quot; it is mainly around Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children . &quot;
even rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
&quot; in the coming days , his country with around 4000 refugees , said Interior Minister Rank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; in addition , buses made from Pres@@ evo on the Maced@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border to Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media reported on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; however , the government in Belgrade , however , that it is to propose certain routes : &quot; neither can we , nor do we do this , &quot; said it . &quot;
&quot; according to the media reports , there was a first bus with around 50 refugees in the Serbian border town of Si@@ d , in the course of the day other buses were expected . &quot;
&quot; Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
the occup@@ ants were the whole night from around 500 kilometres away from the Maced@@ onian border through Serbia .
&quot; we have heard that Hungary has been approved , so the police said that we should go here , &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in this way , it could actually lead to the postpon@@ ed postpon@@ ement of the former Balkan route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary to a somewhat further west route . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic stressed that his country has prepared appropriate plans for the event of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .

you will be able to qualify for strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; Slovenia belongs to this since 2007 , the EU partner places a good testimony from what the standard of border controls is concerned . &quot;
&quot; on a Serbian side behind the Hungarian border fence , about 300 refugees will continue . &quot;
&quot; according to Belgrade &apos;s media reports , they had spent the past night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , who leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border crossing Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed . &quot;
&quot; if the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border , it is still unclear . &quot;
the Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic tried to calm down the debate over alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed .
it would not be a very high number of refugees .
&quot; one could not say whether they would continue their trip over Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot;
help on the options is available . congratulations
&quot; however , private Hungarian refugee workers have already begun to distribute maps on which alternative routes are drawn through Croatia . &quot;
&quot; the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not harm@@ less : in parts of the border area , there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatian border . &quot;
&quot; in the afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of min@@ ef@@ ields were sent in the border region . &quot;

&quot; on their most expected meeting in the years , Federal Reserve Strat@@ for two days a 27 @-@ foot Honduras Mah@@ agon@@ i table to decide whether it is time to lift the Leit@@ z@@ ins for almost a decade . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the galvan@@ ised , two @-@ storey seat hall , a wall of the United States is located . &quot;
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed Chair Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues want to set up the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a double order from Congress : maxim@@ izing the US employment and prices here .
&quot; but since the big recession , the F@@ ed leaders acknowledged that there is an un@@ defined third mandate : financial stability . &quot;
&quot; and this third mandate might be the X factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict them . it will be announced on Thursday , whether the US economy is ready to be reconc@@ iled by the unprecedented incentive by the close to zero @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 . &quot;
&quot; although most data of the economy show that they are solid , the recent turbul@@ ences on the global financial markets could be anxious to rein@@ force this vol@@ atility by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and it is also only a quarter percentage point . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase interest rate , the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to continue , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; there is no consensus about what the F@@ ed will do , what is in@@ secure in itself the financial market itself . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; however , the financial markets are expected to wait for F@@ ed , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance to increase . &quot;
&quot; this indicates a decrease in stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the pro@@ position , unless the strateg@@ ists make the strike off by making sure that another increase is far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Dow Jones jumped at 2@@ 28.@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16.@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 . &quot;

&quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that time , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if they do it , they have to go very far to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t get into panic . &quot;
&quot; other experts argued that a interest income would calm the financial markets , because it would be the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act . &quot;
&quot; even before a month , the F@@ ed seemed to increase the sentence by 0.25 percentage points in this month , the first small step in a slow ti@@ ghtening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ellen had said in spring and in early summer , that it would be necessary in this year despite the dis@@ comfort of liber@@ als that more economic progress would be needed , an increase of the sentence . &quot;
&quot; although the creation of jobs in August slow@@ ed down , the improvement on the labour market was solid . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate decreased to 5.@@ 1 % last month , the lowest since more than seven years and near the level that the F@@ ed sees as full employment . &quot;
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; and although inflation constantly ran under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed Represent@@ atives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs them for the tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on . &quot;
&quot; however , the financial markets on the whole world sent to the end of last month after China had de@@ vised its currency . &quot;
&quot; the Dow Jones Industrial average value fell by more than 16 % below its peak , as investors feared that a slow@@ down of Chinese economy would decrease the global growth . &quot;
&quot; the market has recovered somewhat in this month , while the Dow is now around 10 % below the Ho@@ ch from May . &quot;

&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of Chinese economy in the last few weeks they would not have occurred in this meeting , &quot; &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fellow at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US staff . &quot;
now he says that they will wait for at least one month to get the effects better in the grip .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data that describe developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot;
&quot; the health of the world economy is one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be included technically at their decision @-@ making . &quot;
&quot; but in the end , the F@@ ed Monetary Authority has become the world . &quot;
the impact of the central bank was enormous in recent years .

&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly bl@@ ended , the F@@ ed representatives are expected that they will not only monitor developments in other places , but also with other central banks and experts to get a better understanding of global economy . &quot;
&quot; their decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of the company En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . &quot;
&quot; lacqu@@ er , unanim@@ ously member of the Federal Open Market Committee , set up for an interest in interest in 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce its leadership by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; despite limited recogni@@ zable impact on growth in the United States , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one year later , the F@@ ed representatives made these cuts . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ ed should only place aspects of financial stability only during a serious crisis like the market crisis in 2008 , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee for Interest in the Bank of England . &quot;
&quot; the recent turbul@@ ences do not come close to this level , he said . &quot;
&quot; it certainly does not want to get into the situation in which they fear of interest in interest , because the markets are exciting , &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until that is changed , I don &apos;t think that they should fores@@ ee the time . &quot;

firm of the Year for Trade@@ marks and Un@@ fair Competition Har@@ m@@ sen U@@ tes@@ cher Firm of the Year for M &amp; A No@@ err Firm of the Year for Media
&quot; in the &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; it was the permission for a special form concerning the roof construction . &quot;
&quot; in this way , a &quot; &quot; saddle @-@ roof with non @-@ centered first and roof over@@ stand &quot; &quot; should be erected . &quot;
&quot; in the background of the planning , the planned use of the roof area for solar installations : &quot; this means that we get a wonderful south @-@ roof , &quot; said Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the session . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; it was about the roof pitch , which is prescribed for energy reasons - different than in the building plan - under 10 degrees . &quot;
the volume of the hall is significantly reduced .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the building plan for the roof of the roof is not permitted &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; - with the Bern@@ ri@@ eder District Court in the rule of liberation contracts rather restri@@ ctive . &quot;
&quot; however , there is no recur@@ ring project : &quot; we create no preced@@ ent , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the gymn@@ asi@@ um construction at the sports centre is a community project of the municipality and SV Bern@@ ried .
&quot; at cost , approximately 2.3 million euros are calculated . &quot;
subsidies are expected from school and latitude activities .
&quot; in the next step , the construction contract will be submitted for the 18 x 36 meter large hall . &quot;

&quot; that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án sends another Z@@ ig@@ mill@@ an to us , is a logical result of an apparent policy : &quot;
&quot; instead of the camp of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke immediately in the establishment of structures to help human@@ eness , our Chancellor has officially adopted the position of the Hungarian government in the Dun@@ st circle of National Socialism . &quot;
&quot; these policies are not only those Austri@@ ans , who are now confronted with cha@@ otic conditions now . &quot;
&quot; also the poultry will have to find that the &quot; &quot; yellow land &quot; &quot; which she invited and welcomed , nothing more than another refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; it will become a great challenge , in view of the ongoing refugee flows and the nearby winter , with us decent conditions for protection seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; and it will be even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;
&quot; Konrad on the search for 35@@ .000 winter@@ firm quar@@ rels &quot;
Konrad has full of his hands full of refugees .
Christian Konrad is acc@@ ustom@@ ed to his word weight .
the government has deployed the former powerful Raiff@@ eisen bank@@ ers to provide qu@@ arti@@ s for thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first recording centre Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already got into the grip .
&quot; we have no homeless more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he told his first success . &quot;
&quot; also the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who had come on Monday to Austria was without big work , Konrad and praised the organisational &quot; master performance . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; &quot; bad situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in total , Konrad with a need of 85@@ .000 quar@@ rels in the he@@ ur@@ ry year . &quot;
&quot; in order to meet the number , in the next few weeks , 35@@ .000 accommodations must be found - 20,000 shall provide countries , 15,000 of the co@@ ven@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; if there are more refugees , we can create it . &quot;
&quot; but it is not a barrel without ground , &quot; &quot; Konrad said . &quot;
he has already led to talks with the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art .
&quot; this would have been secured , even for the coming refugees of Qu@@ arti@@ ere . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Austria it runs well , &quot; said Ferry Mai@@ er . &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ ar supports Konrad .
&quot; in the morning , a meeting with Car@@ dinal Christoph Schön@@ born will be clari@@ fied as the church will help . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; great expectations , the asylum coordin@@ ator is also involved in the OR@@ F action &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ps as we . &quot;
&quot; on the platform , private individuals can offer un@@ complicated accommodations . &quot;
&quot; in addition , one hopes to find hotels that are empty in winter . &quot;
Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ised the standards for the accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot;
&quot; in emergency times , it could not be that qu@@ arti@@ er@@ ers need a certain amount of hand @-@ holder or size of the upper ones . &quot;
&quot; for a temporary period , &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; must be considered . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to the Ministry of Interior , Konrad with his experience . &quot;
&quot; I am an older Lord , which you do not say without further into the face of ignorance . &quot;
his most important weapon is his most important weapon .
&quot; Konrad and Mai@@ er cause no costs , as they declared themselves . &quot;
their employees want to increase their employees up to three to four .
&quot; so far , the own Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ Search was not successful yet . &quot;
Konrad wanted to put a container on the Steph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but there are apparently problems with permission .

&quot; as a result , the city leader is committed to the division of refugees within the federal state . &quot;

&quot; at the same time , there is no doubt that the German borders will not be sealed off . &quot;

&quot; this project had to move up the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt arc@@ ade : finally , she has now gained an increase in the form of another business location . &quot;
&quot; in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the business in which they are sold among other bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing of different manufacturers , everything is all about ladies hand@@ bags from Fur@@ la , money @-@ listed products from 75 Euro . &quot;
larger bags and accessories costs up to 500 euros .
&quot; since yesterday , the new shop is in operation . &quot;
&quot; previously , several weeks were rebuilt . &quot;
&quot; but I have thought for a long time , whether I should open a shop , &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot;
&quot; among other things , the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home , are at home , from the idea of a own location where only their hand@@ bags are sold . &quot;
&quot; we are the ones who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters , who have even Italian roots . &quot;
her fashion interest has been put into the cra@@ dle of her mother .
&quot; for me , most when something is developed and I can show new trends at affordable prices . &quot;
&quot; why so many woman at the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in decoration , can also answer the professional woman with last safety . &quot;
maybe it &apos;s about that a beautiful bag of any outfit is up @-@ to @-@ date .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pf@@ äl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose inhabitants are called An@@ onymous .
this property links some people with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become President .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for excitement .
&quot; on the other hand , it is not surprising that journalists are concerned , journalists are concerned , or knowledge gaps in international crisis policy - the applicant for the US presidential office fo@@ stered the election campaign . &quot;
and cuts well .
this will also be registered in the P@@ äl@@ z@@ an K@@ all@@ stadt where the grand@@ parents of the real estate are her@@ edit@@ ary .
&quot; the New Yorker , with the F@@ öhn@@ refresh@@ ur , is a term for many in the Win@@ zer@@ dorf near the wine @-@ road . &quot;
some people in the 1200 inhabitants place is related to -@@ zig corners with him .
&quot; his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in the election mode . &quot;
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del turned a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about his goal to become the most powerful man of the world ?
&quot; I think those who find this somehow exciting , but are not so deeply impressed by their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter type , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Tr@@ ump , the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts . &quot;
&quot; in addition to this , Tr@@ ump , who is not known for circum@@ c@@ ision , comes into &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) too , so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
&quot; to the king of the heart , he did not put it there . &quot;
&quot; although there is no respect for the performance of the family , but also ten@@ sion@@ ally the opinion that Tr@@ ump is already a bit a big mau@@ l , says Wen@@ del . &quot;

the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 1885 when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and in the United States a loc@@ ale for gold gra@@ ves opened .

&quot; but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of logic : their desire to return to the homeland , failed at the Bavarian State , where the Pal@@ at@@ inate was at the time . &quot;
&quot; he did not record Tr@@ ump , because he once had been cut off without hom@@ olog@@ ation , the director of the Institute for P@@ äl@@ z@@ ian History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , explained to the film start . &quot;
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
this is in contrast to the sometimes striking statements of the desc@@ endants .
&quot; this was repeated over Mexican immigrants in the United States , and demanded the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants . &quot;
&quot; this is not so sympath@@ etic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim B@@ ender , a distant relative tr@@ umps ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a born Tr@@ ump , the Op@@ a was born Heinz &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the win@@ emaker in retirement sees the Americans rather dist@@ anced , &quot; he is always so up@@ lifting . &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; this can &apos;t imagine me , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; he never took care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the pen@@ sion@@ ists Veron@@ ika Sch@@ ra@@ mm , like some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter , mentioned that a desc@@ endant of the Heinz has ended with a visit to the church organ , which is generally well anch@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; this can be seen from the Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; it is better if he doesn &apos;t know the choice because , &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if this is good . &quot;
&quot; if those who had the sa@@ wing at the time of his grandfather in the US would have been such as he , &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot;
and as President ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; my president is not , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
and : &quot; the grapes are also ripe without the President Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; the film , which was interviewed for the Tr@@ ump for a long time , have seen the interest of 12 000 children , even in the United States . &quot;
&quot; the upper Bavarian church of Ram@@ sau at Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; &quot; mountain@@ eering village &quot; . &quot; &quot;

&quot; the woman , at the age of Sam Wood in The Bachelor , was held in the biggest secret office . &quot;
&quot; and none of the three left of the remaining girls will certainly not be priced , whether it is the one who has received the last rose . &quot;
&quot; but when we met Sarah Mack@@ ay , Sne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ on @-@ Fel@@ lows on the day before three two will be checked , you might be acci@@ dentally given a note to who will be the winner . &quot;
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
&quot; all three women have left on a ly@@ rical way about why Wood is the perfect man and knew his sense of humour , ambition , family values and positive attitude as the reasons why they would like to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; &quot; If not you , who should receive W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; &quot; could their answers to the game , who won the heart of the Bachelor &apos;s heart . &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki knew both quickly - except themselves - Mack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah Mack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other .
&quot; from the moment when I went to the house , and ( Sar@@ ahs ) and Sam@@ s energies noticed , I felt that they were quite compatible and I thought that they were quite compatible , and I thought it was the whole course of the show , &quot; &quot; said Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah stands with both feet on Earth , it makes so much fun to be together with her , &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot;
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable .
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
&quot; from her point of view , Mack@@ ay said that the house visit last week had her clear that Wood &quot; could be one . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and the family , I was clear that this is obviously not just a game - I &apos;m now ready to go on it , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when she was asked to choose whom Wood should choose , if not she , there was it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the remaining girls alike - it &apos;s an un@@ decided between Sne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
&quot; the Bachelor will be broadcast on Wednesday , 19 : 30 . &quot;

&quot; 4 people killed , after police officers were shooting at demonstr@@ ators in Nepal &quot;
&quot; four people , among them a 4 @-@ year old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police were killed in a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , said a civil servant on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the violence broke on Tuesday evening in Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi district , about 175 miles west of the capital of Kath@@ mand@@ u . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ k@@ al , Chief Apostle , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside a police station , and some of you war@@ med stones and fire bombs . &quot;
&quot; Mr D@@ ha@@ k@@ al said , the police have used Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as , and then shot into the air before taking back on rubber blade . &quot;
&quot; 20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the rubber bands used to kill them , but traditionally used as less deadly alternative , apparently produced a high death rate . &quot;
&quot; the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal , where members of the ethnic group of the M@@ int@@ i say that new provinces , which would be formed within the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence . &quot;
there were also protests in Western Nepal by the ethnic group of Th@@ arus that want to have their own state .
&quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , were in violent clas@@ hes since the 10 . &quot;
&quot; in August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement to split the country in provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial topic in Nepal that has been central to centuries . &quot;
&quot; the work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008 , but the legisl@@ ature accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that had killed thousands of people in April . &quot;
&quot; the legisl@@ ature has coordinated this week on certain cl@@ auses in the constitutional draft in Kath@@ mand@@ u , and officials said that the new constitution could be in force on Sunday . &quot;

&quot; for easily over@@ weight di@@ abe@@ tics , weight loss surgery can be helpful . &quot;
the benefits of weight loss surgery for easily over@@ weight people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say whether easily over@@ weight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery longer live than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; mort@@ ality data require a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of weight loss surgery , which wrote a guide to the new study in J@@ AMA Surgery . &quot;
&quot; weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach . &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s own ability to absorb food .
&quot; over the years , obesity can be used to treat type 2 diabetes as efficient , but most studies have been carried out with people who are obes@@ e with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a certain measure of weight in relation to size , is considered normal between 18,@@ 5 and 24,@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; a BM@@ I of 25 or more shows that someone is over@@ weight , and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered obes@@ e . &quot;
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng general Hospital data , which they have collected in a study since 2007 , and compare two types of obesity and stomach mu@@ sis - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily over@@ weight . &quot;
&quot; the average BM@@ I under those who undergo surgery , decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the BM@@ I remained with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately at 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those who undergo a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes was completely and at 28 % partially . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results of blood pressure , the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol &quot; were generally better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; the authors found out . &quot;
the researchers also monitored the patient &apos;s blood level of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c which reflects the blood sugar values over time .
hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is considered best among 7 percent .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; in the medical treatment group , however , it remained stable at about 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ emic control &quot; - as you reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - reduced not mort@@ ality in five years , so the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
&quot; results appear ordered &quot; &quot; by relevance &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; by date &quot; &quot; ( publication date ) , &quot;
&quot; in the fifth year , the B@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , higher returns in the BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 versus 5.1 ) and hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded a complete over@@ coming of the diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study shows no survival benefit of surgery after five years , there is evidence from a study of heavy people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study , it was subjected to obes@@ e people who undergo a obesity operation , about 29 percent less likely to die during 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study showed no advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was so@@ othing for people with a BM@@ I under 35 , who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because she says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot;
&quot; Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start weight seriously , as soon as the patient is located between 27 and 30 . &quot;
&quot; I think we are waiting for a long time until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes , which have joined their body with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really hard . &quot;

it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; - Dal@@ ai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; Europe cannot absorb all refugees , said the Dal@@ ai Lama and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East . &quot;
the Tibetan Buddh@@ ist leaders called to end the violence in the country &apos;s home countries .
&quot; the Dal@@ ai Lama spoke the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit in the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dal@@ ai Lama Centre for Comp@@ as@@ sion in Oxford , which is dedicated to ethics studies . &quot;
he demanded that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; he also stressed that the reaction of the Western European countries on the refugee crisis is admi@@ rable , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dal@@ ai Lama has praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions such as a true peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , we have to think about how the killing is reduced in their countries . &quot;
we need to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the use of force has never solved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; the Dal@@ ai Lama spoke to the problem of violence and commented George B@@ ush@@ s action after the terrorist attack on September 11 , and revealed that the violent reaction of the US moved a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events . &quot;
&quot; after September 11 , I expressed my appl@@ ause in a letter to President Bush , and I told him , the way to solving this problem lies in non @-@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he continued violence , and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; said the Dal@@ ai Lama . &quot;
four @-@ fold increase in intake of hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the last 4 years
&quot; poison control centres in the United States report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under twelve years , which swal@@ lowed strongly alcoholic hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , so the Georgia Po@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenues of hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years , the poison control centres report , from 3.@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children are becoming more common in these products , and unfortunately , a percentage of them go in the emergency , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CNN . &quot;
&quot; he said that some children drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , while some are doing to im@@ press their friends or because of a mut@@ ant in social media . &quot;
videos on YouTube show how teenagers dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants drink only because of a cheap experience .
teenagers have allegedly mixed dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with alcohol @-@ containing mouth water to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be swal@@ lowed by attractive fragran@@ ces of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the most attractive ( hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those who are perf@@ ected .
&quot; there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and or@@ ang@@ es that are very appealing for children . &quot;
ham@@ de@@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
&quot; especially in small children , few sy@@ ring@@ es can lead to alcohol poison@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the poison emergency centre at the hospital of Kansas , the transm@@ itter Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you wouldn &apos;t get any swal@@ low whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant in reach of children , and when children come , it is a quick way to consume lots of alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who recently taken four sy@@ ring@@ es from after straw@@ berry du@@ p inf@@ ect@@ ant in the school , was brought into an emergency . &quot;
&quot; their blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold , which is legally bound by an adult , Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor , who treated them in the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ all@@ te her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency .
&quot; doctors supervised her over night in a separate child &apos;s hospital at the signs of brain trau@@ ma , as the girl had fallen through alcohol and saw her head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said . &quot;
&quot; this was very fri@@ ghtening , &quot; said Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ ahu &apos;s mother , CNN . &quot;
it would have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ins outside the child &apos;s reach .
&quot; over alcohol poison@@ ing , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , two women died in Ontario women after the swal@@ lowing of ham@@ de@@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , which contained a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient . &quot;
&quot; health authorities assume that the product meth@@ anol contained , a deadly solution , instead of eth@@ ylene alcohol , which was known as an ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in January , three students of the fourth class in the state of New York , their &quot; &quot; trained &quot; &quot; teacher by po@@ uring anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , reports a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic against ham@@ de@@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ished them out of their room .
&quot; the police looked at the ver@@ ted plan as &quot; &quot; sati@@ re &quot; &quot; and proved discipl@@ ined measures to the school authority . &quot;

&quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Ajax , said : &quot; in Holland they show no highlights of Celtic games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the R@@ angers are not there .

Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had problems with some of the things I said and written .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants that an international reporter is present to write there .

I cannot say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty to be a benef@@ ici@@ ary of the fact .
but I believe that a strong probability is that he is not guilty of the murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
&quot; and from this perspective , I will see him die . &quot;
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other rep@@ orters that you can contact .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man &apos;s death to die .

Sydney Roo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the arbit@@ rator had allowed the Storm players &quot; Ring@@ fighting &quot; with his team during the high Storm victory in Sydney on Friday night .
&quot; Bris@@ bane Bron@@ cos Trainer Wayne Benn@@ ett made a barely conce@@ aled note to the Storm team after his team had achieved the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday evening . he called the game a &quot; sample example &quot; of Rug@@ by League and said that the two out of Que@@ ens@@ land are not &quot; too good &quot; in the rings . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy defended the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his team and said they were only concentrated on their &quot; &quot; contact &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy added that the cri@@ tique of two leading train@@ ers at his team is confident , since it de@@ fies that they are worried about being beaten by the Storm team . &quot;
&quot; it always appears again - I didn &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about Ring@@ fighting when they have beaten us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ kles on a real focus , and this has provided us the trend revers@@ al . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . he is probably not used to lose it , so it was a bit a shock for him . &quot;
it &apos;s already funny how this time appears again at this time .
&quot; Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ ett &apos;s idea from the &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or to remember that Benn@@ ett St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; &quot; boring &quot; &quot; football . &quot;
Wayne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; he has compared his game on Saturday evening with our on Friday evening , and how exciting their game was , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wayne said that he will take care of a divorce . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and play as exciting , especially his young players with their speed . &quot;
this is the ball game that you want to play when you have this kind of players .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt as they can play . &quot;
&quot; I build stronger confidence , because they say these things because they are a bit worried to play against us . &quot;
&quot; six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think of us when it was about the big games . &quot;
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against Roo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against Cow@@ boys .
&quot; the game of Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two further attempts in our game , but is it an exciting game ? &quot;
or are breaks and don &apos;t have a point of tension ?
for me it &apos;s the game plans .
&quot; if they mention us , it means that we will still meet them in a phase . &quot;

Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vi@@ cs mother and step@@ father had offered a deposit of 200,000 dollars as security together to reach his release .

the mass makes it : every two years show the car at the IAA in the IAA .
&quot; in 2015 , it is particularly important to see movement in the compact cars that are currently selling very well . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , cars from the compact class are particularly in demand : some 28,@@ 1 percent of new regi@@ strations fell to the Federal Office ( KBA ) alone in August on this segment . &quot;
this is reflected on the IAA ( publication stage 17 - 27 September ) .
&quot; between all the futur@@ istic concept vehicles and new top @-@ class and luxury cars , many new compact models will be presented in this year . &quot;
&quot; the Opel Astra , which is one of the biggest pre@@ m@@ ating for the German automobile industry , is one of the biggest pre@@ m@@ ating cars in the autumn . &quot;
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot;
he belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; in this way , the volume model is also sold well , the new Astra will not be much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; Opel presents an entry below the biggest competitors VW Golf in view , which starts at 17 650 euros . &quot;
the current Astra cost from 16 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; in addition , the Hessen further diesel and gasoline engines offer 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for the first time also three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines . &quot;
&quot; unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , Opel Astra will initially offer the Opel Astra only as a fifth belt . &quot;
&quot; as a second variant I will follow in the spring of the combination , which will also be seen on the IAA . &quot;
and what will be driving next to the Astra on the IAA in new compact cars ?

Infin@@ iti : new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
&quot; with the new model , Nissan dealers will find its position in the strong growing segment . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the compact Infin@@ iti fits perfectly into the brand &apos;s design line . &quot;
the basic model will receive a petrol engine with a capacity of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
&quot; in addition , it is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp . &quot;
&quot; Suzuki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is the Suzuki Bal@@ eno , who celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; the model with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp . &quot;
&quot; according to manufacturer &apos;s specifications , the maximum torque is 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) . &quot;
sales start of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
&quot; DS 4 : not completely new , but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4 , which is seen on the IAA . &quot;
&quot; on the outside , the designers of the noble Citro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ers laid the front part on the front part : the radiator gri@@ lle was newly drawn and fitted with LED technology . &quot;
&quot; in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ainment system was moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons were reduced by a touch@@ screen and integrated the first Ap@@ ples Car@@ Play . &quot;

&quot; the Berlin school administration has found that only a few fled parents will give their children to the Kit@@ as , estimated ten to 15 per cent : &quot; for the un@@ rooted parents it is only very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ schem@@ bar , spokesman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate . &quot;
&quot; in order to convince the family to convince the benefits of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ writing in different languages . &quot;
&quot; if the need to educ@@ ate the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would attempt to increase the training capacities - for example by allowing more specialized schools . &quot;
&quot; in the countries , students will be prepared without knowledge in welcome lessons . &quot;
&quot; but they will not always be taught by fully trained teachers and teachers , but as in Berlin , also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as second language . &quot;
&quot; on them there is no shortage , says Be@@ ate stands from the Berlin school administration . &quot;
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that approximately 20 per cent of the refugees want to study in Germany .

&quot; for refugees with a residence permit or Dul@@ les , no services are received after the asylum seek@@ er performance law more if they start studying a study . &quot;
&quot; in principle , there is no b@@ af@@ ö@@ g , since it is not falling under the circle of the b@@ af@@ ö@@ g@@ able persons . &quot;
&quot; the refugees had to have lived four years in Germany to be eligible to be B@@ af@@ ö@@ g @-@ entitled , January 1 , 2016 . &quot;
&quot; however , this financing gap must be closed , Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk . &quot;
the students should immediately get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g immediately .
&quot; Islam will play a more important role in future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should further develop the same rights as they have the churches , and to further develop the existing state churches right to a new state @-@ religion relationship . &quot;
&quot; it is important to be the establishment of an Islamic welfare union , who cares professionally about the newcom@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; on the right hand , duties are also duties . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the representatives of Islam have to be a clear contact person and willing to work with the state in many areas and to give him some control options . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose we would like to hear your opinion , wishes and suggestions . we kindly ask you to take about ten minutes to take part in this Online Survey . online Survey Information for survey participants &quot;
&quot; the President of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Ma@@ zy@@ ek , expressed concern about the concern , religious conflicts could also be entered in Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted such conflicts in Germany would immediately have their right to stay here in Germany , &quot; he said in the Bay@@ erische Rundfunk . &quot;
he suggested to translate the basic law on Arabic .
&quot; in future , integration will be much more than today a topic of the whole society . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the majority of society will have to change , the reduction of discrimination and racism is more pressing . &quot;
&quot; as a result of European decisions , it has been an anti @-@ discrimination agency and a general equality law . &quot;
&quot; but it lear@@ ns very slowly , as the NSU assass@@ ination series showed , in the police and authorities the rac@@ ist motive was systematically ignored . &quot;
&quot; the same chances for all : what migrants organizations and the stakeholders of non @-@ white Germans are calling for long long , and why international agreements such as the anti @-@ rac@@ ist convention Germany must be in reality when the country remain peaceful and its new citizens should use their possibilities - for the benefit of all . &quot;
&quot; in general , Germany is able to provide medical care to the previously expected refugees , Frank Ulrich Mont@@ gom@@ ery believes . &quot;
&quot; what Man@@ - Power and Cap@@ acities are concerned , we create this , &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
&quot; however , the money has to flow into the system . &quot;
&quot; in order to avoid bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ gom@@ ery calls for all candidates to be handed out at the registration of health cards . &quot;
&quot; as a result , services could later be expected later with the federal states . &quot;
&quot; and in the long term it is highly question@@ able , so many people with limited power catalogue are ab@@ used to see the asylum seek@@ er performance law . &quot;
&quot; in other words , doctors mainly do the language barriers . &quot;
&quot; so far , the Berlin Health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has been proven , migrants are worse about their illnesses than other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in clinics , even in medical practices , they need to be taken over interpre@@ ting costs . &quot;
&quot; as a result , many refugees would also have been assisted with more general medical centres in the emergency ambul@@ ances . &quot;
and with another diagnostic view .
&quot; under refugee camps , there is much more un@@ il@@ ateral Dis@@ abilities , and the young people go to HIV education . &quot;
&quot; with some other disease pictures of German doctors from their training , Mont@@ gom@@ ery believes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite diarr@@ ho@@ ea or tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to detect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Syri@@ ans would have a highly developed educational system , some refugees are even doctors . &quot;
&quot; in order to practice practice , however , they would have to prove their qualification as well as possible tests . &quot;
&quot; at least half of the refugees in Germany , according to estimates of the federal psych@@ otherap@@ ist chamber ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) psych@@ ologically ill , most suffer from post@@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression . &quot;
&quot; in particular , refugee children are particularly vulnerable to refugee children , Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot;
a recently published study of the TU Munich showed that every fifth Syrian refugee children traumati@@ zed in Germany .
&quot; if you are interested in a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder , among other things , so @-@ called Flash@@ backs with breathing , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart attacks and death . &quot;
&quot; other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders , strong wick@@ edness and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent the symptoms of chronic , an early treatment is necessary , Mun@@ z explained . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , problems of matching the skill requirements of jobs and employees &quot; qualifications have come into the focus of scientific discussions . &quot;
&quot; however , psych@@ ologically ill asylum seek@@ ers can provide an application for a psych@@ otherapy application , but the processing usually takes several months . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in the social offices , physicians or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses , decide whether a therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this often lead to mis@@ understand@@ ings , says Mun@@ z . &quot;

H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will build up to 30.000 jobs
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to build 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in the framework of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services . &quot;
&quot; in this year , HP will split up in two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast growing company hardware and service business activities . &quot;
&quot; the expected job reduction leads to a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , said HP in a statement . &quot;
&quot; this restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP Chairman and Chief Executive Officer . &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than it is HP today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support businesses in transition to a new style of business , &quot; Whit@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before , to satisfy the changing needs of our customers throughout the world . &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than 50 billion dollars of annual revenue and &quot; will be focused on the provision so far , integrated technology solutions for companies &quot; , &quot; says an explanation of the company . &quot;

FC Arsen@@ al captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team mates have to stand against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; Wen@@ ger stressed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere , that it was first of September and if his rehabilitation is going to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play before Christmas . &quot;
&quot; this optimistic scenario means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will surely miss at least the next four games for England and in view of its history , his participation in the next summer will certainly be uncertain . &quot;
&quot; the big dis@@ grace in this current issue is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury , and then returned to his old swing during the season . &quot;
&quot; this kind of injury does not threat@@ ens the career , &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
it is a bone which is not well healed .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
&quot; it was not in connection with his ank@@ le , or with the injuries he had previously . &quot;
&quot; this may be true of purely medical vision , but as Wen@@ ger also acknowledged , there is the associated danger of other injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
&quot; the investigation of Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since its debut , six years ago . &quot;
he also played in only 65 of Arsen@@ als 157 Lig@@ amat@@ eurs in the last five times .
the broader picture for Arsen@@ al is that it has been one of the two Premier League clubs since 2007 / 08 .
&quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in injury rate during the last season will last . &quot;
&quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have a prone period , a time when you strengthen your body and win combat power , &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope his body is stabili@@ zed , I am confident that he will do it and he will have a career from the way he deserves . &quot;
&quot; Arsen@@ al starts his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo , before playing Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger puts a rotation within the team . &quot;
Hé@@ ctor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not travelled to Croatia - what means Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta should start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and the players who need to treat a little distortion , &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
&quot; despite Arsen@@ al clear favour@@ ites , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb belongs to the play@@ grounds with the biggest inti@@ mid@@ ation effect in Europe . &quot;
Dynam@@ o is also un@@ successful after 41 games after the &quot; un@@ defeated &quot; campaign was launched in the last season .
&quot; the stadium was sh@@ aken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , with the Rich@@ ter@@ sk@@ ala 3.@@ 2 . &quot;
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
&quot; Wen@@ ger is the opinion that Arsen@@ al has drawn the doctrine from the last season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco , and remains to lead the association to its first European ap@@ oc@@ lassi@@ cal triumph . &quot;
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it has never worked with Arsen@@ al .
&quot; we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic . &quot;
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not dreaming . &quot;
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
&quot; the lack of similar representations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open , now even more dou@@ b@@ ted than ever , as self @-@ mor@@ als among young men on a 15 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;

friendship is the heart of the fight to master this challenge .
&quot; a current study of more than 2,000 high @-@ school students with de@@ pressive symptoms found that if the body had enough high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery are double . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends reduce the risks of mental problems . &quot;
&quot; but of course , you have to have friends , so that a friendship can work . &quot;
&quot; in the age of over social media , communication with its focus on style is often more important than a meaningful contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital life has the need to appear strong , lively and successful , dou@@ bt@@ less , even if in reality the isolation is dominated . &quot;
&quot; this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ tr@@ insi@@ cally values , money , image , social status , all on cost in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner lon@@ ging for personal development and friendship that affects our spiritual health . &quot;
&quot; and as a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really not buy happiness . &quot;
the beauty of Friends was that this focus was placed on the head .
&quot; every character has not been defined by his work , but by his personality , by the interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the humour of Joey and Chand@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments when football looks in comfortable arm@@ chairs and the lon@@ ging of Ross to Rachel - all that came from knowing that men can definitely get back to explore completely their feelings . &quot;
&quot; as a staff of the phone doctor told me : ... &quot; &quot; my listeners for people who feel de@@ pressed and endanger@@ ed , has really shown me clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
men who contact us are often not able to speak with friends .
&quot; the old word &quot; &quot; I come with it &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when you talk about problems . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that come into mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it presents quite clearly the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
&quot; so much my objective external leaders status over the phone call people in moments of desper@@ ation , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
&quot; and so , if you visit this weekend comedy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the celebration of the day , why do not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or , even better if you want to sit around in Starbucks someone alone , give him a smile and tell me Hello . &quot;
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
episode : # 5@@ .04 Devil &apos;s Night ( American Horror Story )
&quot; di Maria meets to assist PS@@ G , mal@@ m@@ ö &quot;
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
&quot; di Maria meets with his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday , and helps PS@@ G to pass through Mal@@ m@@ ö . &quot;
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
&quot; di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player , who brought the French master on the way , but afterwards they missed a number of opportunities before they finally increased their advantage than Cav@@ ani in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and chess t@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in the group A , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish masters , as they did not only strive for the qualification for the K.@@ O@@ .-@@ laps , but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they got the points , it was not a class game of Laurent Blan@@ cs Team with Z@@ lat@@ an Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vi@@ cs missed opportunities ahead of the gate . &quot;
&quot; it is not easy to win at home or down@@ ward in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 , to create our opponents problems and look back , even if there are certain things we need to perfect in the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc . &quot;
&quot; this is a good sign .
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we didn &apos;t have one or two other gates . &quot;
&quot; Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic returned after his injury in one of three changes in the Paris team that could hold a 2 : 2 un@@ decided on their own place against Bor@@ deaux , but he was exposed in the fourth minute by Di Maria . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing doors became known as the man who was taken over to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over the last month of Manchester United , and he pointed out why when he was in Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Mal@@ m@@ ö defense , he was passing nicely into the long corner of the network . &quot;
&quot; but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , it was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Mal@@ m@@ ö , the Celtic in a play @-@ off in order to achieve this level , came up with nine national players on the field and was hit by a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle of the middle . &quot;
&quot; but besides a shot by Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ dj@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps P@@ fo@@ sten in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G himself gave himself sometimes , with some mis@@ ses and bad conditions , not least by Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , who was not less than five attempts alone in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used him after the re@@ start . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless he pointed out a lot more skill , when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass of Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , related to Di Maria in a shot shot , which was passing by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute . &quot;
&quot; after Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic had a left flank of Max@@ well , after Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic had left a left flank of Max@@ well . &quot;
&quot; this ended all thoughts that Mal@@ m@@ ö could come back to the game , and only an outstanding intervention of Wil@@ and from the short@@ est distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , could stop the final result before the waiting list of Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi has been recognized by the end . &quot;
&quot; the coach of Mal@@ m@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , announced that PS@@ G played a class over his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December last year . &quot;
&quot; since then , we played only in the Swedish league , which did not have the same level . &quot;
the qualification games are not sufficient .
hat from Paris !
it was a great game of them !

&quot; eight times Spanish champion , three times champion @-@ winner , four times championship champion , two times World Champion , two times European champion , a time world champion - the title list of X@@ avi is breathtaking . &quot;
&quot; in the summer of the year , 35 @-@ year @-@ olds left the FC Barcelona and changed to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar . &quot;
&quot; but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ avi reveals that he was already standing in front of the European Championship before the EM 2008 . &quot;
&quot; he told me that Bar@@ ça wanted me to sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Madrid won everything we don &apos;t , &quot; he tells . &quot;
&quot; by Andrzej On September 11 , 2011 &gt; 9 &quot; &quot; Tablets &quot;
X@@ avi : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted to have me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the gates of Heaven and Hell are adjacent ... and un@@ marked ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the change came not .
and the decisive husband is working for the German record master : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; X@@ avi explains why : &quot; Bar@@ ça has taken Guardi@@ ola , and I played a great EM . &quot;
PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he could not imagine the team without me .
&quot; so that he has done me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how to run Bay@@ erns season 2008 / 2009 with X@@ avi .
&quot; X@@ avi stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter finals of the Champions League against Bavaria over the entire distance on the lawn , the red from ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the end of the King &apos;s triumph . &quot;
Matt Dam@@ on plays a variety in film making
Matt Dam@@ on confron@@ ts the af@@ ro@@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about the diversity and said they will not need behind the scenes .
&quot; during a result of the Sunday Night of H@@ BO@@ s Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown broke the need of alternative perspectives and in terms of a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen screen@@ play of the project . &quot;
&quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it in the occupation of the film and not at the occupation of the show , &quot; assured Dam@@ on . &quot;
&quot; brown was shocked , with ins@@ ult@@ ed un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; as the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian was strengthened . &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the Pro@@ du@@ centr@@ enk@@ ol@@ lay Ben Aff@@ l@@ eck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly Brothers to discuss about the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to ask people to think about it - who will always be the director - as they treat the figure of Harmon@@ y , &quot; &quot; Brown said first . &quot;
&quot; the only black person , and she is a Nut@@ te , which is beaten by her white . &quot;
&quot; the producer of Dear White People set up for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for the direction rights on the film ; Dam@@ on said that her director &quot; &quot; at the end can give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; after the discussion was broadcast , the social media exploded on Dam@@ on &apos;s comments . &quot;
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
&quot; since its publication , the clients earned more than 5,000 re@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 users since its publication . &quot;
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when the exact rac@@ ist representation in the media is at the top of the social discussion .
&quot; after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed by a white police in 2014 , the movement Black Li@@ ves Matter achieved nationwide action and pressing legisl@@ ature and authorities to stop discrimin@@ atory practices against farms . &quot;
&quot; in February , singer Prince joined the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards . &quot;
&quot; album still matter , &quot; ( albums have still their meaning ) , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; like books and black lives , even albums are still their significance . &quot;
&quot; in recent times , leaders of the Movement Black Li@@ ves Matter have published an explanation of the question of the Fox News personality Elisabeth Hassel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group . &quot;
&quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Matter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders . &quot;
&quot; recently , Dam@@ on was announced on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le who were invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot;
&quot; if he accepted the invitation , or already made the Pope , it is unclear . &quot;
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior &apos; crow@@ ned first champion
professional sport climbing and operating aid Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero was the first ath@@ lete who won the American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior on Monday evening and took the Grand Prix of 1 million $ with home .
&quot; the competition show , which has just completed its 7 season , has never experienced a competition participant , which was able to close all levels of his obstacle course . &quot;
&quot; during the season of season there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and Camer@@ am@@ ann Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , until the final . &quot;
climbing on a 75 foot long climbing rope in 30 seconds .
&quot; Brit@@ ten ended the task within the time , with which he finished the first ath@@ lete who finished the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero ended this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him a winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! messages after the hard @-@ fought victory , still under the shock over the profit of the big prize of 1 million . &quot;
&quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I have never earned more than 10,000 $ or to life , &quot; Isaac E ! over his he@@ ap of money . &quot;
so suddenly .. like I can &apos;t imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the leading producer Kent We@@ ed set himself with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the finale and why Brit@@ ten , although he was first ended at the course of the course , did not receive any prize money . &quot;
&quot; after the rules , the money goes to the fastest person . &quot;
&quot; if there is more than a fin@@ alists , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; how much money is a wonderful price and change life , it receives the great engraving . &quot;
I don &apos;t believe that he h@@ ears about it .
he is just so happy to have done what he has done .
he was awarded by fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I am glad that Isaac is . &quot;
&quot; and I think Isaac would have felt as well , if they had changed the roles . &quot;
America Nin@@ ja War@@ rior was extended for an ast@@ oun@@ ding season in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers grinding on Minnesota Tw@@ ins
MIN@@ NE@@ A@@ POL@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
&quot; earlier they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers stand on the last square in the American League Central . &quot;
&quot; the Tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spoiler , but played this part on Tuesday perfectly against Minnesota Tw@@ ins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target field . &quot;
the Tw@@ ins were a chance to climb to Ascen@@ sion within a game of Houston Astro@@ s for the second American League game .
&quot; for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letters F word that was so difficult to touch over a large part of the season . &quot;
&quot; all victories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Ex@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; Tiger Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon kept his early offensive support , when Detroit was three times in the first two inside , then again in the sixth and then again in the ninth . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) suggested 6 times in 1 / 3 inside and enabled three races .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to quit this year , &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to throw every game in the bull@@ pen every game , and therefore I want to focus on the game . &quot;
&quot; the designated Tiger @-@ Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits , and was in two R@@ uns , his first r@@ bis since mid @-@ August . &quot;
&quot; it was the first three @-@ hit hit game by Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th . &quot;
&quot; he has sm@@ iled the wood well , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; he looked good from the ( percussion training ) , looked much better out of the bull@@ pen , and he brought it directly into the game . &quot;
&quot; with three races at the end of the seventh , the Tw@@ ins had their best chance to come back to the game again . &quot;
center F@@ iel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton ended the In@@ ning with a double on the left field line .

&quot; however , the right @-@ handed st@@ ach is S@@ ano at three pitch for his fifth save . &quot;
Detroit benefited to the start of the game from an even non @-@ mov@@ able Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
&quot; the Tig@@ ers achieved three races in the first two inside against the right @-@ handed veter@@ ans , who had been shot before the game from the injury list . &quot;
&quot; obviously not the start I wanted to tell me , &quot; &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; &quot; but I felt comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches in the third In@@ ning . &quot;
&quot; after they received the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter , H@@ ushes gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z produced Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z , who managed a single &quot; up the middle &quot; in the first run of the game . &quot;
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z completed his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the Run@@ ners in the Scor@@ ing position .
&quot; the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed a single on the right side , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat . &quot;
&quot; in the second , a One @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James McC@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single by Center @-@ F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose for 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; this was a big blow , &quot; &quot; said Tw@@ ins manager Paul Mo@@ li@@ tor . &quot;

hammer artist invested three years into the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gil@@ ded ) thorn is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt has painted his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts .
&quot; at the beginning , the word was ? &quot;
&quot; no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which now appeared with splendid images . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning , the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who has form@@ ulated his very personal interpretations of bi@@ blical stories on paper and canvas . &quot;
&quot; his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old , which is by no means equivalent to &quot; funny &quot; pictures . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary : adapted to the respective subjects , it can be quite dark . &quot;
&quot; about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his Bible project for which he made a subjective artistic choice from the many topics of the &quot; book of all books . &quot; &quot;
&quot; these are cycles related to themes such as Kreuz@@ weg , pl@@ agues , command@@ ments , or fa@@ ther@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; in this way , he spont@@ ane@@ ously fascin@@ ates several partners : this applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological alignment as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with its focus on art books . &quot;
&quot; and there is , above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has drawn up on the basis of painting with the respective biography . &quot;
&quot; he has interpreted the Bible selected by Ot@@ mar Alt &apos;s selected Bible , and is translated into current contex@@ ts . &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ts painting .
&quot; they are embedded between the original bi@@ blical texts of Martin Luther and each one of the artist , who form@@ ulates his very personal thoughts on the respective situation . &quot;
the jewelry clas@@ p has golden Let@@ tern .
&quot; this allows the 75 @-@ year @-@ old double a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high level of intim@@ acy .
&quot; emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protest@@ ant Herr@@ n@@ h@@ uter @-@ Order . &quot;
&quot; since the education has been done with the Rohr@@ stock , &quot; &quot; recalls Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot;
I have tried to work to work in order to bring me back with the Lord &apos;s father .
&quot; his second concern was to help the art in a fast @-@ lived time : &quot; the perception of image worlds is characterized by records , and that is loud . &quot;
symboli@@ sm is pushed .
artists have a different lust and pleasure to show things .
pictures have always something secret and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants to let the viewer get into the pictures , discover and feel what force they have : &quot; the image is looking for himself . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost stood on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; &quot; always &quot; &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Art : &quot; &quot; I like how he worked with his paintings . &quot;

&quot; at the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am next Wednesday in the pul@@ pit office and meet the State Minister Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the Chancellor . &quot;
&quot; the theme is certainly a central role , &quot; he announced . &quot;
the football could help and would help .
&quot; however , the crucial turn@@ out must be set up politics . &quot;
the German football federation therefore has expanded its refugee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; for four years .
&quot; over the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation , we have ensured that this program will continue to continue until 2019 , &quot; said Ki@@ efer at the edge of the UE@@ FA meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
some federal lists support this program .
&quot; already on this weekend , 36 professionals set a clear sign when they are on the left Tri@@ kot@@ express instead of the usual sponsor@@ ing logos ( Her@@ mes ) the imprint &quot; &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; . &quot; &quot;

&quot; the refugee drama goes to everyone , no one can see away . &quot;

&quot; the 54 @-@ year old manager was in the meeting , and &quot; fully employed . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , he will come back to Germany and lead to the software group . &quot;
&quot; I am full of SAP , fully in my job . &quot;

&quot; for this reason , Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes place in the place of tribal leader Roman Bür@@ ki . &quot;

&quot; the highlights : display mannequins , which look terri@@ bly human thanks to video proj@@ ections . &quot;

&quot; in fact , he had been on the contrary , because : &quot; for me an exhibition sounded a bit after death , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; when one dies , one comes into the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection had already been made in the Canadian Montreal and Paris station .
&quot; it &apos;s so much more than just beautiful clothes , &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ eder@@ en . &quot;
&quot; it is about tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society . &quot;
&quot; the exhibits give an insight into that hardly even at the present work of the man who wrote the fashion story , without ever having completed apprentic@@ eship . &quot;
&quot; chron@@ ologically , the show is not built , but it is an excellent chore@@ ographic overall art work for which much effort was done : to fresh@@ en the dolls , for example , a sty@@ list was dedicated to a sty@@ list . &quot;

jewellery instead of Gard@@ ine - Plau@@ ener tip as a fashion @-@ niche
&quot; in the past , it went to the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around Plau@@ en to make meters . &quot;
&quot; the embroi@@ dered fabrics and tips were created in large quantities for customers , for example , blan@@ kets and curtains . &quot;
&quot; this alone does not work anymore , &quot; explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of Mo@@ j@@ it@@ ze Plau@@ en . &quot;
&quot; instead , the fashion is again important . &quot;
&quot; in the early times of the plau@@ sible point fashion , fashion has a bigger role , was then pushed through the home textiles industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : tip in jewellery , in accessories such as bags and regional tra@@ ps . &quot;
&quot; at all , the so @-@ called vintage fashion that re@@ jects the past Sti@@ le@@ po@@ chen , an increasing contractor . &quot;

our products will hardly be able to reach customers on this way .
&quot; the mass ware is much cheaper today in Asian space , and almost exclusively distributed over chains . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the weak@@ ening of export , current to Russia and the USA . &quot;
there are plenty of reasons for new ways .
&quot; the industry association also tries to focus on environmental awareness , such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer from the ST@@ ICK@@ PER@@ LE in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year we have a quality seal , that shows that we produce ecological and socially acceptable . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also refers to the materials used .
diplom@@ a designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ eber@@ ger exterior of the Western @-@ Saxon University of Z@@ wick@@ au - at the faculty of applied art - and speci@@ alizes in embroi@@ dery and tips .
&quot; in order to meet the competition from the Asian region , you need to find high @-@ quality and innovative products . &quot;
that needs time and courage .
&quot; there is a voltage field between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and the companies , who have to think above all economically , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; therefore , an existing design is often only slightly varied to keep a customer base . &quot;
a few years ago textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter is new to the historic snow@@ man tip .
&quot; in this way , the machine is sti@@ cking small kitchens . &quot;
the plau@@ sible gold@@ smith &apos;s master@@ mind Bi@@ anca Hal@@ leb@@ ach herb was inspired : &quot; before I could not start with traditional Plau@@ ener tip .
now she uses the snow @-@ tip for her jewellery .
&quot; in an elaborate procedure , it pre@@ suppos@@ es the pattern in silver . &quot;
&quot; many people of the region identify with the topic of plau@@ sible point - young and old , &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot;
&quot; it also supplies to the USA , Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in Plau@@ en and its surroundings and would like to have a souven@@ ir piece . &quot;
so I see my jewellery as a modern ambassador of the Plau@@ ener tip .

&quot; data coverage : market sizes ( historic and forecasts ) , company shares , brand shares and distribution data . why buy this report ? &quot;
the system will be tested and tested and improved by test programs .
&quot; the initiative is of importance , since the market has a greater role in the allocation of resources , a right @-@ state business environment and the market open to open , said the statement . &quot;
&quot; the government will also take control over the powers to the company , and ensure that companies decide how they perform their business . &quot;
the statement also said that China border regions will allow new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
&quot; in the framework of an offer , state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas are opened for private investment . &quot;
&quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investment , and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign investors and bring better services to them , &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot;

EU wants to double mer@@ cury @-@ limit value in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish
&quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mer@@ cury in large pre@@ dat@@ ors , and to make consumers a significantly higher dose of nerve damage . &quot;
&quot; the consumer organisation Food@@ watch , who has an appropriate working paper of the EU , critic@@ ised the plans sharply : &quot; risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policy will continue with full force on pregnant and inf@@ ant children , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt from Food@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nervous system for big fish at the end of the food chain such as Hai@@ - or Sch@@ wert@@ fish from &quot; economic policy reasons &quot; can be raised by one on two milli@@ grams of mer@@ cury per kil@@ ogra@@ m of fish . &quot;
&quot; however , large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish have already been heavily bur@@ dened with mer@@ cury , that on the basis of the current limit values , approximately 50 per cent of the length are not sold . &quot;
&quot; after dou@@ bling of the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be un@@ avo@@ idable . &quot;
&quot; in return for this loos@@ ening , the EU wants to intensi@@ fy the limit values in other fish from 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mer@@ cury per kil@@ ogra@@ m . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the reduction in Kl@@ einf@@ isch is therefore a per@@ fi@@ ant distra@@ ction maneu@@ ver that helps alone the economy , &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot;
mer@@ cury is a highly toxic heavy metal for humans .
&quot; therefore , the federal government warns that &quot; already small quantities are particularly affected by un@@ born damage to the nervous system . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Federal Environment Ministry explains on its homepage with regard to the applicable maximum values , however , that a &quot; health haz@@ ard of the general population &quot; is not expected . &quot;
mer@@ cury is primarily driven by coal burning in the environment .
&quot; according to a written information by the Federal Environment Ministry , the German coal @-@ fired power stations viol@@ ate the Green @-@ Bundestag Euro MP Ann@@ al@@ ena Ba@@ er@@ ner more than six tonnes of mer@@ cury in the year , two thirds of the total amount in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of mer@@ cury in fish such as Elbe , Rhine and Danube is &quot; permanent and surface @-@ covering &quot; , &quot; the &quot; Spiegel &quot; had been quoted in March of paper . &quot;
&quot; last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings of mer@@ cury in fish has already been reported to the most frequently reported health risks in the EU @-@ Warn@@ system RAS@@ FF . &quot;
