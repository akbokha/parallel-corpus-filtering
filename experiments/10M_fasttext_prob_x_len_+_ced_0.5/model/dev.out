Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and Teheran &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; at the meeting , however , it is also about the conflict with Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement of Israel and thro@@ ws Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
&quot; in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu had held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , which was partly considered an aff@@ ront to Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not talked with Obama , a meeting with regard to the forthcoming election in Israel was rejected . &quot;

&quot; in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ annon Lam@@ b told the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house . &quot;
&quot; it was important to stress that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the cell phone . &quot;
&quot; within the house , the officials found the cor@@ pse of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was scri@@ b@@ bled on a white block : &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I could undo it , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; &quot; this stood according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lam@@ b . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that Lam@@ b , who served in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already submitted 300 miles to the school grounds where he was shot and killed by the police . &quot;
Delta State University Poli@@ tk@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lam@@ b had made the fatal emergency call at some point later .
&quot; until the end of the day , there was another death : Lam@@ m took up life as the police interven@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; a day after fo@@ undry in the university , students and lect@@ urers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what lam@@ b motivated . &quot;
&quot; the investig@@ ators on both ends of the State published details , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher . &quot;
students said they enjoyed themselves on his lessons .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he did not have any history of violence or criminal history . &quot;
he himself had mentioned Lam@@ b in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
&quot; both were taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose curriculum includes 17 members , and many students attended courses from both . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , there were some tendencies towards problematic behavior . &quot;
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised the Lam@@ b , said he seemed too excited and nervous as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes said that Lam@@ m told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
Lam@@ b had asked the del@@ ta State University for health reasons beforehand and told him that he had any health problem .
&quot; this year , he taught only two online courses . &quot;
&quot; recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the doctor@@ ate , for the Lam@@ b had worked so hard for him , would not guarantee an automatic path to an appointment as assistant professor . &quot;
&quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lam@@ b and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ b idea . &quot;
these are questions that Lam@@ b cannot answer any more .
&quot; after the escape from the campus , the police found Lam@@ b &apos;s trail when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as . &quot;
&quot; before he could be arrested , Lam@@ b killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his childhood home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car still ran in the drive .
&quot; it wasn &apos;t immediately clear why Lam@@ m went to this house , but Johnson said she believed that he knew people who lived there . &quot;
Lam@@ b grew up in the area .
&quot; in 2009 , Lam@@ b started his work at the University that 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants , and taught geography and ped@@ agog@@ y . &quot;
he has a doctor@@ ate in the spring of ped@@ agog@@ y .
&quot; one of the long @-@ standing friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny . &quot;
&quot; Car@@ la Hair@@ ston said she was 15 and Lam@@ m was 20 , when they met by common friends . &quot;
&quot; she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her guitar playing . &quot;
he was the flock of women at that time .
&quot; all girls mel@@ ted away when he was there , &quot; &quot; said Hair@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot;
Lam@@ b and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; in the emergency call , &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; but there was no document of a marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog named Light@@ ning who lived with them in the brick house , which is adjacent to a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier . &quot;
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said that they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was 19 years old . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed in the ground , &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said about his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lam@@ b , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lam@@ b was interested in music and played blues . &quot;
Lam@@ b met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail joined both on a summer @-@ scale .
later they played together one or another gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter wrote and sings her own music .

&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he saw Lam@@ b and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night in September 5th for the last time after Lam@@ b had finished his guitar and harmon@@ ic aspi@@ ration before a spar@@ se audience . &quot;
there was no sign of anything wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said . &quot;

&quot; he was a member of the branch of Johann Martin I Kochersperger , line@@ age Jacob II Kochersperger , USA . &quot;

&quot; associated Press Auth@@ ors Emily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report . &quot;
&quot; this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now says that Lam@@ b made the emergency call after he shot Schmidt , and that Lam@@ m called Pr@@ enti@@ ss in his emergency call as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever been married . &quot;

Michael J. Fox is sh@@ attered about his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .

UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; Secretary @-@ General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says , his response to Russia &apos;s reinforced military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five @-@ year conflict , and more weapons will make use of violence and misery for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN chief urges all parties , including the divided UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations on finding a political solution . &quot;
&quot; ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Minister of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the fr@@ inge of the General Assembly meeting this month to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
he regre@@ tt@@ ed that the divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; make this situation in@@ sol@@ vable .

and some wait for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some Rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the top ranks in surveys down , it hasn &apos;t worked . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys show Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit area , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of Real Estate Mog@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is still too early in the election period . &quot;
no one claimed that Tr@@ ump probably won the Republican nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts emphas@@ ise that this time in 2011 Rick Per@@ r@@ ys &apos;s leadership was handed over to the rising Her@@ man C@@ ain , one of whom only won a state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders like J@@ eb B@@ ush@@ s Super PA@@ C and the conservative Economic Group Club for Growth now recognize dr@@ umps of stam@@ ina and begin to flow their dollars to overthrow him .
here are some current surveys that indicate that the Real Estate @-@ Mog@@ ul is not just a temporary phase :

a majority of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans see Tr@@ ump temper@@ ament not as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critici@@ zed for its bomb@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of the Irish voters believe that the real estate @-@ Mog@@ ul has the right temper@@ ament for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number is considered in the first constitu@@ ent state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 per cent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , 44 percent believe that he did not have the personality to effectively manage his office , and almost six out of 10 independent states that his temper@@ ament did not fit into the White House , so ABC / Post . &quot;

a sovereign start of the Champions League season .
&quot; the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze have made a dream start to the &quot; &quot; Mission Milan &quot; &quot; in the Hex@@ enk@@ essel of Pi@@ ra@@ eus . &quot;

&quot; Pi@@ ra@@ eus had won his youngest six home games in the king class , including renowned clubs like Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , here also Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) . &quot;
&quot; but Bavaria , in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , didn &apos;t want to be the next victim . &quot;
&quot; they went cour@@ age@@ ously ran , but often too resour@@ c@@ eful to work with their offensive efforts . &quot;
&quot; the attacks were often initiated by the left @-@ wing Douglas Costa , which was rarely passed through the former Braunschwei@@ ger Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i . &quot;
Müller had more luck from the right when his flank was struck from the right half @-@ field in the left upper tor@@ ch .
&quot; in the 6@@ 7th minute , the world champion gave the possible 2 : 0 . &quot;
the best occasions in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .

* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk within a short time , write the researchers at the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system to trust citizens , &quot; &quot; stated the Commissioner Cec@@ ilia Mal@@ m@@ ström in the presentation . &quot;
the Swedish authorities intend to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US .
the German government announced support .
&quot; by TTIP , the world &apos;s largest free trade zone is to develop with 800 million people . &quot;
the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings indicate that the EU states and the US jointly select independent judges for a new investment court .
&quot; they should come to equal parts from the EU , the US and from third countries . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , there is also a second instance . &quot;
it would allow it to appeal against jud@@ g@@ ments .

&quot; the traditional arbit@@ ral tribun@@ als are critic@@ ised by opponents as a kind of parallel judicial system that allows companies to initiate damage to the tax@@ pay@@ ers , for@@ bid national laws , or impose a reduction in consumer and environmental standards . &quot;
&quot; in the first statements , anti @-@ TTIP organisations such as Camp@@ act designated the proposals of the European Commission as inadequate . &quot;
&quot; it has been critic@@ ised , above all , that it is not to apply for the already negoti@@ ated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) . &quot;

&quot; the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost taken by Stev@@ ens &apos;s lecture . &quot;

Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the frei@@ ghter of the Prime Minister
&quot; since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the prime minister is expected to be eag@@ erly a@@ waited &quot;
&quot; the new Labour leader Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n will give his debut at the prime minister , and for the first time to create David Cameron for the first time . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to put the first of his six pre @-@ mentioned questions shortly after lunch , whereby his performance is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour MPs . &quot;
he called &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could ski@@ p some sessions to leave their colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , because it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C annual meeting on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the Labour leader decided on Tuesday during the Sin@@ ai of the national an@@ them during a commem@@ oration party on the 75@@ th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , critic@@ ised by a number of T@@ ory MPs and is at the centre of several titles stories in the newspapers . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
&quot; a spokesman for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he would have been &quot; &quot; in respect of silence &quot; &quot; and he recognized the &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n Schatten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , Owen Smith , told the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the mon@@ archy should be aboli@@ shed . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve at Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they appeal to differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than one sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary Party originally supported him as a leader . &quot;
&quot; the political correspondent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also &quot; &quot; st@@ acking &quot; &quot; within Labour , while following Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements about the position of the European Union and the limitation in winning . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour made changes to remove all the idea of a limitation altogether .
&quot; Mr Smith , the shadow working and pensions minister , said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against government plans to reduce the limit of 26@@ ,000 £ to 23@@ ,000 £ . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader , David Cameron since he is T@@ ory leader , over the last decade on the Dis@@ patch box in parliament . &quot;
&quot; the Labour leader , who promised another policy approach , says he has given &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30.000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; Is@@ lington North MP has said that the prime minister &apos;s faction is too confron@@ t@@ ational , and that he will be able to concentrate on serious issues such as poverty , inequality , and the challenges for young people . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow economy minister will represent him if he does not participate , for example if Mr Cameron is on his way abroad . &quot;
&quot; he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally take the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the spokesman of the Lower House , addressed to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he was a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le Theater , &quot; which is often linked to the frei@@ ghter of the prime minister . &quot;
&quot; since it was first broadcast on television first in 1990 , the question@@ naire was considered as the most important barometer of the sentence of a driver and his leadership in the Unter@@ haus and his position among his parliamentary colleagues , although critics argue that they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and require far @-@ reaching reforms . &quot;

food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a ground @-@ breaking campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a $ 700 million Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; while Al@@ di prepared the opening of two sales centres and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA Super@@ markets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing on social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show . &quot;
&quot; I@@ GA dealers and suppliers jump on@@ board , with brands like ice maker S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples distributed in I@@ GA stores and store owners to sell the licensed tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Met@@ cash will be released further details of its defence strategy on September 29 when the wholes@@ aler of food , alcohol and devices will conduct its annual investor strategy day . &quot;
&quot; it is much on the game , since South Australia and Western Australia make almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA shop@@ pers and generate higher profit margins than Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the Eastern states . &quot;
&quot; buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in the Eastern states . &quot;

Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise as criticism for his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; in the recent assault on his friend Nick Kyr@@ gi@@ os and deserves praise for his own behaviour according to the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly .
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented du@@ os , which is always referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; became the not@@ orious confrontation of Kyr@@ gi@@ os with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters in the spotlight . &quot;
&quot; in a fier@@ y qualifying match in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon afterwards Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the arb@@ iter , whereby Har@@ rison cried out : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka should have hit Kyr@@ gi@@ os , and I should beat the child . &quot;
&quot; while he was recently seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis bat after a cra@@ mp@@ f carried a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ age is currently in Glasgow , in the competition with Sam Gr@@ oth around the second place behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ finals against the United Kingdom . &quot;
&quot; a thing about which I am quite en@@ vious , is the fact that Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn up a little in the dispute , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; he has broken a pun@@ cher when he lost due to a var@@ ic@@ ose in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a bat out of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the quite provoc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around himself , he has a great family around himself , and I think he was treated too severely . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 @-@ year old , he works very hard and he fits into the team and so on , he has never been a problem with the other players , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves it to be judged according to his own services . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to consider Kyr@@ gi@@ os on the important preliminary decision which starts on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right for everyone , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return to a long @-@ term fixed part in the team . &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team is completely focused on competition and not all around the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gi@@ os &#93; , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; he climb@@ s in the eyes of the public , and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions . &quot;

&quot; the emergency stand in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to tackle the crisis , so that they could block roads and accelerate asylum procedures . &quot;
&quot; the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans to build a barb@@ ed wire along his border to Romania , to stop the influ@@ x of migrants from the country , after having completed a fence at the Serbian border . &quot;
&quot; C@@ BS News correspondent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison races were used in the race , the barb@@ ed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a significant shortage of war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East to a substantial bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and the entry point to the European Union . &quot;
&quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insisted that most of the incoming economic refugees are seeking a better life , and not war refugees who claim protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 metre ( 13 feet ) tall Za@@ uns that the government has built along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also lay higher sentences for convicted human traffi@@ ckers . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government declar@@ es the emergency situation , &quot; said government spokesman Z@@ ol@@ tan Kov@@ acs Rep@@ or@@ neys in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must still agree on the deployment of the military , which is expected next week , but rep@@ orters of Associated Press have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for days . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , Land Security Advisor for Or@@ ban said that authorities had 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others were already penet@@ rated into the country . &quot;
&quot; they come up by damage the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of being accused of the new laws . &quot;
authorities are able to quickly repair the fence .
&quot; Hungarian officials closed on Tuesday morning , two of the seven border cros@@ sings with Serbia , after a train wagon with barb@@ ed wire to close the borders . &quot;
&quot; chaos surro@@ unds the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to deal with the data of people and pushing a crowd to push down there . &quot;
&quot; about 20 were able to enter , but thousands remained outside . &quot;
another group of migrants blocked the main highway link between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary .
election 2016 : Hillary Clinton &apos;s edge in front of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey
&quot; the former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her opposite to the ground . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; Vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is candidate for the presidential office , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic voters . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the start of the elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is determined which candidates will support them . &quot;
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their election than those of the other candidates .
&quot; since the C@@ BS News survey , Clinton lost a number of demographic groups , while S@@ anders scored some gains . &quot;
&quot; Clinton holds a major advantage in women and moder@@ ates , but these jumps have reduced . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s advantage in democratic voters under 50 years has escal@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same height . &quot;
&quot; but Clinton , however , has a great advantage over the older voters . &quot;
&quot; last month , Clinton stood before S@@ anders with two @-@ digit lead in the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group . &quot;
&quot; about half of the democratic voters of the local elections say that they would support Clinton , if they were nominated by the party . &quot;

&quot; data coverage : market sizes ( historic and forecasts ) , company shares , brand shares and distribution data . why buy this report ? &quot;
perhaps not surprising that Clin@@ tons &apos;s current supporters are especially excited about it .
the views are more mixed with those who currently don &apos;t support Clinton - just about one quarter would support them enthusias@@ tically .

Clinton &apos;s supporters will also mention Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
&quot; in addition , quot@@ ing of your company at the Spon@@ sors board of the conference &quot;
&quot; since the vice @-@ president has a potential for the presidential office in the balance sheet , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - although a third believes that he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic voters are asked to vote , who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top . &quot;
more than half of Clin@@ tons &apos;s followers say that Bi@@ den would be a second choice far from S@@ anders .

&quot; fifty @-@ five percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election , but this number of 78 per cent last month has declined . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den is a second in this measurement , but the percentage , which sees him as the &quot; &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; , &quot; has risen . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , at the question of what is more important for a candidate , Democratic voters are asking questions about the constitu@@ ency . &quot;
&quot; similar to the last month , no single democratic candidate or candidate for these elect@@ orate will be considered unacceptable . &quot;
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates bring good results in some important features among elect@@ ing voters of their party .
&quot; we consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den is best for the three candidates , best from hon@@ esty , while Clin@@ tons &apos;s strength is the leadership . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; in general Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den see ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; in all these measurements , about a quarter of democratic voters have no opinion of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; as questions about Hillary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the term of term as an external minister , most Democratic voters are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say they have not influenced their opinions . &quot;
but it is a different story in the American public .

&quot; the public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the email controversy had no impact on Clinton &apos;s general opinion , although 36 percent said that their opinion was even worse . &quot;
&quot; there are mainly Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say that their views of Clinton are worse . &quot;

five members of br@@ otherhood with the death of a Bar@@ uch College @-@ Ne@@ ul@@ ings
&quot; almost two years after a student died during a non@@ violent ritual in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , death charges were filed against five persons . &quot;
&quot; members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduc@@ tory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transportation to the hospital , which contributed to his death , told the police . &quot;
&quot; officials said that he had been charged with a 30 @-@ pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while he attempted to move over a frozen field to a target . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined about head@@ aches , then he fell un@@ conscious . &quot;
&quot; the members of the P@@ i Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood called not the calling number 911 , after Den@@ g was imp@@ ot@@ ent and allegedly waited an hour before they brought him into a hospital , so the police . &quot;
&quot; however , they had the time to switch to D@@ eng@@ s clothing , goo@@ gling his symptoms to goo@@ geln and Andy Men@@ g , to contact the national president of the Brotherhood for advice , said Poli@@ tk@@ ef Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point , the members , uten@@ sils were to hide and set the well @-@ being of the Brotherhood basically about that by Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ tk@@ ef Wagner . &quot;
&quot; he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died next morning to his injuries . &quot;
&quot; after an aut@@ op@@ sy @-@ report , Den@@ g was repeatedly fitted with bl@@ unt power injury to head , hull and th@@ igh@@ s . &quot;
&quot; many families have been destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies every year in the Sch@@ ik@@ anen since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ s family , in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot;
a County Grand Jury by Mon@@ roe recommended an indictment for the third grade for the first five members .
&quot; thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are charged with false attacks and formation of a criminal association . &quot;
&quot; we do not only want to be responsible for the persons involved , but if there is an organization that is officially or in@@ official - this is s@@ ank@@ ed , we will also be held accoun@@ table , &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;

this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; a rise in interest will come , and the domestic se will get lost , returns for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession . &quot;
we know .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will last and how long it will last .
&quot; in particular , the history of the economy offers only little guidance for the economy . &quot;
a recession came within just 11 months after the first interest rate increase and lasted 86 months .
&quot; the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when lifting the interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments react . &quot;
&quot; therefore , representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have so strongly emphasized that investors should not focus on raising interest rates , but rather on the period needed for norm@@ alization . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot;

&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot;
&quot; contrary to this , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights but still at a low level to lead to the sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many to fear . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that there will be no effects . &quot;
here is an overview of historical trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
&quot; as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases things for a while . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the increase occurs , the influence is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there is apparently a tendency that assets to be dic@@ ed 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which may reflect the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what is happening to interest increases in the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; the Bank said that the impact on the shares ten@@ ded later on the earnings cycle , and the return on return starts to decrease . &quot;
&quot; rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest rises often promote them . &quot;
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that didn &apos;t exist before and which could accelerate a recession . &quot;

&quot; interest increases in such a fragile economic backdrop could be ris@@ ky and throw the question &quot; &quot; whether it &apos;s different this time , &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; market participants all year round on an increase in interest in the F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday . &quot;

&quot; in our study , all Earth cycles of 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and in pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ing heights very quickly after the beginning of recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what is the worst recession in the observed phase . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest , which the F@@ ed has been waiting for the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months . &quot;

the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than with shares when they change their strategic course .
&quot; in bonds , the returns seem to change the direction as soon as the initial increase / decrease in the cycle is done . &quot;

&quot; the strateg@@ ists of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the rise in interest rates will lead to closer bonds between longer and shorter loans , and lead to a down@@ turn of the curve . &quot;
&quot; high interest rates often bring better earnings in such a climate , although &quot; we are still cau@@ tious to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , fixed @-@ income analyst at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest has risen , the earnings curve is fl@@ atter , lending has expanded and the vol@@ atility has risen - all features of the market , when the F@@ ed shar@@ pens their strategy . &quot;
&quot; in the large and whole , companies will benefit from the greater part of their business operations in the United States , which benefit when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive . &quot;

Saudi Arabia partly puts down the collapse of the huge Saudi Bin Laden group
&quot; the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured , after the crane collap@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; hundreds of Muslims gathered , when 29 of the victims were carried out by the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane collap@@ sed to Mec@@ ca &apos;s grandmother . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; the funeral proc@@ ession went over to the Holy Site , where only days before a building collap@@ sed through the veil of the mos@@ que and then on the bed . &quot;
&quot; the bodies were released for the funeral , when the Saudi King about the construction company of the family bin Laden because of the catastrophe that left 3@@ 94 injured , a san@@ ction imposed . &quot;
the bodies of 29 operators who were killed when a crane collap@@ sed by the Great Central mo@@ sch@@ ee Mec@@ cas were carried through the streets .
&quot; among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who had been on his first pilgrimage to the crane . &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
&quot; Saudi officials have already stated that the H@@ add@@ an to Mec@@ ca with thousands , who will continue to come to the city , will continue . &quot;
&quot; today , King Sal@@ man said that the bin Laden group would not have left the arm of the crane , when he was not used . &quot;
&quot; an Arab version of the decree was published by the State Saudi Press Agency , said that the bin Laden group was responsible for the collapse . &quot;
&quot; the English @-@ language service of the news agency did not reported this detail , but said that the company &apos;s leadership was banned abroad . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man laugh@@ ed to reveal what caused the fall of the sick , who fell into a courtyard of the grand mo@@ sch@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were in front of the H@@ add@@ an who later took place this month . &quot;
&quot; the bin Laden group issued no statements about the collapse of the sick , and their representatives were not available for a position . &quot;
the Royal Dec@@ ree also ad@@ ams the group because of non @-@ current security measures and because they did not cooperate with met@@ eor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mec@@ ca &apos;s big mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive construction project managed by the bin Laden group .

B &amp; Q boss says that the time of cheap East European tra@@ des@@ men is vor@@ acious

the number of qualified tra@@ des@@ men from Eastern Europe has stepped up
&quot; this means that 200 additional Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which are aimed at crafts@@ men , will be opened &quot;
&quot; at the same time , King@@ fis@@ her will close 60 B &amp; Q sales points nationwide . &quot;
&quot; by Ru@@ pert Steiner , City Chef &apos;s Cor@@ respon@@ dent , Daily Mail &quot;
&quot; it is claimed that British are their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favor of the use of qualified East European crafts@@ men who perform work in their home , &quot;
&quot; if you are sk@@ inned with a hammer or brush for painting walls , you seem to be a minority nowadays . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; V@@ é@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new managing director of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the tree markets chain , said that a great increase in number of qualified tra@@ des@@ men from Eastern Europe , which offer services to low prices , has meanwhile been over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
&quot; therefore , King@@ fis@@ her plans to open a 200 additional Scre@@ w@@ fix Shops , which can be set up to crafts@@ men and to close 60 sales points of B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , men over@@ weigh the men . &quot;
&quot; she said it was necessary to set up the growing demographic trends that have more female single households , more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches .
we need to move this stronger to a balance .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
women play a big role in the decision @-@ making process .
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the top of a British in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also been instruc@@ ted to reflect the same number of men and women in executive positions . &quot;
&quot; King@@ fis@@ her is almost the only company that occup@@ ies just 50 percent of the team with women , including his management and Chief Financial Officer . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue .
it was not difficult to find good women for our supervis@@ ory board .
King@@ fis@@ her announced a decrease in half @-@ year profit and sales after the group failed to shed the costs for closing the stores .

the current trial was adj@@ our@@ ned .
&quot; according to the Attorney General Robert Ri@@ ffel , in the preliminary investigation , the def@@ endants in the years 2006 to 2011 had money from club accounts that were allowed to disp@@ ose in their functions , for private purposes . &quot;

it should be negoti@@ ated at a later date .
&quot; in order to disc@@ lose the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence argued that the society was not a part of an asset . &quot;

&quot; at that time , we stood before the situation : do we keep the club further or locking us ? &quot; &quot; one of the def@@ endants told one of the def@@ endants , in the bread@@ th of the financial am@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; with his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ endants , he decided to take this task . &quot;
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have proposed money to put our life insur@@ ances as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; he said in the arrest . &quot;
&quot; the association has been agreed : you can manage the money freely , there must be no debt . &quot;

&quot; therefore , one part of the expenses inc@@ urred only years later , in 2003 when a plus was paid on the account , paid off . &quot;

&quot; why the pay@@ outs were not disclosed in detail , the judge asked . &quot;
&quot; the association has not interested in the details of the financial security , but it is important to have the right to be free of debt , so the answer . &quot;

&quot; the accused , who had been rep@@ uted , explained the def@@ endants . &quot;
&quot; this securities account ran on the name of the second def@@ endant , and was not known according to the association &apos;s statement . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot;

&quot; then he said , he thought that this was the best thing for the club . &quot;

firm of the Year for Trade@@ marks and Un@@ fair Competition Har@@ m@@ sen U@@ tes@@ cher Firm of the Year for M &amp; A No@@ err Firm of the Year for Media
this wire transfer was form@@ ulated as &quot; claim compensation . &quot;
&quot; why damages claim ? , judge and prosec@@ utor want to know . &quot;
&quot; the first def@@ endant declared that he did not agree with this form@@ ulation , because the association never existed . &quot;
&quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; You are all of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot;

time of deciding on interest rates for the US central bank
&quot; the world is watching when the US staff is coming together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time for almost a decade the interest rates are raised or not . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; it is a historic event , because it has seven years since the F@@ ed interest was on NU@@ LL . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation where a large central bank might leave the zero area and start a process of norm@@ alization of interest rates , &quot; &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , CEO at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the US economy is on a relatively good level , tri@@ llion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ro@@ uble outlook on global relations . &quot;
&quot; it has warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs indicate that the chances of such a move are good . &quot;
the decision should be announced at 8 : 00 CET on Thursday .

&quot; after the shooting and killing of his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he killed his colleagues later on the day , Sh@@ annon Lam@@ b wrote a note to say that it was &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; in the first murder and wanted &quot; &quot; he could not afford it , &quot; &quot; said authorities on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lam@@ b , lect@@ urer for geography and social science education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number against 10 : 00 on Monday morning &quot;
&quot; and said he had shot on someone , and a man killed . &quot;
Lam@@ b told the staff of the emergency call centre that police officers had to send polic@@ emen to his home .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I was struck by my wife yesterday evening . &quot; &quot; he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; is in the house , but it will probably be excited . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the c@@ aller after his name , but he did not give him . &quot;
Lam@@ b gave no explanation for his shots .
&quot; as police are concerned , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written notice of Lam@@ b , 45 which said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted , I could undo it . &quot;
&quot; I loved Amy , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
&quot; after writing the note , Lam@@ b drove 300 miles to Delta State University where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , killed before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen killed him . &quot;
&quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lam@@ b and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ b idea . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday , the Lam@@ b believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss also had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday , there &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was described by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said she had been married for about seven years as a &quot; good man . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss would have a daughter who is 19 , and she is &quot; &quot; destroyed &quot; &quot; on the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss was her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online at home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss . &quot;
&quot; Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog named Light@@ ning , met with Lam@@ b for about three years . &quot;
&quot; she wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; said Know@@ les &quot;
&quot; the police said Lam@@ b had called relatives at a certain point on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; he doesn &apos;t go to jail . &quot;
&quot; as a polic@@ eman on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later in that night , Lam@@ b drove his car to the side , fled to the forest and killed himself with a shot . &quot;
&quot; in spring 2015 , Lam@@ b received a doctor@@ ate from the Delta State University as his life law on the university &apos;s website . &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United can &apos;t play for months due to double frac@@ ture
&quot; in the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven , Luke Sha@@ w suffered double frac@@ ture of his right leg . &quot;
&quot; while this made the left external def@@ ender to we@@ ep and exclu@@ de him for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al won &apos;t hope that Sha@@ w can play again in this season . &quot;
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by Hé@@ ctor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year old Sha@@ w was embedded in the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before he was brought to hospital .
&quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; he has a double leg frac@@ ture and is located in the hospital . &quot;
he will be transferred tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated in Manchester .
&quot; it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it is very hard and then fantastic , and then it happens . &quot;
&quot; in the locker room , he had an oxygen mask . &quot;
he we@@ pt .
&quot; I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , it takes six months , and it will not play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope that he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to escape a red card and the suspension of a penalty .

it is never the intention of our players to hurt your opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ as Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; he is very hard because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear it is a very serious injury , it &apos;s not good , &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball , which was in a different direction , so it looked as if he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said , &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be . &quot;

&quot; it is one thing that all parents learn soon : if your child loves a book , it will not take long until you know it almost completely . &quot;
it is because you are perhaps David Cameron .
&quot; when he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to name his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , which was released in 1971 , decided by Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of the company Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children because it always seems to have a picture or message we have missed so far . &quot;
&quot; all beautiful and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron allegedly describes the story of the book , instead describes an abstra@@ ction of the movie version of 2012 , adding new characters and details to extend the fairly short original text . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the emb@@ raced town of Th@@ ought @-@ Vil@@ le , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted , hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , hoping to see a real tree . &quot;
&quot; a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , hopes to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he admitted to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar to the story of the book . &quot;
&quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times in a row in a row . &quot;
a Down@@ ing Street spokes@@ woman said that the text was likely to have come from Cameron &apos;s Elect@@ oral Office .
&quot; Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s staff , but there was no further direct comments . &quot;
&quot; Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult &quot;
&quot; to encounter Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if one sees the cad@@ res that England has chosen for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my map . &quot;
I would not exclu@@ de a down@@ ward win .
&quot; A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks Page is possibly less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in the batt@@ ing list , and the community spirit is strong ; they won &apos;t carry sc@@ ars of 2012 , only a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball develops Mo@@ een Ali as Spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown quantity of test level , is an option for the attack . &quot;
this message : Adam Ly@@ th leaves out of the England @-@ Test @-@ Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
&quot; the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th , of course , is to be hard to analyze as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire . &quot;
&quot; with his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but tough reality is that Kri@@ cket@@ eers are based on results . &quot;
&quot; there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to nom@@ ination , there - and I told this - players are their own best selection . &quot;
&quot; a long time ago , one could have extended the run of Ly@@ te , but he had control over his own fate . &quot;
&quot; if he hopefully suggests further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance will come . &quot;
&quot; the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ li@@ ss praised his attitude , even if he did not deliver such good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team man . &quot;
the question of how much time a test drummer receives to set his mark is difficult .
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and down@@ wards .
&quot; the only accus@@ ation that you can lift up was that England first set up Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form , but this lost chance is now in the past . &quot;
&quot; Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a drummer I guess . &quot;
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket@@ player what we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he scored 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge place that met us very much .
&quot; he must have at least the same chances as those before him , but this depends on the team position in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea of putting mos@@ ques aside to Cook , which would bring an extra spin @-@ bow@@ ler and receive four Qui@@ cks , appeared on , and I did nothing about it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ handed has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious circle of cri@@ cket players . &quot;
&quot; County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire has perhaps not done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is number 3 for them , and there is no big difference . &quot;
my former te@@ amm@@ ate Justin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he joined the op@@ ener in 2001 .
he has managed three hundred R@@ uns immediately and did not look back .
&quot; Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes in the ca@@ vern as back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited engagement with him he has impressed me as a young man . &quot;
&quot; people may see statistics on - average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no big number of backup spi@@ ders who raise their hands and the train@@ ers have chosen themselves for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the team , England has made some smart additions to the trainer . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dene , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup . &quot;
&quot; he is one of the nic@@ est guys of the game , who will bring a wealth of experiences , since he has played under all conditions and against all the attacks . &quot;
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and powerful deployment into the setup .
&quot; I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind in the changing rooms , even if the messages are in line with the previously ch@@ aired . &quot;
&quot; the team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , won &apos;t be used at the One @-@ Day@@ er , R@@ oot received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it . &quot;
&quot; some will not agree , but coaches and team mates do not determine the timet@@ able . &quot;
&quot; and you have to remember that , as with the players , their jobs depend on the results . &quot;
such decisions are not taken lightly .
the Bre@@ x@@ it camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = exit from Britain from the EU ) could win on Zul@@ u if the economy up to 2017 in a no@@ isy device
&quot; David Cameron &apos;s un@@ wi@@ dened re @-@ negoti@@ ated strategy to keep Britain in the EU will get deeper into trouble with every day , even without the choice of the brilliant Jeremy &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n leads to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , who viol@@ ates Europe on Tuesday . &quot;
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ age .
&quot; a European diplomat friend said that some member states , so deeply ent@@ angled in various crises , as the EU is now and not always out of their own debt , Britain &apos;s self @-@ created agenda with split conc@@ essions and disrup@@ tive changes that they usually do not want . &quot;
&quot; in Bri@@ ghton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting , that it doesn &apos;t like it if they je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze social protection . &quot;
we could also call Dave and Georges Sel@@ fie @-@ Agenda .
&quot; Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb on summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capit@@ als , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they are allies for reforms . &quot;
it &apos;s always about me .
&quot; my European friend who was looking outside the EU &apos;s tent outside the EU tent - &quot; &quot; Let us not alone with France , &quot; &quot; says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short @-@ sigh@@ ted ministers and officials have come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we stay or go . &quot;
&quot; Angela Merkel &apos;s cau@@ tious ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before it looks bad for her , like th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
France &apos;s François Hollande looks at his re @-@ election or his substitution in 2017 .
he is also a f@@ ading force .
&quot; Poland may soon have a nationalist right government , Spain a lef@@ tist . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to imagine that they are going to pull out a leg to help the Sel@@ fie @-@ Brit@@ ons , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something that they do not want because most of the similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have . &quot;
&quot; thus , perhaps some such ministers may not deliberately plan on helpful notes , entirely in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s refer@@ end@@ ums 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my friend suspects . &quot;
&quot; the new trial was a &quot; &quot; P@@ lei@@ te &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Great Britain has won nothing of the new trial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Europeans know how common the Fle@@ et Street can be at its cost and which EU scep@@ tics is the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the Pres@@ seb@@ ar@@ one , as they were inspired by Tony Ben@@ n in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 . &quot;
&quot; they can be weak@@ ened to Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ euro opportunity , who has made himself a name as a &quot; &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade @-@ Ban@@ ana &quot; &quot; Brussels correspondent in the early 90 @-@ he years . &quot;
&quot; in all his rever@@ ence , Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies . &quot;
&quot; the Med@@ ley was part of the tax @-@ für@@ cht@@ ende @-@ Sch@@ ur@@ ken , Tel@@ ephone @-@ hack@@ ing aliens and the pseu@@ do non @-@ Indi@@ ans who have the most of our major newspapers . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Tony Blair thought about her but noticed that when you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage you better get ban@@ anas to di@@ stract him instead of going to his lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ iri@@ ans than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s refer@@ end@@ ums , because Blair had rejected the principle of the un@@ adopted Constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which then opened a back@@ door . &quot;

&quot; but the nice Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly cl@@ aps on Monday in West@@ minster - I told him that he didn &apos;t need time for me - seems in danger , Neil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cott Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 80 @-@ th year , an error then and today . &quot;
&quot; it can take a while but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa he has left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position on Europe is - I like it kind of - in the development .
he says that we should remain in a re@@ formed EU .
&quot; well , most people outside U@@ ki@@ ps &apos;s traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ield tendency and the wil@@ dest pleasure of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engli@@ sh@@ ism can certainly say yes . &quot;
&quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and television this week , when the boy sc@@ outs fought in him , did not admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the provoc@@ ative John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell was a bad idea . &quot;
&quot; it reminded me of the 70 @-@ year @-@ old when his old father tried to be il@@ loyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues , without going too far and to lose his job job . &quot;
Hil@@ ary &apos;s struggle was even more attractive .
&quot; but to fight to &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his fellow workers and dep@@ u@@ ties after all the reports on Monday evening . &quot;
&quot; whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to mediate - remember that he even touched me - News Dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ ine remains important in the age of TV around the clock , and in front of all things in the Stru@@ del of Social Media , a bro@@ od of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal . &quot;
&quot; it is right to give Cameron a free card for Europe , which allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly thinks so .
&quot; but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ity to EU membership - in line with its Benn@@ ite siege economy , its anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the little difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes . &quot;
&quot; as with its ambig@@ u@@ ities to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign to exit - will foreign diplom@@ ats be obliged to try , in particular , to find a sense of their superi@@ ors at home . &quot;
&quot; why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have a susp@@ icious vot@@ er - to make conc@@ essions to the British , if this is all sen@@ sel@@ ess ? &quot;
&quot; the United States are already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded by the British Influ@@ ence Security Forum on Monday . &quot;
experts critic@@ ise Public Health England Report on E @-@ cigarettes
&quot; claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigarettes are less harmful than smoking originated from a meeting of 12 people , partly with links to tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot;
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( PH@@ E ) in their report on e @-@ cigarettes .
&quot; PH@@ E published the &quot; Fundam@@ ental Report &quot; last month , and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
&quot; a leading article in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month took the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily wind@@ y basis , &quot; based on PH@@ E &apos;s most important conclusion . &quot;
two more researchers are writing in BM@@ J and asked whether the claims are based on stone or sand .
&quot; Martin McK@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epi@@ de@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of efficacy . &quot;
&quot; they said that the public expects that &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; on a detailed examination of evidence and modelling . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this statement from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for a multi @-@ level decision analysis ( M@@ CD@@ A ) to conduct their opinions on the damage from different ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summari@@ zed in a research report . &quot;

&quot; he also signed the references of BA@@ T to public health in a sustainability report , they said . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants at the meeting said to receive funding from an e @-@ cigarettes manufacturer , but not the funding he was supposed to have received by Philip Morris International after reports before the tobacco company Philip Morris International . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for selecting the members of the board are not delivered , but include several well @-@ known E @-@ cigarettes champions , some of which also provide sector financing in paper . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
&quot; at the meeting , the tobacco line of PH@@ E took part . &quot;
firm of the Year for Trade@@ marks and Un@@ fair Competition Har@@ m@@ sen U@@ tes@@ cher Firm of the Year for M &amp; A No@@ err Firm of the Year for Media
&quot; however , none of these connections or limitations will be discussed in the PH@@ E report . &quot;
firm of the Year for Trade@@ marks and Un@@ fair Competition Har@@ m@@ sen U@@ tes@@ cher Firm of the Year for M &amp; A No@@ err Firm of the Year for Media
&quot; Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , Director for Health and Well @-@ being at PH@@ E , said that it was already re@@ acting to the claims of BM@@ J before . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; E @-@ cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second lifel@@ ong smo@@ ker dies in his addiction .
&quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigarettes are low compared to this , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; PH@@ E has the clear obligation to inform the public about what evidence shows and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; almost 8@@ 0,000 people annually die in a disease with regard to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System 2 billion a year . &quot;
&quot; due to the clear preference of current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fra@@ ction of damage caused by smoking , we comply with our national competence . &quot;
&quot; BBC should give up East@@ En@@ ders , says former boss of Channel 4 &quot;
&quot; the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial rivals would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK channels .
&quot; he critici@@ zed the BBC for placing public @-@ legal programs , which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in hard @-@ controversial tim@@ ings against the most popular shows of their rivals and broad@@ cast@@ ers like BB@@ C4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC general director , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations , Johnson said he had tried to contact the BBC for six years in his time at Channel 4 without success . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sends , which would also be shown clearly by un@@ subsidi@@ zed rivals , &quot; said Johnson to the BBC &apos;s Ober@@ haus communication committee on the future of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the broadcasting fee , which I don &apos;t think about a good idea in medium or long term , it should at least be on programs that do not make or commission . &quot;
they send The Voice into a first @-@ class time window because they want to achieve as broad support for their future .
&quot; the idea that otherwise nobody would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridicul@@ ous , it &apos;s non@@ sense . &quot;
Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax would be financed without subsidies .
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions . &quot;
&quot; to be honest , other channels would give their right arm for it . &quot;
I have to see how this should be public @-@ right television .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC at all .
&quot; Johnson , a business@@ man for series , channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is to blame for the ambi@@ tions of people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on the BBC &apos;s most popular broad@@ casts include the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows shows like East@@ En@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the rather public broad@@ caster N@@ ic programs should go to BB@@ C4 , where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they fulfil their tasks , and they can argue if they have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that nobody has seen . &quot;
they put them into a time window where nobody wanted to see them ever .
&quot; the broadcast fee said the committee : &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can obtain the best value . &quot;
&quot; of course , you think all , we all think that you get a great value for 150 £ a year , but for people who are a lot of money for £ 150 , ask me if that &apos;s true because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein who also said before the committee on Tuesday demanded that the BBC should review their Rei@@ th@@ ian mission , &quot; &quot; to educ@@ ate , educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain . &quot;
&quot; he said , only little by BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % in the radio - and it was supposed to change in the public broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada for example . &quot;
&quot; on the question of part@@ n@@ ering said El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television will be shown , and engage with the commercial channels to make everything available online . &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ em@@ at@@ odes change the direction at the moment in which they are be@@ amed with sound impul@@ ses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by waves of sound waves .
&quot; the tiny n@@ em@@ at@@ odes change the direction at the moment , in which they have heard high frequencies for human hearing at high frequencies to be heard . &quot;
impul@@ ses work by switching from mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultrasound waves .
HZ@@ I researchers discover control centres in Y@@ ers@@ inia bacteria that initiate infection processes only at body temperature
&quot; researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ Gene@@ tics , where ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; S@@ re@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the deep brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that canc@@ els electrical impul@@ ses into the brain of people for treating the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; thread worms are generally not responding to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani found that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid containing micro@@ sc@@ opic air bub@@ bles . &quot;
&quot; the bub@@ bles , found out , ampli@@ fy the ultrasound waves , which then penet@@ rate into the worms . &quot;
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves work on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and found in the membran@@ es of some of the worms .
&quot; sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells , which they are assigned , such a report Nature Communications . &quot;
&quot; to create ultr@@ asonic controlled n@@ em@@ at@@ odes , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ones carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels . &quot;
&quot; when he uses ultr@@ asonic to the changed creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ waves and transmit into the worms , where they turn the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground@@ breaking tool that allows scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with impul@@ ses of light . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light , which has to be sent to an optical fiber to the desired position in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultrasound waves can happen un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent into the brain from above on the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily susp@@ end the targeted human neur@@ ons temporarily for the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added . &quot;

&quot; V@@ C@@ CP Creative Director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence , which reig@@ ned around the advertisement for the trade fair - through a lease of the Ex@@ Ce@@ L calendar - and thought : &quot; let &apos;s give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot;
&quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic banner @-@ like company advertisement , but &quot; through the blu@@ ep@@ rint with bright colours and animation it remains stronger . &quot;
&quot; they have made a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture devices at the trade fair , &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Amnesty . &quot;
what we need now is a progress of the British government and the guarantee that torture devices are not illegal before our door@@ step .
perhaps the most creative art around the arms fair comes from the area within Ex@@ Ce@@ L where exhibitors are f@@ ing@@ ering fantastic eu@@ ph@@ em@@ istic products .

eight Golden Rules for Life in Student Resi@@ dents
&quot; 11 years ago I moved as self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old in a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ et and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se sm@@ iles of those I have anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , long @-@ lasting complaints about others . &quot;
most of what I have learned can be distill@@ ed into eight simple rules .
&quot; the entry of students &apos; homes ranges from slightly annoying , up to absolutely terri@@ fying . &quot;
&quot; it is temp@@ ting to tie : people tell wh@@ ence you are coming , whether and where you have taken the sab@@ bath year , where you stand in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; frank@@ ly said Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in Ernst , guys , it &apos;s only a yeast extract HA@@ HA@@ HA , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - Ask questions and show interest .
&quot; it direc@@ ts the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like in contrast to those with whom you would not speak , even if your eyel@@ ashes were burned in fire and these fire extingu@@ ish@@ ers would be . &quot;
let people .
&quot; the rooms of people often turn into drinks recipes , film @-@ night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people attract and rep@@ ose their under@@ wear . &quot;
related subject ( s ) : do not remember to start at university with a relationship
intro@@ ver@@ ted received a rough treatment at the university .
&quot; your room should be a refuge , but many student resi@@ dences form a space @-@ to @-@ space bo@@ omer@@ ang culture that can be friendly and socially and can lead to life @-@ long friendship . &quot;
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
&quot; nothing in the culture allows you to say , &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to continue , but you have to go away so that I get the energy back that I have consumed for the interaction with you . &quot;
&quot; try to sense when a fellow student is exhausted , and send him an SMS instead . &quot;
apro@@ pos anchor : do it .
a guy in my student resi@@ dences had the idea that a not closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
&quot; posts : 2,@@ 363 Date of registration : Feb 16th 2007 &quot;
&quot; so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
home @-@ made treats offer is a good way to close friend@@ ships .
their ro@@ omm@@ ates feel obliged to enter@@ tain and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
&quot; of course , this depends on whether you are an independent b@@ aker . &quot;
&quot; bad mixed cl@@ umps of flour , sugar and fat make people feel asleep when you anchor . &quot;
steal food is a common crime in student resi@@ dences .
&quot; of course , the cla@@ ws of chicken is theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too ? &quot;
check that with the milk owner .
&quot; the chances are good that they say to serve themselves , even if they cook inside . &quot;
&quot; if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying and you have my compassion - but try to deal more balanced deal than my ro@@ omm@@ ate , that added to her milk a pur@@ ge to pun@@ ish thi@@ eves . &quot;
she is now in prison .
you should not make any noise that keeps people from sleep or work .
&quot; it is not only about being a decent person , but that you belong in the true sense of the pro@@ verb to the people living in the glass house . &quot;
&quot; a girl on my hall@@ way asked her neighbors , whether they make them something , drum &amp; bass slightly more qui@@ eter than three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had an exam in the morning . &quot;
she re@@ acted with even more lu@@ cra@@ tive music .
&quot; when they finally stopped at 5 p.m. , she kindly allowed her neighbours to sleep two hours before she left her own music , shut her door and beg@@ ged herself to her three @-@ hour test . &quot;
would it not be romantic if your future sp@@ ouse would random@@ ly integrate into the same student residence ?
&quot; on the other hand , it wouldn &apos;t be too deep embarrass@@ ing if you hold a ro@@ omm@@ ate for your future marriage partner to get rid of them , and they will be able to see them every day , and perhaps you can see how they move all together friends to themselves ? &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart goes on its own paths - but if a hot ro@@ omm@@ ate definitely isn &apos;t your future marriage partner , try at least to talk to your under@@ belly a little reason . &quot;
&quot; in the exciting moment when you notice that someone has his keys in his un@@ locked room , the border between a Ul@@ k and Mob@@ bing is fin@@ er than it seems . &quot;
&quot; a good laugh is funny , but it takes only moments until he becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
&quot; by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson on safety , you never fail to wash someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo . &quot;
&quot; close your door , and put your key into a glass of water that you then put into the freezer - but you don &apos;t need to stap@@ le their pos@@ sessions at the ceiling no more than twice . &quot;

thousands of refugees are pushing for the housing market .
the entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly the living space can be created : he builds ter@@ raced houses for refugees in a project .
&quot; Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees are pushing for the housing market . &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass housing in containers or gymn@@ as@@ tics does not have sustainability .
because people stay in a big part here .
&quot; in view of the influ@@ x of refugees , we also need sufficient housing for the next few decades . &quot;
&quot; a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey ter@@ raced house is the solution . &quot;

it eases integration .
this is different if one under@@ scores the people in residential blocks .
&quot; each of the six houses , which are built in the pilot project , consists of three housing units for four asylum seek@@ ers each . &quot;
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , one bathroom , a kitchen and a common room . &quot;
&quot; it can be that many refugees will say , it &apos;s peace again , I go back . &quot;
the house is heated by electricity . 1 bathroom with shower . 1 toilet . freezer . microwave oven . dish washer . wood@@ burning stove . stereo set . CD . digital satellite dish . DVD . high chair . washing machine . tum@@ bler . sauna . whirlpool (
how high are the costs ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : the price for 160 square meters of space per house amounts to 184 000 Euro , without land . &quot;
that is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction took six months .
this is appropriate .
do the construction regulations be complicated ?
Gil@@ dner : I have drawn up my project correctly .
&quot; in particular , it always makes the im@@ pending dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ tion worthy of special construction and the space regulations . &quot;
gr@@ us@@ el@@ ig .
&quot; it is still under@@ p@@ inned , who creates three apartments in a ter@@ raced house needs at least three pit@@ ches . &quot;
only in the cities the square is missing .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers do not have cars .
how did the residents react to their ter@@ raced house project ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : there were , those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
this is definitely not true .
but do you not ag@@ grav@@ ate the competitive struggle for affordable apartments ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : true , we had a construction boom in Germany over the last five years , but built luxury apartments that hardly can afford to afford . &quot;
&quot; my project has the message , even the normal people need housing . &quot;
&quot; not only refugees , but also the only educ@@ ating mother or the Ger@@ ing@@ fel@@ dt . &quot;

&quot; witnesses are searching for the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23 : 45 , three young men were walking from Bad So@@ den to Sal@@ mün@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; one from the group , a 17 @-@ year old Afghan , followed by the police with his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him . &quot;
at that time the group was at the height of the b@@ ft petrol station .
&quot; on the premises of the gas station , there were also three persons . &quot;
one of these men now scre@@ amed the young people and struck this with the fist .
the victim suffered a nas@@ al break and bleeding strongly from the nose .
&quot; when his two friends ha@@ sted and appe@@ aled to the ra@@ ckets , he left his victim . &quot;
&quot; from his friends , the injured young man was brought home . &quot;
the perpet@@ rators followed the group with a passenger car to their home and drove over there several times .
&quot; when you didn &apos;t see the car , the last went before the building to smoke a cigarette . &quot;
there he was once again attacked by the bat and another male person .
&quot; under the aid of a whi@@ stle , one nail on the face and the th@@ ig@@ h of the victim . &quot;
the injured had to be brought to hospital for medical care .
&quot; so far , only one v@@ ague perpet@@ rator is present . &quot;

Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; now the border controls are going up to our southern border , &quot; &quot; said Interior Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain parallel to this .
&quot; as before , it is clear that everyone who wants to apply for asylum can also &quot; &quot; naturally &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of people stand in the for@@ eg@@ round .
&quot; however , it is clear that there are clear signals , &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; people need to know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows , also not about the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot;
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia weak@@ ens &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia refuses
&quot; the Croatian government had previously reported that Slovenia would continue to travel in the direction of Austria and Germany , and could also establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees . &quot;
&quot; in this way , this Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar did not see Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely unacceptable , &quot; Slovenia will intensi@@ fy the surveillance of the border - especially to Hungary . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already severely controlled . &quot;

&quot; as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already tried to pass over the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d in eastern Croatia to avoid registration . &quot;
the Croatian police were able to attack them in nearby corn fields .
&quot; according to local media , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik has repeatedly hit police vehicles with new refugees . &quot;
&quot; it acts mainly for Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children . &quot;
even rescue services and the Red Cross have already been deployed .
&quot; in the coming days , his country with about 4,000 refugees , said Interior Minister Rank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo on the Maced@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border , were diver@@ ted towards Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; however , the government in Belgrade , however , denied that it was the people to propose certain routes : &quot; neither can we , nor do we do this , &quot; it said . &quot;
&quot; according to the media reports , there was a first bus with about 50 refugees in the Serbian border town of Si@@ d , in the course of the day further buses would be expected . &quot;
&quot; about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
the in@@ mates were traveling throughout the night of the Maced@@ onian border by Serbia throughout the night .
&quot; we have heard that Hungary has admitted , so the police said that we should go here , &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the postpon@@ ement of the former Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary could indeed come to a somewhat further west @-@ lying route . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive ways to limit border control &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic stressed that his country was prepared for the case of a strong influ@@ x of refugees related plans for possible shooting situations .
&quot; he did not call him , but he pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; &quot; comprehensive ways of border control . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area , we conduct strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area . &quot;
&quot; Slovenia belongs to this since 2007 , the EU partners have a good testimony to the country since then , as far as the standard of border controls is concerned . &quot;
&quot; on the Serbian side , there are about 300 refugees behind the Hungarian border fence . &quot;
&quot; according to Belgrade media reports , they would have spent the past night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cros@@ sings Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed . &quot;
&quot; if the remaining refugees want to go on to the Croatian border , it is still unclear . &quot;
the Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic tried to calm down the debate over alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed .
it would not be a very high number of refugees at this time .
&quot; one could not say whether they would continue their journey across Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot;

&quot; Fed@@ Ex results mixed , financial outlook for 2016 lowered &quot;
&quot; Fed@@ Ex reports dis@@ appo@@ inting results for the last quarter , and the supply grid lowered its profit outlook for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its floor transport service . &quot;

&quot; at this point last year , Fed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season . &quot;
the share fell over 2.5 percent in pre @-@ market trading 45 minutes before opening on Wednesday .
&quot; Fed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a profit from $ 10,@@ 40 and $ 10@@ ,90 in the financial year that ends in the next May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous forecasts . &quot;

&quot; data coverage : market sizes ( historic and forecasts ) , company shares , brand shares and distribution data . why buy this report ? &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company brings solid earnings if one considers weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
&quot; the plans for the holiday jobs were announced a day later than the rival UPS announced that plans to employ 90@@ ,000 to 95@@ ,000 additional workers , about the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the quarter , which ended on August 31 , Fed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; earnings per share stood at 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just below the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of Z@@ acks Investment Research consult@@ ed analysts . &quot;
sales rose by 5 percent to $ 12.@@ 3 billion .
six of Z@@ acks asked analysts expected to expect $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
&quot; in recent years , Fed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in international priority shipping , which brought sales in its unit express shipping to stagn@@ ation . &quot;
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results of Fed@@ Ex ground .
&quot; in the last quarter sales rose by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance . &quot;
&quot; the Express Unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices , while the result was lower due to higher labour costs in the freight business . &quot;
&quot; in the pre@@ market trading , about an hour before the opening , the Fed@@ Ex stocks rose by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , they closed 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 . &quot;
&quot; on their most expected conference in the years , Federal Reserve will spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras Mah@@ agon@@ i table to decide whether it is time to lift the Leit@@ z@@ ins for the first time for almost a decade . &quot;

the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed chairman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and their colleagues should set up the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a two @-@ fold mandate from Congress : maxim@@ ising US employment and prices here stable .
&quot; but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ even third mandate : financial stability . &quot;
&quot; and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict them . it will be announced on Thursday , whether the US economy is ready to be we@@ an@@ ed by the unprecedented incentive by the close to zero current interest rate since the end of 2008 . &quot;
&quot; although most data in the economy show that they grow solid , the recent turbul@@ ences on global financial markets could be anxious to rein@@ force this vol@@ atility by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and whether it is only a quarter percentage point . &quot;
&quot; * Pinpoint growth sectors and identify factors driving change ; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase the rate of interest , the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which is uns@@ ett@@ led by itself the financial market . &quot;
&quot; about half of econom@@ ists questioned recently by Bloom@@ berg , predicted a rise in interest rates this week . &quot;
&quot; however , the financial markets anticip@@ ate a decline in the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance of an increase . &quot;
&quot; this points to a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the set , unless the strateg@@ ists will alle@@ vi@@ ate the blow by promising a further increase . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial Average product jumped 2@@ 28,@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 . &quot;
firm of the Year for Compliance Audi@@ ts and Investig@@ ations Gibson Dun@@ n &amp; Cr@@ ut@@ cher Firm of the Year for Corporate G@@ lade Michel Wirt@@ z Firm of the Year for Disp@@ ute Resolution
&quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would lift the pro@@ positions at that time , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if it does , &quot; she would have to go very far to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot;
&quot; other experts argued that an increase in interest would calm the financial markets , because they would remove uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act . &quot;
&quot; even before a month , the F@@ ed seemed good ways to increase the set by 0.25 percentage points this month , the first little step in a slow ti@@ ghtening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the United States . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ellen had said in spring and in early summer , in spite of the dis@@ comfor@@ ts of liber@@ als that more economic progress would be needed , an increase in the sentence . &quot;

wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; although inflation was constantly running under the annual target of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed Represent@@ atives said that the main reason is the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macroeconomics . &quot;
&quot; but the financial markets all over the world sent to the end of last month , after China had de@@ valued its currency . &quot;
&quot; the Dow Jones Industrial Average Value fell by more than 16 % in May by more than 16 % , as investors feared that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would th@@ rot@@ tle global growth . &quot;
&quot; the market has recovered somewhat in this month , whereby the Dow falls by almost 10 % below the height of May . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; if events on the financial markets and news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks would not have occurred , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liners , Senior Research Fellow at the U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US staff . &quot;
now he assumes that she will wait at least one month to get the impact better .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data that describe developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liners . &quot;
&quot; the health of the world economy is none of the main concern of the F@@ ed , therefore it should not be included in the decision @-@ making process . &quot;
&quot; but in the end , the F@@ ed Monetary Authority has become the world . &quot;
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .

&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ t@@ win@@ ed , the F@@ ed representatives can be expected that they will not only monitor developments elsewhere , but also with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy . &quot;
&quot; its decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of over@@ reaction on financial market movements that are apparently not associated with the economic fundam@@ entals . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Open Market Committee , a member of the Federal Open Market Committee , applied for an increase in interest rates , made decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to lower its interest rates by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; despite a limited recogni@@ zable impact on growth in the U.S. , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one year later , the F@@ ed representatives made these cuts . &quot;

&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates , which give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research suggests that higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adaptation that mothers should do . &quot;

&quot; at the &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; it was the permission for a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot;
&quot; therefore a &quot; &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ center first and roof over@@ laying &quot; &quot; should be erected . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehen@@ sibility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; it was again about the roof pitch that is required for energetic reasons - unlike in the building plan - it is supposed to lie below ten degrees . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the volume of the hall is significantly reduced . &quot;
&quot; a &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan for the roof inc@@ lin@@ ation does not allow &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; - whereby the Bern@@ ward municipal council usually drives more restri@@ ctive in liber@@ ating applications . &quot;

they came both by bus and with ta@@ xis in the Serbian border town of Si@@ d .
&quot; immediately after their arrival , they had tried to reach the green border to Croatia . &quot;

&quot; after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria is only a few refugees . &quot;
the country also has reinforced its border controls .
&quot; in order to keep the 20,000 migrants still in the country , but still in the country . &quot;
&quot; in Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany . &quot;
the train from there to Germany was stopped at the German authorities on the morning .
&quot; in Frei@@ las@@ sing , smaller groups of refugees arrived on foot regularly . &quot;
the mayor visited &quot; Gest@@ rand@@ ete &quot; on the border
&quot; we were busy at the bridge on Sunday with the clearing , when there were ten people with travel agents at the entrance of the tent , &quot; says W@@ ern@@ stein mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; tourists , they wanted to go to Pass@@ au by train . &quot;
&quot; because Germany had surprisingly stopped the railway traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the refugee stream , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein concluded , &quot; &quot; Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and the frames together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars on the border to the Nah@@ e Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; prior to that , we had the un@@ trusted guests only once , with a snack and drinks . &quot;
&quot; we have said right , we bring them to Pass@@ au by car . &quot;
&quot; that was of course for us , &quot; says Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview . &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man did not let himself take a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; that made us very happy , &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday evening in Wels from an ICE train to Pass@@ au , the str@@ anded train passengers had moved to Pass@@ au on Sunday evening , after the short notice that the railway traffic was set to Germany , but still on the border . &quot;

&quot; the bridge festival connected with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday , before a two brid@@ ging run sports - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen . &quot;
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án is now sending further Z@@ ig@@ mill@@ an to us is a logical conclusion of an apparent policy :
&quot; instead of helping R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke at the establishment of structures that ensure humanity , our Chancellor has officially opened up the position of the Hungarian government in the dun@@ st of the National Socialism . &quot;
&quot; this policy is not only the Austri@@ ans , who are now confronted with cha@@ otic conditions in the border regions . &quot;
&quot; also the P@@ oultry will have to find that the &quot; &quot; learned land &quot; &quot; that she has been invited and welcomed is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; it will become a great challenge , given the ongoing flood of refugees and the approaching winter , with us decent conditions for protection seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; and it will be even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;

Konrad has to do all his hands with the refugee camp .
Christian Konrad is used to have his word weight .
the government has deployed the former powerful Raiff@@ eisen bank@@ ers to place qu@@ arti@@ s for the thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first recording centre Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already got a grip on Konrad .
&quot; we have no homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he told his first success . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the number of refugees who arrived on Monday to Austria was without a big fuss , Konrad and praised the organisational &quot; master performance . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of Interior said , on the other hand , of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in total , Konrad was reck@@ oned with a demand of 85@@ .000 quart@@ ets in the he@@ ur@@ igen year . &quot;
&quot; in order to meet the number , more than 3@@ 5,000 accommodations have to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 shall provide the federal government . &quot;
&quot; if there are more refugees , we can create it . &quot;
&quot; but it is not a barrel without ground , &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot;
&quot; with the state officials , he has already taken talks . &quot;
&quot; they would have assured him , even for the coming refugees of Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ ere . &quot;

&quot; his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in campaign mode . &quot;
the K@@ all@@ stadt Simone Wen@@ del turned a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they find it somehow exciting , but are not really impressed in their K@@ all@@ stadt art , &quot; Simone Wen@@ del says . &quot;

but Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the don@@ or .
the tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 1885 when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gold gra@@ ves in the United States .
firm of the Year for Trade@@ marks and Un@@ fair Competition Har@@ m@@ sen U@@ tes@@ cher Firm of the Year for M &amp; A No@@ err Firm of the Year for Media
&quot; but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : her desire to return to the homeland , failed at the Bavarian state where the Pal@@ at@@ inate belonged . &quot;
&quot; he did not record Tr@@ ump , because he was once without hom@@ olog@@ ation , the director of the Institute for Pe@@ eling History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , was declared a film start . &quot;
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of a &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
this is stark contrast to the inci@@ dental statements of the desc@@ endants .
he had repeatedly spoken about Mexican immigrants in the United States and demanded the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; as such , it &apos;s not so li@@ ke@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim B@@ ender , a distant relative of Tr@@ ump ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a born Tr@@ ump , the Grand@@ pa was born &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the win@@ emaker in retirement looks more dist@@ anced by the Americans , &quot; he is always so up@@ lifting . &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump doesn &apos;t come ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; he never took care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the pen@@ sion@@ ers Veron@@ ika Sch@@ ra@@ mm mentioned as some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter , that a desc@@ endant of the Heinz family ended with a visit to the church organ , which was generally well anch@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; &quot; said the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; it is better if he doesn &apos;t know the choice , because he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if this is good . &quot;
&quot; if those who had the sa@@ wing at the time of his grandfather in the USA would have been like he , &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting subjects than him , &quot; &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot;
and as President ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; my president is not , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
and : &quot; the grapes are ripe without the president Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; Wen@@ dels movie , for which Tr@@ ump was interviewed for a long time , have seen 12 000 cinem@@ at@@ ograph@@ ers , even in the USA the interest is w@@ aking up . &quot;

&quot; the woman , at which Sam Wood landed in The Bachelor , was wrapped in greatest secret detention . &quot;
&quot; and none of the three remaining girls left will certainly not give up , if she is the one who has received the last rose . &quot;
&quot; but when we checked with Sarah Mack@@ ay , Sne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows on the day before three two , checked , you may acci@@ dentally be given a note on who will be the winner . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; all three women have settled in a ly@@ rical way , why Wood is the perfect man and named his sense of humour , ambition , family values and positive attitude to why they would like to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; &quot; If not you who should get W@@ oods last Rose ? &quot; , &quot; their answers can be sp@@ oil , who won the heart of the bach@@ el@@ or . &quot;
Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki recognized both quickly - except himself - Mack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah Mack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from the first day .
&quot; from the moment when I went to the house and noticed Sam@@ s energies , I felt that they were quite compatible , and I &apos;ve thought that throughout the course of the show , &quot; &quot; said Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah stands with both feet on Earth , it &apos;s so much fun to be together with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added . &quot;
&quot; I saw them together , and they have the right chemistry . &quot;
they feel comfortable and comfortable .
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
&quot; from their point of view , Mack@@ ay said that the house visit last week made her clear that wood &quot; &quot; A &quot; &quot; could be . &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and the family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now ready to stop him , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when she was asked whom Wood should choose , if not she , she was pu@@ zzling . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the remaining girl equally - it is an un@@ decided between Sne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest in his move to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent inquiries after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and Trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a wise decision .
&quot; some train@@ ers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bench when he lost a triangle , as the Aus@@ sie rug@@ by division conver@@ ts with his first punch @-@ return on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minnesota . &quot;
but Tom@@ s@@ ula confi@@ ded his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to a pun@@ t return and also in the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula continued to show his true face in the dressing cabin after the game .
&quot; instead of gr@@ asp@@ ing his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team , he encouraged them . &quot;
Tom@@ s@@ ula strengthened Hay@@ ne publicly in his press conference after the game .
&quot; the 49@@ er Sport@@ reporter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who advised him to forget his scrat@@ ched catch and take care of the next game . &quot;
&quot; Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a pun@@ t , which was restored in the first game area by Minnesota Vi@@ kings . &quot;
&quot; it was certainly not the start , the Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian skir@@ mis@@ h for his N@@ FL debut . &quot;

&quot; that was a thing that happens now , you only care about the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; Hay@@ ne said . &quot;

4 people killed when polic@@ eman rub@@ bed on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
&quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal following the police rub@@ bed into a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , said a civil servant on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the violence erup@@ ted on Tuesday evening in the Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi district , approximately 175 miles west of the capital Kath@@ mand@@ u . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ k@@ al , senior district officer , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators were gathered outside a police station , with some of you threw stones and fire bombs . &quot;
&quot; Mr D@@ ha@@ k@@ al said that the police used tear gas , and then shot into the air before returning to rubber shoes . &quot;
&quot; 20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were hurt , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the rub@@ ber@@ bands used , of which it is known that they can kill , but traditionally used as a less lethal alternative , apparently such high death rates are produced . &quot;
&quot; the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal on southern levels , where members of the ethnic group of the M@@ ons say that new provinces , which are formed within the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence . &quot;
there were also protests in western Nepal by the ethnic group of Th@@ arus who want to have their own state .
&quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , were in violent clas@@ hes since the 10th . &quot;
&quot; in August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement to split the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial topic in Nepal , which has been ruled out for centuries . &quot;
&quot; the work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008 , but the legisl@@ ature accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April . &quot;
&quot; the legisl@@ ature has agreed this week on certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kath@@ mand@@ u , and officials said that the new constitution could take effect on Sunday . &quot;

&quot; for easily over@@ weight di@@ abe@@ tics , weight loss surgery can be helpful . &quot;
the benefits of weight loss surgery for easily over@@ weight people with type 2 diabetes can take at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to tell whether easily obes@@ e people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mort@@ ality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of weight loss surgery , who wrote a guide to the new trial in J@@ AMA Surgery . &quot;
weight loss operations or obesity surgery use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
&quot; over the years , obesity surgery has proven to be effective for type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been carried out in people who are obes@@ e obes@@ e with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a measure of weight regarding size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 . &quot;
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is over@@ weight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ wan@@ ese Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital Data , which they have collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity surgery - stomach b@@ ypass and stomach ul@@ cer formation - medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily over@@ weight . &quot;
&quot; results appear ordered &quot; &quot; by relevance &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; by date &quot; &quot; ( publication date ) , Fac@@ ets , which offer an easy way to limit your search , Online Help , &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the BM@@ I remained with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately equal to 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those who undergo surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes is completely eliminated and at 28 % partially . &quot;

&quot; in addition , the results in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and the &quot; &quot; bad &quot; &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol are generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , the authors found out . &quot;
the researchers also monitored the blood levels of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
&quot; hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , write the researchers . &quot;
&quot; after the operation , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c decreased by around 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ emic control &quot; - as you reflected in the improved ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - not reduced mort@@ ality in five years , so the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also promised average results in the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group lost more weight compared to the Gast@@ ro@@ ect@@ omy Group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved higher response in BM@@ I ( 7.4 versus 5.1 ) and hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and reported a complete over@@ coming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study does not show survival benefit of surgery after five years , there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study , it was in obes@@ e people who subjected themselves to obesity surgery , about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study showed no benefit for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was so@@ othing for people with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start weight seriously as soon as the patient with his BM@@ I is between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we wait too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic modifications , which have linked their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot;

it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; - Dal@@ ai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; Europe cannot accept all refugees , said the Dal@@ ai Lama and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East . &quot;
the Tibetan Buddh@@ ist leader called on to stop violence in the native countries of the refugees .
the Dal@@ ai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit in the United Kingdom at the opening of the Dal@@ ai Lama Centre for Comp@@ as@@ sion in Oxford which is dedicated to ethics studies .
&quot; he demanded that under the circumstances , the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents . &quot;
&quot; he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admi@@ rable , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dal@@ ai Lama in Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to tackle the crisis , he stressed that there was only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime , you have to think about long @-@ term solutions such as a true peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; he stressed . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , we have to think about how the killing in their countries is reduced . &quot;
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the application of violence never solved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; the Dal@@ ai Lama addressed the problem of violence and commented George Bush &apos;s actions following the terrorist attack on September 11 , and turned out that the violent reaction of the US drag@@ ged a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events . &quot;
&quot; after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ence in a letter to President Bush , and I told him that the way to solving this problem lies in non @-@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he put violence , and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; said the Dal@@ ai Lama . &quot;
four @-@ fold increase of inf@@ ect@@ ants inf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the last 4 years
&quot; poison control centres in the United States report an almost 400 @-@ percent increase in the number of children under twelve years , which swal@@ low heavily alcohol hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , so the Georgia Po@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of the Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of income from hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants reported in children under 12 years , the poison control centres report , from 3,@@ 266 in 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children are getting more and more common in these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in emergency , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CNN . &quot;
&quot; he said that some children drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , while some do it to im@@ press their friends , or because of a mut@@ ation in social media . &quot;
videos on YouTube show how young dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants drink only because of a cheap experience .
teenagers have allegedly mixed dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with non @-@ alcoholic mou@@ th@@ wash to get a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child doesn &apos;t think this is bad for it , &quot; Lop@@ ez said . &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those who are perf@@ umed .
&quot; there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange scent that are very attractive for children . &quot;
dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
&quot; especially with small children , few sy@@ ring@@ es can lead to alcohol poison@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , Medical Director of the poison emergency centre at the University of Kansas City , the Fox 4 station in K@@ ansa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you wouldn &apos;t let si@@ p whis@@ key around , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant in reach of children , and when children come to it , it is a quick way to consume much alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , who recently took four sy@@ ring@@ es from after straw@@ berry and dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant inf@@ ect@@ ant in the school , was brought into an emergency room . &quot;
&quot; her blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold required by an adult , Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor , who treated her in the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ ung@@ ed her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
&quot; doctors monitored it overnight in a separate child hospital for signs of brain trau@@ ma , since the girl had fallen through alcohol and had hit the head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said . &quot;
&quot; that was very fri@@ ghtening , &quot; said Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ ahu &apos;s mother , CNN . &quot;
it would have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ables and store dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
&quot; beyond alcohol poison@@ ing , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , two women died in Ontario women following the swal@@ lowing of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants containing a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient . &quot;
&quot; staff of health authorities suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a deadly solution , rather than eth@@ yl alcohol known as an active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in January , three students of the fourth class in New York State were planning to poison their &quot; gem@@ a &quot; teacher by putting anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , so it reports a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic against dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ished them out of their room .
&quot; the police concerned the mis@@ guided plan as &quot; &quot; Gesch@@ wei@@ ge &quot; &quot; and rejected disciplinary measures to the school authority . &quot;

&quot; N@@ eil@@ son remains what he said , and insisted , &quot; &quot; I have no integrity question , I have no performance commented . &quot;

why I &apos;m witn@@ essing an execution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
&quot; a little later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death . &quot;
&quot; when it happens , and I hope that it does not happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber in the Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p executed through the poison sy@@ ringe . &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
&quot; the invitation took place for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed . &quot;
&quot; when the day came closer , I began to fear . &quot;
so why should I do it ?
&quot; I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty . &quot;
it would provide a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US , and there are often more applications than places available , a mak@@ ab@@ ere lot@@ tery takes place in order to decide who is elected . &quot;
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
who is chosen will see it emotion@@ ally .
I cannot do that .
I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps close friend with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
&quot; the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remember all details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me of giving up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
&quot; tell the story of the prisoner , as he wants , and you get access . &quot;
I am compla@@ ining about her .
&quot; they said that &quot; &quot; it could have been better form@@ ulate , &quot; &quot; but she still thinks that it is wrong what I do . &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had problems with some of the things I said and wrote .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses .
but he wants an international reporter to write there .
&quot; when he dies , he thinks that the public relations of the movement will help against the death penalty . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ ware , a reporter from Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts I &apos;ve made . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to go back to all details here .
I cannot say that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions following the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a benef@@ ici@@ ary of de@@ ed .
but I think there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I think his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him die .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other rep@@ orters that you can contact .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man dying to death .

Peter Moody claims that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threatened to end racing sport
&quot; Peter Moody claims that ste@@ wards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables , and threatened to finish the race immediately . &quot;
&quot; he focused on ste@@ wards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that she had a personal campaign against him with the late Sc@@ rat@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , last straw on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Moody said Fair@@ fax media that he always tried to do what is best for racing , and he himself has found himself under difficult conditions , when it was about the positive cob@@ alt test at Li@@ dar@@ i , which he cannot explain . &quot;
he had held 18 months because of the es@@ pion@@ age repro@@ aches and did not want it to &quot; see how too highly hanging grapes . &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I have long to eat it , but sometimes you are so fru@@ strated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; said Moody . &quot;
they know that it went on .
&quot; sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with that which I have said . &quot;
I will go home tonight and sleep well tonight .
&quot; I want to embrace raised heads , and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them . &quot;
&quot; if they start thinking , I do not do that , then I should not be a trainer . &quot;
I have to think about what I do with my license .
&quot; previously , Moody had submitted the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the integrity department tried to spy out his stable . &quot;
&quot; eigh@@ teen months Terry Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sitting in a room with a man - whom I will name - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I &apos;m doing within my st@@ ables , &quot; &quot; said Moody on Rac@@ ing.com . &quot;
they seem to believe that I am a dec@@ ei@@ ver .

am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think outside that I am .
&quot; perhaps they have to take my license and viol@@ ate me , and I have no doubt that what I say they can now think about it now . &quot;
&quot; but I have arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad . &quot;
that makes me sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and push them to make a decision .

&quot; the levels of the trainer have built up with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt investigation at Li@@ dar@@ i , and late sc@@ rat@@ ching led to the fact that he could &quot; &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Moody , best known by his preparation for the un@@ approved master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the race @-@ treatment rule &quot; ridicul@@ ous &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse debate , which pushed the rules . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm train@@ ers Craig Bell@@ amy beats Riv@@ als for claims about ring fighting
Melbourne @-@ storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy has critic@@ ised critics at the tac@@ kling of his players as &quot; agenda setting &quot; of two Premier League favour@@ ites in the NR@@ L .
&quot; Sydney Roo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ees allowed the Storm players &quot; &quot; ring events &quot; &quot; with his team during the high storm victory in Sydney on Friday evening . &quot;
&quot; Bris@@ bane Bron@@ cos Trainer Wayne Benn@@ ett made a barely conce@@ aled comment to the Storm team after his team achieved final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; sample example &quot; of the rug@@ by league , and said that the two out of Que@@ ens@@ land are not &quot; too good &quot; in rings . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy defended the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his team and said that they were only concentrated on their &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; at the tac@@ kling . &quot;
&quot; she added that the criticism of two leading train@@ ers on his team win him confi@@ dently , as it compla@@ ined that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team . &quot;
&quot; this happens repeatedly - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson talked about ring events when they had hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with tac@@ kles to a real focus , and this has made us the turn@@ around for us . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team . he &apos;s probably not used to lose it , so it was a bit a shock for him . &quot;
it &apos;s funny how this time to come back to this season .
&quot; Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ etts idea of &quot; &quot; exciting football &quot; &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; &quot; boring &quot; &quot; football . &quot;
Wayne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; he has compared his game on Saturday night with our on Friday evening and how exciting their game was , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wayne said he would take care of a shit . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed . &quot;
this is the ball game that you want to play when you have this kind of players .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt , so they can play as they can . &quot;
I build stronger confidence because they say these things because they are a bit worried to play against us .
&quot; six weeks ago , they did not think of us when it came to the big Games . &quot;
it also pointed out that the game Storm against Roo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos versus Cow@@ boys .
&quot; the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts in our game , but is that an exciting game ? &quot;
&quot; or are breaks , and no points of tension ? &quot;
&quot; for me , it &apos;s the game plans . &quot;
&quot; if they mention us , it means that we will meet them in a phase . &quot;
&quot; this weekend , the Storm team released their right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on the next Saturday night in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning . &quot;

&quot; a man , possibly a life @-@ long punishment threat@@ ens to come to the possession of 40 kil@@ ograms of co@@ caine , smug@@ gled into Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 . &quot;
&quot; Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of the Dro@@ ge on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America about Van@@ u@@ at@@ u and placed in August in Co@@ om@@ era . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed how he met his co @-@ def@@ endants in the J@@ ach@@ thaf@@ en during the morning and later at Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police found 40 kil@@ ograms of the drug in a Toyota echo . &quot;
&quot; despite a potentially life @-@ long sentence for trying to own a commercial quantity of co@@ caine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic argued that there was no evidence that he tried to own the whole lot and that it could have been a harm@@ less reason in the café . &quot;
&quot; the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was concerned about the danger of escape in Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he explained to the court on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in the case of criminal law , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vi@@ cs &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a deposit of 200,000 dollars as security together to reach his release . &quot;
&quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ dav@@ its of the two persons it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; said Richter Flan@@ agan . &quot;
&quot; but that alone will not be enough to prevent him from appearing , he warned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released against Cau@@ tion , under the conditions that he canc@@ els his Australian and Serbian passport . &quot;

&quot; Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the girl &apos;s phone , when this was asleep , entered into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of un@@ decent pictures of children who were sent to him by another user . &quot;
the girl woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping H@@ og@@ g .
&quot; she saw it through , found the bew@@ il@@ dered messages and aler@@ ted immediately their mother . &quot;
&quot; the police took care of it and saw the five images , analyzed then computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; relevant &quot; web research , the terms used for searching for in@@ decent images of children . &quot;
&quot; H@@ og@@ g then claimed that he had done it , as it would lead to &quot; &quot; p@@ ests in the internet &quot; &quot; and then &quot; &quot; preten@@ ding to be a polic@@ eman to fri@@ ghten them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on said the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; he said it would be a addiction to be addic@@ ted to people . &quot;
&quot; he admitted that the search on the computer were carried out by him , but said that it was done because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are p@@ ests . &quot;
he was asked after his talks with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos .
he said he did it to enti@@ ce them .
&quot; he said he was sick in the head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder . &quot;
&quot; MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was at the trem@@ bling and crying . &quot;
she also saw the in@@ decent pictures on the phone and confronted the accused with it .
the girl was interviewed and said that the accused computer and pla@@ yst@@ ation used to talk to girls who looked much younger than he .

the mass makes it : every two years the car manufacturers show their novel@@ ties at the IAA .
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , cars from the compact class are particularly sought @-@ after : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new regi@@ strations fell to this segment according to Kraft@@ fahrt @-@ Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) alone in August . &quot;
this is reflected in the IAA ( publication stage 17 - 27 September ) .
&quot; between all the futur@@ istic concept vehicles and new top class and luxury cars , many new compact models will be presented . &quot;
&quot; the Opel Astra , which will be available in autumn , will be one of the biggest premier@@ es for the German automobile industry . &quot;
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; this means that the volume model is also well sold , the new Astra will not be much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; Opel presents an entry below the largest competitor of VW Golf in prospect , which starts at 17@@ 650 Euro . &quot;
the current Astra costs 16 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; in addition , the Hessen also offer further diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for the first time also three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines . &quot;
&quot; unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is only a five @-@ door car . &quot;
&quot; as a second variant I will follow in the spring of the comb@@ i , which is also shown at the IAA . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the Astra , the Astra is still on new compact cars . &quot;

&quot; at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is only a five @-@ door in a conventional and a emphas@@ ised sporty GT version . &quot;
&quot; in retail , he arrives at the beginning of next year , then also as a comb@@ i . &quot;
Infin@@ iti : new in the segment is Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
&quot; with the new model , the Nissan rec@@ umbent wants to find its position in the highly growing segment . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the compact Infin@@ iti fits perfectly into the brand &apos;s design line . &quot;
the base model will get a gasoline engine with a power of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
but the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
&quot; Suzuki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Suzuki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; the model with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp . &quot;
&quot; according to manufacturer data , the maximum torque is 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) . &quot;
sales start of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
&quot; DS 4 : not completely new , but all round is the compact class model DS 4 , which is shown at the IAA . &quot;
&quot; on the outside , the designers of the noble Citro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ers were hand @-@ held at the front part : here the radiator grill was re@@ drawn , and the changed head@@ lights with LED technology were fitted . &quot;
&quot; in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ainment system has been moderni@@ zed , reducing the number of buttons through a touch@@ screen and integrated Ap@@ ples Car@@ Play for the first time . &quot;
&quot; in addition , at the IAA in the compact class a number of re@@ work and new variants such as the rear @-@ mounted Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 308 GT@@ I . &quot;

&quot; in this way , a former prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was housed in a single cell with approximately five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was not separated . &quot;
&quot; after that , the man , who has now been on the free walk after his An@@ caster &apos;s account , has been transferred to a larger cell . &quot;

&quot; on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had agreed to a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009 . &quot;
&quot; for three months , the then pla@@ inti@@ ff was accommod@@ ated between 15 to 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case . &quot;

Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we create that &quot;
the migration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the German Chancellor is determined to accept them .
what happens in Germany ?
&quot; according to Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany will even be able to record a million refugees . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) demonstrated determination in view of the unusual challenge : &quot; I say again and again : we can create this and we create this .
&quot; what comes to Germany , gives the following overview . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
this is almost twice as much as it is built up ( 25@@ 0000 flats ) .
&quot; the lack of housing is dramatic , but above all for affordable rental properties : 600@@ 00 to 800@@ 00 social apartments fall out of the rental price , and these particularly favorable apartments will also apply for refugees . &quot;

&quot; both assumptions seem unrealistic : for example , the impact of a global shock is likely to vary from one region to another . in this issue on regional labour markets , Norbert Schanne employs novel methods in spatial econometrics to describe and forecast their development . &quot;
&quot; however , the refugees in Germany were not systematically asked about their qualification in order to help them get started , Claudia Walter critic@@ ises the project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation . &quot;
&quot; for the integration of refugees , however , it is crucial if they find work in Germany . &quot;

&quot; in Germany , according to the Thr@@ än@@ hardt , there has been a political shift in Germany : from the ban on refugees for recognition of work . &quot;
&quot; while it was formerly a ban for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the residence duty to limit asylum seek@@ ers to a place of residence . &quot;

&quot; until now , there is not yet a sufficient offer of general and professional language courses . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the construction of networks is therefore based on the Königs@@ weg path to work integration . &quot;
&quot; the Berlin school administration has found that only a few fled parents give their children to the kit@@ as , estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the parents &quot; parents it is only important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ sch@@ ko , spokesperson for youth and family in Berlin &apos;s Senate administration . &quot;
&quot; in order to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in different languages . &quot;
&quot; if the need for educ@@ ators grew strongly by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the capacity of education - for instance by allowing more specialised schools . &quot;
enter multiple addresses separated by commas and / or different lines .
&quot; but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ okes from the Berlin school administration . &quot;
the German Studenten@@ werk has estimated that approximately 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study .

&quot; Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should succ@@ essive the same rights as they have the churches , and further develop the existing state @-@ church law to a new state @-@ religion relationship . &quot;
&quot; the establishment of an Islamic welfare organization , who cares for the newcom@@ ers , would also be important . &quot;
the rights are also obligations .
&quot; thus , the representatives of Islam have to agree on clear contacts and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and to grant him certain control options . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the willingness to take refuge against religious fundament@@ alism is also part of this . &quot;
&quot; the President of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Ma@@ zy@@ ek , expressed concern that religious conflicts could also be entered into Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted to pursue such conflicts in Germany , &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; he said in the Bay@@ rische Rundfunk . &quot;
he suggested to translate the Basic Law on Arabic .
&quot; in future , integration will continue to be a topic of the whole society today . &quot;
&quot; in order to change the majority society , the reduction of discrimination and racism is pressing . &quot;
&quot; as a result of European decisions , Germany has a anti @-@ discrimination point and a general equality law . &quot;
&quot; but it lear@@ ns very slowly , as the NSU thriller series showed , in the police and the authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive . &quot;
&quot; this means that the resource in question identified itself as &quot; &quot; XHTML 1.0 Strict &quot; &quot; and that we successfully performed a formal validation of it . &quot;

&quot; to avoid bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ gom@@ ery urges all newcom@@ ers alike to register health cards at the same time . &quot;
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exaggerate the simulated increase in caseloads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
&quot; in the long run , it is highly question@@ able to track so many people with the limited power catalogue that the asylum seek@@ ers act . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , the doctors are doing the language barriers . &quot;
&quot; so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are more likely to be more informed about their illnesses than other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in clinics , also in medical offices , interpre@@ ting posts would need to be taken over . &quot;
&quot; however , many refugees would have been helped by more general medical centres in emergency ambul@@ ances . &quot;
and with another diagnostic sight .
&quot; under Refu@@ gee Women , there are much more un@@ covered disabilities , and among young people it is about HIV education . &quot;
&quot; in some other cases , German doctors from their training , however , are clear , Mont@@ gom@@ ery means . &quot;
&quot; it is not so difficult to detect paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis . &quot; &quot; and as far as the doctors are concerned , it may even be alle@@ vi@@ ated by the refugees . &quot;

&quot; in order to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualification and possibly take examinations . &quot;
&quot; at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany , according to the German Psych@@ otherap@@ ist Association ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) , is psych@@ ologically ill : most suffer from post@@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression . &quot;
&quot; in particular , refugee children are particularly vulnerable to refugee children , says Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot;
a recently published study of the TU Munich shows that every fifth Syrian refugee crisis is trau@@ matic in Germany .
&quot; those who suffer from post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder suff@@ ers from so @-@ called Flash@@ backs with respiratory disorders , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart disease and death . &quot;

&quot; Wen@@ ger stressed over Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it is only September and if his rehabilitation is done according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas . &quot;
&quot; this optimistic scenario implies that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England , and in view of his history his involvement in the next summer is certainly uncertain . &quot;
&quot; the great shame in this current issue is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury , and then returned to his old swing during the pre @-@ season . &quot;
&quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten the career , &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
it is a bone that doesn &apos;t heal well .
this is not a greater matter .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his knu@@ ck@@ les or with the injuries he had before .
&quot; this may be true from purely medical terms , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
&quot; the study of Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since its debut , six years ago . &quot;
he also played in only 65 of Arsen@@ als 157 league games in the last five seasons .
the wider picture for Arsen@@ al is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs since 2007 / 08 that have suffered most injuries .
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , if you come back from an injury , you have a temporary period , a time in which you have to strengthen your body and win fighting force , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
&quot; I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves . &quot;
&quot; Arsen@@ al starts his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger places a rotation within the team . &quot;
Hé@@ ctor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not travelled to Croatia which means that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are likely to start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and allow players who need to take a little break @-@ up , &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
&quot; although Arsen@@ al is clear favour@@ ites , through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the biggest inti@@ mid@@ ation effects in Europe . &quot;
Dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign launched in the last season .
&quot; the stadium was sh@@ aken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , measured on the Richter scale 3,@@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; this year , it was the 10th in Zagreb . &quot;
&quot; Wen@@ ger believes that Arsen@@ al has drawn the lesson from the last season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco , and remains from far @-@ reaching hopes to lead the club to his first European cup victory . &quot;
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it hasn &apos;t worked at Arsen@@ al yet .

Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the comedy show that gives us serious lessons on men &apos;s friend@@ ships
&quot; the lack of similar representations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open , now more desperate than ever , how suicide rates among young men prove to be a 15 @-@ year ho@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains three times more common in men than women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to tackle the problem , the Campaign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably announced ( CAL@@ M campaign against a pi@@ tiful life ) 2015 as the year of the man , with the aim of asking the men to seek help if they need them . &quot;
friendship is the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge .
&quot; a current study of more than 2,000 high school pupils with de@@ pressive symptoms found that if the suffering had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood &quot; it doubled its chances of recovery . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems . &quot;
&quot; but of course , you have to have friends , so that a friendship can work . &quot;
&quot; in the age of social media , communication , with its emphasis on style on substance , the immedi@@ acy of the response is often more important than a meaningful contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital life has the need to appear strong , lively and successful , even if in reality isolation is dominated . &quot;
&quot; this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at expense in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner lon@@ ging for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper . &quot;
&quot; and as a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire announced recently , money can really not buy happiness . &quot;
the Beautiful at Friends was that this focuss@@ ing was placed on the head .
&quot; every character was not defined by his work , but by his personality defined by the interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the humour of Joey and Chand@@ ler frequent hu@@ gs , moments when playing soccer in cozy arm@@ chairs and the lon@@ ging of Ross to Rachel - all that came out of the knowledge that men can relate to each case , even though they are often reluct@@ ant to fully explore their feelings . &quot;
&quot; as a staff of telephone pastoral care , it explained to me : &quot; &quot; my listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and endanger@@ ed , really showed me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us are often not able to talk to friends .
&quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; I come to cope with it &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , as the feeling that it is perceived as weakness when talking about problems . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that come to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
she presents quite clearly the little moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
&quot; as much my objective out@@ si@@ der status over the phone can also help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
&quot; and so , when you visit Comedy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest at the celebration of the day , why don &apos;t take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or , even better if you see in Starbucks a person sitting alone , give him a smile and say h@@ ello . &quot;
you never know what difference your friendship could make .

&quot; but while they got the points , it was not a class game by Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ an Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vi@@ cs . he was later in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the association with whom he started his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it is not easy to win at home or down@@ ward in the Champions League . therefore it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 to cause problems and to look back , even if there are certain things that we have to perfect in the course of the season , &quot; &quot; said Blanc . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot;
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we did not have one or two other goals . &quot;
&quot; Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic returned to the Paris team after his injury in one of three changes in the Paris team , which was on the weekend a 2 : 2 Un@@ decided on his own place against Bor@@ deaux in the First League , but he was eliminated in the fourth minute by Di Maria . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ inian wing stor@@ mer was called the man who took PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over in the last month of Manchester United , and he pointed out why when he was in Marco Ver@@ rat@@ i Pass behind the Mal@@ m@@ ö @-@ defense , he was passing over into the long corner of the network . &quot;
&quot; but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Mal@@ m@@ ö , who struck Celtic in a play @-@ off to achieve this level , entered the field with nine national players on the field and was a serious opponent with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle of the field . &quot;
&quot; but besides a shot by Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ dj@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps &apos;s posts in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G sometimes gave himself up , with some mis@@ ses and bad degrees , not least by Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , who was in no less than five attempts alone in the first half , and then abandoned after having used him after the re@@ boot . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless he showed much more skill , when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass of Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , whom Di Maria turned into a shot which was directed by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute of the pole ... &quot;
&quot; the second gate finally fell short after the hour mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ an achieved his sixth season tor , after Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic had left a left flank of Max@@ well . &quot;
&quot; this ended all the thought that Mal@@ m@@ ö could come back to the game , and only an excellent intervention by Wil@@ and from the short@@ est distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , the final result could be low before the waiting list Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi was a gateway to the end . &quot;
&quot; the coach of Mal@@ m@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , announced that PS@@ G played a class over his team and the Norweg@@ ians said : &quot; &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December last year . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have only played in the Swedish league which does not have the same level . &quot;
the quali@@ fier is not enough .

&quot; during a succession of Sunday Night of H@@ BO@@ s Project Green@@ light , experienced actor Brown interrupted the need for alternative perspectives and in terms of a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen script of the project . &quot;
&quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it with the occupation of the film and not at the occupation of the show , &quot; assured Dam@@ on . &quot;

professional sports clim@@ ber and help Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ lete who won the American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior on Monday evening and took the Grand Prix of 1 million $ with home .
&quot; the competition show , which just completed its 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who could shut down all levels of his obstacle course . &quot;
&quot; during the season finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and Camer@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , until the final . &quot;
&quot; for the last task , climbing at a 75 feet long climbing rope belonged to 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; Brit@@ ten ended the task within the time , with which he was the first ath@@ lete who completed the stren@@ uous phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero ended this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him the winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! news after the hard @-@ fought victory , still under the shock over the win of the Grand Prize of 1 Million $ . &quot;
&quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned or had more than 10,000 $ or had to live , &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! over his he@@ ap of money . &quot;

Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ aks up to Minnesota Tw@@ ins
MIN@@ NE@@ A@@ POL@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
&quot; in the past , they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers are standing on the last square in the American League Central . &quot;
&quot; the Tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spoiler , but played this part on Tuesday perfectly against the Minnesota Tw@@ ins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target field . &quot;
the Tw@@ ins w@@ aged a chance to climb up within a half @-@ half of Houston Astro@@ s for the second American League game card .
&quot; for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word , which was so hard to write about a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all victories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Aus@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; Tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon held his early offensive support , when Detroit scored three times in the first two inside , then once in the sixth and then in the ninth . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) struck 6 times on the 1 / 3 inside and allowed three races .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to throw every game in the bull@@ pen , and so I want to go into the game . &quot;
&quot; the designated tiger @-@ Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits , and was in two races , his first r@@ allies since mid @-@ August . &quot;
&quot; it was the first three @-@ hit game of Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th . &quot;
&quot; he has scre@@ amed the wood well , &quot; &quot; said Aus@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at the ( punch training ) , looked much better out of the bull@@ pen , and he brought it directly into the game . &quot;
&quot; with three races at the end of the seventh inside , the Tw@@ ins had their best chance to return to the game again . &quot;
center F@@ iel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
&quot; right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks finished a Bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zi@@ er to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed bla@@ ins Har@@ dy . &quot;
&quot; Har@@ dy over@@ worked the wall , the only man with whom he was faced , before the designated R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who took a two @-@ run to the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen . &quot;
&quot; with a pair of runners and the final run on the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play . &quot;
&quot; it was that in the Major League for the 27th time in this season , that pl@@ ou@@ les struck a double play . &quot;
&quot; after Detroit added an insurance @-@ run at the end of ninth in@@ ings , the wall created a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and scored the booth of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; the right @-@ handed , however , st@@ ach S@@ ano at three pit@@ ches for his fifth save . &quot;
Detroit benefited the start of the game from an even non @-@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
&quot; the Tig@@ ers achieved three races in the first two inside against the right @-@ handed veter@@ ans , who had been shot before the game from the injury list after having missed more than one month because of a back@@ bone . &quot;
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wanted to do , &quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es said , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; after they received the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter , H@@ ushes gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into play , which made a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game . &quot;
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z completed his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the runners in the scoring position .
&quot; the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right side , made another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat . &quot;
&quot; in the second one , the Tig@@ ers achieved a One @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James McC@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single by Center @-@ F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose on the 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; that was a big blow , &quot; said Tw@@ ins @-@ Manager Paul Mo@@ li@@ tor . &quot;
&quot; he didn &apos;t hit well , but he caught the right place . &quot;
&quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch count , scored no points in the third inning before he was replaced by the reli@@ ever right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter . &quot;
&quot; at Hu@@ gh@@ es , there came to three R@@ uns at six hits and a walk with four strokes . &quot;
remarks : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to an injury of the throwing school .
&quot; he was examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who operated the shoulder of San@@ che@@ z in 2007 . &quot;
&quot; San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the injury list due to a shoulder injury , should be activated for the start on Wednesday . &quot;

climate change thus poses an equal challenge to both cities and business .
&quot; on Wednesday and during the night on Thursday , the cave b@@ lows partly with storm force through the f@@ ren@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ öhn@@ ende on Thursday morning , we cross a striking cold front , which brings strong ra@@ inf@@ all , wind gu@@ sts and a temperature decline . &quot;
&quot; as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low @-@ pressure area across the British Is@@ les in a powerful southwest stream . &quot;
&quot; on the top of the alpine side , on Wednesday the F@@ öh@@ n breaks through the valleys . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ öh@@ n b@@ lows until Thursday morning in the valleys with goats from 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the Ur@@ i land also with more than 100 km / h . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ öh@@ n can penet@@ rate to the neighbouring Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and on the mountains there are even arch@@ ways of more than 120 km / h possible . &quot;
&quot; during the north on Wednesday stor@@ my hair dryer for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , moisture is beginning to sto@@ w down at the Alpine slope . &quot;
&quot; here is rain , which lasts until Thursday night . &quot;
&quot; in sum , south of the Alps has to be expected to be expected in the next 48 hours with some more than 100 litres of rain per square meter . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday morning the F@@ öh@@ n gets out of the air , as a result rolls a cold front with strong , partly cloudy rain from West to east via Switzerland . &quot;
&quot; along with the cold front the wind refresh@@ es strongly , and temperatures drop significantly . &quot;
&quot; the following days are present in the north at 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the other hand , it will be sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees . &quot;
Rome has now a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz

&quot; on Wednesday , the presence of the city president Ign@@ azi@@ o Marino was ch@@ ri@@ sten@@ ed on the name of the German Re@@ formers on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; on the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is now honoured as &quot; German The@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the park is located in the middle of the old Rome , next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um . &quot;
the nam@@ ing was requested by the working group of the Protest@@ ant Chur@@ ches in Rome .
&quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , past@@ or of the Evangel@@ ical Luther@@ an Church in Rome , remembered that Protest@@ ants in the city of Pop@@ es were often only able to live in sec@@ rec@@ y for centuries as a minority . &quot;

Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was considered a young August@@ inian mon@@ k about the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .

hammer artists invested three years into the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gil@@ ded ) crown is one of the major works that Ot@@ mar Alt painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts .
at the beginning was the word ?
&quot; no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which is now published with splendid pictures . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alto , who has form@@ ulated his very personal interpretations of bi@@ blical stories on paper and canvas . &quot;
&quot; his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old , which is by no means equivalent to &quot; funny &quot; images . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary : adapted to each subject , it can be quite dark . &quot;
&quot; about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his bi@@ ble project for which he has met a subjective @-@ artistic selection from the many subject areas of the &quot; book of all books . &quot; &quot;
&quot; cycles , which are dedicated to topics such as cross paths , pl@@ agues , command@@ ments , or fa@@ ther@@ less . &quot;
Luther Firm of the Year for Pharmaceuticals and Healthcare Hogan Lov@@ ells
&quot; and there is , above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with painting with the respective Bible places . &quot;
&quot; he has interpreted the Bible points selected by Ot@@ mar Alt , and thus transl@@ ates into current connections . &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ts painting .
&quot; they are embedded between the original Bible quot@@ ation by Martin Luther and each one of the artist , who has form@@ ulated his very personal thoughts on the situation . &quot;
the jewel binding has gold Let@@ ts .
&quot; so the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high degree of intim@@ acy .
&quot; emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family belonging to the strict Protest@@ ant Herr@@ n@@ h@@ uter @-@ Orden . &quot;
&quot; since the education was already done with the stock , Ot@@ mar Alt re@@ members . &quot;
&quot; I have tried to work with my father , perhaps even with the Lord . &quot;
&quot; his second concern was to help art in a fast @-@ pac@@ ed time : &quot; &quot; the perception of image worlds is shaped by advertising today , and that is no@@ isy . &quot;
symboli@@ sm is supp@@ ressed .
artists have a different desire and joy to show things .
pictures always have something secret and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewer to fall into the images , let them work , discover and feel what power they have . &quot; the picture is looking for his counter@@ part . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art : &quot; I like how he compreh@@ ends life with his paintings . &quot;
&quot; I did not pay attention to the Bible completely , but that was chosen for him important , even mysterious subjects . &quot;
&quot; this was not co @-@ operation at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text merely explains . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and to find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( bi@@ blical ) language of love and responsibility .
&quot; a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition , which will be opened on November 15th at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung . &quot;

G@@ aul@@ tier feels too old for an En@@ f@@ ant .
the designer Jean Paul G@@ aul@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
&quot; the highlights : display mannequins , which look terri@@ bly human thanks to video proj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; they wear the spectacular creations of the French designer , including Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits to the great star of the fashion scene - and so that he put men in skirts . &quot;
&quot; I can no longer say that I &apos;m the En@@ f@@ ant of the Hau@@ te Cou@@ ture , because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; in the past it was ble@@ ak , meanwhile it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; said G@@ aul@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from September 18 , at the Kunsth@@ alle of the Hyp@@ o @-@ Cultural Foundation , it is a good luck that the fashion designer has changed its beginning . &quot;
&quot; in fact , he was on the contrary , because : &quot; for me an exhibition was a bit of death , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; when one dies , one gets into the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection had already been made in the Canadian Montreal and Paris Station .
&quot; it is so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ eder@@ en . &quot;
&quot; it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society . &quot;
&quot; the exhibits give an insight into the barely visible work of man , who wrote fashion history without ever having completed apprentic@@ eship . &quot;
&quot; chron@@ ologically , the show is not built , but it is an excellent chore@@ ographic overall artwork for which much effort was done : to fresh@@ en the dolls , for example , a sty@@ list was dedicated . &quot;
&quot; as a result of this , it is the first time that the United States and the United States have signed an agreement with the United States . &quot;
&quot; shortly before the start of the Oktober@@ fest , there was still a special treat : a leather pants outfit with cor@@ set . &quot;
Heidi meets Madonna .
&quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; ) and for people who are a little different , G@@ aul@@ tier said . &quot;
also G@@ aul@@ tiers of old Ted@@ dy is to be seen in the exhibition .
&quot; he stands for the first , z@@ ag@@ ious fashion walking attempts by the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he was attracted to his ted@@ dy BH@@ s and clothes , said G@@ aul@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; to play with a doll , his parents wouldn &apos;t have allowed him . &quot;
he then joined the throwing of fashion later .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers as G@@ aul@@ tier told in Munich .
later I bought them naturally .
&quot; for his first own fashion show , he did not have to pay the models . &quot;

jewellery instead of Gard@@ ine - Plau@@ ener Spitze as fashion niche
&quot; in the past , it went to the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around Plau@@ en to make meters . &quot;
&quot; the embroi@@ dered fabrics and tips were created in large quantities for customers , for example , to ceilings and curtains . &quot;
&quot; this alone doesn &apos;t work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the fashion shop Plau@@ en . &quot;
&quot; instead , fashion is important again . &quot;
&quot; in the early hours of Plau@@ ener Spitze , fashion played a major role , was then pushed through the Heim@@ tex@@ ti@@ lin@@ dustrie - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : lace in jewelry , accessories like bags and for regional costumes . &quot;

&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
our products hardly reach the customers in this way .
&quot; today , mass goods are produced much cheaper in the Asian space and sold almost exclusively through chains . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the weak@@ ening of export , currently in Russia and the USA . &quot;
there are enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; the industry association is also trying to score with environmental awareness , such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer , from the ST@@ ICK@@ PER@@ LE in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; since this year we have a quality seal , which shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially acceptable . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt added : &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot;
&quot; Prof. U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ eber@@ ger office of the Western Saxon University of Z@@ wick@@ au , speci@@ alising in applied art - and speci@@ alis@@ es in embroi@@ der@@ ies and tips . &quot;
&quot; to counter the competition from the Asian region , you need to find high @-@ quality and innovative products . &quot;
that takes time and courage .
&quot; there is a voltage field between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that have to think of everything economically , &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; therefore , an existing design is often only slightly variable to keep a customer base . &quot;
&quot; a few years ago , a textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter re@@ invented the historic snow@@ ball point . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the machine sti@@ cking small kitchens at some places . &quot;
the Plau@@ ener gold@@ smith master in Bi@@ anca Hal@@ leb@@ ach @-@ Krau@@ ße was inspired by this : &quot; before I could not start with traditional Plau@@ ener Spitze . &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball point for her jewelry .
&quot; in an elaborate procedure , it shapes the pattern in silver . &quot;
&quot; many people in the region identify themselves with the topic of Plau@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot;
&quot; it also supplies to the USA , Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in Plau@@ en and its surroundings and who would like to be a souven@@ ir piece . &quot;
&quot; in this way , I see my jewellery as a modern ambassador of the Plau@@ ener Spitze . &quot;
