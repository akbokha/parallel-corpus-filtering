the organization will be held on the total amount and composition of this in the state or the relevant material and on any passing on such material from this state or the states on the current state .
&quot; this explains its consent as quickly as possible ; it extends only on matters such as inter @-@ time and negoti@@ able terms and modifications for reporting , but does not include a tr@@ ap@@ oration or under secre@@ cy knowledge of the military activity , nor does not refer to the following use of the nuclear material . &quot;

purpose of this part of the Convention is to take part in the implementation of part I through secur@@ ing measures as required .
the aim of the treatment process in this Convention is the timely discovery of the distrib@@ uting significant amounts of significant amounts of significant quantities of peaceful nuclear weapons and other nuclear plants for non @-@ known purposes and the det@@ err@@ ent of such a di@@ version by the risk of early @-@ term discovery .
&quot; to receive the amount of fundamental importance in article 28 specified , the material accounting is used as a backup of fundamental importance , inter@@ connection with the spatial input and observation as an important additional measures . &quot;
the technical finish of the re@@ visions using the organization is carried out by an explanation in which for each material balance sheet is not listed for a particular period of time due to the analy@@ zed limits for the indicated range .
in the carrying out of its evaluation makes the organization according to Article 3 full use of the security system of the community .

&quot; B ) is not yet reached urine - or th@@ ori@@ um@@ idi@@ ous material that is not yet reached in states , the community of the organization introduced the quantity and composition of the material , unless it is used for specific non @-@ nu@@ cl@@ ing purposes ; &quot;
&quot; C ) leaves nuclear material , which is suitable for composition and purity for the fuel production or the is@@ ot@@ open@@ di@@ ence , in which it is produced or other , in a later phase of the core @-@ driven core material in the States , so it is subject to the others in this agreement . &quot;
&quot; a ) The requirements set in this Convention are finished in the article 11 mentioned conditions , the community is not possible in Article 11 @-@ named conditions , the community measures are subject to this Convention , is not possible or desired to consult the re@@ claim@@ ing measures for this Convention , is not possible to consult the organization and commun@@ ion to each other on the application of suitable backup measures . &quot;

Switzerland has been working with research for several years with research work in the area of controlled nuclear fusion and plas@@ map@@ hy@@ si@@ k and is well familiar with the area concerned .
&quot; as far as to the practical use of the controlled nuclear fusion have even more extensive work , it lies in the interest of the contract parties to avoid un@@ necessary over@@ flowing efforts to acceler@@ ate in@@ necessary over@@ exer@@ tion and to acceler@@ ate their respective research projects due to the energy crisis . &quot;
&quot; this agreement should be able to carry out any contractual partners in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and the plas@@ map@@ hy@@ si@@ k from the designated possible use of research purposes , and accordingly the common objective of these research work , d.@@ h . the cost @-@ oriented electricity generation can be reached by using the controlled kernel action , faster . &quot;
&quot; towards the achievement of the present agreement , the contract parties associ@@ ate their respective in Annex I and II of this agreement defined research programmes , the &quot; &quot; Euratom program &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Swiss program &quot; . &quot; &quot;

protocol relating to the Convention of 1979 via far @-@ scale air pollution relating to the com@@ bating emissions of nit@@ rogen ox@@ ides or its gr@@ assy river
&quot; concerned about the current emissions of air pollution in exp@@ on@@ ated parts of Europe and North America , causing vital importance for the environment and economy , &quot;
&quot; in its second meeting the necessity recognized for the Convention on his second session , the annual holistic emissions of nit@@ rogen ox@@ ides from ort@@ isation and movable river to 1995 , and the need that states that have made progress in reducing this emissions and check their em@@ ission @-@ bound@@ ary for nit@@ rogen Ox@@ ides and ver@@ ify , &quot;
&quot; taking account consideration of scientific and technical data about emissions , air movements and effects of nit@@ rogen ox@@ ides and their folders products on the environment as well as data on technologies to combat emissions , &quot;
&quot; determined to take effective measures to fight and reduce the annual national emissions of nit@@ rogen ox@@ ides or its gr@@ en@@ zu@@ est@@ ing river , especially by application of appropriate national em@@ ission @-@ bound@@ ary sources , as well as by retro@@ fitting of existing larger size @-@ fixed sources , &quot;
