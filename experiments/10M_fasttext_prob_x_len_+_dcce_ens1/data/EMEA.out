this document is a summary of the European public statement report ( EP@@ AR ) in which it is described as the Committee for Human@@ arz@@ ne@@ ction@@ el ( CH@@ MP ) introduced to recommendations to recommendations regarding the use of the drug .
&quot; if you need more information about your disease or treatment , please read the package be@@ il@@ age ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or turn to your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; if you would like further information regarding the recommendations of the CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg m@@ elt @-@ tablets ( tablets that are available in the mouth ( 1 mg / ml ) and as injection resolution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; B. wir@@ res thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or vision of things that are not present ) , distr@@ ust and mad@@ ness ; • B@@ ipol@@ ar @-@ I @-@ disorder , a psych@@ ic episodes associated with periods of normal episodes ( periods of age ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ bil@@ ify is applied to the treatment of severe and severe episodes and prevention of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past . &quot;
the injection solution will be applied to the rapid control of st@@ acking un@@ rest or behavi@@ oral disorders when the oral intake of the drug is not possible .
&quot; in both diseases , the solution can be applied to the em@@ bedding of or the mel@@ ting tablets in patients are prepared to prevent the sl@@ ugs of tablets . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are able to use other medicines just like A@@ bil@@ ify , the dose should be adjusted to A@@ bil@@ ify . &quot;
&quot; this affects the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters , i.e. chemical substances that allow communication of ner@@ ve cells . &quot;
Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol probably acts as &quot; partial Ag@@ on@@ ist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ try@@ pt@@ amine ( also ser@@ ot@@ onin ) .
&quot; this means that Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ try@@ pt@@ amine and d@@ op@@ amine , but in gr@@ ac@@ ed dimensions than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter works to activate the recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; da D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ try@@ pt@@ amine in sch@@ izophr@@ enia and b@@ ipol@@ ar disorder plays a role , carries Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , thus reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms . &quot;
the effectiveness of A@@ bil@@ ify that prevent the occurrence of the symptoms was investigated in three studies over up to one year .
the effectiveness of inje@@ ctions was compared in two studies at 8@@ 05 patients with sch@@ izophr@@ enia or similar diseases that compared to a plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours with a plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in another study , A@@ bil@@ ify about twelve weeks at 3@@ 47 patients with Hal@@ oper@@ id@@ ol , in another study was to prevent the effectiveness of A@@ bil@@ ify and plac@@ ebo that have been stabil@@ ized with A@@ bil@@ ify symptoms in which the man@@ ic symptoms were already stabil@@ ized with A@@ bil@@ ify . &quot;
the effectiveness of A@@ bil@@ ify inje@@ ctions was compared to 301 patients with b@@ ipol@@ ar disorder that compared to Lor@@ a@@ ze@@ p@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medication ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours .
&quot; in all studies the change in patients have been investigated on the basis of a standard scale for b@@ ipol@@ ar disorder , or the number of patients who spoke to treatment . &quot;
the company also led studies through to examine how the body protects the mel@@ ting tablets and the solution to em@@ bedding .
&quot; in the two studies with the injection of patients , the A@@ bil@@ ify in doses of 5,@@ 25 mg , 9,@@ 75 mg or 15 mg received , a significantly stronger reduction of symptoms increased un@@ rest than patients who received a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
the application for the treatment of b@@ ipol@@ ar disorder di@@ zed A@@ bil@@ ify in four of the five short @-@ time studies were more effective than plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in addition to 74 weeks , it has been more effective than plac@@ ebo the repet@@ itive episodes in previously treated patients and if in addition to an existing treatment was administ@@ ered . &quot;
A@@ bil@@ ify inje@@ ctions in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg cans were also more effective than plac@@ ebo the symptoms gest@@ ed un@@ rest and were similarly effective as Lor@@ a@@ ze@@ p@@ am .
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ bil@@ ify to em@@ bedding ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extr@@ at@@ yr@@ am@@ id@@ al disorders ( const@@ ipation ) , fr@@ ying , nausea and exhaust@@ ion ( increased spec@@ ific@@ ity ) , fatigue and exhaust@@ ion , ru@@ el@@ essness , in@@ som@@ ite ( ins@@ om@@ nia ) and anxiety . &quot;
&quot; the committee on human therapeutic medicines ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the advantages of A@@ bil@@ ic episodes associated with b@@ ipol@@ ar @-@ I @-@ disorder as well as in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had mainly man@@ ic episodes associated with Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol , towards the risks over@@ we@@ igh . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the committee came to the result that the benefits of inje@@ ctions in the fast control of increased anxiety and behavi@@ oral disorders in patients with both sch@@ izophr@@ enia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes associated with b@@ ipol@@ ar @-@ I disorder , if an oral therapy is not suitable to we@@ igh the risks . &quot;
June 2004 announced the European Commission to the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . a permit for the development of asylum in the entire European Union .
A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y is intended for the treatment of moderate to heavy man@@ ic episodes of b@@ ipol@@ ar @-@ I@@ - disorder and for prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had mainly man@@ ic episodes associated with Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily from meals .
&quot; a increased effectiveness of doses over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose . &quot;
&quot; the recommended starting dose for A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combinations ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y in the treatment of sch@@ izophr@@ enia and b@@ ipol@@ ar @-@ I@@ - disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
with regard to the larger sensitivity of these patients should be considered a lower initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis if clinical factors are just@@ ify this just@@ ify this ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 indu@@ ctor is set off the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the appearance of su@@ iz@@ id@@ alem behavior belongs to psych@@ otic disorders and aff@@ ective disorders , and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changing an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , even in treatment with Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
the results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with b@@ ipol@@ ar disorder no increased sugar risk with Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol in comparison to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
&quot; Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol should be applied with caution in patients with known cardi@@ ac disease ( m@@ yo@@ k@@ ardin@@ al disease ) , cer@@ v@@ ascular disease , conditions , which are applied for hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( Deh@@ yd@@ rat@@ ation , hyp@@ ovol@@ emia ( including ac@@ pressive drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ak@@ zel@@ er@@ ated and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies that were a year or less , there were occas@@ ional reports on during treatment with Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol @-@ tre@@ k Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia . &quot;
&quot; if at one with A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y @-@ treated patients signs and symptoms of a Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , should be pul@@ led to reduce the dose or break the treatment . &quot;
&quot; if a patient signs and symptoms developed to indicate a m@@ ns , or un@@ clear high fe@@ ver without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ika , including A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y . &quot;
&quot; hence , Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol should be applied in patients with col@@ lar cases in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese or in the states that are applied with caution . &quot;
&quot; 56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol in patients with psych@@ oses associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol , an elev@@ ated ster@@ ber@@ is@@ iko has been treated compared to the plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; however , there was one of these studies , a study with fixer dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the approach to undes@@ irable zer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cul@@ ature events with Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol @-@ treated patients . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with K@@ eto@@ acid@@ osis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em Com@@ a or death , was treated with patients who were treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs , including A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y . &quot;
there is no precise risk ass@@ ess@@ ments for hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic @-@ related events with A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs treated patients to allow direct compar@@ isons .
&quot; Poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , Poly@@ ur@@ ie , Poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk actor for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should regularly monitored with regard to a deteri@@ oration of gl@@ uc@@ ose values . &quot;
&quot; gaining weight gain is generally known in sch@@ izophr@@ en@@ ic patients and in patients with b@@ ipol@@ ar Man@@ ie because of com@@ bi @-@ bid@@ ding , the application of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain as side effect , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle , and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol on the central nervous system , be careful when Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective medicines such as se@@ di@@ ment ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 @-@ ant@@ agonist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ ine , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol , whereby this effect is not relevant as clin@@ ically not relevant . &quot;
in a clinical trial with healthy pro@@ s increases a high @-@ effective CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ hib@@ itor ( Chin@@ id@@ in ) the Au@@ c of Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol by 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
&quot; it is expected to expect other high @-@ effective inhib@@ itors from CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ oxet@@ ine and par@@ oxet@@ ine , similar effects and therefore should be similar dos@@ ages . &quot;
&quot; in CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ ism , the common application with high @-@ effective inhib@@ itors from CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plas@@ ma central management can result in comparison to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ext@@ ensi@@ ven Met@@ abol@@ ism . &quot;
if you consider the common gift of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other high @-@ effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhib@@ itors with A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y , the potential use should take the potential risks to the patient . &quot;
&quot; other high @-@ effective inhib@@ itors from CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and HIV @-@ protein inhib@@ itors , should have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dos@@ ages . &quot;
&quot; after receipt of the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhib@@ itors , the dosage should be raised by A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y at the beginning of the accompan@@ iment therapy . &quot;
Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 together with A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y can be arranged with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol@@ - Con@@ centr@@ ations .
&quot; in clinical studies showed cans of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol per day no significant effect on the met@@ abolic rate of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ meth@@ yl@@ morph@@ in@@ an @-@ Rat@@ io ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) . &quot;
patients should be gr@@ ated to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or have a pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol .
&quot; due to the in@@ sufficient data base for the safety of people and due to the contrary , this drug must not be used in pregnancy , unless the possible use just@@ ifies the potential risk for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; however with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be war@@ ned of dangerous machines , including power vehicles , to operate until they are safe that Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol has no negative influence . &quot;
the following side effects occurred more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than under plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medical @-@ relevant side effects ( * ) :
&quot; the frequency of the down@@ side effects depends on the following criteria : common ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; sch@@ izophr@@ enia - In a controlled long @-@ term study about 52 weeks occurred in patients who were treated with Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol , Ak@@ ath@@ is@@ ie , D@@ yst@@ ony and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , compared to patients who were treated with Hal@@ oper@@ id@@ ol ( 5@@ 7.3 % ) . &quot;
in a plac@@ ebo controlled long @-@ term study about 26 weeks was the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol treatment and 13.@@ 1 % for patients under plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in another controlled long @-@ term study about 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 14,@@ 8 % was treated with patients who were treated with Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol , and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ zap@@ in therapy . &quot;
man@@ ic episodes associated with B@@ ipol@@ ar @-@ I @-@ disorder - In a controlled trial about 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 2@@ 3,5 % in patients under Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients under semi @-@ oper@@ ant treatment .
in another study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lith@@ ium treatment .
in the long @-@ term savings phase over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo controlled trial was the incidence of EPS 18.0 % for patients under Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for plac@@ ebo treated patients .
&quot; a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol and plac@@ ebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically controlled changes of rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratories , resulted in no medic@@ ally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; enh@@ anc@@ ements of CP@@ K ( creatine @-@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , in general temporarily and asym@@ pt@@ omatic , have been observed in 3.5 % of patients with Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol @-@ treated patients , compared to 2,0 % of the plac@@ ebo treated patients . &quot;
&quot; on the side @-@ side effects that can occur in connection with an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , the mal@@ ign@@ ite neuro@@ le@@ pt@@ ical syndrome , Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , and increased mort@@ ality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
in clinical studies and since the launch were un@@ intent@@ ional or intent@@ ional over@@ dos@@ ages with Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol alone with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without deaths .
&quot; although there is no information about the effectiveness of a hem@@ at@@ aly@@ se in the treatment of an over@@ dosage with Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol ; it is unlikely to be the hem@@ at@@ aly@@ se in the treatment of an over@@ dosage of benefits , since Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol points a high plas@@ map@@ ) . &quot;
it is suspe@@ cted that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol in sch@@ izophr@@ enia and b@@ ipol@@ ar @-@ I disorder on the combination of a particip@@ atory effect on D@@ op@@ amine D2@@ - and ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recept@@ ors .
&quot; Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol showed a high aff@@ inity to the D@@ op@@ amine D2@@ - and D3 recept@@ or and the ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- and 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a @-@ recept@@ or , as well as a moderate aff@@ inity to the D@@ op@@ amine 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , to the alpha @-@ 1 @-@ rep@@ ell@@ ows and to the hist@@ amine H@@ 1@@ recept@@ or . &quot;

&quot; in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1,@@ 228 sch@@ izophr@@ enia showed Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol compared to plac@@ ebo a statist@@ ically significantly stronger improvement of mental symptoms . &quot;
in a semi @-@ controlled trial in a week 52 of the share of the Respon@@ sible patients who played an approach to the study of media and played in both groups ( Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol 77 % and Hal@@ oper@@ id@@ ol 73 % ) .
&quot; current values from Mess@@ sk@@ als , which were defined as secondary studies , including PAN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - De@@ press@@ ption scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than in Hal@@ oper@@ id@@ ol . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo controlled study about 26 weeks in stabil@@ ized patients with chronic sch@@ izophr@@ enia , showed a significantly higher reduction of re@@ demption rate that lay at 34 % in the Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol group and at 57 % under plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ in @-@ controlled , multin@@ ational dual @-@ blind @-@ study with sch@@ izophr@@ enia about 26 weeks , the 314 patients turned into a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the output value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg in an average weight of ca . &quot;
in two plac@@ ebo controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage about 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of b@@ ipol@@ ar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance showed Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol a opposite plac@@ ebo ex@@ empt@@ ed effectiveness during reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a plac@@ ebo controlled Mon@@ otherapy study about 3 weeks with fixer dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of b@@ ipol@@ ar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance showed Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol against plac@@ ebo not excessive effectiveness .
&quot; in two Plac@@ ement@@ - and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies about 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a b@@ ipol@@ ar @-@ I @-@ disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , showed Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol a opposite plac@@ ebo ex@@ empt@@ ed effectiveness in week 3 and an inher@@ ent effect , which was comparable to that of lith@@ ium or Hal@@ oper@@ id@@ ol in week 12 . &quot;
Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol pointed out in a week 12 a comparable portion of patients with sympt@@ omatic re@@ mission of Man@@ ie on like lith@@ ium or Hal@@ oper@@ id@@ ol .
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo controlled trial about 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a b@@ ipol@@ ar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance , with or without psych@@ otic medication that spoke partly over 2 weeks not on lith@@ ium or val@@ pro@@ at @-@ mon@@ otherapy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms in comparison to mon@@ otherapy with lith@@ ium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; 10 In a plac@@ ebo controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term expansion phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic phase , which had been achieved by Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol during a stabil@@ isation phase opposite plac@@ ebo , mainly in the prevention of a b@@ ipol@@ ar return , pre@@ domin@@ antly in the prevention of a retreat into the Man@@ ie . &quot;
&quot; based on in vit@@ ro studies the enzymes CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 for the stretching of Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ yl@@ ation is cat@@ aly@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 . &quot;

&quot; at Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol there are no differences in the pharmac@@ oc@@ inet@@ ik between male and female healthy volunteers , as well as demonstrated in a pharmac@@ etic investigation of sch@@ izophr@@ enia patients with no gender @-@ dependent effects . &quot;
a popul@@ ations @-@ specific evaluation of the Pharmac@@ oc@@ inet@@ ik resulted in no reference to clin@@ ically significant differences with respect to ethnic affili@@ ation or the effect of smoking on pharmac@@ opo@@ oc@@ inet@@ d of Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol .
the pharmac@@ opo@@ etic properties of Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol were similar in patients with severe kidney failure in comparison to young healthy volunteers .
&quot; a single dose study at pro@@ b@@ anden with different liver flex@@ ology ( Child @-@ Pug@@ h Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the no@@ zzles of the liver function on the pharmac@@ opo@@ int of the class C , which is not sufficient to pull conclusions on their met@@ abolic capacity . &quot;

&quot; in analyses of sub @-@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe aggression , a similar effectiveness in relation to the overall population was observed , but a statistical Sign@@ ific@@ ance could be determined due to a decre@@ ased patient . &quot;
&quot; in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) at 1,@@ 228 sch@@ izophr@@ enia showed Ari@@ pip@@ raz@@ ol ( oral ) compared to plac@@ ebo a statist@@ ically significantly stronger improvement of mental symptoms . &quot;

the effectiveness of Abraham x@@ ane was examined in a main study which participated in the 460 women with metastatic breast cancer where approximately three quarters used to get an anth@@ rac@@ ycl@@ ine .
the effect of Abraham &apos;s ( in all@@ ele or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared to a conventional packing lit@@ ax@@ el ( given in combination with other drugs to reduce the side effects ) .
&quot; in total , they were included in the main study ( 31 % ) of the 229 with Abraham @-@ treated patients , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients , the conventional packing lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; if only the patients were treated for the first time for metastatic breast cancer , in terms of the effic@@ acy @-@ indic@@ ators , such as time up to deteri@@ oration of the disease and survival has no difference between drugs . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , the other treatments showed their metastatic breast cancer , with regard to these indicators that Abraham x@@ ane is more effective than conventional packing lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; it is also not allowed to use in patients , the breastfeeding or before the treatment of the treatment of low neutr@@ ality choices in the blood . &quot;
&quot; the committee on human therapeutic medicines ( CH@@ MP ) presented that Abraham &apos;s first treatment was no longer propos@@ es , more effective than conventional packing lit@@ ax@@ el included in contrast to other Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drugs , not to reduce side effects . &quot;
January 2008 the European Commission dedicated to the company &apos;s Bios@@ c@@ ience Limited a permit for the operation of Abraham &apos;s role in the European Union .
&quot; Abraham &apos;s Mon@@ otherapy is inde@@ xed for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients , where the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease is not displayed and is not displayed for the default anth@@ rac@@ ycl@@ ine therapy . ( see also Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe neutr@@ ality ( Neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ enz@@ ahl &lt; 0.50 x 109 / l above a period of one week or longer ) or severe sens@@ ory Neuropath@@ y during the &quot; &quot; x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to the following series to 220 mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; at sens@@ ory Neuropath@@ y grade 3 is the treatment to under@@ break , until a improvement to degree 1 or 2 will be reached , and in all subsequent cycles must be reduced by the dose . &quot;
there is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dosage adjustment in patients with easier to moder@@ ation of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
there were no studies carried out with patients with affected kidney function and there is currently no adequate data on the recommendation of dosage adjustment in patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; Abraham &apos;s no@@ vels is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to non @-@ sufficient data for in@@ compreh@@ en@@ sibility and effectiveness . &quot;
Abraham x@@ ane is an Alb@@ um@@ in @-@ baked nan@@ op@@ art@@ icul@@ ate @-@ wor@@ ding of packing lit@@ ax@@ el that could indicate considerably other pharmac@@ ological characteristics as other forms of packing lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
&quot; if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be replaced immediately and a sympt@@ omatic treatment should not be treated once again with packing lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
in patients there should be no ren@@ ew Abraham treatment cycles up to 1.5 x 109 / l and the Th@@ u@@ bo@@ zy@@ t@@ enz@@ ahl has risen again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with heavy liver disorders ( Bil@@ ir@@ ub@@ in &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abraham .
&quot; during a clearly marked with Abraham &apos;s car@@ di@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity , kar@@ di@@ ale inc@@ idents are not unusual , especially in patients with early anth@@ rac@@ ycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart disease . &quot;
&quot; if in the patients after the gift of Abraham &apos;s nausea , v@@ om@@ iting and di@@ ar@@ rhe@@ a , these can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ ics and consistently means . &quot;
&quot; Abraham &apos;s no@@ vels should not be used during pregnancy or at women in child@@ bearing age , which do not use effective recept@@ ionist , except the treatment of the mother with packing lit@@ ax@@ el is un@@ avo@@ id@@ able . &quot;
women in child@@ bearing age should apply during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abraham &apos;s a reliable contr@@ ace@@ ption method .
&quot; male patients who are treated with Abraham , will be advised , while and up to six months after treatment is no child to test@@ ify . &quot;
male patients should be advised in treating a sperm serv@@ icing since the therapy with Abraham x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
&quot; Abraham &apos;s can cause side @-@ effects such as fatigue ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( frequently ) , which can impact on traffic law and the ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; below are the most common and most important cases of side @-@ effects listed in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer , which were treated in the p@@ iv@@ ot@@ al clinical phase III study once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abraham . &quot;
Neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie was the most striking important hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ( at 79 % of patients ) and was quickly reversible and dos@@ ages ; Leu@@ kop@@ enia was reported at 71 % of patients .

&quot; in patients with chronic kidney in@@ suffic@@ iency or in patients who receive a chemotherapy , the her@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin@@ ations should always be in a recommended area ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) . &quot;
&quot; the iron @-@ values of all patients are before treatment to control , to ensure that no iron ails consists of , and ice @-@ energ@@ izers should be administ@@ ered during the entire treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients who receive a chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , one an@@ emia may be caused by a ery@@ thro@@ po@@ iet@@ al or so that the body is not sufficient to the body &apos;s own ery@@ thro@@ po@@ iet@@ in . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ iet@@ in is also applied to operations to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reducing the consequences of a blood pressure .
it is produced by a cell that has been brought into a gene ( DNA ) which was able to explo@@ it the formation of epo@@ xy in al@@ fa .
&quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared to adopt@@ ing as injection in a V@@ ene in the framework of a main study with total 479 patients , which caused by kidney problems caused by ren@@ al problems . &quot;
&quot; all participating in this study participating patients was at least eight weeks in E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in a v@@ ene , before they received either on se@@ perate or continued E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
main indic@@ ator for the effectiveness was the change of the her@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin@@ ary levels between the start of the study and the examination period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also laid out the results of a study in which the effects of under the skin have been investigated with the ones of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o with 114 cancer patients who received a chemotherapy .
&quot; in the study with patients who caused by ren@@ al problems caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ es values were maintained in the same measures as with those patients who continue to maintain E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to the patients , the continued E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o received an increase from 0,@@ 0@@ 63 g / dl of the output value of 12,@@ 0 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; the most common side @-@ effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which occasionally lead to symptoms of a encephal@@ opathy ( Hir@@ n@@ problems ) like sud@@ den , ste@@ am@@ ous mig@@ rant head@@ aches and confusion . &quot;
&quot; dis@@ bur@@ amed may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against epo@@ chs , or one of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; dis@@ bur@@ dened as injection under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems , as further studies are required to ensure that this can be trig@@ ger@@ ed by no allergic reactions . &quot;
&quot; the committee on human medicines ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the drug was conducted in accordance with the rules of the European Union of evidence , that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and effic@@ acy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;

in clinical studies an increased mort@@ ality risk and risk for serious cardiovascular events have been observed if Er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ese stimul@@ ating drugs ( ESA ) have been given by a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ es aim of over 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have no significant use that is attributed to the gift of epo@@ chs when the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ oc@@ ular concentration is increased by the control of the em@@ bodi@@ ly concentration and avo@@ iding blood trans@@ atlan@@ tic concentration .
the her@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin@@ ge increase should amount to approximately 1 g / dl ( 0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1,25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month per month to minim@@ ize the risk of an increase in hyper@@ tension .
in patients with chronic kidney in@@ suffic@@ iency and clin@@ ically evi@@ d@@ enter coron@@ ary heart disease should not be exceeded within the section 4.2 recommended upper limit of the her@@ mo@@ dest@@ ine goals .
&quot; after the time of these findings , through the treatment of an@@ emia with epo@@ chs in adults with kidney failure that are not di@@ alys@@ is , the progression of kidney failure are not acceler@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; in chemotherapy , patients should be considered for the assessment of the treatment efficiency of epo@@ xy in al@@ fa a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ xy @-@ al@@ fa @-@ gift and the ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ in response ( patients that may be trans@@ gres@@ sing ) . &quot;
if the HB @-@ rise is greater than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) each month or a HB @-@ value of 13 g / dl ( 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) has to minim@@ ize the dose in accordance with section 4.2 .
the decision for the application re@@ combin@@ able ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit of risk inher@@ ited in the involvement of the respective patient which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
&quot; for patients who are intended for greater ele@@ ctive orthop@@ edic surgery , if possible , before the beginning of the epo@@ xy therapy , the cause of an@@ emia is investigated and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; patients who under@@ go a greater ele@@ ctive orthop@@ a@@ edic proph@@ y@@ lax@@ is , since they have an increased risk for th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and v@@ ascular disease , especially in a underlying cardiovascular disease . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it cannot be excluded that in treatment with Epo@@ et@@ in al@@ fa for patients with a output bul@@ let of &gt; 13 g / dl an increased risk for post@@ operative botanical / v@@ ascular events can exist . &quot;

&quot; Epo@@ et@@ in al@@ fa used together with Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood level should be controlled by Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in and the Cic@@ los@@ por@@ ind@@ osis should be adapted to the rising ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ rit . &quot;
&quot; from in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ investigations on tum@@ ors , there are no evidence on a interaction between epo@@ xy in al@@ fa and G @-@ C@@ SF or GM @-@ C@@ SF regarding hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or pro@@ lifer@@ ation . &quot;

the most common side @-@ effect during treatment with epo@@ xy in al@@ fa is an dos@@ ed increase of blood pressure or the deteri@@ oration of an existing hyper@@ tension .
an increased incidence of thro@@ mb@@ al events ( see Section 4.4 and Section 4.8 - General ) was observed in patients under treatment with ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine .

there is an increased risk for th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bol@@ ic events in tum@@ our patients who are treated with re@@ combin@@ able human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ in and a negative effect on the overall survival cannot be excluded .
&quot; it is not clear how far these results are treated to the use of re@@ combin@@ able human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ in in tum@@ ors patients who are treated with chemotherapy , because of a few patients with these characteristics were included in the inspe@@ cted data . &quot;

kidney @-@ functioning Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid was associated with kidney disorders ( i.e. an increase in the Ser@@ um Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as ac@@ ute kidney failure .
the change in Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ( annually prior to administration ) and the appearance of kidney failure as well as a restricted kidney function were comparable to oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years compared to the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a- and the plac@@ ebo group .
a temporary increase in the Ser@@ um Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of G@@ abe was observed at 1.8 % of patients with A@@ cl@@ asta treated patients compared to 0.8 % of the patients treated with plac@@ ebo patients .
&quot; based on the evaluation of the laboratories , the temporarily asym@@ pt@@ omatic pot@@ assium values that were treated below 2,3 % of the patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta in a large clinical study patients compared to 21 % of the patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pag@@ et studies . &quot;
all patients received adequate quantities of vitamin D and calcium in the study on post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis in the study for prevention of clinical fra@@ ct@@ ures after a h@@ ips and in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pag@@ et studies ( see section 4.2 ) .

&quot; summary of the EP@@ AR for the public this document is a summary of the European public statement report ( EP@@ AR ) , in which it is described , such as the Committee on Human@@ pharmac@@ ology ( CH@@ MP ) , in order to see recommendations regarding the application of the drug . &quot;
Act@@ os is used for the treatment of type @-@ 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ ins@@ ulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) . • It can be used together with another di@@ ab@@ etic media ( Du@@ al@@ therapy ) .
it can also be used in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) associated with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose may not be satis@@ factory .
&quot; in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ant or ins@@ ulin , the previous dose of sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ant or ins@@ ulin can be kept in patients with hyp@@ ogly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here should be reduced the dose of sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ant or ins@@ ulin . &quot;
this means that the bodi@@ ly ins@@ ulin can be better processed and decre@@ ases the blood sugar levels which allows to better adjust type @-@ 2 diabetes .
&quot; more than 1 400 patients were examined the effectiveness of Act@@ os in Tri@@ ple@@ therapy ; in addition , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ant , in addition they received up to 3.5 years either Act@@ os or plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated her@@ mo@@ dest@@ ine , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) , which indicates how good the blood sugar is adjusted . &quot;
&quot; Act@@ os led to a low@@ ering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which leaves the blood sugar at the application of doses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg . &quot;
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ t study the effect of the additional gift of Act@@ os to existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ant in a low@@ ering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by 0.94 % , while the extra gift of plac@@ ebo increases to a reduction of 0,35 % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study which was examined in the combination of Act@@ os and ins@@ ulin at 28@@ 9 patients , the patients who took Act@@ os in addition to ins@@ ulin , a low@@ ering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of very much % after 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in the patients who participated in addition plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects associated with Act@@ os were vision disorders , infections of the upper respiratory tract ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hy@@ po@@ aesth@@ esia ( decre@@ ased sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) . &quot;
&quot; Act@@ os may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or one of the other ingredients , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or di@@ ab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ acid@@ osis - in the blood ) . &quot;
it has been decided that Act@@ os in the framework of a mon@@ otherapy ( in the sole use ) as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients should be displayed in which met@@ form@@ in is not displayed .
October 2000 announced the European Commission to the company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited creates a permit for the activation of Act@@ os throughout the European Union .
&quot; the tablets are white to white , round , curved and wear on one side the mark@@ ings &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the heading &quot; Act@@ os . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is also shown for a combination with ins@@ ulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is in@@ sufficient in@@ sufficient with ins@@ ulin in@@ adequate and in which met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance is un@@ suitable ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; for the use of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on for patients under 18 years of age are not available , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are at risk at least one risk factor ( e.g. earlier heart disease or sympt@@ omatic coron@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start the treatment with the lowest available dose and raise the dose . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of a heart failure , weight gain or oil , especially those with reduced cardi@@ ac reserve . &quot;
patients should be applied to signs and symptoms of a heart failure to gain weight gain and o@@ de@@ me when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is applied in combination with ins@@ ulin .
a cardiovascular out@@ come study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on patients under 75 years of age with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and the existing advanced mak@@ rov@@ as@@ cul@@ osis disease was performed .
this study showed an increase in reports about heart failure , which however does not lead to an increase in mort@@ ality in the study . &quot;
&quot; in patients with increased output of liver liver ( AL@@ T &gt; 2,5 x upper limit of the standard division ) , or with other signs of liver illness may not be used for Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on . &quot;
&quot; if the AL@@ T @-@ mirror is increased to 3 @-@ pole of the upper limit of the norm@@ ality , the liver values are as soon as possible again . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops symptoms resulting in a he@@ pat@@ ic dysfunction like e.g. un@@ explained nausea , v@@ om@@ iting , fatigue , appet@@ ite and / or dark Har@@ n , are the liver values to check . &quot;
the decision whether the treatment of the patient is continued with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on should be led to the privileg@@ e of the laboratory parameters of clinical assessment .
in clinical studies with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on has been demonstrated a dosage @-@ dependent weight gain by lip@@ ids and in some cases it is associated with a fluid ret@@ ention .
as a result of a hem@@ at@@ l@@ ution stood under the therapy with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on a slightly reduction in the middle hem@@ og@@ lob@@ es ( relative reduction of 4 % ) and the hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction of 4.3 % ) .
similar changes have been observed in compar@@ ative controlled studies with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients under Met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in um 3 @-@ 4 % ) and ins@@ ulin ( relative reduction of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ins by 1 @-@ 2 % and the hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its around 1 @-@ 3 % ) .
&quot; as a result of the increased ins@@ ulin resistance consists of patients , the Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on as or@@ ale two or two @-@ room combination therapy with ins@@ ulin , the risk of dose @-@ dependent hyp@@ ogly@@ c@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; after the launch of the market , including Pi@@ og@@ az@@ ol@@ id@@ ine , including Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , about a occurrence or a deteri@@ oration of a di@@ ab@@ etic mac@@ ular mac@@ ul@@ sion with a de@@ preci@@ ation of the visual shar@@ p@@ ness reports . &quot;
&quot; it is un@@ clear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and the appearance of mac@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ de@@ men , though patients should be aware of the possibility of a mac@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ de@@ ms . &quot;
&quot; in a summar@@ izing analysis of messages unwanted events regarding bone break@@ down , controlled , dou@@ bl@@ ossom clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.@@ 100 patients who were treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on . &quot;
the amount of fra@@ cture @-@ incidence was 1.9 fra@@ ct@@ ures per 100 patient years with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on treated women and 1.1 fra@@ ct@@ ures per 100 patient years with women who were treated with a compar@@ ative media .
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a study about 3.5 years in the investigation of cardiovascular events , occurred in 44 / 870 ( 5,@@ 1 % ; 1.0 fra@@ ct@@ ures per 100 patient years ) with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on treated patients , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 Fra@@ ct@@ ures per 100 patient years ) were treated with a compar@@ ative media . &quot;
patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy and if an patient wishes or occurs this is the treatment ( see section 4.6 ) .
&quot; research regarding the examination of the interactions have shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one has no relevant effects on the pharmac@@ ogen@@ ic or Phar@@ mak@@ od@@ ynam@@ ics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , phen@@ pro@@ cou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; interactions with medicines which are met@@ alli@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. or@@ ale contra@@ ze@@ p@@ tiv@@ a , Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Cal@@ ci@@ um@@ kan@@ al@@ blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A @-@ Redu@@ ct@@ as@@ ehem@@ mer are not expected . &quot;
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with Gem@@ fib@@ ro@@ z@@ il ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C8@@ - In@@ hib@@ itor ) results in an increase in Au@@ c by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on around the 3 @-@ fold .
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with Rif@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C8 @-@ indu@@ ctor ) results in a low@@ ering of the Au@@ c of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on around 54 % .
this is due to the fact that under treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on that is decre@@ ased in pregnancy and increased ins@@ ulin resistance of the matern@@ ity and thus decre@@ ased the availability of met@@ abolic substr@@ ates for red@@ dish growth .
&quot; common &gt; 1 / 10 ; common &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rarely &gt; 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , single cases : unknown ( from these data is not estimated ) . &quot;
these lead to a temporary change of the tur@@ mo@@ ors and the brake inde@@ xes of the lens as well as other hyp@@ ogly@@ ph@@ ic drugs .
&quot; in clinical studies with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , AL@@ T ascent of the upper limit of the standard area is often referred to as among plac@@ ebo , but rare than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff . &quot;
in a Out@@ come study in patients with the existing advanced mak@@ rov@@ as@@ cul@@ osis disease was the frequency of severe heart failure under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on around 1.6 % higher than under plac@@ ebo when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on b@@ z@@ w .
&quot; since the launch has been rarely reported about heart failure in Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , but more often when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was used in combination with ins@@ ulin or in patients with heart failure in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; it has been a summar@@ izing analysis of messages unwanted events regarding bone break@@ down , controlled , dou@@ bl@@ ossom clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on treated groups and more than 7.@@ 400 patients in the treatment of compar@@ ative treatment . &quot;
&quot; over a period of 3.5 years in current pro@@ active study , Fre@@ ct@@ ures were treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on patients , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients who were treated with a compar@@ ative media . &quot;
&quot; intake of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days occurred no symptoms . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on seems to work on a activation of specific nuclear recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator , Rece@@ pt@@ or @-@ processors ) , which leads to an increased ins@@ ulin ivity of liver , fat and skel@@ eton cells . &quot;
it could be shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is reduced to Glu@@ cos@@ e@@ production in the liver and increases the peri@@ ph@@ ere Glu@@ cos@@ al treatment in the event of ins@@ ulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on versu@@ s Gl@@ ic@@ la@@ zi@@ d as mon@@ otherapy has continued over two years to investigate the time up to follow the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8,0 % after the first 6 treatments .
&quot; at the time after two years after the beginning of therapy , a blo@@ om@@ able control could be maintained ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on at 69 % of patients treated ( compared to 50 % of patients under Gl@@ ic@@ la@@ zi@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ eb@@ ok@@ on@@ tro@@ ll@@ ated study about 12 months , patients , their blood sugar was in@@ adequate with ins@@ ulin in@@ adequate , to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo random@@ ized . &quot;
&quot; in patients under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c is reduced by cost % , compared to patients who continued only ins@@ ulin ; a reduction of ins@@ ulin use in which was treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on treatment . &quot;
in clinical studies a year at Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one has seen a statist@@ ically significant significant decline of the Alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Qu@@ ot@@ ine compared to the output values .
the effect of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versu@@ s plac@@ ebo ) was examined in a small group on 18 weeks on type @-@ 2 di@@ abet@@ ics .
in most clinical studies in comparison to plac@@ ebo a reduction of the overall plas@@ ma trig@@ ger@@ ide and the free fatty acids and a rise in the H@@ DL@@ - cholesterol levels as well as slightly , however clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL@@ - cholesterol levels . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on compared to plac@@ ebo , met@@ form@@ in or Gl@@ ic@@ la@@ zi@@ d the overall plas@@ ma rig@@ ts and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L Chol@@ ester@@ levels . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to plac@@ ebo was established under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on no statist@@ ically significant increase in L@@ DL Chol@@ ester@@ line , while under Met@@ form@@ in and Gl@@ ic@@ la@@ zi@@ d decre@@ ased values . &quot;
&quot; in a study about 20 weeks reduced Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , not only the jun@@ cture trig@@ ly@@ cer@@ ide , but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial trig@@ ly@@ cer@@ id@@ mirror , this both on an effect on the Trig@@ ly@@ zer@@ ide absorption as well as on the he@@ pat@@ ical trig@@ ly@@ cer@@ ide synthesis . &quot;
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a cardi@@ ac @-@ study , 52@@ 38 patients were random@@ ized with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre@@ existing advanced disease in groups that have previously received existing anti@@ di@@ ab@@ etic and cardi@@ ology therapy either Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; after or@@ aler application , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is fast res@@ or@@ ated , with the top @-@ con@@ centric Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in plas@@ ma usually reached 2 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; based on this basis the contribution of M @-@ IV is the effectiveness of the effectiveness of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot;
&quot; in Inter@@ action@@ ism , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on could not be a relevant effect on the pharmac@@ ogen@@ ic or Phar@@ mak@@ od@@ ynam@@ ics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , phen@@ pro@@ cou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with Gem@@ fib@@ ro@@ z@@ il ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C8@@ - In@@ hib@@ itor ) or with Rif@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C8 @-@ indu@@ ctor ) or low@@ ers the plas@@ ma central tip of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on ( see Section 4.5 ) .
after oral use of radio@@ active mark@@ eted Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in humans the mar@@ ker was mainly found in the barrel ( 55 % ) and to a lower extent of Har@@ n ( 45 % ) .
the mean plas@@ ma @-@ E@@ lim@@ in@@ ation@@ sh@@ alb@@ ran@@ ces of un@@ changed Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is at people 5 @-@ 6 hours and that of the entire active met@@ abolic rate is at 16 - 23 hours .
&quot; the plas@@ ma central management of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and its met@@ abolic function are lower than in patients with reduced kidney function , whereby the ro@@ asting of the or@@ bit clear@@ ance of the mother subst@@ it@@ ant however resem@@ ble . &quot;
&quot; in tox@@ ic@@ ological studies occurred at mice , rats , dogs and monkeys coinc@@ ided after repeated administration of plas@@ ma volume , an@@ emia and reversible ex@@ centric heart hyper@@ tro@@ phy . &quot;
this is due to the treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on which is decre@@ ased in treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on which is decre@@ ased in the development of hyper@@ ins@@ ulin and increased ins@@ ulin resistance to the matern@@ al substr@@ ates and thus reduces the availability of met@@ abolic substr@@ ates .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) the R@@ atte increased incidence of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( with male and female rats ) and tum@@ ors ( with male rats ) of the urinary tract epithel@@ ium .
&quot; in an animal model of the family @-@ like poly@@ pos@@ is ( FA@@ P ) , the treatment carried out with two other th@@ i@@ az@@ ol@@ no@@ ons to an increased frequency of col@@ ont@@ al . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to white , round , flat and wear on one side the mark@@ ings &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other side the heading &quot; Act@@ os . &quot;
the amount of fra@@ cture @-@ incidence was 1.9 fra@@ ct@@ ures per 100 patient years with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on treated women and 1.1 fra@@ ct@@ ures per 100 patient years with women who were treated with a compar@@ ative media .
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a study about 3.5 years in the investigation of cardiovascular events , occurred in 44 / 870 ( 5,@@ 1 % ; 1.0 fra@@ ct@@ ures per 100 patient years ) with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on treated patients , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 Fra@@ ct@@ ures per 100 patient years ) were treated with a compar@@ ative media . &quot;
in another study about two years the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in each with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or Gl@@ ic@@ la@@ zi@@ d studied .
in clinical studies about 1 year under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is a statist@@ ically significant significant decline of the Alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Qu@@ ot@@ ine compared to the output values .
&quot; in a study about 20 weeks reduced Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , not only the jun@@ cture trig@@ ly@@ cer@@ ide , but improved beyond a effect on the Tr@@ y@@ gly@@ cer@@ id@@ mirror , this is both via a effect on the Tr@@ y@@ gly@@ cer@@ ide absorption as well as on the he@@ pat@@ ic Tr@@ y@@ gli@@ cer@@ ide synthesis . &quot;
&quot; although the study was lacking in terms of its primary end@@ point out , which is a combination of the overall mort@@ ality , non @-@ deadly coron@@ ary cor@@ vas@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation and re@@ vas@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation of leg arter@@ ies , put the results close to the intake of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on no cardi@@ ac term risks . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to white , round , flat and wear on one side the mark@@ ings &quot; 45 &quot; and on the other side the heading &quot; Act@@ os . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a summar@@ izing analysis of messages unwanted events regarding bone break@@ down , controlled , dou@@ bl@@ ossom clinical trials were treated over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.@@ 100 patients who were treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , a increased incidence of bone bur@@ sts with women . &quot;
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a study about 3.5 years in the investigation of cardiovascular events , occurred in 44 / 870 ( 5,@@ 1 % ; 1.0 fra@@ ct@@ ures per 100 patient years ) with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on treated patients , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 Fra@@ ct@@ ures per 100 patient years ) were treated with a compar@@ ative media . &quot;

Act@@ u@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mir@@ rors that clearly stated that the blood sugar levels were similar to that of a different Human@@ ins@@ ulin .
Act@@ raph@@ s should not be used in patients who might be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic to Human@@ ins@@ ulin ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
&quot; in addition , the cans of Act@@ u@@ is@@ ans may be adapted when it comes together with a number of other medicines which can affect the blood sugar ( the full list is to be found ) . &quot;
the committee on human therapeutic medicines ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the benefits of Act@@ u@@ ary in the treatment of diabetes compared to the risks exceeded .
October 2002 the European Commission introduced to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S a permit for the activation of Act@@ raph@@ s throughout the European Union .

&quot; Aden@@ ur@@ ic is applied in patients used to have signs of cryst@@ all@@ abl@@ ag@@ ings , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in joints ) or g@@ icht@@ kn@@ ots ( &quot; stones &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if the urinary tract , after two to four weeks is still over 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter , the dose can increase daily 120 mg once daily . &quot;
&quot; during the first treatments , you can still occur se@@ iz@@ ures ; therefore , patients should take at least during the first six months under treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic even more drugs to contr@@ ace@@ ption of gre@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; the medicine is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ@@ tran@@ spl@@ ant , as it was not examined for these groups . &quot;
&quot; in the first study , at 1 0@@ 72 patients , the effic@@ acy was compared to different Aden@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) with the one plac@@ ebo ( pseud@@ o @-@ media ) and from All@@ op@@ ur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine used to treat hyper@@ ur@@ ic emia ) . &quot;
two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with All@@ op@@ ur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies All@@ op@@ ur@@ in@@ ol was applied in a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems were only 100 mg per day .
&quot; main indic@@ ator for the effectiveness was the number of patients , whose urinary tract has been in the blood for the last three measurements under 6 mg / dl . &quot;
&quot; in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of the patients , the Aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg took , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of the patients who took once a daily 120 mg in the blood of under 6 mg / dl . &quot;
&quot; compared to this , this was 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) patients under All@@ op@@ ur@@ in@@ ol and in any of the 134 patients under plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed on 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , di@@ ar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea and normal liver levels . &quot;
especially in patients with heart disease there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels .
&quot; the committee on human medicines ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in the low@@ ering of the urinary tract , but also a higher risk of side @-@ effects associated with the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic emia in diseases that have already led to U@@ rat@@ abl@@ ag@@ ings ( including one out of the history of known or currently present G@@ icht@@ kn@@ ot@@ ens and / or an ep@@ tic arthritis ) .
&quot; if the ser@@ um har@@ dening level after 2 @-@ 4 weeks still is &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , a dosage increase on AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily will be considered daily . &quot;

the primary effic@@ ien@@ end@@ point was in every study the proportion of patients in which the last three months of the patients were &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; plac@@ ebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 134 ) or 100 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with a ser@@ um created at the start of up to 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2,0 mg / dl &quot;
the AP@@ EX study showed with regard to the low@@ ering of the ser@@ um har@@ dening level under 6 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) ( see table 2 and figure 1 ) the stat@@ istic significant su@@ peri@@ ority doses of All@@ op@@ ur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the fact study showed with a view to the lasting reduction of the ser@@ um har@@ dening level under 6 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) the stat@@ istic significant su@@ peri@@ ority of both the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment of All@@ op@@ ur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
&quot; patients with Ser@@ um@@ kre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ valid@@ ate &gt; 1.5 and ≤ 2,0 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 509 ) , were att@@ ained for the analyses . * p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versu@@ s All@@ op@@ ur@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0,@@ 001 versu@@ s 80 mg &quot;
the reduction of the ser@@ um har@@ n@@ apping reference to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed in a week 2 and permanently retain@@ ed the entire treatment .
509 patients received All@@ op@@ ur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with Ser@@ um@@ kre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney functioning The AP@@ EX study sign@@ ifies the effectiveness of 40 patients with kidney functioning ( i.e. h ) .
with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C the primary effic@@ acy end@@ point at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) . &quot;
&quot; there were no clin@@ ically significant differences with regard to the pro@@ cent@@ red flight of the ser@@ um har@@ dened , regardless of their kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney disorders ) . &quot;
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ser@@ um har@@ dened rate of ≥ 10 mg / dl E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ act study ) had a ser@@ um @-@ concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
&quot; the data collected in two years collected from the open extension of the phase 3 showed that the lasting reduction of the ser@@ um har@@ dening level resulted in &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , so that less than 3 % of patients used in the months 16 @-@ 24 ( i.e. more than 97 % of the patients needed no treatment against a fork shift ) . &quot;
this was associated with a reduction of the gre@@ asy size which was in 54 % of the patients a complete dis@@ appearance of the G@@ lay@@ outs until month 24 .
&quot; increased T@@ SH@@ - Values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long term treatment with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 5,0 % ) , and also in patients who received All@@ op@@ ur@@ in@@ ol ( 5,@@ 8 % ) in the open long @-@ term extensions ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;

&quot; for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg is an increase in Au@@ c , which is greater than the dos@@ is@@ spro@@ port@@ ionate rise . &quot;
after taking easier or multi @-@ free doses of 80 to 120 mg 1 x daily the C@@ max is approximately 2.8 @-@ 3.8 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.6 µ@@ g / ml .
&quot; however , no clin@@ ically significant change in the proje@@ ct@@ ual decline in the ser@@ um har@@ dened rate has been observed if this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) . &quot;
distribution The apparent ste@@ ady state @-@ state volume ( V@@ ss / F ) by Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is in the range from 29 to 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
&quot; plas@@ ma rot@@ ates from Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at amounts to approximately 9@@ 9,@@ 2 % ( primary bond to Alb@@ um@@ in ) and is reached via the concentration width which is achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg , consistently . &quot;

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease where the bones fr@@ y are used ) in women after men@@ op@@ ause where a risk for a small vitamin D @-@ mirror lies .
&quot; patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or em@@ bedding of other medicines ( including Ant@@ ic@@ ida , Cal@@ ci@@ um@@ - and vit@@ amin@@ supplements ) . &quot;
&quot; to avoid a irrit@@ ation of the es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient may take place until after the first dietary consumption of the day , the ear@@ liest 30 minutes after taking the tablet is to take place . &quot;
&quot; since Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at and vitamin D3 already be used separately in medicines which are approved in the European Union , the company laid data from previous studies and the published literature . &quot;
the company also led to a study with 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to prove the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in terms of increasing vitamin D @-@ mir@@ rors .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment was the proportion of patients with low vitamin D @-@ mirror with the patients who were treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 11 % ) than with those who took exclusively Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( 32 % ) .
&quot; the company also placed data in the data that reflected in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , which is precisely the dose that is needed to prevent a bone loss . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of the movement of movement ( muscles , bones , or joints ) and symptoms of the digest@@ ive techniques such as abdom@@ inal pain , di@@ ar@@ rhe@@ a ( bl@@ owing ) , di@@ ar@@ rhe@@ a ( bl@@ owing ) , di@@ ar@@ rhe@@ a ( bl@@ ower ) as well as acid be@@ zz@@ lement . &quot;
&quot; in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity , vitamin D3 , or any other ingredients may not be used as AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE . &quot;
it may not be used in diseases of es@@ oph@@ agus ; in patients with hyp@@ oc@@ alc@@ emia ( ger@@ low calcium levels ) or in patients who are not er@@ ect at least 30 minutes long .
Janu@@ ary@@ 2007 shared the European Commission on the company Mer@@ ck Sharp &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd . a permit for the in@@ solven@@ cy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in the entire European Union .
&quot; capsule form , white to broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on the one side and &quot; 710 &quot; on the other side . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal ( including Ant@@ ac@@ ida , Cal@@ ci@@ um@@ - and vit@@ amin@@ supplements ) for the day . &quot;
the following hints are accurate to follow to reduce the risk for ös@@ oph@@ age@@ al irrit@@ ation and associated side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended to cut the tablet with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) as a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a . • The patient should not take place in front of the first dietary consumption of the day that is at the ear@@ liest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
&quot; B. pe@@ pt@@ ical Ul@@ kus , active gast@@ ro@@ intestinal ble@@ eding or surgical procedures in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract except P@@ yl@@ or@@ oplast@@ y , only under special attention ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; Ec@@ cl@@ oph@@ age@@ al reactions , such as ec@@ oph@@ ag@@ itis , ös@@ oph@@ age@@ al ul@@ cer@@ ions , rare followed by ös@@ oph@@ age@@ al stri@@ ctions , were rare in patients under the intake of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( partly were these serious and required a health assignment ) . &quot;
&quot; the doctor shall therefore be aware of all signs and symptoms resulting in possible solu@@ oph@@ age@@ al reactions , and the patients should be pointed out when the appearance of symptoms of ös@@ oph@@ age@@ al irrit@@ ation , or new or themselves en@@ imm@@ ering the medicine ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 The risk of severe ös@@ oph@@ age@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients , which the medicine should not take correctly and / or it returns to the appearance of sympt@@ om that point to a ös@@ oph@@ age@@ al irrit@@ ation . &quot;
it is very important that all dos@@ ing will be passed on to the patient and are understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; during in large scale clinical studies with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at no increased risk was rarely found , rarely ( after market launch ) Mag@@ - and Du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ cer@@ a , including some serious and with complications , reported ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose of the lap@@ se , usually reported in connection with a numer@@ ical traction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ om@@ yel@@ itis ) , was developed primarily with cancer patients , whose therap@@ ist was mainly used intra@@ ven@@ ous Bis@@ ph@@ os@@ phon@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; there are no data available to provide you , whether the de@@ bet of a bis@@ ph@@ os@@ phon@@ at@@ ry treatment in patients who require a purchase surgical procedure , the risk of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose of the lap@@ se . &quot;
the clinical evaluation by the treated doctor is critical for treatment planning in each patient based on an individual benefits risk assessment .
patients should be dependent on taking a dose of taking a dose of a dose of a dosage AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE the tablet in the next morning after they have noticed their dre@@ aming .
&quot; they should not take two tablets on the same day , but taking advantage of one tablet per week as originally planned on the scheduled week@@ day . &quot;
other diseases which affects the mineral metabolism ( like vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ idi@@ sm@@ us ) before the treatment of therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is also adequate .
&quot; Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at foods and drinks ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ ac@@ ida and some or@@ ale drugs can affect the res@@ or@@ ption of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at when they are taken at the same time . &quot;
&quot; therefore , patients need to wait for taking Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at least 30 minutes before they are taking other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although specific response studies were not conducted , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at in clinical trials were taken together with a variety of usually prescribed drugs , without being clin@@ ically relevant interactions occurred . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended solely for the application in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not to apply for pregnancy nor by breastfeeding women .
&quot; animal studies with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at leave no reference to directly damages effects in terms of pregnancy , the embryonic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development . &quot;
oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose of the lap@@ se was reported in patients under bis@@ ph@@ os@@ phon@@ ati ; most reports are reported by cancer patients , but also in oste@@ opor@@ osis patients were reported . &quot;
&quot; however , took off the ser@@ um @-@ Cal@@ ci@@ ums up to &lt; 8.0 mg / dl ( 2,0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the Ser@@ um@@ - phosph@@ ate to ≤ 2,0 mg / dl ( with@@ ered m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in both treatment groups with similar frequency . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at as a result of or@@ ally over@@ d@@ osis may occur hyp@@ oc@@ alc@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ age@@ at@@ emia and side effects in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach @-@ co@@ res , so@@ ils , gast@@ ritis or Ul@@ cer@@ a . &quot;

Adv@@ ag@@ raf is administ@@ ered to which a kidney or liver was tran@@ spl@@ anted to prevent a rep@@ ul@@ sion of tran@@ spl@@ anted organs by the immune system .
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft already employed in the EU , the company has submitted the results of the published studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft and data from the published literature . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results of a clinical study was presented to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transfer , whereby the application of Adv@@ oc@@ raf was compared with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; main indic@@ ator of the effectiveness was the number of patients , with which the tran@@ spl@@ ant was charged according to a treatment duration of one year ( by using for example , as often an inher@@ ent organ tran@@ splant@@ ation or a re@@ sum@@ ption of di@@ alys@@ is required ) . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , further studies have been carried out in 119 patients with kidney disorders and 129 patients with liver tran@@ splant@@ ation and studied , such as Adv@@ ag@@ raf in comparison to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft from the body . &quot;

only doctors who are familiar with the immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive therapy and the treatment of tran@@ spl@@ ant patients should make this drug or make changes in the immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive therapy .
&quot; due to clin@@ ically relev@@ ance , differences of the system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , this can lead to tran@@ splant@@ ation or an increased incidence of side @-@ effects , including under@@ - or super@@ immune @-@ sup@@ pression . &quot;
patients should always keep the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us form@@ ulation and the appropriate daily dose ; trans@@ itions of wor@@ ding or regime should be made only under the nar@@ row@@ ful control of one in the tran@@ splant@@ ation of experienced physician ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; as a result of a conversion to an alternative wor@@ ding , has to be carried out a therapeutic drug monitoring and corresponding dosage adjustment to ensure that the system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains . &quot;
the dosage of Adv@@ ag@@ raf should be based primarily on the clinical evaluation of rep@@ ul@@ sion and compatibility in individual cases and on blood pressure ( see below .
after conversion from pro@@ gra@@ f on Adv@@ ag@@ raf should be controlled at the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ Tal@@ spiegel from the conversion and over two weeks after conversion .
&quot; on day 4 was the system@@ ic exposure , measured as a talents , with both forms both with kidney and le@@ d@@ tran@@ spl@@ ant patients . &quot;
careful and repet@@ itive inspe@@ ctions of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ Tal@@ spiegel are recommended during the first two weeks after tran@@ splant@@ ation under Adv@@ ag@@ raf in order to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate post@@ tran@@ splant@@ ation phase .
&quot; da Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low clear@@ ance , can take an adaptation of the Adv@@ oc@@ raf dos@@ is@@ schem@@ as several days until the Sty@@ ady State is reached . &quot;
&quot; if the state of the patient allowed in the first post@@ operative phase no or@@ ale intake of drugs , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ treatment intra@@ ven@@ ous ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentration for the production of an inf@@ usion solution ) are introduced to a dose of ca . &quot;
&quot; duration of the application in the op@@ pression of tran@@ splant@@ ation , the immune @-@ sup@@ pression must be maintained ; consequ@@ enter@@ al therapy cannot be specified as a maximum duration of the oral therapy . &quot;
dosage Recomm@@ end@@ ations - Nier@@ ed@@ spl@@ ant proph@@ y@@ lax@@ is of tran@@ splant@@ ation The or@@ ale Adv@@ ag@@ raf therapy should start with 0.@@ 20 - 0,30 mg / kg / day as once daily fork in the morning .
further doses can be required later in the course of the phar@@ yn@@ chron@@ icle of t@@ ac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the course of stabil@@ isation of the patient after the tran@@ splant@@ ation .
dosage recommendations - liver tran@@ splant@@ ation proph@@ y@@ lax@@ is of tran@@ splant@@ ation The or@@ ale Adv@@ ag@@ raf therapy should start with 0.10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily fork in the morning .
dosage Recomm@@ end@@ ation - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f on Adv@@ ag@@ raf is a tran@@ splant@@ ation of twice daily intake of pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to a once daily intake of Adv@@ ag@@ raf set to a once daily intake of Adv@@ ag@@ raf set up to the entire daily dose .
kidney and liver tran@@ splant@@ ation after a change from other immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ ants in Adv@@ ag@@ raf once daily must start the treatment with each in kidney and liver tran@@ spl@@ ant initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis for the proph@@ y@@ lax@@ is of tran@@ splant@@ ation .
tran@@ tran@@ spl@@ ant With adult patients who are placed on Adv@@ ant@@ raf is an or@@ ale initi@@ al@@ dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day once daily in the morning .
&quot; other tran@@ spl@@ ant received , though there is no clinical experience with Adv@@ ag@@ raf in an or@@ ative initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis of 0.10 - 0.15 mg / kg / day , with intestinal tran@@ spl@@ ant patients in an or@@ ic initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis of 0,@@ 3 mg / kg / day . &quot;
dosage adjustment in special patient groups with reduced liver function for maintaining blood mirror in the desired area can be required in patients with severe liver disorders in patients with severe liver disorders .
patients with reduced kidney function Da kidney function has no effect on the pharmac@@ opo@@ etic of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be assumed that a dosage adjustment is not necessary .
&quot; however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potenti@@ als of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , a careful monitoring of kidney function ( including a regular provision of the ser@@ um incre@@ mental level , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ ence and supervision of the urinary tract ) . &quot;
conversion from Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in on Adv@@ ag@@ raf in the conversion from a Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in@@ - on a t@@ ac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is not available ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations for the talents in full bl@@ ut The dose should be based primarily on the clinical evaluation of rep@@ ul@@ sion and compatibility in the individual case under the help of full bl@@ ut @-@ Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ Tal@@ spiegel inspe@@ ctions .
it is recommended to conduct frequent inspe@@ ctions of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ Tal@@ spiegel during the first two weeks after tran@@ splant@@ ation followed by perio@@ dic controls during degra@@ dation therapy .
&quot; blood levels of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also change after conversion from pro@@ gra@@ f on Adv@@ ag@@ raf , dosage adjustment , changes of immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive therapy or in simultaneous use of substances that can change the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us full @-@ blood@@ concentration ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; as Adv@@ ag@@ raf is a medicine with a low clear@@ ance , adjustments the dose may need several days until the ste@@ ady state is entered . &quot;
the data in clinical trials let them conclude that a successful treatment is possible in most cases when the talents in the blood 20 n@@ g / ml do not exceed .
in clinical practice the talents of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us usually occur in the first time after liver tran@@ splan@@ ts in the range of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and with kidneys - and heart@@ ed patients at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml .
&quot; during the subsequent treatment therapy of liver , kidney and cardi@@ ac @-@ tran@@ splant@@ ation have been used in general cons@@ or@@ ations in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; this has led to serious unwanted events , including tran@@ splant@@ ation or other side @-@ effects , which may occur in a consequence of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Unter@@ - or Over@@ ex@@ position . &quot;
patients should always keep the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us form@@ ulation and the appropriate daily dose ; trans@@ itions of wor@@ ding or regime should be made only under the nar@@ row@@ ful control of one in the tran@@ splant@@ ation of experienced physician ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; 5 In order to treat patients with tran@@ splant@@ ation , which has proven against other immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ ants , there are not a clinical data for the ret@@ ardi@@ zed wor@@ ding Adv@@ ag@@ raf . &quot;
for proph@@ y@@ lax@@ is the tran@@ splant@@ ation of the tran@@ spl@@ ant @-@ tran@@ splant@@ ation and tran@@ splant@@ ation in the Kind@@ es@@ old there are not a clinical data for the ret@@ ardi@@ zed wor@@ ding Adv@@ ag@@ raf .
&quot; due to possible interactions formed into the blood and weak@@ ening of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the intake of the clinical effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , is the intake of herbal supplements , the cur@@ rant ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) is to avoid cur@@ rant ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with Di@@ ar@@ rh@@ ö is a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - concentr@@ ations in the blood , as the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels can be subje@@ cted to considerable fluctu@@ ations under such circumstances . &quot;
in rare cases under pro@@ gra@@ f was to be observed as Kar@@ di@@ omy@@ opathy or Sept@@ um@@ hyper@@ tro@@ phy that can therefore be seen at Adv@@ ag@@ raf .
&quot; further factors to increase the risk of such clinical disorders , are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cort@@ ic@@ ost@@ ero@@ ids , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver disorders , infection , fluid . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ ants , the effect of sunlight or UV @-@ light should be restricted due to appropriate clothing or use of a sun protection by means of a high protection factor . &quot;
&quot; if patients , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us are taking symptoms for PRE@@ S such as head@@ aches , altered consciousness , cryp@@ ts and tend@@ encies should be a radi@@ ographic examination ( e.@@ g ) . &quot;
&quot; as Adv@@ ag@@ raf set , ret@@ ardi@@ zed , L@@ act@@ ose is included in patients with the rare her@@ ed@@ itable g@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lact@@ ating lack or gl@@ uc@@ ose g@@ act@@ ose g@@ oc@@ osis special care . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous use of drugs or herbal remedies which are known as inhib@@ itors or indu@@ ctors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can increase or decrease the metabolism of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and thus reduce the blood levels of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or lower . &quot;
&quot; hence , it is recommended to change the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - blood levels at the same time of substances that can change the CY@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and to adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose for maintaining simultaneous concentr@@ ations accordingly ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; a strong pronoun@@ ced interaction with An@@ tim@@ yk@@ ot@@ ika such as K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , Flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and Vor@@ icon@@ az@@ ole , as well as with the Macro@@ heat antibiotic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV @-@ prot@@ ect@@ omy ( z ) . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ opo@@ etic studies , that the rise of blood levels are mainly from the increased bio@@ availability of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , due to the inhib@@ ition of gast@@ ro@@ intestinal metabolism . &quot;
&quot; high @-@ dos@@ ed Pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on , as it is used for ac@@ ute break@@ down , the concentration of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can increase or decrease . &quot;
the effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on the metabolism of other medicines t@@ ac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ Hem@@ mer ; therefore the simultaneous use of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be metabol@@ ized by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
&quot; as Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the Clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid contra@@ di@@ tiv@@ a is down and thus enhance the hormon@@ al exposure is especially cau@@ ti@@ ous in decisions about rece@@ p@@ tive measures particularly cau@@ ti@@ ously . &quot;
the results of animal try to reduce the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us potentially the clear@@ ance of pent@@ ob@@ stru@@ al and Phen@@ az@@ on and to extend their half @-@ life .
the results of a limited number of investigations in tran@@ splant@@ ation patients do not provide notice that under Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us compared to other immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ ants an increased risk for unwanted events with regard to the course and result of pregnancy .
&quot; in uter@@ o Ex@@ position , a supervision of the new@@ bor@@ ns recomm@@ ends itself to any det@@ ri@@ mental effects of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( especially in terms of its effect on the kidneys ) . &quot;
there is the risk of an early birth ( &lt; Week 37 ) and a hyper@@ cal@@ i@@ emia ( incidence of the new@@ born 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns ) i.e. :

it was reported on ben@@ ign or mal@@ ign@@ ant Neop@@ las@@ ms including EB@@ V@@ - Associ@@ ated l@@ ymp@@ ho@@ pro@@ lifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ors in conjunction with the treatment of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
&quot; due to its high molecular weight , its low water @-@ solu@@ bility and the high bond of ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plas@@ map@@ rot@@ ein may be assumed that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is not di@@ alys@@ is . &quot;

&quot; based on the first @-@ term data of the CH@@ MP , the CH@@ MP data has continued to be positive as positive , but into consideration that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons : &quot;
&quot; therefore the CH@@ MP based on the security process of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which makes a fil@@ ing of PS@@ UR@@ s every 6 months , decided to request the authorisation system in 5 years . &quot;
December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited was officially distributed with the Committee on Human@@ pharmac@@ ology ( CH@@ MP ) that the company has its application for permission of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
&quot; however , the chest , the brain , the bones , or the soft parts ( tissues , the other structures in the body connects , surround and supported ) . &quot;
&quot; it is a kind of virus , that is gen@@ etically so modified that there is a gene in the cells of the body . &quot;
&quot; in the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in , it is a &quot; &quot; Aden@@ ov@@ irus &quot; , &quot; that is so modified , that there cannot be copies of themselves and thus cannot trigger infections in humans . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; adv@@ ent in the tum@@ ors could be put forward directly into the tum@@ ors and thus the cancer cells should be made again to form the normal p@@ 53 protein . &quot;
&quot; the p@@ 53 protein , which is formed from the not defe@@ ctive in the human body existing p@@ 53 gene , usually contributes to the restoration of cor@@ rupt DNA and to protect the cells when the DNA can not be restored . &quot;
&quot; at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ cancer , where the p@@ 53 Gen is defe@@ ctive , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share . &quot;
&quot; the company laid data from a trial with a patient prior to the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer in the field of sub @-@ tree , in the bones and in the brain . &quot;
&quot; after the CH@@ MP , the answers of the company had been tested on the questions , were still some questions un@@ solved . &quot;
based on the testing of initial submitted documents will be created by the CH@@ MP on Day 120 a list of questions that will be sent to the company .
after viewing the CH@@ MP was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ tum@@ ours are benefits for patients .
&quot; the committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company had not been demonstrated sufficient that advoc@@ acy can be produced in a reliable way and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who are in close contact with the patient . &quot;
the company has not dealt with the CH@@ MP whether the retro@@ spective consequences for patients who currently participate in clinical trials or &quot; com@@ edy @-@ Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
changing real@@ izing means that the tablets are so mer@@ ged that one of the effective components are immediately released and the other slowly is connected over a few hours .
&quot; aer@@ os@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of season@@ al allergic rhin@@ itis , by an allergy against pol@@ len s@@ igh inflammation of the nas@@ al urinary tract ( hidden nose ) in patients with nose @-@ skin in@@ con@@ gest@@ ant nose ) . &quot;
&quot; in adults and adol@@ esc@@ ents from 12 years , the recommended dose of aer@@ obic twice a tablet that is to be taken with a glass of water with or without food . &quot;
&quot; the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and end , as soon as the symptoms , especially the sw@@ elling of the nas@@ al skin . &quot;
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be trac@@ ed to the const@@ ipation of the nose .
&quot; the main @-@ effective dimensions were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the Hitt@@ ites , which were reported by patients before the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment . &quot;
&quot; during the trial , patients received their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and rated with a standard sc@@ ala , as hard the symptoms were in the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; with contem@@ plation of all he@@ us@@ chn@@ u@@ pf@@ ym@@ pt@@ ome , except the const@@ ipation of the nose reported the patients , the aer@@ ob@@ tains of symptoms by 46.@@ 0 % , compared to 35.@@ 9 % in patients , the pseud@@ o@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ in alone . &quot;
&quot; if only the sw@@ elling of the nas@@ al fores@@ kin was considered , the patients among the symptoms led by 3@@ 7,@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients who took the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in alone . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of aer@@ ob@@ ics ( observed on 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) , ach@@ yn@@ ge@@ itis ( rub@@ bing ) , A@@ no@@ re@@ x@@ ie ( appet@@ ite ) , const@@ ipation , head@@ aches , fatigue , in@@ som@@ ing ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , ins@@ om@@ nia and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ ob@@ ics may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , Pseud@@ o@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine or one of the other ingredients , against rep@@ in@@ no@@ cent agents or Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( another medicine for the treatment of allergies ) are not applied . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ os@@ ze may not be used in patients that suffer from a bott@@ om@@ less eye pressure , cardi@@ ac or v@@ ascular disease , including hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ re@@ osis ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ function of the thy@@ roid ) or have a risk to have a h@@ amm@@ or@@ rh@@ ic stroke . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 the European Commission announced the company SP Europe a permit for the operation of aer@@ ob@@ ío , throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , however , is in the whole too s@@ wal@@ low ( i.e. without them to break , to cr@@ ashing or to che@@ w ) . &quot;
aer@@ os@@ ze should not be applied to children under 12 years due to the ble@@ eding and effectiveness ( see section 5.1 ) in children under 12 years of age .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after sound the symptoms .
&quot; it is recommended to limit the period of time to 10 days , because at long @-@ time application the activity of pseud@@ o@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine can be removed with the time . &quot;
&quot; after decrease the sw@@ elling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper breath , the treatment can be continued with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in as mon@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; da Aer@@ og@@ s pseud@@ o@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine contains , the drug is also contra@@ sted in patients who are treated with a mon@@ o@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhib@@ itors or within 2 weeks after termination of such therapy . &quot;
&quot; this is attributed to the alphabet@@ ical application of pseud@@ o@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ in with other vas@@ o@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ in , Per@@ gol@@ id , Cab@@ ar@@ amine , Cab@@ g@@ amin , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amin or other De@@ kon@@ gest@@ iva , phen@@ y@@ le@@ der@@ in , Ep@@ he@@ dr@@ in , O@@ xy@@ met@@ ac@@ olin , Nap@@ haz@@ in , O@@ xy@@ met@@ ac@@ olin , Nap@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) . &quot;
security and the effectiveness of these combination therapy have not been tested and the data are not sufficient to address corresponding recommendations for dosage .
&quot; the security and effectiveness of aer@@ ob@@ ances were not tested in patients with kidney or liver , and the data is not sufficient to address corresponding recommendations for dosage . &quot;
patients must be informed about that treatment in appearance of hyper@@ tension or a t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ riers or by Pal@@ pit@@ ations , cardi@@ ac rhyth@@ mi@@ ums , nausea or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or by strengthening the head@@ aches ) . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of the following patient groups , patients with hyper@@ tension • patients with hyper@@ tension • patients with hyper@@ tension • patients with hyper@@ tension in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , Blas@@ en@@ hal@@ sob@@ stru@@ ction or bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ asm in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
aer@@ ina@@ ze is at least 48 hours before performing dermat@@ ological tests that anti@@ hist@@ amine otherwise can prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin actions or in their scale .
&quot; in the framework of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administ@@ ered , however there were no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes of the plas@@ ma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the results of the psychological testing , no significant differences could be found between the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and the patients treated with plac@@ ebo patients regardless of whether Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in alone or with alcohol is taken . &quot;
&quot; this enzyme was not identified for the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , so that interactions with other drugs cannot be excluded completely . &quot;
&quot; des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in inhib@@ its in @-@ vi@@ vo CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 not , and in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhib@@ ited and neither a substr@@ ate nor an inhib@@ itor of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ one . &quot;
the in@@ conce@@ iv@@ ities of the use of aer@@ os@@ ze during pregnancy is not assured that experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ anc@@ ies have no increasing the frequency of ab@@ normal@@ ities compared to the frequency of the normal population .
&quot; since Re@@ production studies have not always been transmitted to human animals , and due to the vas@@ oc@@ on@@ str@@ ic@@ ect@@ ic properties of pseud@@ o@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine should not be used in pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be informed about it that in very rare cases it can come in very rare cases that can lead to impair@@ ment or ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; symptoms may vary between a Z@@ S @-@ Depression ( se@@ di@@ ment , ap@@ nea , decre@@ ased mental attention , cy@@ an@@ osis , Kom@@ a , heart @-@ circulation ) and a Z@@ NS stimulation ( ins@@ om@@ nia , con@@ vul@@ sions , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ tu@@ al inter@@ vals . &quot;

&quot; a Z@@ NS stimulation is particularly likely in children , as well as A@@ tropical in @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth dry , d@@ ill@@ en@@ star@@ re , and di@@ lat@@ ation , hyper@@ therm@@ ia and gast@@ ro@@ intestinal symptoms ) . &quot;
&quot; these include both the inhib@@ ition of the activation of proje@@ ctions such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human poles / Bas@@ ophil@@ es an as well as the inhib@@ ition of expression of Ad@@ h@@ äs@@ ion@@ sm@@ ol@@ ec@@ ls P @-@ S@@ elect@@ ro on End@@ ot@@ hel@@ cells . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with adults showed des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg no influence on standard measurement sizes of the flight performance , including the ampl@@ ification of subjective conclusions or the tasks that are connected to flying . &quot;
in controlled clinical studies at the recommended dosage of 5 mg a daily frequency of sle@@ ep@@ iness was established compared to plac@@ ebo .
&quot; the or@@ ale application of pseud@@ o@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ in in the recommended dosage can give more sympath@@ etic effects such as an increase of blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ die or manifest@@ ations of a Z@@ NS @-@ arous@@ al . &quot;
&quot; 1.@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with season@@ al allergic rhin@@ itis , with 4@@ 14 patients Aer@@ og@@ s tablets received . &quot;
&quot; in both studies the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic effectiveness of aer@@ ina@@ ze tablets , determines the basis of the total co@@ res for the sympt@@ omatic ( except nas@@ al glands ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseud@@ o@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ in over the two @-@ week treatment times . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of aer@@ obic tablets with regard to the ab@@ ell@@ owing effect , determined by the nose @-@ skin @-@ skin , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in over the two @-@ week treatment times . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of aer@@ ina@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or ethnic groups . &quot;

&quot; for children aged 6 to eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once daily , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup . &quot;
A@@ eri@@ us was examined in total eight studies with about 4 800 adults and young people with allergic rhin@@ itis ( including four studies in season@@ al allergic rhin@@ itis and two studies in patients who also had as@@ thma ) .
&quot; the effectiveness has been measured by changing the symptoms of symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the squares , impair@@ ment of sleep and the efficiency of the day ) before and after six@@ ty treatment was determined . &quot;
&quot; further studies have been submitted to show that the body has the sy@@ rup , the solution to em@@ bedding and the mel@@ ting tablets in the same way are classified as the tablets and the application for children . &quot;

there are limited experience of clinical trials for effectiveness in the application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in at adol@@ esc@@ ents from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of inter@@ mitt@@ ing allergic rhin@@ itis ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be completed according to the result of the previous disease and can be re@@ sum@@ ed according to the end of the symptoms .
&quot; in the Pers@@ istent allergic rhin@@ itis ( occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) , patients may be recommended during the allergy @-@ time treatment . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not established within the framework of clinical studies with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in tablets when ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administ@@ ered ( see under Section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study was reduced by A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol the performance effect of alcohol ( see under section 5.1 ) .
&quot; however , patients should be informed about it that in very rare cases it can come to Ben@@ om@@ men@@ ness that can lead to impair@@ ment of transportation or ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies in various indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , than in patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side @-@ side effects , which was reported more frequently than with plac@@ ebo were fatigue ( 1.2 % ) , mouth@@ wash ( 0,@@ 8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0,@@ 6 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial with 5@@ 78 youth@@ ful patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common side @-@ effect head@@ aches , these occurred in 5,@@ 9 % of patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and were treated with 6.8 % of patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ class study , when up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( ninth clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects have been observed . &quot;
&quot; this includes both the inhib@@ ition of the activation of proje@@ ctions such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human poles / Bas@@ ophil@@ es an as well as the inhib@@ ition of expression of Ad@@ h@@ äs@@ ion@@ sm@@ ol@@ ec@@ ls P @-@ S@@ elect@@ ro on End@@ ot@@ hel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical study involving multi @-@ training , in a dosage of up to 20 mg twice a day over 14 days a stat@@ istic or clin@@ ically relevant cardi@@ ac effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in the Des@@ oc@@ at@@ ad@@ in in a dosage of 45 mg a daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of clinical dose ) was given over ten days a prolong@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c inter@@ v@@ alls . &quot;
&quot; in a stand@@ dos@@ ing study with adults showed des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg no influence on standard measurement sizes of the flight performance , including strengthening subjective conclusions or the tasks that are connected with the flies . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rhin@@ itis was A@@ eri@@ us effective in alle@@ vi@@ ating the symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , Nas@@ en@@ secre@@ tion and Ju@@ er@@ re@@ iz of the nose , itch , pot@@ tery and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching of the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in season@@ al and per@@ enn@@ ial , allergic rhin@@ itis can also be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis . &quot;
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as a appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as a appearance of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
&quot; as on the basis of the entire question@@ n@@ aire of the question@@ n@@ aire regarding the quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ Kon@@ jun@@ ctiv@@ itis , di@@ min@@ ishes A@@ eri@@ us effectively caused by season@@ al allergic rhin@@ itis . &quot;
&quot; the chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria has been investigated as the underlying path@@ ophy@@ si@@ ology , because the underlying path@@ ophy@@ si@@ ology is similar to the e@@ ti@@ p@@ ology in the different forms and chronic patients can become easier to pro@@ spect@@ ively . &quot;
&quot; since the hist@@ amine is a ob@@ li@@ ative factor in all ur@@ gency disorders , is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is expected to improve the symptoms in other forms of ur@@ gency to an improvement of symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines . &quot;
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria was A@@ eri@@ us effective in the improvement of pr@@ ur@@ itus and the low@@ ering of size and number of squares at the end of the first dos@@ is@@ inter@@ v@@ alls . &quot;
&quot; as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ika , the minority of patients , which was not excluded on anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ika , from the study . &quot;
an improvement of the itch around more than 50 % was observed at 55 % of patients with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in patients compared to 19 % of the patients treated with plac@@ ebo patients .
&quot; the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the disorder of sleep and w@@ ashes , as it was measured by a 4 @-@ out scale to assess these variables . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ opo@@ etic study , in which the patients were comparable with the general season@@ al allergic rhin@@ itis population , was achieved by 4 % of patients a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in . &quot;
there are no quot@@ ation points for a clinical relevant Kum@@ ulation after once daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days ago .
&quot; however , this is not identified for the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine . however , it is not identified , so that interactions with other medicines will not be excluded completely . &quot;

&quot; A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals , to alle@@ vi@@ ate the symptoms in allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ing and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see under section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the prescription doctor should be aware that most cases of rhin@@ itis in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see under Section 4.4 ) and that there is no data to support a infe@@ ctive rhin@@ itis with A@@ eri@@ us .
&quot; besides the exclusion of upper respiratory infections , or anatom@@ ical an@@ om@@ al@@ ies should play a role in the diagnosis of an@@ am@@ n@@ ese , physical investigations and skin investigations . &quot;

clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not established within the framework of clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets were not established in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administ@@ ered ( see under Section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study was not enhanced with simultaneous intake of A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol the performance effect of alcohol ( see under section 5.1 ) .
the overall frequency of side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us sir@@ up group as with the plac@@ ebo group .
&quot; in clinical studies with adults and young people in various indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ gency , were reported at the recommended dose 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , than in patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ class study of adults and adol@@ esc@@ ents , when up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( n@@ in@@ ety clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; children aged between 1 and 11 years , who came in question for an anti@@ hist@@ amine treatment of 1.25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) . &quot;
&quot; because the course of allergic rhin@@ itis / chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ gency and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in adults and children are similar , the effic@@ acy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in at adults can be extr@@ ap@@ ol@@ ated in adults on the children &apos;s population . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical trial with multiple adults and adol@@ esc@@ ents , in a dosage of up to 20 mg a day was applied for 14 days a day , no statist@@ ically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardi@@ ac effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adol@@ esc@@ ents , in a dosage of 45 mg a daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of clinical dose ) was applied over ten days at adults , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c inter@@ v@@ alls . &quot;

June 2008 Nov@@ art@@ is V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. to the committee of Human@@ it@@ un@@ ov ( CH@@ MP ) officially announced that the company takes its application for permission of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to prevent the avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 @-@ influ@@ enza in adults and older people .
&quot; A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and older people for the protection against fl@@ u , which is caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the In@@ flu@@ enza @-@ A virus . &quot;
&quot; this is a special kind of vaccine that could cause a strain of influ@@ enza , which could cause a future pan@@ dem@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; a Gri@@ p@@ pe@@ pan@@ dem@@ ic breaks out when a new strain of the Gri@@ p@@ pe@@ virus appears , which can easily be spread from man to man , because human beings have no imm@@ unity ( no protection ) against it . &quot;
&quot; according to the approval of the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the immune system contained in the vaccine contained in the vaccine as &quot; physically and forms antibodies against it . &quot;
this makes the immune system later in the position to make contact with a fl@@ u virus of this regul@@ ate faster antibodies .
&quot; subsequently , the membrane envelop@@ e of the virus with the &quot; surface area &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which det@@ ects the human body as bodi@@ ly det@@ ects ) , cleans@@ ed and as part of the vaccine . &quot;
a inspection of some of the studies showed that the study was not conducted in accordance with the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
thus the scope of the clinical data base for the evaluation of the safety of the vaccine is not sufficient to fulfill the requirements of the guidelines of the E@@ MEA for pre@@ pan@@ dem@@ ic vaccines .
&quot; should you participate in a clinical trial and require further information about your treatment , please contact your treated doctor . &quot;
&quot; if you would like further information regarding the recommendations of the CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
it is applied in combination with other an@@ tiv@@ ir@@ al medicines to treat adults and children over four years that caused by human immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome of type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) which caused the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
&quot; for patients who cannot s@@ wal@@ low the capsules stands as a solution to em@@ bedding , but this can not be examined together with Rit@@ on@@ av@@ ir since the safety of this combination was not examined . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should only be prescribed if the doctor has tested , the an@@ tiv@@ ir@@ al drugs of the patient has previously taken , and the prob@@ ability evaluated that the virus will appeal to the drug . &quot;
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily which together with twice a day 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ av@@ ir and with other an@@ tiv@@ ir@@ al drugs .
for children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg the recommended dose of an@@ gener@@ ase depends on the body weight .
A@@ gener@@ ase reduces consumption in combination with other an@@ tiv@@ ir@@ al drugs the HIV amount in the blood and keeps them at a low level .
&quot; Aids is not to heal AIDS , but can cause the damage of the immune system and therefore the development of AIDS associated infections and diseases . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase has been studied in combination with other an@@ tiv@@ ir@@ al medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ av@@ ir , have been studied with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adult , which previously did not have been treated with prot@@ ect@@ ives . &quot;
&quot; this with low dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ av@@ ir reinforced drugs of A@@ gener@@ ase was compared with 206 adults , who had previously taken the extrem@@ ities previously , with other proteins . &quot;
main indic@@ ator for the effectiveness was the proportion of patients with non @-@ rep@@ utable concentr@@ ations of HIV in the blood ( vir@@ us@@ last ) or the change of vir@@ us@@ last after the treatment .
&quot; in the studies with patients who had previously taken no proteins , after 48 weeks under A@@ gener@@ ase more patients have a vir@@ us@@ last among 400 copies / ml than under plac@@ ebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than In@@ din@@ av@@ ir . &quot;
&quot; in children decre@@ ased ass@@ gener@@ ase also the vir@@ us@@ last , but with the children who were treated earlier with prot@@ ect@@ ives , only very few on the treatment . &quot;
in the study with adults who were treated earlier with prot@@ eas@@ ants reinforced medicine A@@ gener@@ ase the Vir@@ us@@ last after 16 @-@ weekly treatment as effective as other prot@@ eas@@ aders :
&quot; in case of patients with HIV , that was resistant to four other prot@@ eas@@ ants , it came under A@@ gener@@ ase together with Rit@@ on@@ av@@ ir for a stronger waste of the Vir@@ us@@ last after four weeks than in patients who have previously participated in their previous protests : &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed with more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ( di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ) , Flat@@ sea ( nausea ) , v@@ om@@ iting , rash and Fat@@ nesses ( fatigue ) . &quot;
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic to Am@@ bel@@ av@@ ir or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase may also not be used in patients , the cur@@ rant ( a herbal supplement for treating depression ) or drugs that are built in the same way as A@@ gener@@ ase and are in high concentr@@ ations in the blood health . &quot;
&quot; as with other drugs , the risk of lip@@ od@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of the body perf@@ umes ) , a oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose ( Ab@@ die of bone structure ) or an immun@@ re@@ activation syn@@ dro@@ mes ( symptoms of infection which are caused by the rest@@ ful immune system ) . &quot;
the committee on human therapeutic medicines ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the advantages of A@@ gener@@ ase used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al drugs to treat HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ opo@@ etic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ av@@ ir , but the committee presented that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase used in combination with Rit@@ on@@ av@@ ir in patients who have previously taken no protest eas@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally approved under &quot; extraordinary circumstances , as at the time of approval for scientific reasons only limited information . &quot;
October 2000 announced the European Commission to the company G@@ lax@@ o Group limited a permit for the In@@ dependence of A@@ gener@@ ase in the entire European Union .
A@@ gener@@ ase is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al drugs to treat HIV @-@ 1- infected by HIV @-@ 1- adults and children from 4 years .
for usually A@@ gener@@ ase capsules to pharmac@@ ogen@@ ic boo@@ sted by Am@@ bel@@ av@@ ir are administ@@ ered together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ av@@ ir ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of Am@@ pr@@ av@@ ir should take place in consideration of the individual vir@@ al res@@ ist@@ ency sample and the pre @-@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ nest@@ av@@ ir as a solution to em@@ bedding is 14 % lower than by Am@@ bel@@ av@@ ir as a capsule ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution to be paid on a mill@@ ig@@ ram per mill@@ ig@@ ram base are not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg am@@ ni@@ av@@ ir twice daily along with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ av@@ ir twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al drugs .
&quot; 2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules applied without the amplifier addition of Rit@@ on@@ av@@ ir ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg am@@ ni@@ av@@ ir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al drugs to a daily dose of 2400 mg Am@@ bel@@ av@@ ir that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
pharmac@@ euticals and security of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ av@@ ir or other prot@@ ect@@ ives have not been studied in children .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the bug of data for in@@ conce@@ iv@@ ities and effectiveness ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on the pharmac@@ etic data , the dose should be reduced to A@@ gener@@ ase capsules in adult patients with medium @-@ har@@ dened liver ill@@ age on 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver disorders to 300 mg twice daily . &quot;
simultaneous use should be carried out in patients with easier or moder@@ ation inter@@ ruption with caution when patients with severe liver disorder is it contra@@ sted ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase may not be given simultaneously with drugs that have a small therapeutic width and also represent substr@@ ates of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzy@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot;
&quot; herbal supplements , the cur@@ rant ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plas@@ ma centric and a di@@ min@@ ished therapeutic effect of Am@@ bel@@ av@@ ir ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
patients should be pointed out that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy does not cause any healing of HIV infection and that they also continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of an HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of an transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or cont@@ amination with blood .
for usually A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be applied together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ av@@ ir and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al drugs ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients who suffer from chronic he@@ patitis B or C and are treated with an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy and have an elev@@ ated risk for heavy liver effects associated with potentially fatal course .
for the case of simultaneous an@@ tiv@@ ir@@ al treatment of he@@ patitis B or C please read the relevant information on this drug .
patients with pre @-@ existing liver function including a chronic @-@ active he@@ patitis show a increased frequency of liver functioning under a anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
&quot; simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ av@@ ir can be confused with Fl@@ ut@@ ic@@ as@@ one or other Gl@@ uk@@ ok@@ or@@ tik@@ ero@@ ids that is over CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , unless the possible use of treatment of system@@ ic cort@@ ic@@ ost@@ ero@@ ids effects including Mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and Sup@@ pression of the adren@@ al function weighs ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the metabolism of the H@@ MG Co@@ A @-@ Redu@@ ct@@ ase inhib@@ itors and sim@@ vast@@ atin strongly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended as simultaneous adoption of map@@ le with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and sim@@ vast@@ atin because of the increased risk of My@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; 4 For some medicines which can cause serious or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects such as Car@@ b@@ ama@@ ze@@ pine , phen@@ ob@@ stru@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tr@@ ic@@ ycl@@ ic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring of the International standard , Rat@@ io ) , are methods of determination of the active con@@ centric concentration . &quot;
&quot; in patients who use this medicine at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase can be less effective due to di@@ vor@@ av@@ ir ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the possibility of met@@ abolic interactions with Am@@ nest@@ av@@ ir , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contra@@ di@@ tiv@@ a can be altered , however , the information is not sufficient to appreciate the type of interactions . &quot;
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ on simultaneously is given with am@@ or@@ av@@ ir , patients should therefore be monitored on Op@@ iat@@ ric ss@@ ym@@ pt@@ ome , in particular if there are also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ av@@ ir . &quot;
&quot; because of the possible risk of a tox@@ icity , due to the high Prop@@ yl@@ engl@@ y@@ col@@ abel of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution to the revenue of four years and should be applied to children under the age of four years and should be applied with caution at certain other patient groups . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should be placed on duration 5 if a rash is accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms , or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients who received an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy including proteins , was reported on the appearance of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ emia or an ex@@ ac@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus . &quot;
&quot; many of the patients had other diseases , their therapy medicines required to be associated with the development of diabetes or hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; higher age , and with medication @-@ dependent factors , like a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment and associated met@@ abolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; at h@@ amm@@ ophil@@ es patients ( type A and B ) , who were treated with proteins , reports on an increase of ble@@ eding including spontaneous hem@@ at@@ oms and hem@@ at@@ thro@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; with HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immun@@ ology , at the time of the introduction of an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy ( ART ) , a inflammatory reaction to asym@@ pt@@ omatic or res@@ i@@ dual opportun@@ ist infections which leads to severe clinical states or deteri@@ oration of symptoms . &quot;
&quot; although a mul@@ tif@@ act@@ orial ent@@ ti@@ ology is accepted ( including the application of cort@@ ic@@ ost@@ ero@@ ids , drinking agents , severe immun@@ sup@@ pression , higher body @-@ Mass Index ) , were reported cases of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose especially in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 substr@@ ates with low therapeutic width of A@@ gener@@ ase may not be given simultaneously with drugs , which have a small therapeutic width and also represent substr@@ ates of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzy@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot;
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 substr@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with rit@@ on@@ av@@ ir may not be combined with pharmac@@ euticals but their active ingredients are pre@@ domin@@ antly via CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and are connected to the increased plas@@ mas@@ pie@@ gel with heavy and / or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects .
it was shown that Rif@@ amp@@ ic@@ in a 82 % reduction in the Au@@ c by Am@@ bel@@ av@@ ir caused to say to an vi@@ ro@@ logical pre@@ dictions and lead to a res@@ ist@@ ency development .
with an attempt to extend the harvest@@ ed plas@@ mas@@ pie@@ gel through a dosage increase of other protest inhib@@ itors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ av@@ ir are very often undes@@ irable effects on the liver .
cur@@ rant ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) can be harvest@@ ed by the simultaneous use of herbal medicines with cur@@ rant ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) .
&quot; when a patient takes already cur@@ rant , the am@@ id@@ av@@ ir@@ mirror , and if possible to ver@@ ify the Vir@@ us@@ last and to reset the cur@@ rant . &quot;
a dosage adjustment for one of the drugs is not necessary if Nel@@ fin@@ av@@ ir administ@@ ered together with Am@@ bel@@ av@@ ir ( see also e@@ fav@@ ir@@ ence below ) .
508 % increased for C@@ max against 30 % reduced by 30 % ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with Am@@ se@@ av@@ ir capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
clinical studies were used twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ av@@ ir 100 mg twice daily to prove the effectiveness and in@@ conce@@ iv@@ ities of this treatment schem@@ atic .
52 % reduced if Am@@ bel@@ av@@ ir ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg L@@ opin@@ av@@ ir + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ av@@ ir twice a day ) .
the C@@ min @-@ Values of Am@@ nest@@ av@@ ir ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ av@@ ir twice a day .
&quot; a dosage for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ ith@@ av@@ ir and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , but it is not recommended to be a nar@@ row@@ ful monitoring since the effectiveness and in@@ conce@@ iv@@ ities of this combination is not known . &quot;
there was no pharmac@@ etic study to use A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Did@@ an@@ os@@ in but is recommended due to the ant@@ azi@@ des component of Did@@ an@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see Ant@@ ac@@ ida below ) .
this is why the gift of E@@ fav@@ ir@@ is is necessary in combination with Am@@ pr@@ av@@ ir ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ av@@ ir ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dosage adjustment .
the treatment with em@@ bank@@ ir@@ ence in combination with Am@@ nest@@ av@@ ir and Sa@@ quin@@ av@@ ir is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ eas@@ ants would be harvest@@ ed .
the effect of Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ in to other proteins and existing limited data may assume that ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ to the ser@@ um concentration of am@@ or@@ av@@ ir may possibly per@@ vert@@ ed .
&quot; if these drugs should be used simultaneously , be careful because Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din due to the decre@@ ased or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plas@@ mas@@ pie@@ gel could be less effective . &quot;
&quot; if this drug is applied together , be careful ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be made , since a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ nest@@ av@@ ir and Rit@@ on@@ av@@ ir is difficult to Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din . &quot;
the simultaneous fork by Am@@ bel@@ av@@ ir and Rif@@ ab@@ ut@@ in led to an increase in plas@@ ma concentration ( Au@@ c ) by Rif@@ ab@@ ut@@ in around 193 % and thus to an increase in using rif@@ ab@@ ut@@ in connected side effects .
&quot; if it is required for clinical reasons , rif@@ ab@@ ut@@ in along with A@@ gener@@ ase is to be administ@@ ered to a reduction in the dosage of Rif@@ ab@@ ut@@ in at least half of the recommended dose , although there are no clinical data . &quot;
pharmaceutical studies with gener@@ a in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin have not been carried out but could be increased plas@@ mas@@ pie@@ gel of both drugs in case of simultaneous approval .
simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ av@@ ir and 100 mg of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once a day led to an increase in the C@@ max von K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once a day led to a increasing number of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily without simultaneous use of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ av@@ ir with Rit@@ on@@ av@@ ir .
&quot; other medicines which are listed below , including substr@@ ates , inhib@@ itors or indu@@ ctors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can be applied together with A@@ gener@@ ase , possibly to interactions . &quot;
patients should therefore be monitored on toxic reactions which are associated with these drugs when they are applied in combination with A@@ gener@@ ase .
&quot; based on the data of other proteins , it is advis@@ able that Ant@@ az@@ ida cannot be taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase since it may come to res@@ or@@ pt@@ uous disorders . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous use of anti@@ vul@@ vul@@ va , known as an enc@@ y@@ du@@ ctors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ stru@@ al , Car@@ b@@ ama@@ ze@@ pine ) , with Am@@ nest@@ av@@ ir can lead to a degra@@ dation of plas@@ mas@@ pie@@ zo . &quot;
&quot; the ser@@ um @-@ concentr@@ ations of Cal@@ ci@@ um@@ kan@@ al@@ block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , Dil@@ ti@@ pine , Ni@@ kl@@ di@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , N@@ insul@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can increase 10 by Am@@ nest@@ av@@ ir , which may increase the activity and tox@@ icity of this drug . &quot;
simultaneous intake with A@@ gener@@ ase can significantly increase their plas@@ ma centric and with PD@@ E@@ 5 @-@ inhib@@ itors in connection side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ ension , tend@@ encies and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , in the Rit@@ on@@ av@@ ir 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g Fl@@ ut@@ ic@@ ator prop@@ ion@@ at int@@ ran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) , while the end@@ ogen@@ ic Kort@@ is@@ ol was significantly reduced by approximately 86 % ( 90 % -@@ console interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; consequently , the simultaneous G@@ abe is not recommended by A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ av@@ ir along with these Gl@@ uk@@ ok@@ or@@ tik@@ oid , unless the possible use of treatment is the risk of system@@ ic cort@@ ic@@ ost@@ ero@@ ids ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; at H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ Redu@@ ct@@ ase inhib@@ itors , such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and sim@@ vast@@ atin , whose distrib@@ uting is strongly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are pronoun@@ ced enh@@ anc@@ ements of plas@@ mas@@ pie@@ gel with simultaneous adoption of A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; as plas@@ mas@@ pie@@ gel@@ enh@@ anc@@ ements of this H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduction inhib@@ itors to My@@ opathy including a R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ se , the combined application of this drug is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended to be a more frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentr@@ ations until the stabil@@ ization of the mirror , since the plas@@ mac@@ on@@ ent@@ ations of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;

&quot; a irrit@@ ation study of pregnant rats , which was administ@@ ered by the em@@ bedding of the uter@@ us until the end of the lact@@ ation of Am@@ ith@@ av@@ ir , showed a decre@@ ased increase in the 12 body weight in the descendants . &quot;

the in@@ conce@@ iv@@ ities of A@@ gener@@ ase has been studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical studies in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al drugs .
&quot; most associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment related effects were slightly to moderate , occurred early on and rarely led to treatment up@@ heav@@ al . &quot;
&quot; in many of these events it is not clar@@ ified whether they are related to the in@@ gest@@ ion of an@@ gener@@ ase , or another simultaneously to HIV treatment . &quot;
&quot; most of the above @-@ side effects are from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 3@@ 001 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which with proteins were not previously treated patients 1200 mg A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily . &quot;

conclusions regarding the relev@@ ance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation@@ sm@@ uster may be subject to change through additional data and it is recommended to always move the current interpret@@ ations systems to the analysis of the results of res@@ ist@@ ency tests .
on ph@@ än@@ otyp@@ ing @-@ based analysis clin@@ ically val@@ idi@@ opathic interpret@@ ations can be used in conjunction with the gen@@ otyp@@ ic data on the occasion of the activity of Am@@ pr@@ av@@ ir / Rit@@ on@@ av@@ ir or Fos@@ on@@ av@@ ir / Rit@@ on@@ av@@ ir in patients with protein @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .

&quot; each of these four with a decre@@ ased sensitivity to Am@@ bel@@ av@@ ir associated patterns produces a certain cru@@ ising resistance against Rit@@ on@@ av@@ ir , the sensitivity to In@@ din@@ av@@ ir , Nel@@ fin@@ av@@ ir and Sa@@ quin@@ av@@ ir remains in general . &quot;
&quot; there are currently data to cru@@ ising between Am@@ ber@@ av@@ ir and other prot@@ eas@@ ants for all 4 Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ av@@ ir Res@@ ist@@ ency pf@@ ade , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al cav@@ ities ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , Dar@@ un@@ av@@ ir ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , In@@ din@@ av@@ ir / Rit@@ on@@ av@@ ir ( three of 24 Isol@@ aten ) , Sa@@ quin@@ av@@ ir ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ quin@@ av@@ ir ( three of 24 Isol@@ aten ) and Tip@@ ran@@ av@@ ir ( four of 24 Isol@@ aten ) . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ nest@@ av@@ ir reserves its activity against some other prot@@ eas@@ ing @-@ resistant isol@@ ate ; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of consistency mut@@ ations in the insulation . &quot;
early ab@@ ortion of a vers@@ ary therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in borders which may affect the following treatment .
&quot; the cover of the effectiveness of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ av@@ ir 100 mg twice daily based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study ( vir@@ us@@ load ≥ 1000 copies / ml ) either A@@ gener@@ ase ( 600 mg twice daily ) and a standard therapy ( standard of care , So@@ c ) with a PI , mainly with low dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ av@@ ir &quot; &quot; received . &quot;
&quot; hundred @-@ hundred @-@ six@@ ty @-@ six@@ ty ( n = 163 ) patients with st@@ ipul@@ ated virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one NR@@ TI were included in the part of the A from PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
the primary analysis presented the non @-@ sub@@ peri@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ av@@ ir in comparison to the So@@ c @-@ PI group in terms of time ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the plas@@ ma after 16 weeks , in a non @-@ sub @-@ condition of 0.@@ 4 log@@ 10 copies / ml . &quot;
&quot; the cover of the effectiveness of un@@ bund@@ led A@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled studies with a total of 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 years , of which 152 were treated with PI . &quot;
&quot; in the studies of A@@ gener@@ ase solution to em@@ bedding and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients 20 mg / kg twice daily . &quot;
there was no low dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ av@@ ir at the same time ; the majority of the patients treated with PI patients had previously received one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the NR@@ TI@@ s together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
after 48 weeks the patients received a plas@@ ma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 @-@ RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml with a medi@@ an increase in the CD@@ 4 cell &apos;s number of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the output .
19 Bas@@ ically on this data should be considered at the treatment optim@@ izing with PI @-@ treated children of the expected benefits of &quot; un@@ fried &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; according to oral administration , the average duration ( T@@ max ) is the average duration ( T@@ max ) up to the maximum ser@@ um concentration of Am@@ bel@@ av@@ ir approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
508 % increased for C@@ max against 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ av@@ ir ( 100 mg twice a day ) together with Am@@ nest@@ av@@ ir ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
&quot; administration of Am@@ nest@@ av@@ ir with a meal leads to a 25 % of the Au@@ c , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ bel@@ av@@ ir 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the minimal concentration in the Ste@@ ady state ( C@@ min , ss ) from the dietary consumption is un@@ influenced , although the simultaneous food consumption is affected by the scale and the rate of res@@ or@@ ption . &quot;
the apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and leaves to a large portion of penetration as well as an un@@ ambig@@ uous penetration of Am@@ pr@@ av@@ ir from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
&quot; this change leads to a acceptance of the overall concentration of the drug in the plas@@ ma , whereby the amount of un@@ bund@@ les , which represents the active share , probably remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of ir@@ regular am@@ ni@@ av@@ ir remains constant , fluctu@@ ates the percentage of free active component during the total @-@ drug application in the Ste@@ ady state through the area of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min . ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , drugs , the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 indu@@ ce or inhib@@ it or a substr@@ ate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with caution will be given when they are given simultaneously with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily am@@ ni@@ av@@ ir exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
Am@@ pr@@ av@@ ir is made up of the solution 14 % less bio@@ available than from the capsules ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase solution and A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable .
also the ren@@ al clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ av@@ ir negle@@ cted so that the impact of a kidney failure is likely to be low on the elimination of am@@ ni@@ av@@ ir and Rit@@ on@@ av@@ ir .
these treatment schem@@ ata lead to Am@@ nest@@ av@@ ir @-@ plas@@ mas@@ pie@@ br@@ icks compared to a dose of 1200 mg Am@@ bel@@ av@@ ir twice daily without simultaneous approval of Rit@@ on@@ av@@ ir .
&quot; in long @-@ time studies with amp@@ ou@@ av@@ ir on mice and rats appeared on male animals ben@@ ig@@ ne he@@ pat@@ o@@ cell@@ ular Aden@@ ome at Dos@@ age , which came to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) of the exposure to the people , after twice daily fork by 1200 mg Am@@ bel@@ av@@ ir . &quot;
the 21 underlying mechanism to the emergence of he@@ pat@@ o@@ cell@@ ular Aden@@ ome and cardi@@ ac was not yet clear and the relev@@ ance of these observed effects for man is un@@ clear .
&quot; however , from the present ex@@ posit@@ ional data on people , both of clinical studies as well as from the therapeutic application , there are little evidence of adopt@@ ing a clinical relev@@ ance of this confess@@ ion . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery charger of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic tests , micro lymph@@ oma test , micro@@ k@@ ern@@ test in human peri@@ ph@@ eral lyrics , was neither mut@@ ually nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ically . &quot;
this liver tox@@ icity can be monitored and detected in clinical life through measurement of AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ ate are monitored and proven . &quot;
&quot; hi@@ ther@@ to in clinical studies have not been observed in clinical studies , neither during the administration of asylum nor after the end of treatment . &quot;
studies of tox@@ icity at vir@@ tue that have been treated as well as at the age of 4 days and they treated with the control as well as with Am@@ bel@@ av@@ ir treated animals a high mort@@ ality .
&quot; for a system@@ ic plas@@ ma@@ ex@@ position , which was significantly lower than ( rab@@ bit ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) as the expected ex@@ position among therapeutic dosage in humans , however , were observed a number of slightly changes including th@@ y@@ mus@@ cul@@ ation and slightly skel@@ eton changes , which point to a del@@ ayed development . &quot;
&quot; 24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the intensi@@ f@@ ying addit@@ ive of Rit@@ on@@ av@@ ir ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg am@@ ni@@ av@@ ir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al drugs to a daily dose of 2400 mg Am@@ bel@@ av@@ ir that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
simultaneous use should be carried out in patients with gu@@ arded or easier living @-@ working distur@@ b@@ ance with caution when patients with severe liver disorder is it contra@@ sted ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; 26 For some medicines which can cause serious or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects such as Car@@ b@@ ama@@ ze@@ pine , phen@@ ob@@ stru@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tr@@ ic@@ ycl@@ ic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring of the International standard , Rat@@ io ) , are methods of determination of the active con@@ centric concentration . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should be placed on duration 27 if a rash is accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms , or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; an increased risk for lip@@ od@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment and associated met@@ abolic disorders . &quot;
it was shown that Rif@@ amp@@ ic@@ in a 82 % reduction in the Au@@ c by Am@@ bel@@ av@@ ir caused to say to an vi@@ ro@@ logical pre@@ dictions and lead to a res@@ ist@@ ency development .
508 % increased for C@@ max against 30 % reduced by 30 % ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with Am@@ se@@ av@@ ir capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min @-@ Values of Am@@ nest@@ av@@ ir ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ av@@ ir twice a day .
&quot; a dosage for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ ith@@ av@@ ir and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , but it is not recommended to be a nar@@ row@@ ful monitoring since the effectiveness and in@@ conce@@ iv@@ ities of this combination is not known . &quot;
the treatment with em@@ bank@@ ir@@ ence in combination with Am@@ nest@@ av@@ ir and Sa@@ quin@@ av@@ ir is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ eas@@ ants would be harvest@@ ed .
&quot; if this drug is applied together , be careful ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be made , since a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ nest@@ av@@ ir and Rit@@ on@@ av@@ ir is difficult to Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din . &quot;
&quot; if it is required for clinical reasons , rif@@ ab@@ ut@@ in along with A@@ gener@@ ase is to be administ@@ ered to a reduction in the dosage of Rif@@ ab@@ ut@@ in at least half of the recommended dose 31 ger@@ ies , although there are no clinical data . &quot;

&quot; in a clinical study , in the Rit@@ on@@ av@@ ir 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g Fl@@ ut@@ ic@@ ator prop@@ ion@@ at int@@ ran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) , while the end@@ ogen@@ ic Kort@@ is@@ ol was significantly reduced by approximately 86 % ( 90 % -@@ console interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
at simultaneous G@@ abe of War@@ far@@ in or other or@@ ally anti @-@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gener@@ ase becomes an enhanced control of the IN@@ R ( International norm@@ ality Rat@@ io ) because of the possibility of we@@ aker or rein@@ force the anti @-@ current botanical effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .

this medicine may only be used during pregnancy only after careful weighing of possible use for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
&quot; a irrit@@ ation study of pregnant rats , which was administ@@ ered by the em@@ bedding of the uter@@ us until the end of the lact@@ ation of Am@@ ith@@ av@@ ir , showed a decre@@ ased increase in the body weight in the descendants . &quot;

50 % of the inhib@@ itors ( IC@@ 50 ) by Am@@ nest@@ av@@ ir is located in the range from 0.@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in ac@@ ute cells and amounts to 10 µ@@ M with chronic infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ nest@@ av@@ ir reserves its activity against some other prot@@ eas@@ ing @-@ resistant isol@@ ate ; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of consistency mut@@ ations in the insulation . &quot;
&quot; based on this data should be considered at the treatment optim@@ izing with PI , the benefit of &quot; &quot; un@@ baked &quot; &quot; of de@@ generated &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;

&quot; however , from the present ex@@ posit@@ ional data on people , both of clinical studies as well as from the therapeutic application , however , little hints for the acceptance of a clinical relev@@ ance of this confess@@ ion . &quot;

the benefits of using Rit@@ on@@ av@@ ir &quot; re@@ generated &quot; A@@ generic &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution to em@@ bedding has been neither with PI previously treated patients with PI previously treated patients .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ nest@@ av@@ ir as a solution to em@@ bedding is 14 % lower than by Am@@ bel@@ av@@ ir as a capsule ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution to be paid on a mill@@ ig@@ ram per mill@@ ig@@ ram base are not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .

&quot; the applic@@ ability and duration of the treatment with al@@ dara depends on the disease condition : • In the genital area is Al@@ dara up to a maximum of 16 weeks in times a week . • In case of little bas@@ al treatment , it is possible during one or two four @-@ week treatment cycles , with four weeks of break between the treatment cycles , three times a week . &quot;
&quot; the cream is in front of the bed@@ time thin on the affected areas , so that they remain enough long ( about eight hours ) on the skin before they washed off . &quot;
&quot; in all studies al@@ dara was compared with a plac@@ ebo ( same cream , but without the ingredients ) . • Al@@ dara was tested in four main studies at 9@@ 23 patients with waiting for 16 weeks . &quot;
main indic@@ ator for the effectiveness was the number of patients with complete disp@@ ers@@ ing of the treated War@@ zen . • Al@@ dara was also examined at 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al@@ cell@@ ular symptoms in which patients were treated six weeks and al@@ dara or the plac@@ ebo either daily or five times a week .

a break in the treatment described above should be saved when intensive local inflammation should occur ( see Section 4.4 ) or if in the treatment area is an infection .
if at the follow @-@ up investigation 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment of treatment the untreated les@@ ions are only un@@ completely healed and should be started another therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .

&quot; with an application of Im@@ iqu@@ im@@ od cream cream in higher than the recommended doses , there have been severe local skin irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) in rare cases , which made a treatment required and / or to a temporary body impair@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; in cases where such reactions at the exit of the ureth@@ ra came , some women had difficulty in the water that made an emergency cath@@ eter@@ ization and a treatment of the affected area . &quot;

local home actions are common but the intensity of these reactions takes in general during therapy or the reactions form after completion of treatment with Im@@ iqu@@ im@@ od cream .
&quot; if it is necessary due to the complaints of the patient or due to the sever@@ ity of the local home actions , a treatment fee of several days can be made . &quot;
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after the rainy skin around 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
&quot; at present no data on long term healing rates are available for more than 36 months after the treatment , the other appropriate therapy forms should be moved to other appropriate therapy forms . &quot;
&quot; in patients with recipro@@ cal and treated BC@@ Cs do not have clinical experiences , therefore the application is not recommended for previously treated tum@@ ors . &quot;
data from an open clinical study point out that with large tum@@ ors ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) a lower li@@ kel@@ ih@@ ood of contact on the Im@@ iqu@@ im@@ od therapy .
&quot; Im@@ iqu@@ im@@ od was not examined for the treatment of actor ker@@ at@@ osis , inside the nose , or the ears or on the lip area within the Lip@@ pen@@ ess . &quot;
there are only very limited data on the application of Im@@ iqu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of act@@ less ker@@ at@@ ants to anatom@@ ical places outside of the face and the scal@@ p .
&quot; the available data on the actor of ker@@ at@@ osis on the sub@@ arms and hands support the effectiveness in this application , so this application is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; local home actions often occur , but these reactions usually take back in the course of therapy or go back after dism@@ ant@@ ling the therapy with Im@@ iqu@@ im@@ od cream . &quot;
&quot; if the local skin interactions can cause large discomfort or very strong , the treatment may be susp@@ ended for some days . &quot;
&quot; from the data of an open clinical trial , patients with more than 8 AK@@ - les@@ ions referred to as patients with less than 8 les@@ ions . &quot;
&quot; due to the immune @-@ stimul@@ ating properties , Im@@ iqu@@ im@@ od cream should be applied with caution in patients who receive an immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive treatment ( see 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; animal studies have no direct or indirect harmful effects on the pregnancy , the embryonic / f@@ öt@@ ale development ( see 5.3 ) . &quot;

&quot; the European pharmac@@ euticals agency ( E@@ MEA ) will update all new information that may be well known , check and update this summary . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will receive patients , the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me to observe the reactions to the inf@@ usion and the development of antibodies . &quot;
June 2003 the European Commission announced the company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.V. a permit for the in@@ solven@@ cy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me throughout the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O @-@ mammals ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ vary ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is dedicated to long @-@ term enzymes in patients with secured diagnosis of a Mu@@ kop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ char@@ id@@ osis I ( MPS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase short@@ age ) to treat non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other her@@ ed@@ itary metabolism .
&quot; the initial inf@@ usion rate of 2 e / kg / h can , if the patient carries it , all 15 minutes in individual steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h . &quot;
the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined and for these patients may not be recommended for these patients .
the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure was not identified and for these patients may not be recommended for these patients .
&quot; with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated patients can develop inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions which are defined as any related to the out@@ set , which occurs during inf@@ usion or until the end of the inf@@ usion ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , these patients should continue to be monitored , and the inf@@ usion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out only in an appropriate clinical environment , in the re@@ inv@@ ent facilities for medical emergen@@ cies immediately . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical phase @-@ 3 study , almost all patients were Ig@@ G antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months of treatment . &quot;
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; as little experience regarding the recovery of treatment after a longer inter@@ ruption , must be cau@@ ti@@ zed due to the theoret@@ ically increased risk @-@ reaction after a break of treatment cau@@ ti@@ ously . &quot;
60 minutes before the start of inf@@ usion with medications ( anti@@ hist@@ amine and / or anti @-@ py@@ us ) to minim@@ ize the potential occurrence inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions .
&quot; in the event of a slight or medium @-@ sized inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction , the treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ ac@@ et@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be raised and / or a reduction of inf@@ usion rate to the half of the inf@@ usion rate . &quot;
&quot; in case of a single , serious inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction must be stopped by inf@@ usion until the symptoms are brought to decline , an treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ ac@@ et@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be aw@@ aken . &quot;
inf@@ usion can be recorded with a reduction of inf@@ usion rate on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of inf@@ usion rate when the reaction occurred .
3 are used ( anti @-@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ ac@@ et@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or Cort@@ ic@@ ost@@ ero@@ ids ) as well as a reduction of inf@@ usion rate on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of inf@@ usion rate .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be applied simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ quin or Pro@@ c@@ ain because a potential risk of inter@@ ference with the intra@@ cell@@ ular recording of Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
&quot; animal experimental studies cannot be direct or indirect impact on pregnancy , embryonic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no data to new@@ born , which were exp@@ on@@ ated to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase over the mother mil@@ ch , is recommended to satisfy during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot;
&quot; the side @-@ effects in clinical trials were reported mainly as inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions , which were observed at 53 % of patients in the phase @-@ 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and at 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) . &quot;
&quot; unwanted drug actions related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were observed during the phase @-@ 3- study and its extension at a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older with a treatment duration of up to 4 years , are often listed in the following table according to the following frequency range : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) . &quot;
&quot; in some patients with severe MPS @-@ I @-@ related participation of the upper air@@ ways and lungs in the pre@@ history occurred in addition severe reactions to , including bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ asm , breathing and facial hair ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children of undes@@ ir@@ ables associated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a ph@@ as@@ e- 2 @-@ study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years , with mainly severe circulation and a treatment duration up to 12 months , are reported in the table . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ous once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ous once a week , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ous all 2 weeks or 300 m / kg intra@@ ven@@ ous all 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in most patients there came within 3 months after the start of treatment to a ser@@ ok@@ on@@ version , with the patients aged under 5 years with a he@@ avier mer@@ chant version ( average after 26 days compared to patients at the age of 5 years and older ) . &quot;
&quot; up to the end of phase 3 @-@ 3 study ( or up to a premature retirement from the study ) , at 13 / 45 patients were not due to radio@@ immun@@ op@@ anc@@ ipation ( RI@@ P ) Ass@@ ay det@@ ect@@ able antibodies , including 3 patients , where it never came to Ser@@ ok@@ on@@ version . &quot;
patients with lack@@ ed to lower anti @-@ mirror levels referred to a robust reduction in the G@@ AG mirror in Har@@ n while in patients with high anti@@ body tit@@ els was to determine a variable reduction of G@@ AG in the Har@@ n .
four patients ( three in phase 3 @-@ 3 study and one in phase @-@ 2 study ) showed a mar@@ gin@@ ally to low neutr@@ alised effect on enzy@@ matic lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ e- activity in vit@@ ro that seemed to affect the clinical effectiveness and / or reducing G@@ AG in Har@@ n .
the presence of antibodies seemed to be associated with the incidence of unwanted drug actions even if the appearance of unwanted drugs typically fell together with the formation of Ig@@ G anti @-@ antibodies .
the reason for the enzyme is in one for the hydro@@ lys@@ is of the accumul@@ ated substr@@ ate and the prevention of further accumulation of accumulation of enzymes .
&quot; after intra@@ ven@@ ous Inf@@ usion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase becomes quickly removed from the circulation and cells into the L@@ ys@@ os@@ om@@ es , most probably over Mann@@ ose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the security and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a random@@ ised , dou@@ bl@@ ossom , plac@@ eb@@ ok@@ on@@ tro@@ ll@@ ated Phase 3 @-@ study studied in 45 patients at the age of 6 to 43 years . &quot;
&quot; although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , which arose the entire disease spectrum was the majority of patients from the middle phen@@ otype and only a patient pointed the heavy phen@@ otype . &quot;
&quot; patients were recru@@ ited when they had a for@@ c@@ ated exp@@ ir@@ ator@@ ic volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters . &quot;
the primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the pro@@ cent@@ u@@ al change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute route in the 6 @-@ minus enclosure .
all patients were subsequently received for an open @-@ label extender that they received another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) each week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
after a 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated patients with the plac@@ ebo group improvement in the lung @-@ function and the in@@ capability that is shown in the following table .
&quot; the open extension study showed themselves an improvement and / or maintain this effects of up to 208 weeks in der@@ Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me @-@ group and from 182 weeks in the plac@@ ebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as follows from the following table . &quot;
the acceptance of the anticipated FE@@ V is not significant about this period clin@@ ically and the absolute lung vol@@ um@@ ina increased further proportional to the height of the growing children .
&quot; from 26 patients with a he@@ pat@@ om@@ aly prior to treatment , 22 ( 85 % ) up to the end of the study a normal living size . &quot;
&quot; within the first 4 weeks became a significant decline of the G@@ AG mirror in Har@@ n ( µ@@ g / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) , which remained constant to the study . &quot;
&quot; in regard to the hetero@@ gen@@ eous disease management between patients , which was considered by using a combined end@@ point ( too expected pro@@ cent@@ u@@ al norm@@ ality ) , was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deteri@@ oration with 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot;
&quot; it was conducted a year @-@ round open phase 2 study , which was mainly examined for the safety and pharmac@@ opo@@ etic of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me at 20 patients ( 16 patients with the heavy verses form and 4 with the middle @-@ form ) . &quot;
&quot; in four patients , the dosage was increased due to elev@@ ated G@@ AG@@ C mirror in the har@@ n in a week 22 in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg . &quot;
&quot; in several patients a magn@@ itude ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) found after the Z score for these age group . the younger patients with the middle @-@ course form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) , and all 4 patients with the middle delay form referred to as a normal mental development speed , only limited or no progress in cognitive development . &quot;
in a phase @-@ 4 study exam@@ inations were carried out investigations into pharmac@@ od@@ ynam@@ ic effects of different Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me @-@ dos@@ ing schem@@ ata at the G@@ AG @-@ mirror in Har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ous once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ous once a week , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ous all 2 weeks or 300 m / kg intra@@ ven@@ ous all 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; dos@@ ing scheme with 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ous every 2 weeks can be used in patients , the difficulties with weekly inf@@ usions , however , is not proven that the long term clinical effectiveness of these two dos@@ ing schem@@ es is equ@@ ival@@ ently . &quot;
&quot; the European Medi@@ c@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will receive any new information that will be available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the drug will be updated . &quot;
the pharmac@@ opo@@ etic profile in patients aged under 5 years was similar to those in older and less affected people .

&quot; during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ eral , at least 5 cans must be taken at least 5 cans of fol@@ ic acid , and the intake needs to be continued during the entire treatment period as well as for further 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ uter x@@ ed@@ - dose . &quot;
patients must also receive an in@@ tra @-@ mus@@ cular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ gram ) in the week before the first P@@ em@@ eral dose and after each third time @-@ cycle .
&quot; in patients , the P@@ em@@ uter can be created prior to each gift , should be created in front of each gift , including a differentiation of the leu@@ ko@@ ocy@@ tes and a c@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ t@@ enz@@ alys@@ is . &quot;
the alkal@@ ine Phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate @-@ Trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Al@@ anin @-@ Trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should amount to ≤ 3 @-@ fold of the upper limit value . &quot;
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle must take place a dosage examination of the kidney or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity of the preced@@ ing therapy cycles .
&quot; after recovery , patients must be treated accordingly to the references to tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as a mon@@ otherapy , or in combination with Cis@@ plat@@ inum . &quot;
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common toxic Crit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 blood .
&quot; should patients do not develop @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ≥ grade 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity ) , the therapy needs to be interrupted with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA , until the patient has the value before the treatment &quot;
the treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be canc@@ eled if in patients after 2 dos@@ ing tox@@ icity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity degree 3 or 4 appearance or so@@ - fort in the appearance of degree 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
clinical studies have no indication that in patients at the age of 65 Yahweh or in comparison to patients aged under 65 years an increase by side effects .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to non @-@ sufficient data for in@@ conce@@ iv@@ ities and effectiveness .
in clinical studies were necessary for patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min .
the data base in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clear@@ ance of under 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; however , patients with a liver functioning of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the top Bil@@ ir@@ u@@ bin@@ - bor@@ der@@ es and / or trans@@ am@@ inas@@ value from &gt; the 3.0 @-@ fold of the upper bound@@ ary ( at Ab@@ - Wes@@ eness of liver metastatic ) or &gt; 5,0 @-@ fold of the upper bound@@ ary ( in existence of liver metastatic ) not specifically studied in studies . &quot;
patients need to be monitored with regard to the bone of bone sup@@ pression and p@@ em@@ atic may not be administ@@ ered to patients before their absolute neutr@@ ality rate returns a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the Th@@ u@@ bo@@ - Cypri@@ ots back a value of ≥ 100.000 cells / mm ³ .
a dosage reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adir of absolute neutr@@ ality and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity as they were observed in the previous treatment cycles - the ( see section 4.2 ) .
a lower tox@@ icity and reduction of degree 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and n@@ ich@@ th@@ ec@@ ologic tox@@ icity such as neutr@@ ality and infection with degree 3 / 4 Neut@@ ro@@ g@@ ie was be@@ o- if a pre @-@ treatment with fol@@ ic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
&quot; therefore all patients must be dependent on patients , fol@@ ic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as proph@@ y- lactose @-@ based tox@@ icity ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients with easy to medium ren@@ al in@@ suffic@@ iency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid the simultaneous intake of non @-@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti @-@ logistics ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) for at least 2 days before the therapy , the day of therapy and mind@@ set - TE@@ NS 2 days after the treatment with P@@ em@@ cker ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; all patients who is intended for therapy with P@@ em@@ eral , need to avoid taking N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with a long half @-@ life time for at least 5 days before the therapy , the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ eral , avoid ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients in which these events entered , had appropriate risk actors for the appearance of ren@@ al events , including Deh@@ yd@@ rat@@ ation , pre @-@ employed hyper@@ tension or diabetes . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid &quot; collection in the trans@@ cell@@ ular space a drainage of the erg@@ ents in front of the P@@ em@@ atic treatment can be wo@@ unded . &quot;
&quot; 5 serious cardi@@ ac events , including m@@ yo@@ k@@ ardin@@ al , and cereb@@ ral events were reported in clinical studies with P@@ em@@ eral occasionally , if this drug is usually given in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic drug . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the simultaneous use of atten@@ u@@ ated life @-@ vacc@@ inated ( except Yellow @-@ f@@ ie@@ ber , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indications ) not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; as the possibility of an ir@@ reversible pl@@ ating the reproductive capacity through P@@ em@@ eral consists , men should be pointed out before the treatment - g@@ inn , advice regarding the sperm serv@@ icing . &quot;
in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds , such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and ac@@ et@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ic acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1.3 g daily ) to a decre@@ ased pen@@ di@@ ence ex@@ cre@@ tion with the consequence of a multipl@@ ied imp@@ se of side @-@ effects . &quot;
therefore be careful if patient with normal ren@@ al function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ic acid in high dosage are applied .

&quot; as no data is available as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ ox@@ ib , the simultaneous use with P@@ em@@ er has to be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ eral - mixed . &quot;
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the straight@@ ening status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between or@@ ally anti@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplast@@ y chemotherapy requires the increased monitoring frequency of the IN@@ R ( International norm@@ ality Rat@@ io ) when the decision was hit to treat Pat@@ i@@ - ducks .
&quot; there are no data for the use of P@@ em@@ cker mixed during pregnancy , but as with an@@ de@@ - an@@ timet@@ ables are expected in an application in the pregnancy severe birth@@ days . &quot;
&quot; P@@ em@@ ama must not be applied during pregnancy , except if necessary and after careful weighing of the use for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; as the possibility of an ir@@ reversible damage caused by P@@ em@@ eral , men should be pointed out before the treatment . &quot;

all@@ i can be used to weight reduction in adults with overweight ( body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hyp@@ oc@@ al@@ or@@ ic , fatty food . &quot;
&quot; all@@ i may not be used by children and young people under the age of 18 , as there are not enough data on effectiveness and security . &quot;

&quot; since the weight reduction in diabetes can be reached with improved met@@ abolic control , patients who consult a medicine against diabetes , prior to the treatment of treatment with all@@ i a doctor or pharmac@@ ist , because the dosage of anti @-@ di@@ ab@@ etic will need to be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; patients , all@@ i as well as drugs against hyper@@ tension or an increased cholesterol levels , should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ist whether the dosage should be adapted for this drug . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended to hit extra weak measures , in order to prevent the possible failure of the oral contra@@ sts ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;

&quot; in most patients who were treated in clinical trials up to 4 full years with Or@@ list@@ at , the concentr@@ ations of vitamins A , D , E and K and the beta carot@@ ene in the standard range . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be recommended to take place in front of the sleep a supplements to ensure an adequate vit@@ amine ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; after the gift of an Ein@@ mal@@ d@@ osis Am@@ io@@ dar@@ on , was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers , which at the same time Or@@ list@@ at once received a slightly withdrawal of the Am@@ io@@ dar@@ on plas@@ ma concentration . &quot;
&quot; animal experimental studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embryonic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; the side effects of Or@@ list@@ at are mainly gast@@ ro@@ intestinal nature and hang together with the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , since the absorption of un@@ genom@@ ic fat is prevented . &quot;
the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal side effects were obtained from clinical trials with Or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary .
&quot; the frequency are as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and very rarely ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( incidence on the basis of the available data is not removable ) . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of those used @-@ side effects , which were noted after the launch of Or@@ list@@ ate , is not known since these events were volunt@@ arily reported by a population un@@ certain size . &quot;
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can lead to subsi@@ dies in terms of possible or actual gast@@ ro@@ intestinal side effects .
single p@@ ants of 800 mg Or@@ list@@ at and multi @-@ users of up to 400 mg three times daily were given over a period of 15 days of normal weight and overweight commission .
in the majority of the cases after the launch reported cases of Or@@ list@@ at @-@ over@@ dosage were either reported either side effects or similar side @-@ effects such as at the recommended dose of Or@@ list@@ at .
&quot; based on research and animal can be attributed by a quick retro@@ fitting system of system@@ ic effects , which are attributed to the li@@ pas@@ ing properties of Or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
the therapeutic effect sets in the lum@@ ens of the stomach and the upper d@@ une bond through kov@@ al@@ ente bond to the active ser@@ ene @-@ rest of gast@@ ric and pan@@ dem@@ ic lip@@ ids .
&quot; clinical studies have been derived that 60 mg of Or@@ list@@ ate , three times daily , the absorption of about 25 % of the food @-@ fet@@ us blocked . &quot;

&quot; primary parameters , the change in the body weight compared to the output value ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ ization ) , has been rated as follows : as a change in the body weight ( table 1 ) and as a share of those study participants , which have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their output weight ( table 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although in both studies the weight reduction was observed over 12 months , the largest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months . &quot;
the average change in total chol@@ est@@ ess was with Or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( starting 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with plac@@ ebo + 2.8 % ( starting 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .

&quot; in pre@@ clinical studies inhib@@ ited Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron not used against tum@@ ors of the five under@@ examined chem@@ otherap@@ eut@@ ics not ( Cis@@ plat@@ inum , Cycl@@ oph@@ osph@@ ere , Cy@@ tar@@ ab@@ in , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ omy@@ cin C ) . &quot;
in a clinical trial there was no significant pharmac@@ etic inter@@ play between a unique intra@@ ven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a ste@@ ady concentration of met@@ o@@ cl@@ op@@ ram@@ ids , a CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ inhib@@ itors . &quot;
&quot; based on a population @-@ based pharmac@@ etic analysis was shown that the simultaneous recording of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ hib@@ it@@ ine , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , Flu@@ id@@ ine , Chin@@ at@@ id@@ ine , par@@ oxet@@ ine , Ran@@ on@@ av@@ ir , Ser@@ tr@@ ine and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant effect on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; to use Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on human pregn@@ anc@@ ies , therefore , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used during pregnancy , unless it is necessary by the doctor as necessary . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies were the most common in a dose of 250 micro@@ gram to ob@@ struction side effects ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , who were at least possibly with Alo@@ xi in connection , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and or@@ chards ( 5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions at the appointment ( burning , har@@ dening , complaints and pain ) were given in post @-@ marketing experience . &quot;
in the group with the highest dosage showed themselves similar frequency of unwanted events such as in the other dos@@ ing groups ; there were no dose for any relationships .
&quot; there were no di@@ alys@@ is studies conducted , due to the great distribution vol@@ um@@ ens is a di@@ alys@@ is however , probably no effective treatment at an oh@@ igg@@ - over@@ dosage . &quot;
&quot; in two random@@ ised double @-@ bl@@ ind@@ ings have been a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received a moderate em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of Cycl@@ oph@@ age@@ ron , with patients compared to 32 mg of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( half @-@ term 2 hours ) or 100 mg Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ term 2 hours ) , which was given to Day 1 without D@@ ex@@ ame@@ th@@ ason intra@@ ven@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; in a random@@ ised double @-@ bl@@ ind@@ ings , a total of 667 patients who received a strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cycl@@ op@@ os@@ et@@ ron , with patients compared to the 32 mg of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron , which were given to day 1 intra@@ ven@@ ous . &quot;
the results of the studies with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ gen@@ er chemotherapy and the study with strongly em@@ eto@@ gen@@ er chemotherapy are summar@@ ized in the following tables .
&quot; in clinical studies the indication of chemotherapy @-@ indu@@ ced nausea and v@@ om@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) were the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; according to the satisfaction of the clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the audit@@ ors and polar@@ isation involved in the field of action and extend the duration of the action potential . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the study was carried out by 221 healthy doct@@ oral study , the assessment of the EC@@ G @-@ effects of i.@@ v. administ@@ ered Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in items of 0.25 , 0.75 and 2,25 mg . &quot;
res@@ or@@ ption After intra@@ ven@@ ö@@ ser G@@ abe follows an initi@@ ated desc@@ ending of plas@@ ma centr@@ ations a slow elimination of the body with an average terminal half @-@ life time of about 40 hours .
the average maximum plas@@ ma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the surface under the concentr@@ ations of time @-@ curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally in the entire dosage field of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ g / kg with fe@@ ar@@ ers and cancer patients dos@@ is@@ proportional .
according to intra@@ ven@@ ous G@@ abe from Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 cans were measured at 11 Ho@@ den@@ kar@@ cin@@ om@@ pat@@ ric patients between day 1 and day 5 mixed medium ( ± SD ) increase in Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron @-@ Plas@@ mac@@ on@@ centr@@ ation at 42 ± 34 % .
&quot; from pharmac@@ opo@@ etic simul@@ ations , that at once daily intra@@ ven@@ ous G@@ abe from 0.25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron after 3 consecutive days reached the total value of 0.75 mg . however , the C@@ max after the arrangement of 0.75 mg was higher . &quot;
about 40 % are eliminated over the kidneys and about another 50 % are converted into two primary met@@ abolic disorders which have compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron about less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on 5@@ HT@@ 3 recept@@ or .
&quot; in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ studies for met@@ abolic isation have shown that CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and , in ger@@ ed dimensions , the I@@ so@@ v. CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 at the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are involved . &quot;
&quot; E@@ lim@@ ination After an intra@@ ven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ gram / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were found approximately 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron made about 40 % of the given dose . &quot;
after a unique intra@@ ven@@ ous bolt @-@ injection mol@@ ds with wo@@ unds was the total body of 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al cle@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
&quot; although patients with severe liver inter@@ ruption have increased the termin@@ ale E@@ lim@@ in@@ ation@@ sh@@ alb@@ wert@@ zeit , and the average system@@ ic exposure time with Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , a reduction of the dose is not justified . &quot;
in pre @-@ clinical studies were only observed after exposure to be considered adequate over the maximum human@@ istic exposure position which indicates a small relev@@ ance for the clinical use .
10 From pre@@ clinical studies were indications that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block in very high concentr@@ ations of I@@ on@@ enk@@ an@@ men who are involved in the v@@ entr@@ icular de@@ - and re@@ polar@@ ization and can extend the action potenti@@ als .
&quot; high doses Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose said about two years ago , led to a multipl@@ ied incidence of liver tum@@ ours , p@@ itu@@ itary Neop@@ las@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid , hyp@@ oph@@ ys@@ al@@ ms ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats , but not with mice . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the used high doses and da Alo@@ xi compared to the unique application , the relev@@ ance of these results will be low as for the people . &quot;

June 2006 the committee of humanity medicines ( CH@@ MP ) has been adopted a negative certificate in which the author@@ ization of approval for the treatment of he@@ patitis C pre @-@ intended drugs called Alp@@ he@@ on 6 million IE / ml inje@@ ctions .
&quot; this means that Alp@@ he@@ on , a biological drug called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same arz@@ ne@@ il@@ ich should be effective component , which is already approved in the EU ( also &quot; Reference arz@@ ne@@ cology &quot; ) . &quot;
Alp@@ he@@ on should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long lasting ) he@@ patitis C ( one by vir@@ al infection ) .

it is produced by a yeast into which a Gen ( DNA ) was brought to this to the formation of the drug .
&quot; the manufacturer of Alp@@ he@@ on placed data in front of the comparison of Alp@@ he@@ on with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A bel@@ egen ( active structure , composition and purity of the drug , effectiveness , safety and effectiveness in he@@ patitis C ) . &quot;
in the study of patients with he@@ patitis C the effectiveness of Alp@@ he@@ on was compared to the effectiveness of the reference rate of 455 patients .
&quot; in the study it has been judged as many patients after 12 from a total of 48 treatment , as well as 6 months after adjustment of the treatment to the medication ( i.e. no sign of the virus in blood ) . &quot;

&quot; furthermore , concerns have been expressed concerns that data is not sufficient for the stability of the drug and the market @-@ market@@ able drug . &quot;
&quot; the number of patients with he@@ patitis C based on treatment with Alp@@ he@@ on and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar in clinical study . &quot;
&quot; after setting up the treatment with Alp@@ he@@ on , the disease was back in more patients than with the reference level of reference ; also Alp@@ he@@ on had more side effects . &quot;
&quot; apart from this , the test was introduced to the study of the question as far as the medication is an immun@@ og@@ lob@@ t ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) is not sufficient . &quot;
it can be used to treat Im@@ pet@@ igo ( one with screw @-@ in @-@ depth Hau@@ tin@@ ction ) and small infected Laz@@ er@@ ations ( R@@ iss@@ - or snor@@ ing ) , de@@ preci@@ ation and se@@ wn wo@@ unds . &quot;
Alt@@ ar@@ go should not be used to treat infections which were det@@ ect@@ able or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ega @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ loc@@ occ@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Al@@ ar@@ go against this kind of infections might not affect .
&quot; Alt@@ ar@@ go can be applied to patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years of age may not exceed 2 % of the surface surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient talks about two to three days not on the treatment , the doctor should once again examine the patient and draw alternative treatments in yield . &quot;
it works by block@@ ing the bacterial in@@ os@@ om@@ es ( the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced and inhib@@ it the growth of bacteria .
&quot; main indic@@ ator of the effectiveness in all five studies were determined by the proportion of patients , their infection after the end of the treatment was del@@ ayed . &quot;
119 ( 8@@ 5,@@ 6 % ) of 139 patients under Alt@@ ar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.7 % ) of 71 patients under plac@@ ebo spoke to treatment .
&quot; in the treatment of infected h@@ oses showed alt@@ ar@@ go and Cef@@ al@@ ex@@ in similar contact : if the results of both studies were summar@@ ized , they spoke about 90 % of the patients of both groups in the treatment . &quot;
&quot; however , in these two studies however , Alt@@ ar@@ go was established in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ ary cav@@ ities in the body tissue ) or infection which were det@@ ect@@ able or probably caused by MR@@ SA , not effective enough . &quot;
the most common side @-@ effect with Alt@@ ar@@ go ( which was observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation at the order .
&quot; the committee on human therapeutic medicines ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the advantages of Alt@@ ar@@ go in the short @-@ time @-@ line treatment of the following su@@ perf@@ icial tin@@ ct@@ ures against the risks exceeded : • Im@@ pet@@ igo , • infected little la@@ vers , de@@ preci@@ ation or se@@ wn wo@@ unds . &quot;
May 2007 the European Commission announced the company G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd . a permit for the In@@ dependence of Alt@@ ar@@ go in the entire European Union .
patients in which within two to three days there is no improvement to be examined and consider an alternative to be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in the case of a sen@@ sibil@@ isation or serious local irrit@@ ation by the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment , the o@@ int@@ ment should be carefully abol@@ ished and an appropriate alternative treatment of the infection started . &quot;
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known or proje@@ cted ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical studies with secondary open wo@@ unds was the effectiveness of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin to patients with infections which were caused by a meth@@ ic@@ illin @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ loc@@ occ@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) .
an alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2- to 3 @-@ day treatment no improvement or deteri@@ oration of the infected place .
the effect of simultaneous use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical resources have not been investigated and the simultaneous use of other top@@ ical drugs is not recommended .
&quot; due to the low plas@@ ma centr@@ ations , which were reached by people after top@@ ical use on sc@@ anned skin or infected su@@ perf@@ icial wo@@ unds , is a clin@@ ically relevant inhib@@ ition in vi@@ vo ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;

&quot; due to the low system@@ ic exposure to top@@ ical use in patients will not be maintained , if top@@ ical Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during a system@@ ic treatment with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhib@@ itors . &quot;
animal studies have shown a re@@ produ@@ ction@@ ary tox@@ icity after oral intake and are in@@ adequate in terms of a statement on the birth and the f@@ öt@@ ale / Post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be used during pregnancy when an top@@ ical anti @-@ bacterial therapy is clearly inde@@ xed and the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin use of a system@@ ic antibiotic .
&quot; when dec@@ iding whether the breastfeeding continues / ended or the therapy continued with Alt@@ ar@@ go , is between the benefit of breastfeeding for inf@@ ants and the benefit of Alt@@ ar@@ go therapy for women . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies at 2@@ 150 patients with su@@ perf@@ icial Hau@@ tin@@ al infections , the Alt@@ ar@@ go was used , most often reported by @-@ effect error , that was about 1 % of the patients . &quot;

the real@@ ism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the sel@@ ective inhib@@ ition of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction with a certain binding point of the Gothic Rib@@ os@@ oms which differ from the bond of other rib@@ os@@ om@@ al inter@@ ag@@ ious anti@@ bacterial substances .
data point out that the bond @-@ site rib@@ os@@ om@@ ales Protein L3 involved and in the region of the rib@@ os@@ om@@ al P bonds and of the Pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transfer@@ as@@ ez@@ ing centre .

&quot; should be aware at the basis of the local preval@@ ence of resistance , the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some infectious forms , should receive a consultation by experts . &quot;
there were no differences in the In @-@ vit@@ ro activity of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us regardless of whether the isol@@ ate sensitive or resistant to Meth@@ ic@@ illin were .
in case of non @-@ speaking on treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us should be considered the presence of stra@@ ins with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ one @-@ Valent@@ ine Leu@@ coc@@ id@@ in ) .

Amb@@ i@@ rix is used to protect he@@ patitis A and he@@ patitis B ( diseases that concern the liver ) in children between one and 15 years that are not immune against these two diseases .
Amb@@ i@@ rix is used in the context of one of two cans of existing vaccines and a protection against he@@ patitis B may only be achieved after approval of the second dose .
&quot; for this reason , Amb@@ i@@ rix may only be used if during the immun@@ ization there is a low risk of he@@ patitis B infection and is ensured that the two cans can lead the existing vacc@@ ination . &quot;
if a r@@ illation dose against he@@ patitis A or B is desirable to be Amb@@ i@@ rix or another he@@ patitis A@@ - or B vaccine .
vaccines have the immune system by using the immune system ( the natural defense of the body ) &quot; ib@@ r@@ ingen &quot; as it can be against a disease .
&quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recogn@@ izes the viruses and surface ant@@ ig@@ ene as &quot; alien &quot; and produces antibodies against it . &quot;
Amb@@ i@@ rix contains the same components as that since 1996 approved vaccine Twin@@ rix adults and since 1997 approved vaccine Twin@@ rix Children .
&quot; the three vaccines have applied to the protection against the same diseases , but Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix Children within the frame made of three cans of existing vaccines . &quot;
&quot; because Amb@@ i@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data that use the application of Twin@@ rix adults , also used as evidence of the application of Amb@@ i@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; the main indic@@ ator for the effectiveness was the proportion of the vacc@@ inated children , which had developed a month after the last injection of an protective antibodies . &quot;
in an additional study with 208 children the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month distance between the two inje@@ ctions .
Amb@@ i@@ rix resulted in between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children a month after the recent inje@@ ctions for the development of protective antibodies against He@@ patitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Amb@@ i@@ rix had similar to six @-@ month and at a 12 @-@ month distance between the inje@@ ctions .
&quot; the most common side effects of Amb@@ i@@ rix ( observed with more than 1 of 10 vaccines ) are head@@ ache , appet@@ ite , pain in the injection , red@@ ness , matt@@ resses ( fatigue ) and irrit@@ ability . &quot;
Amb@@ i@@ rix may not be used in patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the agents such as the other components or Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) not to be used .
August 2002 the European Commission announced the company G@@ lax@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Biolog@@ icals s.@@ a. a permit for the in@@ solven@@ cy of Amb@@ i@@ rix across the whole
&quot; the Stand@@ ardi@@ zed plan for the Grun@@ mun@@ mun@@ ization with Amb@@ i@@ rix consists of two vaccines , whereby the first dose is administ@@ ered on the date of choice and the second dose of between six and twelve months after the first dose . &quot;
if a r@@ ins@@ ure is required for he@@ patitis A and he@@ patitis B can be vacc@@ inated for he@@ patitis A as well as for he@@ patitis B .
the anti @-@ he@@ patitis ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) - and anti @-@ he@@ patitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) - and anti @-@ he@@ patitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) - and anti @-@ he@@ patitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) - and anti @-@ he@@ patitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) - and anti @-@ he@@ patitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) -@@ antibodies are in the same size as according to the vaccine using the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ents vaccines .
&quot; it is not entirely assured , whether or immune @-@ competent persons , which are addressed to a he@@ patitis A@@ - vacc@@ ination , as it may also be protected with no more det@@ ect@@ able antibodies due to the immun@@ ological memory . &quot;
3 As with all injection mol@@ ds should be available for the rare case of an an@@ aph@@ yl@@ actic reaction after the gift of the vaccine appropriate options for medical treatment and monitoring immediately .
&quot; if a fast protection against he@@ patitis B is required , the Stand@@ ardi@@ m@@ pf@@ ema is recommended that contains the 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated He@@ patitis @-@ A @-@ Virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combined he@@ patitis B surface . &quot;
&quot; in Hä@@ modi@@ aly@@ tic patients and individuals with the disorders of the immune system , under circumstances is no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies , so in these cases the gift of other vacc@@ inations may be required . &quot;
&quot; as an in@@ tra @-@ male injection or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration in the facial muscle to an sub@@ optimal im@@ pfer@@ d , these inje@@ ctions should be avoided . &quot;
at Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ top@@ enie or blood flow disorders can be inje@@ cted Amb@@ i@@ rix but it can be inje@@ cted as rel@@ u@@ ct@@ ively as it can occur in these cases after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular G@@ abe .
&quot; when Amb@@ i@@ rix in the second life @-@ year in the form of a separated inje@@ ctions , Tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , az@@ ell@@ ul@@ o@@ rem Per@@ t@@ us@@ - , in@@ active pol@@ i@@ om@@ yel@@ it@@ is@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us s@@ enz@@ ae type b vaccine ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / H@@ ib ) or with a combined mas@@ king &apos;s vaccine was sufficient to all ant@@ ig@@ ens enough ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
patients under immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive therapy or in patients with immun@@ defe@@ ctive effects must be assumed that possibly no sufficient immun@@ answered is achieved .
&quot; in a clinical study that was carried out with 3 vacc@@ inations in adults , the frequency of pain , red@@ ness , sw@@ elling , di@@ ro@@ enter@@ itis , head@@ aches and fe@@ ver comparable to the frequency that was observed in the earlier Th@@ i@@ om@@ ers@@ - and preserv@@ atives @-@ containing vaccines . &quot;
in clinical studies 20@@ 29 vacc@@ inated Amb@@ i@@ rix had been administ@@ ered in a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ inations at the age of 1 to 15 years .
in a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 to 15 including 15 years the compatibility of Amb@@ i@@ rix has been compared with the 3 @-@ cans of bin@@ oc@@ ulars .
&quot; only exceptions were the higher frequency of pain and matt@@ resses on a comp@@ artment base per vaccines Amb@@ i@@ rix , but not on a comp@@ artment base for each person . &quot;
&quot; pain was observed after the gift of Amb@@ i@@ rix at 5@@ 0,@@ 7 % of the pro@@ portions compared to 39,@@ 1 % in the prob@@ ability after the gift of a dose of the 3 @-@ cans . &quot;
&quot; according to the entire vacc@@ ination , 6@@ 6,@@ 4 % of the pro@@ b@@ anden had enough to get over pain , compared to 6@@ 3,@@ 8 % in the pro@@ portions that were vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dos@@ ing combination . &quot;
&quot; however , the frequency of Matt@@ ress was similar to a pro@@ band ( i.e. above all vacc@@ ination at 39,@@ 6 % of the pro@@ b@@ anden , which received Amb@@ i@@ rix compared to 36,@@ 2 % in the pro@@ ofs which received the 3 @-@ cans combination . &quot;
the frequency of emb@@ oss@@ ed pain and matt@@ resses was low and comparable that was observed according to administration of the combinations with the 3 @-@ cans vacc@@ inated .
&quot; in a compar@@ ative study with 1- up to 11 year @-@ year vaccines , the appearance of local actions and public interactions in the Amb@@ i@@ ri@@ x@@ group has been comparable with the 3 @-@ cans combined with 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ active he@@ patitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combined he@@ patitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g . &quot;
&quot; however , when vacc@@ ination up to 11@@ - year @-@ year @-@ olds has been a common occurrence of pain ( at the injection ) per dose , not per pro@@ band . &quot;
the proportion of vacc@@ inations that has heavy side effects during the 2 @-@ cans of vaccines with an@@ i@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ doses vaccines with 360 E@@ LI@@ SA@@ - units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ active he@@ patitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combined he@@ patitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combined he@@ patitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combined he@@ patitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g
&quot; in clinical studies that were conducted at vaccines at the age of 1 to 15 years , the ser@@ oc@@ ular rates were conducted for anti @-@ H@@ AV 99.@@ 1 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , for month 6 administ@@ ered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
the ser@@ oc@@ ular rates for anti @-@ H@@ BS were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second one to the month 6 administ@@ ered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
&quot; 7 In a compar@@ ative study which was conducted at 12@@ - until including 15 @-@ year @-@ old , 142 two cans were carried out Amb@@ i@@ rix and 147 the standard combined sim@@ ulator with three doses . &quot;
&quot; at the 28@@ 9 people whose imm@@ unity was ext@@ endable , the ser@@ op@@ r@@ ote@@ urs ( SP in the table below ) against He@@ patitis B in the month 2 and 6 after gift of the 3 @-@ dos@@ ing fuel it significantly higher than with Amb@@ i@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; the immune response , which were achieved during a clinical compar@@ ative study during 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ old one month after completion of the full vacc@@ ination ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table . &quot;
in both studies the vaccine received either a 2 @-@ doses vacc@@ inated with an@@ i@@ rix or a 3 @-@ doses vacc@@ inated with 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ active he@@ patitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combined he@@ patitis B surface .
&quot; in individuals who were at the time of land@@ slides between 12 and 15 years old , the pers@@ istence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies can be proven for at least 24 months after the immun@@ ization with an@@ i@@ rix in 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ inated . &quot;
in this study ob@@ stru@@ cted imm@@ unity against both ant@@ ig@@ ens was comparable to vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combined sim@@ ulator , consisting of 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ active he@@ patitis B surface in a dosage volume of 0.5 ml . &quot;
in a clinical trial at 12@@ - until including 15 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ old could be shown that the pers@@ istence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies can be compared to immun@@ ization in 0 @-@ 6@@ - months @-@ vacc@@ ema is compared to the 0 @-@ 12 @-@ month @-@ vacc@@ inated .

a clinical study that was conducted with 3 doses of the present wor@@ ding at adults showed that the current wor@@ ding similar ser@@ op@@ r@@ ote@@ ction and ser@@ oc@@ on@@ ions@@ rates as for the previous wor@@ ding .

&quot; he@@ patitis A virus is usually transmitted through vir@@ us@@ eless foods and beverages , but can also be transferred by other paths , such as by bathing in the water @-@ contamin@@ ated waters . &quot;
&quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark Ur@@ in , a bl@@ asses face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( laughter ) and other symptoms that may be necessary for stationary treatment . &quot;
&quot; as with all vaccines , Amb@@ i@@ rix cannot be completely protected from an infection with he@@ patitis A@@ - or he@@ patitis B virus , even if the complete vaccine has been completed with 2 doses . &quot;
if you are infected / your child in front of the approval of both vacc@@ inations Amb@@ i@@ rix are already infected with he@@ patitis C virus or he@@ patitis B virus ( although you can feel free or ill ) a vacc@@ ination may not prevent vacc@@ ination .
&quot; to protect against other infections , which are the liver damage or symptoms which are similar to those after a he@@ patitis C or he@@ patitis B infection , cannot be convey@@ ed . &quot;
• If you have already shown an allergic reaction to Amb@@ i@@ rix or any part of this vaccine including Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
&quot; an allergic reaction can be expressed through ju@@ ching @-@ thousands , breathing , breathing , or attacks of the face , or the tongue . • If you have occurred an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against he@@ patitis A or he@@ patitis B . • If you have a serious infection with fe@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; • If you want to have a protection against he@@ patitis B ( i.e. , within 6 months and before usually issued by the second vaccine osis ) . &quot;
for a possible risk of infection with he@@ patitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination the doctor will advise you / your child from a vacc@@ ination with Amb@@ i@@ rix .
&quot; instead , he will recommend you / your child 3 inje@@ ctions of a combined he@@ patitis C @-@ vaccine with a decre@@ ased content of effective ingredients per vaccines ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated he@@ patitis A virus and 10 micro@@ gram of a re@@ combin@@ ant he@@ patitis B surface ) . &quot;
the second vaccine osis of this vaccine with decre@@ ased content of effective ingredients is usually given a month after the first dose and is likely to give you a vacc@@ ination prior to the end of the vaccine .
sometimes Amb@@ i@@ rix sometimes suffer from people who suffer from severe blood flow disorders caused by the skin and not into the muscle stimulation . • If you are a child based on a disease or treatment in your / his body &apos;s own def@@ ic@@ er / or if you / your child is sub@@ jug@@ ate with a hem@@ at@@ alys@@ is .
&quot; Amb@@ i@@ rix cannot be given in these cases , but the imm@@ ering of these persons on the vacc@@ ination cannot be adequ@@ ately so that a blood can be required to see how strong the reaction is on vacc@@ ination . &quot;
&quot; 21 Make your doctor if you are taking your child other medicines ( including those who have received without sp@@ elling ) or if you / your child has recently been vacc@@ inated / has been received or immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) , have or this is planned in the near future . &quot;
but it may be that in this case the immun@@ answered is not sufficient and the person is not protected against one or both he@@ patitis A and B viruses .
&quot; if a different vaccine must be given at the same time with Amb@@ i@@ rix , should be vacc@@ inated at separate places and as possible as possible as possible as possible . &quot;
&quot; if Amb@@ i@@ rix at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely to be sufficient that the reaction to the vaccine is still adequate . &quot;
&quot; usually , Amb@@ i@@ rix pregnancy or breastfeeding women is not sufficient , except it is urgently needed to be vacc@@ inated both against He@@ patitis A and he@@ patitis B . &quot;
important information on certain other components of Amb@@ i@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
&quot; if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new date as soon as possible . &quot;

&quot; other side @-@ effects , the days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination of he@@ patitis A and he@@ patitis B very rare ( less than 1 case per 10.000 dec@@ imal cans ) were reported : &quot;
&quot; these include limited limited or extensive attacks , the ju@@ ices can be or blu@@ ish @-@ shaped , sw@@ elling of the eyel@@ id and of the face , fr@@ ight@@ ened breathing or sl@@ ice , sud@@ den blood pressure loss and consciousness . &quot;

&quot; 23 inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist , if one of the listed side effects you can significantly imp@@ acted or you notice side effects that are not stated in this pack@@ ag@@ il@@ age . &quot;
Amb@@ i@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs to 50 without need@@ les .
&quot; based on the data , which has become known since creation of the first approval for the In@@ dependence , the CH@@ MP opinion that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Amb@@ i@@ rix is positive . &quot;
&quot; however , Amb@@ i@@ rix only occurred in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data is limited to this drug due to the low patient ex@@ position . &quot;
ammon@@ aps can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with in@@ complete du@@ z@@ ym@@ ium or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ic encephal@@ opathy ( hier@@ archy of high ammon@@ ium concentration ) in the pre @-@ history .
ammon@@ aps is divided - split by several single @-@ p@@ ants to meals - sh@@ ocked , among the food sh@@ uff@@ led or via a gast@@ ro@@ omm@@ ates in the stomach of leading hose ) or a Nas@@ en@@ son@@ de ( through the nose in the stomach of leading hose ) . &quot;
&quot; it was not a compar@@ ative study , as ammon@@ aps do not be compared to any other treatment or with plac@@ ebo ( a head@@ line , i.e. without any ingredient ) . &quot;
&quot; ammon@@ ite can also lead to appet@@ ite loss , an ab@@ normal acid@@ sp@@ ine in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , fluid , fluid , nausea , gl@@ om@@ iting , rash , hum@@ ility , rash , or weight gain . &quot;
the committee on human therapeutic medicines ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that ammon@@ aps in patients with distur@@ b@@ ances of the urinary tract to high ammon@@ ite values effectively prevented .
ammon@@ ium was approved under &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; because of the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of admission only limited information about this medicine .
the use is manifest@@ ed in all patients in which a complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ man@@ gel has already manifest@@ ed in the new@@ born age ( within the first 28 Leb@@ days ) .
in patients with a late manifest@@ ed form ( in@@ complete grand@@ son ) is then manifest@@ ed an indication of the deployment when in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese is a hyper@@ ammon@@ ic encephal@@ opathy .
&quot; for inf@@ ants , for children who are not able to s@@ wal@@ low tablets or for patients with hose ru@@ ptions , AM@@ MONA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form . &quot;
&quot; the daily dose will be individually calculated under consideration of protein toler@@ ance , and the growth and development of the daily protein intake of the patient . &quot;
according to the previous clinical experience the normal daily dose of Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as in her@@ an@@ growing and adults .
&quot; in patients who suffer from an early def@@ ect lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ at@@ synth@@ etic or Orn@@ ith@@ int@@ ran@@ scar@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase , the subst@@ itution of Cit@@ rul@@ line or argin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3,@@ 8 g / m ² / day required . &quot;
patients with ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ uc@@ cin@@ at@@ synth@@ etic short@@ age must be ar@@ ine in a dosage of 0.7 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
&quot; AM@@ MONA@@ PS tablets may not be administ@@ ered with bats , as a risk for the emergence of ec@@ oph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ cer@@ a , if the tablets can not immediately get into the stomach . &quot;
&quot; each tablet AM@@ MONA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium per 20 g so@@ dium poly@@ phenol , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MONA@@ PS should therefore be applied in patients with contra@@ sting heart failure , or severe kidney in@@ suffic@@ iency as well as with so@@ dium um@@ ret@@ ention and econom@@ ists , only with caution . &quot;
&quot; since Met@@ abol@@ ization and ex@@ cre@@ tion of Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate on the liver and the kidneys , should be applied AM@@ MONA@@ PS in patients with liver or kidney failure . &quot;
the significance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ IL@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indications ( see 4.3 ) .
at sub@@ cut@@ ut@@ aner G@@ abe from phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate to young rats in high dosage ( 190 - 474 mg / kg ) came to a sl@@ owing of neur@@ onal iner@@ ation and a increased loss of neur@@ ons .
there were also a del@@ ayed matur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral Syn@@ ap@@ ses and a decre@@ ased number of working ner@@ ves in the brain and thus a disability of the brain growth .
&quot; it could not be noted if phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate is turned off when people into the breast milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ IL@@ PS during breast @-@ feeding ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with AM@@ MONA@@ PS , at 56 % of patients had at least a unwanted event ( AE ) and at 78 % of these undes@@ irable events that they were not connected with AM@@ IL@@ PS . &quot;
&quot; the frequency is defined as follows : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; an prob@@ able toxic response to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 year old an@@ ore@@ ctal patient in conjunction with L@@ act@@ at@@ az@@ id@@ osis , severe hyp@@ oc@@ al emia , peri@@ ph@@ eral Neuropath@@ y and Pan@@ kre@@ at@@ itis . &quot;
a case of an over@@ dosage occurred at a 5 month old small@@ child with an acc@@ idental dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate which showed an intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day an dos@@ ing neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate is a met@@ abolic active connection made by ac@@ et@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to Phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine contained across the kidneys .
St@@ kl@@ i@@ omet@@ ric seen is comparable to phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ rogen at@@ oms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an aging support to the ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nit@@ rogen .
5 patients with distur@@ b@@ ances of the urinary tract can be assumed that for each gram of genom@@ ic so@@ dium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate between 0.@@ 12 and 0.15 g Phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nit@@ rogen .
it is of meaning that the diagnosis is early at an early stage and the treatment is immediately started to improve the survi@@ ving skin and the clinical outcome .
the pro@@ gn@@ osis of the early symptoms of the disease with appearance of first symptoms in the new@@ born age was almost always inf@@ own and the disease led itself in treating with per@@ it@@ one@@ al@@ di@@ alys@@ is and essential amino acids or with their stick@@ ers @-@ free analog@@ a within the first life @-@ year to death .
&quot; by hem@@ at@@ alys@@ is , the util@@ ization of aging ways of the nit@@ rogen secre@@ tion ( so@@ dium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate ) , natur@@ ri@@ um@@ ben@@ zo@@ ate and Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate ) , protein@@ ates k@@ ost and possibly subst@@ itution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rates of new disease ( but within the first life of life ) diagnosed conditions to 80 % . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even with these patients there was time with many for intellectual disabilities or other neuro@@ logical def@@ ic@@ ites . &quot;
in patients with a bel@@ ated form of the disease ( including female patients with hetero@@ gen@@ eous form of the Orn@@ ith@@ int@@ ran@@ scar@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase man@@ gels ) that were treated with so@@ dium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate and a protein@@ ced diet was the survival rate of 98 % .
already existing neuro@@ logical def@@ ic@@ ite are also very reversible for treatment and in some patients may occur another deteri@@ oration of neuro@@ logical states .
&quot; it is known that Phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ox@@ idi@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate ox@@ idi@@ ert , which is jug@@ ated in liver and kidney enzy@@ matic with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine . &quot;
the concentr@@ ations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate and its met@@ abolic in Plas@@ ma and Ur@@ in were obtained after gift of a single dose of 5 g so@@ dium poly@@ phen@@ ates at n@@ udes and repet@@ itive gifts of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled studies ) .
the behavior of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its met@@ abolic rate was also examined in cancer patients after intra@@ ven@@ ous G@@ abe from Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or Phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate .
after an or@@ ally single dose of 5 g so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in tablet form 15 minutes after taking meas@@ urable plas@@ mac@@ ro @-@ centr@@ ations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate .
in the majority of patients with urinary tract disorders or hem@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin@@ opath@@ ies was after different doses of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) the next morning after the no@@ ct@@ urn@@ al fasting no Phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate in plas@@ ma .
&quot; with three of six patients with liver sc@@ ents that were repeated with so@@ dium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 20 g / day oral in three single parts ) , the middle phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ at@@ con@@ centric con@@ centric in the plas@@ mas@@ pie@@ gel on the third day five times higher than after the first gifts . &quot;
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is turned within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of the jug@@ ated product Phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine on the kidneys .
&quot; according to the results of Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( examination 24 and 48 h after or@@ ally administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 2800 mg / kg ) . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MONA@@ PS gran@@ ulate is either taken by oral ( inf@@ ants and children who do not have any tablets , or patients with hose @-@ wr@@ aps or a nas@@ al @-@ tomato soup . &quot;
&quot; according to the previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a weight of over 20 kg as well as for her@@ an@@ growing and adults . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of ammonia , argin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , Car@@ nit@@ ine and Ser@@ um@@ prot@@ eine in plas@@ ma should be held within the Nor@@ mal area . &quot;
&quot; in patients who suffer from an early def@@ ect lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ at@@ synth@@ etic or Orn@@ ith@@ int@@ ran@@ scar@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase , the subst@@ itution of Cit@@ rul@@ line or argin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3,@@ 8 g / m ² / day required . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MONA@@ PS Gran@@ ules includes 124 mg ( 5,@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium per gram of so@@ dium poly@@ phenol , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium per 20 g so@@ dium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
if R@@ att@@ enf@@ els were exposed before birth phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate ( active Met@@ abol@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ) came to les@@ ions in the pyram@@ ids of the cor@@ tex .
&quot; an prob@@ able toxic response to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 year old an@@ ore@@ ctal patient in conjunction with L@@ act@@ at@@ az@@ id@@ osis , severe hyp@@ oc@@ al emia , peri@@ ph@@ eral Neuropath@@ y and Pan@@ kre@@ at@@ itis . &quot;
St@@ kl@@ i@@ omet@@ ric seen is phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea comparable ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ rogen at@@ oms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative vehicle to ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess
on the basis of investigations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with distur@@ b@@ ances of the urinary tract can be assumed that for each gram of genom@@ es Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate between 0.@@ 12 and 0.15 g Phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nit@@ rogen .
already existing neuro@@ logical def@@ ic@@ ite are also very reversible for treatment and in some patients may occur another deteri@@ oration of neuro@@ logical states .

&quot; ang@@ io@@ x is used to treat patients with &quot; ac@@ ute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes &quot; ( ACS , decre@@ ased blood flow to the heart ) , for example with inst@@ abil@@ er ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ k@@ ardin@@ al ( heart attack ) without &quot; ST@@ - Heb@@ an ( or EC@@ G ) . &quot;
&quot; if Ang@@ io@@ x is applied to the prevention of blood pressure in patients which reaches a higher dose , and inf@@ usion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this can increase in patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack , to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of one PCI . &quot;
&quot; nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study of the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of ang@@ io@@ x at all@@ ele @-@ one @-@ I@@ I@@ b / I@@ I@@ I@@ a @-@ In@@ hib@@ itor ( G@@ PI , another medicine for preventing blood treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ) and a G@@ PI compared . &quot;
&quot; during the PCI was often a st@@ ent ( a short tubes , which remains in the arter@@ ies to prevent a cl@@ asp ) and they received additional medicines to prevent blood cl@@ auses , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and A@@ spir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of ACS , Ang@@ io@@ x - with or without fork from G@@ PI - in preventing new events ( deaths , heart attacks or re@@ vas@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation ) after 30 days or one year altogether as effective as usual treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients who were subje@@ cted to PCI , Ang@@ io@@ x was in terms of all indicators just as effective as He@@ par@@ in , except for severe ble@@ eding which it was significantly more effective than He@@ par@@ in . &quot;
&quot; ang@@ io@@ x may not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against b@@ ival@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine , other Hir@@ ud@@ ine or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , it may not be applied to patients who recently had a blood pressure , as well as in people with strong hyper@@ tension or severe kidney problems or a heart . &quot;
the committee on human therapeutic medicines ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that ang@@ io@@ x is used in the treatment of ACS and during one PCI a acceptable replacement for He@@ par@@ in .
September 2004 announced the European Commission to the Company The Medi@@ c@@ ines Company UK Ltd . a permit for the im@@ il@@ ight of ang@@ io@@ x in the whole European Union .
to treat adult patients with ac@@ ute cor@@ al cord ( inst@@ ab@@ ile ang@@ ina / non @-@ lever ) in a not@@ ch or if an early intervention is provided .
the recommended initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis of ang@@ io@@ x in patients with ACS is an intra@@ ven@@ ous st@@ amping of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an inf@@ usion of 0.25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; if in case of patients being carried out a PCI result , an additional bol@@ us should be given by 0.5 mg / kg and the inf@@ usion for the duration of the intervention on 1,75 mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; according to the PCI needs , the reduced inf@@ usion dose of 0,25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; immediately before the procedure , a bol@@ ts of 0.5 mg / kg are administ@@ ered , followed by an inf@@ usion of 1,75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the entrance . &quot;
the recommended dosage of ang@@ io@@ x in patients with one PCI consists of a initi@@ ated intra@@ ven@@ ous bol@@ ts of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and a hier@@ archy directly subsequent intra@@ ven@@ ous inf@@ usion with a dose of 1,75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention .
the security and effectiveness of a all@@ ele Bol@@ us @-@ G@@ abe of Ang@@ io@@ x was not examined and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned .
&quot; if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) can be short@@ ened under 225 seconds , a second bol@@ ts should be made from 0,@@ 3 mg / kg / body weight . &quot;
&quot; to reduce the appearance of low ACT values , the re@@ constit@@ uted and dil@@ uted medicine should be mixed in front of the application carefully and the Bol@@ us@@ d@@ dose will quickly bl@@ ended intra@@ ven@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , another surveillance is no longer required , provided that is charged to 1.75 mg / kg inf@@ usion d@@ osis is correct . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney functioning ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are treated to one PCI ( whether with B@@ ival@@ ir@@ ud@@ in against ACS or not ) , should be a lower inf@@ usion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; lies the ACT value under 225 seconds , is a second bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis of 0.@@ 3 mg / kg to ad@@ here and the ACT 5 minutes check again after the second Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney disease , which led to approval I@@ I@@ I@@ - PCI @-@ study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which was included in the phase I@@ I@@ I@@ - PCI @-@ study , the ACT value 5 minutes after gift of the B@@ ival@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Bol@@ us without dosage adjustment at an average 36@@ 6 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
3 In patients with severe kidney disease ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also on di@@ alys@@ is patients is ang@@ io@@ x contra@@ indications ( see under section 4.3 ) .
the treatment with Ang@@ io@@ x can be reached 30 minutes after the end of intra@@ ven@@ ous gift from un@@ fra@@ ction@@ ated He@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after termination of sub@@ cut@@ aneous gases .
• known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any other components or against Hir@@ ud@@ ine • active ble@@ eding or increased blood risk . • severe in@@ controlled hyper@@ tension and sub@@ ac@@ idi@@ otic end@@ oc@@ ar@@ dit@@ is . • severe in@@ controlled hyper@@ tension and sub@@ ac@@ idi@@ otic end@@ oc@@ ar@@ dit@@ is .
patients are carefully chosen during treatment and signs of blood circulation especially when b@@ ival@@ ir@@ ud@@ ge is sufficient in combination with another anti@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; even if you occur in PCI @-@ patients under B@@ ival@@ ir@@ ud@@ in most cons@@ or@@ ations to arter@@ ial points , in patients who occur themselves to a per@@ k@@ ut@@ aneous Kor@@ on@@ ar@@ intervention ( PCI ) , during the treatment of principle everywhere ble@@ eding . &quot;
&quot; in patients , the war@@ far@@ in and treated with B@@ ival@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International standard , Rat@@ io ) should be considered to ensure that the value is achieved after processing the treatment with b@@ ival@@ ir@@ ud@@ ly restored before the treatment existing level . &quot;

Ap@@ id@@ ra is used to treat adults to adol@@ esc@@ ents and children from six years with diabetes which need a treatment with ins@@ ulin .
Ap@@ id@@ ra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdom@@ inal wall , the th@@ igh or the top@@ arm inje@@ cted or as continuous inf@@ usion with a ins@@ ulin pump . &quot;
diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce sufficient ins@@ ulin to control of gl@@ uc@@ ose levels ( sugar ) in the blood or the ins@@ ulin cannot be effective .
ins@@ ulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in differ very slightly of human ins@@ ulin and the change means that it acts faster and a shorter real@@ time has as a short @-@ effective Human@@ ins@@ ulin .
Ap@@ id@@ ra has been studied in combination with a long @-@ effective ins@@ ulin in patients with type @-@ 1 diabetes where the body can produce no ins@@ ulin in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years .
&quot; in type 2 diabetes , with which the body ins@@ ulin cannot be effective used , Ap@@ id@@ ra was examined in a study with 8@@ 78 adults . &quot;
&quot; the main indic@@ ator for the effectiveness was the change of concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated her@@ mo@@ dest@@ ine ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood , which shows how good the blood sugar is adjusted . &quot;
in the first study with adults with type @-@ 1 diabetes after six months a reduction of 0.3 % ( 7.4 % to 7.4 % ) compared to a reduction of 0.6 % at In@@ sul@@ in@@ l@@ is@@ pro .
in adults with type @-@ 2 diabetes the low@@ ering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration 5 % after six months with Ap@@ id@@ ra compared to 90 % in human nor@@ mal@@ ins@@ ulin .
Ap@@ id@@ ra may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic to ins@@ ulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in or one of the other ingredients are suffering from a hyp@@ ogly@@ c@@ emia .
doses of Ap@@ id@@ ra may possibly be adapted when it comes along with a number of other medicines which can affect blood glu@@ cos@@ ities .
September 2004 announced the European Commission of the company San@@ ofi @-@ av@@ ent@@ is Deutschland GmbH for approval of Ap@@ id@@ ra in the entire European Union .
Ap@@ id@@ ra is considered to be sub@@ cut@@ aneous inje@@ cting either in the field of abdom@@ inal ceiling , the head of the epithel@@ ium or sal@@ ut@@ or by continuous inf@@ usion in the area of the abdom@@ inal - to appl@@ ause . &quot;
&quot; due to the decre@@ ased Glu@@ con@@ ogen@@ esis capacity and the decre@@ ased in@@ sul@@ ated ins@@ ulin , the ins@@ ulin can be put down in patients with a restriction of the liver function . &quot;
&quot; any change of the real strength , the brand ( Her@@ - St@@ eller ) , the In@@ sul@@ int@@ yp@@ s ( normal , N@@ PH , z@@ ink@@ er@@ del@@ ayed etc . ) , the type of ins@@ ulin ( animal ins@@ ulin ) and / or the manufacturer methods can move a change in the ins@@ ulin . &quot;
&quot; 3 A in@@ sufficient dosage or breakthrough treatment , especially in patients with a insul@@ ated diabetes , can lead to a hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic and a di@@ ab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ acid@@ osis ; these states are potentially vital @-@ threat@@ ening . &quot;
the conversion of a patient at another ins@@ ulin type or an ins@@ ulin of another manufacturer should be carried out under strict medical supervision and can make a change in dosage needed .
the date of occurrence of a hyp@@ ogly@@ c@@ emia depends on the drug profile of the used ins@@ ulin and can therefore change in conversion of the treatment schem@@ es .
