<seg id="6">"Abilify is applied to the treatment of severe and severe episodes and prevention of manic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past."</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution will be applied to the rapid control of stacking unrest or behavioral disorders when the oral intake of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in both diseases, the solution can be applied to the embedding of or the melting tablets in patients are prepared to prevent the slugs of tablets."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in patients who are able to use other medicines just like Abilify, the dose should be adjusted to Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this affects the signal transmission between brain cells by" neurotransmitters, i.e. chemical substances that allow communication of nerve cells. "</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazol probably acts as "partial Agonist" for the receptors for neurotransmitter Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (also serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means that Aripiprazol like 5-hydroxytryptamine and dopamine, but in graced dimensions than the neurotransmitter works to activate the receptors."</seg>
<seg id="13">"da Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder plays a role, carries Aripiprazol to normalize the activity of the brain, thus reducing psychotic or manic symptoms."</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of Abilify that prevent the occurrence of the symptoms was investigated in three studies over up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of injections was compared in two studies at 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases that compared to a placebo over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">"in another study, Abilify about twelve weeks at 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study was to prevent the effectiveness of Abilify and placebo that have been stabilized with Abilify symptoms in which the manic symptoms were already stabilized with Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="17">The effectiveness of Abilify injections was compared to 301 patients with bipolar disorder that compared to Lorazepam (another antipsychotic medication) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in all studies the change in patients have been investigated on the basis of a standard scale for bipolar disorder, or the number of patients who spoke to treatment."</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also led studies through to examine how the body protects the melting tablets and the solution to embedding.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the two studies with the injection of patients, the Abilify in doses of 5,25 mg, 9,75 mg or 15 mg received, a significantly stronger reduction of symptoms increased unrest than patients who received a placebo."</seg>
<seg id="21">The application for the treatment of bipolar disorder dized Abilify in four of the five short-time studies were more effective than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">"in addition to 74 weeks, it has been more effective than placebo the repetitive episodes in previously treated patients and if in addition to an existing treatment was administered."</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg cans were also more effective than placebo the symptoms gested unrest and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">"the most common side effects of Abilify to embedding (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extratyramidal disorders (constipation), frying, nausea and exhaustion (increased specificity), fatigue and exhaustion, ruelessness, insomite (insomnia) and anxiety."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the committee on human therapeutic medicines (CHMP) came to the conclusion that the advantages of Abilic episodes associated with bipolar-I-disorder as well as in the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had mainly manic episodes associated with Aripiprazol, towards the risks overweigh."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in addition, the committee came to the result that the benefits of injections in the fast control of increased anxiety and behavioral disorders in patients with both schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes associated with bipolar-I disorder, if an oral therapy is not suitable to weigh the risks."</seg>
