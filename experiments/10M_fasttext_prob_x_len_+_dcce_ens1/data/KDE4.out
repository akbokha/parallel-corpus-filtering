package &amp; package ; contains different modules for &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; in spite of its low size they provide some additional functions and simpl@@ ify the use of some functions of &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; by making it easier available .
further information on the use of &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual .
&quot; to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; please select settings extensions , open the card card tools and select the desired modules . &quot;
&quot; this is a list of standard modules from the package KDE ; add @-@ ons . please note that any more modules are installed on your system , if you have additional software installed . &quot;
&quot; you should install the package k@@ de@@ base , the &amp; quer@@ quer@@ or ; contains , before you comp@@ ile this package . &quot;
&quot; to use the crash module , click in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on extr@@ as . then you can view the page , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; the list of cr@@ ashes , if available . &quot;
the module covers ( also folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; Menu bar under extr@@ as filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos;s current working directory in different ways .
&quot; to use the DO@@ M design view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to use extr@@ as DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed website . as a pre@@ set , the display begins with the root of the document , example : document@@ element , all other kn@@ ots are under@@ elements of this root . &quot;
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides another view for objects with the M@@ IME @-@ Type In@@ ode / directory in local files . it can be used as an alternative to the various toolbar and text views to view the content of your local files@@ ystem .
&quot; the property of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists of a rect@@ angle folder , which is depic@@ ted with the help of a so @-@ called Tree @-@ Map graph@@ ically . each object is proportional to its size . this size must possess the property that the sum of the sizes of the sub@@ ordin@@ ate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object . &quot;
&quot; at &amp; FS@@ View ; reflects the size of a file or folder , whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of a folder as the sum of the size of the items in it . therefore , it can be easily recognized as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX , command you can see . &quot;
in &amp; FS@@ View ; is an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap representation of a rect@@ angle which represents a file or folder in your files@@ ystem .
&quot; the color of a rect@@ angle which is swit@@ ched over view of colour mode , either depth for the slight detection of the wedge locking as name , owner , group or M@@ IME @-@ type . &quot;
a rect@@ angle can be set with the various characteristics of the corresponding file or folder . for each property you can specify if there is enough room to display or whether the surface of sub@@ ordin@@ ate can occur or whether the surface of sub@@ ordin@@ ate can occur . in addition , you can specify the relative position of the lab@@ eling in the rect@@ angle . &quot;
&quot; in Dar@@ kness algorithms for Tre@@ em@@ aps , this goal should not always be respected for the size of the entry . at the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View ; this goal is not always available to provide the sub@@ ordin@@ ate entries . note that less space is lost for the frame when the rect@@ angle square is square . &quot;
&quot; as a division of the surface of an agreement for the sub@@ ordin@@ ate entries is carried out , the implementation remains left . here it is for the compl@@ eting and for avo@@ iding the areas to arise that rect@@ angles are protected as quadrat@@ ic . the best methods of this respect are lines , columns or re@@ cur@@ sive cross@@ over . &quot;
&quot; you can specify the minimal area for an entry on the menu item view . instead , a swee@@ p pattern into the area of the over@@ laid contract is drawn to indicate that this area is actually occupied by an sub@@ ordin@@ ate entry . &quot;
&quot; originally was &amp; FS@@ View ; as small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map widgets , which was developed for the application K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind . &quot;

&quot; although &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; easy to use , it provides fit professional skills . it works fully in 16 @-@ bit Far@@ br@@ aum and all available modules support the raw converting using li@@ bra@@ w , DNG export and ICC @-@ color wo@@ unded workflow . &quot;
&quot; improved database with considerably more met@@ ad@@ ata , such as &amp; eg ; on the camera or the lens , which can be sought . &quot;
like all &amp; KDE ; programs is also &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; an open source project . this means it is based on the support of the En@@ dan@@ wen@@ der . you should therefore have problems and improvements .
&amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; tries to report the mel@@ ting of problems or suggestions for them . wherever you use yourself in the program that opens your web browser a page in error messages . all required information is already registered here . follow the instructions to submit your review .
&quot; if a project that is supported by a community . i.e. , the user and developer will help each other . if you want to answer any questions to other users of &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; then we would like to answer any questions to other users of &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; and we hope to answer other users with other users . in this ma@@ iling list , you should answer this language therefore powerful . &quot;
you can also visit the dig@@ ik@@ am ; homepage to visit News about the given versions and other information about &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; to learn .
the best start to participate in &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; to participate in the developer @-@ ma@@ iling@@ list . instructions to sign in the developer @-@ ma@@ iling@@ list of &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ;

&quot; a simple to use camera will be provided to you with your digital camera and you can download your photos directly in &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; -@@ albums will be supported by using the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , each medium is supported by your operating system , with &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; work together . &quot;
modern digital cameras are registered by using Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire
&amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; uses the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 for communication with digital cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 is a free to re@@ distribut@@ able software collection designed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images of digital cameras to computers and other peri@@ pher@@ als without the need for additional drivers .
&quot; many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . as photos generally large files are out@@ dated , this connection has now obsolete . &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; supports these cameras and guides the transfer of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found at this link . &quot;
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 has to be created with li@@ bex@@ if support have been created by some lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 camera . the company will not be read by some lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 . the following support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 . if the Exif is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 that you might have the th@@ umb@@ nails possibly nothing could be or the production could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things on &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; is how easy to expand its functionality by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the KDE Image plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is a approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; the Photo@@ album , Show@@ im@@ g and G@@ wen@@ view . aim is to provide the modules with all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section . &quot;
&quot; modules can man@@ ip@@ ulate images in virtually any way , as it can also be a user . your advantage is that it is much easier , and dig@@ ging by writing a small module to complement a function when changes in &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; even perform . &quot;
&quot; to simpl@@ ify the window , you can either remove the side@@ bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or change in full @-@ mode mode with F@@ 11 or Ctr@@ l + Shift + F . &quot;
&quot; drag and dism@@ ant@@ ling from pictures everywhere : you can lay a picture in another part of the al@@ ot line , above the horizontal separ@@ ating line or into another application window . the only limitation is the one image not in keywords , file list or search . &quot;
&quot; - one file selection allows you to complete the most common : JPEG , PNG , TIFF , Ro@@ h , movies and Audio &quot;
the text filter is used only for the fields that can be shown in the toolbar only when this ind it can also appear . which fields are shown to be displayed in the dialog of the aging settings .
&quot; the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ list@@ equ@@ ot ; provides an organized view of your photo gallery . these albums can be saved according to the folder , in which they are created on the hard disk , according to the name of their collection in the Al@@ ben@@ ds or by the date , to which the album has first been created . the date may be modified in the properties of the album . &quot;
&quot; if you have a scanner set up , you can also scan a photo directly to an album . you can also add a screenshot directly to one album . &quot;
&quot; to copy a picture from an album to another , or move the photo with the mouse on the target album and click here . in which the image you need to move or copy it . you can simply copy all photos and move it to the target album . &quot;
&quot; one album contains a collection of photos and the Alb@@ um@@ ber@@ ships allow you to access information on this collection . to select the album , click on the album , click on the album Record@@ ing menu . &quot;
&quot; Alb@@ um@@ - Colle@@ ctions : are a method of select your albums , so that you can select from your photos if you select from the collection , if you want to add a collection from the toolbar or want to delete new collections . if you want to add new collections . if you want to add new collections , you can make this in the settings for collections . &quot;
the Alb@@ um@@ - Date : is used when you sort your albums after date with view albums by date .
&quot; the heads of oldest , average , new test@@ er : these set the date on the one of the oldest , the latest image or the passage of the album . that &apos;s first attempts to calculate the average of images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last change of any file is used in this folder . &quot;
&quot; if you first open an album in &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; will open the first image in the album as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ list@@ equ@@ ot ; sometimes this is the first photo in the album not representative , and you might want to choose another photo as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to select another photo as an album icon , you must click the picture with the right mouse button and select in the context menu &amp; quot ; As Alb@@ um@@ pre@@ schau &quot; . &quot; in addition , you can draw the photo to the album in the list to put it as a symbol . &quot;
one album can always be included in a collection and collections may not be wast@@ ed .
&amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the field of mine keywords left down in the main window . album collections have a different effect . the collection includes always all photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
the image window provides you the main view of your photos . if you choose an album will display all the pictures in this album in the image window . each photo will be shown in a preview that can adjust the size of this preview with the two l@@ up@@ heads in the toolbar .

&quot; it character@@ izes any image by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows images to compare these sign@@ atures . the lower the difference between two sign@@ atures , the more correspond to them . this technique is applied in three areas . &quot;
&quot; similar entries : this is an area in which you can drop each image . by means of a spon@@ ge , the result can be enlarged or res@@ ized . if you go a picture from somewhere over the icon of the in@@ sufficient search in the left side bar , then you will open it and you can drop it there . &quot;
sketch : free sketch : drawing a fast sketch and dig@@ ik@@ am ; finds the matching images .
this rider provides an intuitive map search engines based on the Mar@@ ble mini@@ ature program . you can press Ctr@@ l ; lin@@ ker mouse button to pull a square . all pictures within this coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . this course requires your images Geo @-@ data .
in the box below you can specify a name for your Geo @-@ filter . this will then be added for a later use of the list below . it works like a live Geo@@ folder .
&quot; &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; puts a lumin@@ osity in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . he works with all supported images formats , also raw files . &quot;
select one or more pictures from any view in the main window and then use Ctr@@ l ; L D@@ em fluores@@ cent add from the context menu . the selection will be added to the lumin@@ aire window . if you are back in &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; main window you can open the lumin@@ osity quickly with L extr@@ as .
&quot; from the pre@@ sw@@ amp you can draw the pictures you want to see in the left or right area of the window and put it off . a small arrow shows you to see what copy of the toolbar can select and Zoo or move operations on one of the images , then these can also be compared to the other picture . you can thus compare the same section of the two images . &quot;
another mode is better suited to display quickly from a picture series . if you use pa@@ ar@@ wise navig@@ ating from the toolbar to display it in the left side . the right is shown in the right area . this is easier to work in the right area . this is easier to work in the right area . this is easier to work through a number of similar images .
of course the normal sol@@ vers work also directly from the lumin@@ osity like F@@ 4 File Edit ...
all images from the right side bar of the main window are available for both th@@ umb@@ nails . this makes it easy to connect the differences with ventilation data .
&quot; in the lower end of each area you will find a built @-@ in foam function , which you can see in the crossed arrows . to push the visible area of the image , you need to stop this and the &amp; L@@ MB ; pressed in the mode of the same image will then show both pictures of the same image . &quot;
the zo@@ om@@ es works as well as in other views . use the zoom controllers under the pictures or Ctr@@ l ; mouse wheel around in the picture and out into zo@@ om@@ es . this happens in both pictures when you are viewing in the mode .
what is a digital invent@@ ory government - apart from the fashion management ? digital component management has been taken during the picture until the fin@@ als edition and the permanent storage . each of the photos saves a form of digital component management through . most of us do this not in a systematic and efficient way .
&quot; we give you a tool to secure a plan and practical tips on how to secure your images . we will consider downloading , ren@@ aming , backup , store , store , stor@@ ing , secur@@ ing , optim@@ izing , waiting and export of image files . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; digital invent@@ ory administration takes on , inde@@ xed , categor@@ ized , sec@@ ures , transform@@ ers , con@@ feder@@ ated and exports contents that have a mon@@ et@@ ary or cultural value hab@@ .@@ quot ; &quot;
met@@ ad@@ ata are defined as data on data . met@@ ad@@ ata data is defined in accordance with your definition data that provide information about or a documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment .
&quot; I d@@ are to claim if you need more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you will not even know how many photos you have . if you do not even know how many photos you have , then use very fast search and secure archiving on which you can access with other programs , platforms and formats . &quot;
&quot; the first thing you do and know before you need anything in your system , the structure of information structure is to be organized in contrast to data structure . you have to decide whether other access to your photos do not want to store them on a reserved drive or on a network of network &amp; etc ; notice that you will eventually have to switch to a larger drive . &quot;
&quot; maybe you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be found quickly via your location , for you were in one year several times the same place . if you have enough photos , then you will add sub@@ folder as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; then use a folder for pictures you print or publish on a website . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have other requirements such as Vers@@ ion@@ ing of the photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant flow of pictures to different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % archives and 5 % work files and you will then want to re@@ organize your structure for this content . &quot;
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the st@@ acking processing easier . separate new from old files .
the separation of original and work@@ files simpl@@ ifies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a deriv@@ ative picture .
&quot; we also recommend the met@@ ad@@ ata data stored in the opening of the met@@ ad@@ ata in &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; it is sure that Ex@@ if@@ - and IP@@ TC data will be written in the file . if you forget , then you can save the met@@ ad@@ ata from the database in the files by selecting the appropriate point in the menu . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change ? that &apos;s a met@@ ad@@ ata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important . &quot;
&quot; now , the real work begins , since you have now ass@@ ign each photo keyword , sign@@ ify and a review . of course you can choose the same attribute and put the value . you start the best with the evaluation or the ang@@ ible . this makes sense , since you can concentrate on the best photos . &quot;
&quot; now let us start with keywords , keywords how to continue with other programs often or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot;
&quot; if you want to import kat@@ alog@@ ized pictures from another source of embedded keywords , then the images is to build on the right place . the re@@ sort@@ ing of the hier@@ archy within the tree is not a problem and can simply be done by pul@@ ling a sub@@ tree on another . the changed keywords are updated by &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; updated while there is the sub@@ trees . &quot;
the graphic shows how different met@@ ad@@ ata is cutting itself . this is a very rough representation since each block is composed of met@@ ad@@ ata in truth from many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data of all images .
&quot; enough of the keywords - the next section refers to complaint or comments , the third important tool to cat@@ alog@@ y your met@@ ad@@ ata . &quot;
&quot; you want to see most of anyone watching your photos just see , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies . they are certainly interested in your photos . &quot;
&quot; take a look at this panorama . from the distance it is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you view it closer , then you start to see some details , people , the place . &quot;
&quot; and now I say to you this is the landing place of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing is . Wow ! it starts to dream , associations , the historical time of time is again present , you may even hear the silence . the lab@@ eling has changed your perception of this panorama . &quot;
&quot; for others who consider your photos , the title may be more important than the image itself to generate an interest . remember that the key is it to help you tell us about the motive it moves to understand what you understand what you understand . &quot;
it is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only with a lab@@ eling for itself alone .
&quot; with dig@@ ik@@ am ; you can easily export any number of text , in an internation@@ alised alp@@ habet ( U@@ TF @-@ 8 ) , then you can also export it for a selection of pictures simultaneously . &quot;
remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find in a different city without navigation system ? she was not a boring planet ahead of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now already with light speed .
&quot; moreover , the possibilities offered by Ge@@ ol@@ ok@@ ization are already emp@@ ow@@ able and will be able to open up your trips in the near future . I can also export your trips with Goo@@ gle@@ Earth . you can also export your trips with Goo@@ gle@@ Earth . you can also export the pictures at G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flick@@ r &amp; etc ; with the Goo@@ gle@@ Maps viewer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; cop@@ y@@ left is a voc@@ abulary with copyright and refers to the practice the cop@@ y@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies . the same freedoms are also in all changed versions , so also for the work of others . &quot;
the following description tells you what information in the furnishings of &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; as information you should be depos@@ ited :
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for creators and author ) : this field should add your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not required to use the name of the photographer , for example , the name of a company or organization should not be changed . this field does not support Kom@@ mas nor sem@@ icol@@ on as separ@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the title ( syn@@ onym for author ) : linked to the author . this field contains the work@@ book of the photographer . examples of this may be title as : employee photographer , fre@@ el@@ ance photographer or independent commercial photographer , this field must be filled with it . &quot;
&quot; publisher ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the vend@@ er@@ field to identify who the photo has to offer . this is not necessarily the author . if the photograph is shown here . if the picture is a warehouse photo , then the group / agency that offers the image here . &quot;
&quot; it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although this does not provide protection against mis@@ use . everyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calcul@@ ator . for individuals , this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and half @-@ professionals , this protection is very important against it . &quot;
the digital water@@ mark is per image unique . &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; will provide such a module for for@@ k@@ lifts in the near future .
&quot; themes : PLA@@ TE N@@ FE@@ H@@ LER , tur@@ nt@@ ables , dat@@ ag@@ ons , EC@@ C , transmission , ag@@ eing , lifestyle , lifestyle , temperature , data size , widespread super@@ st@@ itions . &quot;
&quot; of course , we do not talk about CDs that can be lost on the street or a fire . these kinds of losses are those who can happen to you in traditional paper fot@@ os or neg@@ atives . in this section it comes to problems with the so called new media . &quot;
&quot; K@@ roll On@@ track , the largest data collection in the world , has some interesting statistics which causes a data loss . &quot;
&quot; to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs they need to be treated more difficult and you can no longer stay longer than a couple of years . of course you can also keep CDs and DVDs in archives quality , you can also get more difficult to get more difficult and much more expensive . there are offers more than gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years for themselves . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ read@@ able , but you can use this risk in which you use good Dis@@ ks and good recording and they are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write a lot of reliable . &quot;
&quot; CDs and DVDs are very sus@@ cep@@ tible to bugs , even if you just have written for formatt@@ ing . 75 % of the data is only effective data , the rest we needed for formatt@@ ing and the check@@ boxes . despite this massive protection they age through chemical ag@@ eing , Ul@@ tra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; for defe@@ ctive CDs and DVDs there are a cheap program called I@@ so@@ B@@ uster which seems to be able to read mir@@ acles on CDs and DVDs , but is still not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read the damaged data of damaged disks , hard disk , Flash@@ media , etc . &quot;
optical Media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to win the formatt@@ ed war against the HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disk can save 50 GB and thus almost hex@@ sm@@ al the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB . everything that has been said to CDs and DVDs is of course also valid for the Blu @-@ ray disc .
&quot; slowly , burn slowly with a good recording of high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ etary format . also read the media with a description , date &amp; author marks and then protected on a clean , dark dry and a animals protected place . don &apos;t forget to copy the data to the next generation of media or software that can read this media . &quot;
Disk@@ Dir retain your statistics for themselves . your manufacturer guarantees a new disk , but not the data . Google presents a large fiel@@ d@@ ential control via the error mechan@@ ic of hard disk : disk space &quot;
&quot; shortly : Dis@@ ks hold the longest in the temper@@ ament range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C . at lower temper@@ ament , this error can not determine this error . some of SMART made mistakes is the most common failure . &quot;
&quot; this is only the complete loss due to over voltage . of course you can also have data loss due to an electricity , before you have secured the files , but these losses can normally recover without great problems . &quot;
&quot; while most electric devices are not much to do , these an@@ om@@ al@@ ies can take advantage of devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed key@@ boards , complete data loss , hardware age , destru@@ ctive motherboards , and other def@@ ect that leads to a loss of time and money . &quot;
&quot; the most widely used protection against electricity , is an over@@ thr@@ illing protection . this is a device that absor@@ bed a part of the energy saving and the rest . it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ in bar . remember that it is not included in the form of a plug @-@ in bar . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for an over@@ thr@@ illing protection , then you should pay attention to the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also pay attention to the protection against Blitz@@ krieg and thus protects the right connected devices . &quot;
&quot; as a hyper@@ tension can use each cable to your computer , you should be sure that all peri@@ pher@@ als can be connected to your system . some manufacturers provide head@@ lines for your modem . others offer connectors for your modem . others offer connectors for the co@@ ax@@ ial cable of the cable mode@@ ms and the TV card . &quot;
&quot; if you have a not@@ ebook , then you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specifically designed for not@@ ebooks and therefore also contain protection for the modem . so you are ideal for travel . &quot;
&quot; while an over@@ thr@@ illing protection your system is protected from smaller variations in the electricity generation , it will not really help you . even a loss of few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful in an inter@@ changeable power supply . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the protection against vol@@ t@@ ages , these devices will automatically pass the cordless power when a black@@ out occurs . this gives you the opportunity to store your data and then you should be sure that they use the same quality standards like a t@@ ension@@ ing protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the appropriate software is interesting . &quot;
&quot; raise the potential risk that is exposed to your computer system and compare his safety when paying with the costs to prevent this . a high quality over@@ voltage protection can be used as well as your computer . at the end , you should always remember all the cable to tr@@ enne before you go to the holidays . &quot;
&quot; the Amazon Web @-@ service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple memory service . with the right configuration you can use this as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as a backup destination to your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is a popular offer with which you can store any amount of data . &quot;
&quot; you are at home compared to the HDDs , but very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 500 . furthermore , you have to send the data using the compar@@ atively slow internet . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the solutions are only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . it is too slow . &quot;
&quot; Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flick@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo @-@ community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services available on photos . your free memory is available on 1 GB and you will not get your pictures in full resolution online . for $ 25 per year you get unlimited memory , which should only be ver@@ ified in reality . &quot;
&quot; from the point of view of the data , the Web @-@ solutions are very safe . transmission errors are automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP @-@ protocol automatically and with the large companies can be included in the offer a backup and a distributed memory . so they are des@@ ast@@ er@@ sure . &quot;
the diagram illustr@@ ates the elements of the transmission chain in calcul@@ ator . all transfers are pr@@ one to transmission errors . the files@@ ystem Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs are at least the data integ@@ ers between operating system and hard drive safely .
&quot; the worst thing is that nobody says when a transmission error occurred , not when this happened in your hardware . all these distur@@ b@@ ances stay un@@ discovered until you have not thought it . no one seems to have thought it . the Internet with its TCP @-@ protocol is a much safer data way than that in your computer . &quot;
un@@ reliable networks are another source of transmission loss since they generate inter@@ fer@@ ences within the data flow . in normal files@@ ystems these errors remain un@@ noticed .
&quot; even if you are currently not affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of errors a year . &quot;
Z@@ FS by Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who are able to deal with tur@@ nt@@ ables to lower level and is available under one of the GPL @-@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it is soon available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available . read this article in English .
Oracle has started its own initiative with its name file system . this is still in alpha @-@ status . it is still used in Alpha Status . it is still used for &amp; Linux ; but it is not part of the core .
&quot; do not estimate this both ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss in the not@@ ebook , and 46 % at the job @-@ line systems . if not@@ ebooks is already the proportion of theft 50 % . &quot;
&quot; loss of data loss due to viruses is less common than the meth@@ ane thinking . it is currently limited to a smaller damage , such as theft or re@@ install@@ ments . and it is currently not limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users know only very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; has long been no longer s@@ ighted . &quot;
&quot; open source file systems are less sus@@ cep@@ tible to data loss as propri@@ etary systems : wrong , NTFS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS , to call the spread files@@ ystems . a very good English article can be found here . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent cor@@ rupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process in a sud@@ den break during a surgery is higher and an un@@ defined status will be avoided . if a file is not completely saved before the problem occurred , it is lost . &quot;
viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : false , theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss . &quot;
&quot; sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings away from fundamental physical boundaries . meant that while the technology is further developed , there is a natural limit for these progress . sensitivity and smoking characteristic for all types of light sensors are not far away from this border . &quot;
today cameras go down towards the 10 meg@@ ap@@ ix@@ el@@ sensors . even if this resolution is rather deteri@@ orate . a sensor size of 6 meg@@ api@@ xel and high quality optics are rather deteri@@ orate . a sensor size of 6 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ xel . for higher resol@@ utions you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
&quot; a 750@@ GB hard drive you get today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not make any other responsible for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are frequently asked for a plan and test this backup before you do something like the re@@ installing your operating system , the exchange of plates or the size of the hard drive . &quot;
&quot; suppose you make every day your back@@ ups on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a bl@@ itz does not have luck if the drive in the moment was not connected . &quot;
&quot; a disaster strikes locally and destroyed a lot . forget air@@ plane : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous for your data dangerous . they normally concern a whole room or the entire house . &quot;
&quot; therefore , des@@ count prevention is always a not local storage . bring your f@@ uses the stair@@ way up into the neighboring house , into your office or similar . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of the physical separation : as above mentioned is a common reason for a data loss despite secur@@ ing the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save one day . &quot;
complete backup : a complete backup of all files are to be secured . it is a snapshot without history and provides a complete copy at a time .
differences : a backup of the files have been changed since the last completion . creates a complete snapshot of two periods : the completion of the completion and the last difference .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files have been changed since the last backup . you can restore the original status at any time . this backup comes from a sealing system to the next with the exception that it is only down@@ ward and non @-@ continuously .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that can easily set up easily on your machines . as opposed to script @-@ controlled FTP meetings or other types of file transfer scripts r@@ sync only the difference of files that were actually changed . this happens happens and if you want to increase safety over ss@@ h .
get important pictures directly after having saved it on your computer to a DVD or other optical medium .
this approach lets you have enough time to discover losses and restore . at the same time you come up for the backup but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of working files . at the end you have made a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot should be done manually after which you have made a complete review . &quot;
&quot; themes : met@@ ad@@ ata data , original X@@ MP files , original X@@ MP files , original , memory , scal@@ ability , media , restore images and met@@ ad@@ ata , copy of images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , refle@@ ctors , ... , use of Internet . &quot;
&quot; thus , valuable images will survive the next 40 year that you really are interested in you because they are interested in your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be respected : &quot;
&quot; as the future because of your nature un@@ fore@@ see@@ able , you need to see everything today is said to take care and re @-@ rate at the time . unfortunately , there is no other option than a certain vig@@ il@@ ence . every 5 @-@ 8 years you should ask yourself as the current system is backward . the less variants you have used in the past , the more difficult it is to assess the questions of the future . &quot;
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or switch to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtualization is now available for everyone . if you have an old system that is important for reading your pictures then keep it up and install it into a virtual machine for later use .
&quot; on the other hand the Council is quite simple : every@@ time when you change your computer architecture , your memory and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard . stay in open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the professional print for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means to enlarge .
let us know that you have installed the scal@@ ability and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated record or partition . at * n@@ ix systems such as &amp; Linux ; can you copy this area and shift onto a new record number :
&quot; check with the command dm@@ es@@ g , whether your new record was detected by the system , but do not hang them . &quot;
&amp; Dollar ; d@@ d if = / dev / S@@ DC # source is / dev / S@@ DC &amp; dollar ; part@@ ed res@@ ize / dev / S@@ DC &amp; dollar ; # works with ext@@ 2,3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and re@@ iser@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of re@@ iser@@ fs if necessary
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day no software can read it then you can create it yourself . this task is easier from year to year .
&quot; GIF is a propri@@ etary , pat@@ ented format that slowly dis@@ appears from the market . you should not use it anymore . &quot;
&quot; it has been designed as an open source standard , it should replace g@@ MP , ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC met@@ ad@@ ata , 16 @-@ bit per colour kan@@ al and full transparency . PNG can save Gam@@ ma@@ - and Chro@@ mat@@ ology data for improved color levels , but not as many as it needs and a slow com@@ rade . this format we would like to recommend to the stor@@ ing your pictures . &quot;
&quot; TIFF has been widely used as a picture format . it manages pictures in high quality , but requires very large files . with some cameras you can store your images in this format . however , there is more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types . &quot;
&quot; DNG The digital neg@@ atives file format is a licence @-@ free and open material format , developed by Adobe Systems . it is based on the TIFF / EP format and is committed to the use of met@@ ad@@ ata . a hand@@ full of camera is now available and we hope to use the competitors for Canon and Nikon somet@@ ime . &quot;
&quot; this is possibly one of the reasons why in 2001 , Adobe its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology is introduced to replace the &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Metad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . the file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF . &quot;
&quot; many photographers draw it in front of one original of your recording , mostly in the raw format , to arch@@ ate . X@@ MP does not fit any problems with the link between the met@@ ad@@ ata data and the image file and how above it has been noted the raw format . therefore , you should think if you use DNG as a container and put everything there . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online met@@ ad@@ ata standards , which supports a large range of applications and business models . the activities of D@@ CM@@ I and the D@@ CM@@ I work groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and enlight@@ ening efforts to achieve a comprehensive acceptance of met@@ ad@@ ata standards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import images of the camera , the Map@@ les@@ er or the scanner . so long the pictures on the camera , you can use this as a temporary backup . &quot;
convert RAW files to DNG and save this in your raw archive . this function is not yet implemented .
&quot; for a fine editing process allows you to use external programs . if you edit the images again with &amp; dig@@ ging , then you should add the met@@ ad@@ ata . these have been cut down by the other programs . &quot;
&quot; download the edited images for the copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export it only in Web@@ gal@@ eries , co@@ ding in MPEG , use in contact , print &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; add a description of photos to an album you can add . the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for import@@ ing images to your album database . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; use it using the computer , switching the camera on the sco@@ re@@ of and turn it . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; if you start the camera interface , try to connect with your camera . if the connection is made , a fer@@ rite indic@@ ator will appear on the lower end and the th@@ umb@@ nails of all photos on the camera will appear . some cameras are not displayed , the fil@@ ename and a symbol of the dates for each file , photos , movies , music etc . &quot;
&quot; before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information about each entry . with the side@@ bars and met@@ ad@@ ata data from the camera interface you can see the properties of an entry or its met@@ ad@@ ata . &quot;
this dialog shows file features and the photo@@ information that can be stored intern@@ ally from the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer . note that some of the cameras are not available to your computer .
&quot; the rider met@@ ad@@ ata shows the internal met@@ ad@@ ata as Exif , manufacturer , GPS etc. of the picture . this information is the same as in the met@@ ad@@ ata side@@ bar from the main window of &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; or the image processing . note that this met@@ ad@@ ata will not be available on some digital cameras . &quot;
the easiest way to download photos to their computer is the click to download and then download the photos from her camera to a single album in &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; while downloading the photos are not deleted and we recommend you to check whether the pictures safely downloaded into a album before you delete the photos from the camera .
&quot; if you do not want to download all photos , you can only select the desired selection methods of &amp; KDE . once you have selected the photos , use the button and then download the selected . the kno@@ ck is selected as long as you have selected some photos . &quot;
&quot; if your camera is supported this is an option to download new . these pictures have been downloaded now . in this case the new images are marked with a star in advance . if you select this option , of course only the new images are downloaded . &quot;
&quot; if you download the buttons all download or download the chosen album , the list of existing albums will be displayed in which the photos will be stored . details of the existing albums will be displayed , as usual folder you can read in the section My albums . select the target album from the list and click OK . &quot;
&quot; after which you have chosen the target album , press OK , and dig@@ ik@@ am ; invites photos of the camera into the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete these from the camera . you can delete all at once by using the button delete all . if you just want to delete all of them , you have to select and delete it . &quot;
&quot; please note that there are no possibility of making photos that you can delete from the camera , so they will be completely deleted if you want to delete them from the camera . if you want to delete it from the camera . if you want to delete it from the camera . if you want to complete the camera , because this is much faster . &quot;
&quot; cameras use as fil@@ en@@ ames for the photos often not particularly significant names . the fil@@ en@@ ames are usually loaded again , if you want to load photos of different recording criteria in the same album . therefore , it can be sensible to integrate the date and time when the image was made in the fil@@ ename . &quot;
in the next section you will find options for turning and mir@@ rors of image and for data base . if you use this latter option automatically create a folder per day .
&quot; the options D@@ uring the transfer will open three further options , which are executed before the photos on the record . the first two concern the information about the author in the section standard author@@ ization . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all loaded images . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use other file format than the default format , you can use the pre@@ fix photographs % Y@@ - % m@@ - % d % H : % M : % S . &quot;
&quot; if you use the camera file name , you have the option when downloading the fil@@ ename in small letters . or in large letters when you prefer . &quot;
&quot; the new fil@@ ename , the &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; used for a photo will be displayed below the name , the camera will be saved in the preview . your settings will be saved and automatically used if you open the next time the camera window . &quot;
&quot; if all the information about the orientation of the camera will be able to perform a automatic spin during the down@@ lad@@ ens . not all cameras make this information ready . in the section side@@ bar Metad@@ ata you can see further details , about the information that your camera is embedded in the photo . &quot;
&quot; the automatic spin is usually swit@@ ched , and if your camera will not provide this information , lets &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; the photo is in the original orientation . if you want to expand the automatic rotation , use the button and select the Automatic rotation in the lower part of the window . &quot;
&quot; if your camera is made information about the date , at which the photo was made available , can &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; this under@@ line are based on the image data . all pictures with the same date will be available to download . in the section side@@ bar met@@ a data you can read what information your camera could be embedded in the photos . &quot;
&quot; this option is normally off , and in this case saves &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; the photos directly in the destination album . if you want to change this option , you need to select this option . use the button @-@ based under@@ side at the bottom of the window . &quot;
the easiest way to load photos of their computer to load their camera is the button . select then up@@ loading . the file selection dialog &amp; KDE ; in which you can select the files you want to upload . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; KDE ; methods .
&quot; after the selection is done , queries &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; you , where the pictures will be loaded up . a folder dialog for the camera will appear . select the desired folder and click OK to load the up@@ loading . the pictures will not be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; GPS ( Global Position@@ ing System ) is used as a general term in this document . thus , a position meant that is indicated in long@@ it@@ ud@@ inal and lat@@ itudes and which can be shown on a map . the detection of data can be performed from the American GPS , the Russian GLO@@ NAS , the European Galil@@ eo or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional photos , it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to make an area through automatic recording of GPS data . environment pl@@ aner , military , police , architectural offices and IM@@ MO@@ BI@@ LI@@ EN@@ MA@@ KLE@@ R can use this ability . &quot;
&quot; if you have forgotten where exactly the photo was done , you can send a postcard to another &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; users who want to document the place of photos , or just want this aspect , it is well suited to the position of a photos . &quot;
&quot; the question is how coming the GPS data into the picture ? first you should know that ex@@ iv@@ 2 many GPS data fields , such as direction , s@@ addle and map refer@@ ences . it is at least three ways to reach this . directly with the right hardware , via a re@@ working of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for the manual entry of known places . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there are currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few that work with GPS receiver . either as a ticket module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;
cameras with GPS @-@ Interface : Co@@ y@@ ote@@ Eye iP@@ A@@ Q I@@ ke Kodak D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR R@@ ico@@ h Pro G3 Sony
&quot; downloading the GPS data from one device can be saved with g@@ p@@ sman or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel , as this is the only format that is supported by the module for geographical mapping . &quot;
there are several programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS which can extract data from pictures and from GPS . on the following page you can make the same under &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
&quot; if you know the long@@ it@@ ud@@ inal and lat@@ itudes or other data , then you can use this script using the Ex@@ if@@ Tool of Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the AY @-@ ordin@@ ated coordinates , e.g. by map@@ s.@@ google . &quot;
&quot; here are some European roads . here are some European sides , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe . &quot;
&amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; attempts to give you so much control of its work@@ flows as possible . there are many settings to access the behavior of &amp; dig@@ ging ; you have to switch to these settings . you can switch between these settings by clicking on the symbols of the left .
select action can display in built @-@ in preview or mach@@ ining . you can set the default behavior of &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; fixed when you click on an entry in the main view .
&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the Stand@@ ardi@@ ism and copyright data . this data is automatically selected in the corresponding IP@@ TC data collection , if the option when downloading the camera data is written in the IP@@ TC fields . &quot;
&quot; Aut@@ ort@@ itel is a syn@@ onym for author : this field should contain the design@@ ation of the photographer , this field should be a professional photographer or independent , commercial photographer , or independent , commercial photographer , this field must be filled with . &quot;
&quot; publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to specify the photo . this does not have the author here , if this is a warehouse photo , then the group or agency that will be available here . &quot;
the IP@@ TC actions do not store the data into the corresponding IP@@ TC rim . this met@@ ad@@ ata is permanently contained in the picture and are not only available in the database of &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; this met@@ ad@@ ata are also available in other programs and can be imported into &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; can be imported without lost .
&quot; images referred to as embedded sign@@ atures ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments that you can add to your photos , with the images contained in the pictures . &quot;
&quot; the settings settings contains all options for the information that appear when the cursor in the main window of a file rests . depending on selected option , this information is displayed or not . &quot;
&amp; # 160 ; dig@@ ik@@ am ; supports a number of different formats and some vide@@ o- and audio formats . to determine which file types &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; note that file files can add and remove any file in one &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; Alb@@ um@@ Fol@@ ders that is none of these extensions is ignored by &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; ignored .
the default settings can be reset again by pressing the button Re@@ fresh right of each category .
&quot; however , the settings of the lumin@@ ous of &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; can then be added to the default values . every pictures have been swit@@ ched on this page . some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode . if you have one , then you can only get better results . &quot;
&quot; by default the imaging of a black background uses behind the quoted photos . if you prefer another color , you can select this here . you can switch the toolbar when you use the screen processing in full @-@ screen mode . &quot;
over@@ - and instru@@ ctive areas of a picture can be marked with dar@@ ker or bright colour in the image . these colours will be set here . in the image editing can be set up with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
Chro@@ ma @-@ Sub@@ sam@@ pling is meant that the images are co@@ ded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the color form@@ ations . please read this article in Wikipedia about the immediate declaration .
&quot; with the setting PNG compression , you can reduce the size of PNG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality , since PNG use a left @-@ free algorithm . if you have a quick computer , you can put this value on a high compression . it means 1 : a low and 9 a high compression . &quot;
&quot; with the option TIFF files , you can switch to the de@@ fl@@ ate compression heads for TIFF images . this reduces the size of the TIFF images . it has no influence on the image quality , since the de@@ fl@@ ate algorithm is left @-@ free . &quot;
&quot; with the adjustment loss @-@ free JPEG @-@ 2000 files , you can save money @-@ free setting , the ratio of quality loss and file size is far better than in normal JPEG . as this paragraph , met@@ ad@@ ata was not supported yet , but was in the planning . &quot;
in the earlier versions of &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; the image processing was only a picture @-@ viewed for photos . currently it develops very fast to a tool for man@@ ipulation of your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of the image processing .
&quot; the default is that all green pixels are equal . if you use this option when using the CCD @-@ sensor , this option makes it a little soft , elim@@ inating this problem with a minimal loss of details . this option makes this picture a little soft , eliminated but the 2x@@ 2 gre@@ ase pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality . &quot;
&quot; if this option is set , the white @-@ out of the camera is used . otherwise , if the automatic color @-@ balance is used . &quot;
&quot; this setting is only used when the whit@@ ish is not set out . standard is it a fixed colour balance , which was photograp@@ hed on a white map which is photograp@@ hed in the sunlight . &quot;
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD S@@ LR cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that sub@@ mer@@ ged images in four steps get more details in the cool@@ ers . for other cameras this option will be ignored .
&quot; the standard is the nickname , so that the parts of your images are the burned down , because of the in@@ ability of your camera will display the sp@@ otted white in the settings . you can also use some parts of the missing results , since they try to re@@ construct a few parts of the missing information from the cups . &quot;
&quot; this is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast as green and red . &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the lack of green and red parts from the still not satur@@ ated blue pixels . of course , this is a question , how much color or white you want . &quot;
&quot; if you select the option , you get the possibility to put a level . here is a value of three a compromise and can therefore be adjusted for any image individually . &quot;
&quot; put the light @-@ value according to your taste . you will probably have to put it slightly higher than the standard 1 . this can also be small later in the image options of the &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; image processing . in order to maintain the time for the Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing , you should conservative . &quot;
&quot; a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process , to reach a complete picture from the particle data that provides many cameras and is known to a matrix colored pixel . this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation or Far@@ bre@@ construction . &quot;
&amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; and D@@ cra@@ w put you three alternatives available : Bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( Vari@@ able number of Gra@@ dient ) was the first algorithm that created by D@@ cra@@ w . he produces shades of the edges . Bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a fast solution with a acceptable result . &quot;
&quot; if you know the color de@@ viation of your l@@ ent@@ ils , you can set the red and blue @-@ proof values here . this is certainly the best method for a color correction corre@@ ctions , since you performed during the Roh@@ loff . &quot;
a profile translated the color form@@ ations and gives instructions like this again should be given . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; information such as the color form@@ ations of a Far@@ br@@ aum in the other to translate the colors as accurately as possible .
behaviour questions when a picture will be opened in the image processing / colour module module with raw files .
&quot; color profile Fol@@ low@@ ing the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .c@@ ol@@ or / ICC , where you will save all your profiles during the start@@ up . &quot;
settings of the ICC @-@ Profile you have here the possibility &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later .
the colour@@ ful design view is an alternative to X@@ cal@@ ib or Arg@@ yll . here are just your pictures colored not all the screen .
&quot; the entry profiles should use for the camera and model you match . not all profiles are created on the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which do not have any colour mapping or g@@ amm@@ ak@@ or@@ tium . this means that you have to perform the color mapping itself . &quot;
&quot; there are further options such as the soft @-@ pro@@ of profile , which you can emul@@ ated how your image can be re@@ ated from one device as your camera and some colors therefore can be very satur@@ ated , instead you can manually correct it rather than you can rely on the bl@@ esome algorithm of your printer . &quot;
for most cameras it is quite obvious that color profile for them is intended . unfortunately not in the models of Canon . therefore here a table of cameras and profiles are working together . this answer is naturally un@@ officially :
&quot; the Canon profile extension lets you see the style for the goal : F for an accurate style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for the standard style . &quot;
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; KDE ; Image Plugin Interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; KDE ; imaging and sculpt@@ ural ; many modules are supported to work with each program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
&quot; if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . choose which you want to use , and these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and furthermore you will find some also in the context menu of the preview . &quot;
short command for tasks which can be performed by modules can be set in the menu under settings short@@ coming .
further information ( in English ) via K@@ IP@@ I modules you can get over the K@@ IP@@ I project at http : / / www.k@@ ip@@ i @-@ plug@@ g@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
&quot; the settings of the di@@ lem@@ ma should be easy to understand . the top reg@@ eller adjust the time between the screen , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds well . the other inc@@ ón @-@ fields are the met@@ ad@@ ata and which are displayed at the lower end of the pictures during the display . &quot;
&quot; the camera properties show on the left hand a list of all the currently supported cameras . on the right side there is a button Automatic detection , which is trying to use a camera that is connected to the computer . below are the portals that is properly connected and in the image mode . below are the portals , US@@ B@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage . &quot;
at the bottom end you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ wi@@ re@@ - ( IEE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) . this field is only active when you have a US@@ B@@ - or Fire@@ Wire @-@ mass storage camera from the camera list . you have to specify the path that you want to hang out the path / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / Rem@@ ov@@ able .
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; do you have to connect the camera to your computer , put it into the display mode . &quot;
&quot; check out if &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; the camera automatically detect . if not , you can put c@@ amo@@ del and port manually . once you set up your camera will appear in the menu camera . &quot;
&quot; you can choose any name for your camera . this is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window . if you have more than one camera , you can insert all here . &quot;
&quot; with the option confirmation dialog for the shif@@ ting of &gt; pictures in the tr@@ ash , you can set the talk of &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; when delet@@ ing an photos in an album . in the Cancel delet@@ ion of a photos and delet@@ ing a album you will find more details . &quot;
&quot; the editorial changes by the right side bar can be used by dig@@ it by &amp; dig@@ ging , if you use the option changes in the right side bar without back@@ packs . otherwise , you have to apply the changes using the button . &quot;
you can also include the display of the welcome image of &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; in the starting point . this acceler@@ ates under circumstances the start@@ up process of &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ;
&quot; the setting can be found in the start of new photos , for@@ cing the ground@@ ed folder for new or deleted albums / photos . this extends the run@@ time of &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; if something is deleted from the base folder , asks , ask if it is to delete it from the database . &quot;
different color schem@@ es can be used in &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; used to adapt the main window to your taste . these settings can choose from settings design from the toolbar . a preview of available design is listed below :
these designs have been defined in simple files . if you are interested in a new design for &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; you will find more information about it in this tutorial .
&amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; contains a fast imaging with some basic tools . you can use these to see your photos and improve your photos with the left mouse button on the preview of a picture or by the context menu of the preview and selection of the entry .
the image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; so they are not part of your distribution . more information on the K@@ IP@@ I modules can be found in the section image processing .
&quot; a status line at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ ename , current file number , magn@@ ifying factor and the current image size . &quot;
a menu bar on the upper edge and below the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently required functions .
&quot; however , the processing functions of the image processing will change your photos . none of the functions will change the original photo before you stor@@ ing the file or restore the button save from the toolbar . note that you can not restore the original photo as soon as you have the image . &quot;
you should therefore ev@@ ap@@ l a copy of your image before you change it . this can save you with a file .
&quot; as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the menu File restore or using the button Res@@ restore the button re@@ produce in the toolbar . you will then lose any change that you have performed in the photo since the last time . &quot;
virtually any action of imaging can be cat@@ chy or re@@ produced . the last action can be cat@@ chy by selecting them or re@@ produce rest@@ oring the menu from the menu .
&quot; if you often use this , you should make the keyboard short@@ cut , Ctr@@ l ; -@@ z to return and Ctr@@ l ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore . &quot;
&quot; if you want to push the &amp; L@@ MB ; via the back@@ seat or restore button in the toolbar for a moment you get a context menu . if you select one of the menu items , all actions are included in between likewise . &quot;
&quot; once you have started the editing process , you can use the photos in the same album or the same keyword , using the navigation buttons in the toolbar , image high , picture below or the entries in the menu file . if you have made changes in the menu file , you will be asked if you want to save it . &quot;
you can insert in the photo and get out zo@@ om@@ es in which you Ctr@@ l ; mouse bike or the symbols in the toolbar or the entries in the menu bar .
&quot; to adjust a picture to the window size , you can use this button on the toolbar : enlarge factor &quot;
&quot; full @-@ screen mode shows the photo in full @-@ screen mode . you get into the normal view that you can use the Es@@ c button . normally , you can change this in the dialog dialog by &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; you can view it out of the &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; main window , you can view the section to set up the image . &quot;
&quot; if you want to print the current picture , you can print in the menu file image and get the standard &amp; KDE ; press dialog . you can custom@@ ize the settings before you print your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the main menu , you can select single pictures or whole sent@@ ences . whole picture pages can select from your selection . you just need to select the images with the default method and select from the menu album export printing . if you follow the wiz@@ ard , you just need to make your choice . &quot;
&quot; the Fin@@ ik@@ am ; main window features a side@@ bar on the right edge , which is important information and actions for selected pictures . the same side bar is available without the navigation bar , even in the image processing . it is displayed if one of the five rider is displayed : &quot;
multiple Click on the same rider lets the side@@ bar seem to be appearing and disappear again in the edge .
in the sign@@ age view you can insert signs with unlimited size or insert . note the note below . the text is U@@ TF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed to be used in the EX@@ IF@@ S and IP@@ TC@@ - fields so that you can use other programs .
the IP@@ TC data will only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments will be cut off after 2000 characters and special characters are re@@ formed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC connector field in other applications you should consider these restrictions .
after which you have commented to use either the button user or simply switch to the next picture , the circum@@ cis@@ ions are then saved . &quot;
&quot; besides the user button there is a button More . with this you can read more met@@ ad@@ ata from the selected file or the database , but it will always be conducted if you have chosen a met@@ ad@@ ata adjustment which is always written in the pictures . &quot;
the section rating show a reference rate of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sort@@ ing . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or by keyboard short@@ cut Ctr@@ l + 0 ... 5 at the same time . to evaluate multiple images simultaneously and use the context menu .
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field ur@@ gency . the co@@ ding follows the sch@@ ema in the following table :
the keyword view shows a search box to filter@@ ing the keywords , the keywords and a selection box with the previously in this &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; level meeting . &quot;
the keyword tree is dynam@@ ically adapted to the keyword . you can re@@ strict the number of possibilities when searching for a keyword . this ability is particularly useful when you have a lot of keywords .
&quot; the input field at the lower end is a further relief in the input of keywords at a picture series . if you have different keywords , these are stored for fast access . &quot;
keywords can also be set by marking the appropriate anchor fields in the tree . all keywords of a picture are stored in the IP@@ TC @-@ field keyword .
&quot; if several pictures are selected in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword tree , this is only applied to the entire selection , if you want to make a selection with a keyword , please read the section keyword filter . &quot;
&quot; the side@@ bar head@@ line is used to change the selection of the main window displayed pictures . normally , the left side bar is used with their album , - Dat@@ um@@ - , keywords and ad@@ chan@@ ge@@ ars . if there is one or more keyword filter from the right side , is only the intersection of these two . &quot;
&quot; you can also drag and put it . suppose you already exists in the main view several pictures , you can simply drag it from the right side bar and put it on the selection . then a dialog appears that you ask if you want the keyword . &quot;
&quot; in the upper example , the main window shows the pictures on a cal@@ ender day . the keyword filter is reduced by Ctr@@ l + a and after that it became a keyword from the right keyword tree to the selection and stored there . a dialog asks whether this keyword should be set . &quot;
this search for changes will be held at any start of the program . it can also be turned off on settings .
&quot; if you have a rule with and created and find that it should be one or , you can easily change it with a double @-@ click on the text and in the control . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : this entry is sought after the database in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , keyword , etc . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) : the argument for the Oper@@ ator , which is a name or a string that is already set in the database . &quot;
you can define e.g. an ext@@ ensible search of all elements of the database with the following options :
&quot; if you want to group options , you only need the cross @-@ box at the end of the rule and then use the button group@@ ing . the options are then as follows : &quot;
why Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Flick@@ r not listed ? the free space is limited there on 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution .
this article / tutorial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I have mainly adapted it to &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; s concrete implementation .
the reason why one puts a colored workflow is the colors used by your camera or scanner that have actually photograp@@ hed or sc@@ anned colors . with a colour@@ ful workflow can you reach that the colors will print on your monitor or scanner the colors or in the web that you will print or publish on the web from your digital dar@@ k@@ room .
&quot; if the theme for color @-@ government is coming , then everyone wants to push what buttons he needs to push for the results which he wants . unfortunately , the sense of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient information about colour management . in addition , you will provide information with deeper information to make your own informative decisions to make you get the desired result . &quot;
&quot; if your imaging has met all the criteria listed below , then you will not have to worry about colours . &quot;
you are working on a monitor of the s@@ R@@ GB @-@ Far@@ br@@ aum calib@@ rated . ( further information can be found below )
your only other images are by e @-@ mail or the Web where s@@ R@@ GB of the de @-@ fac@@ to standard is .
&quot; so if s@@ R@@ GB is so good works and life for all so easy to do , why should you use another Far@@ br@@ aum and have to make thoughts about color wo@@ unded ? &quot;
&quot; a visual example of limitation of s@@ R@@ GB in comparison to the colors that we can really see below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hu@@ fe@@ isen@@ ical region , and the colors in the s@@ R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum , the tri@@ angular area . &quot;
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ R@@ GB with some larger colours you want to visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms ex@@ cell@@ ente page and then click on information and then to information About R@@ GB Working Sp@@ aces .
must I make my monitor kal@@ lib@@ rate when I decided to work for it only in the R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum ?
&quot; yes ! whether you work in the s@@ R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum or not , you will need to make your monitor kal@@ lib@@ rate because s@@ R@@ GB that your monitor has to work on s@@ R@@ GB , then you have to use your monitor at the s@@ R@@ GB standard , then you have to use your monitor at the s@@ R@@ GB standard calib@@ rate , a pass@@ over profile use or both . &quot;

&quot; this tool provides five automatic corre@@ ctions available , which can improve a picture in most cases . use it so before you try a further manual processing . &quot;
&quot; the functions normal@@ ise , the same , automatic dis@@ equal and contrast from the menu cor@@ rig@@ ating Automatic correction automatically try to make best suits your colors . you will have to experiment with these effects , to see what works best in your photo . &quot;
&quot; normal@@ ise : this method is scal@@ able the void levels across the entire image , so the dar@@ k@@ est point black and the bright@@ est point is as bright as possible without its color shade . this function is often a magical correction for pictures the dark or well @-@ balanced . &quot;
&quot; the same method Adjust@@ ment the lumin@@ ance factor of the colors of the selected image , so that the hist@@ og@@ ram of Int@@ ensity . sometimes it makes the same very good results in improving the contra@@ cting of a picture , sometimes it produces only tr@@ ash . it is a very powerful surgery , which causes either wonder at a picture or it was destroyed . &quot;
&quot; automatic dis@@ advantage : this method maxim@@ izing the color area in the Rot@@ - , green and blu@@ e@@ channel . you determine the dark and bright border @-@ ones and adjust the rot@@ ary , green and blue channels to the complete history program . &quot;
contrast : this method improves contrast and lumin@@ osity of the R@@ GB values of a picture by moving the lowest and highest values in the greatest possible area and a re@@ ji@@ ust@@ ation of all values between . this is only visible at balanced images and can be a good correction for poor photos .
the white @-@ out of &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; is an semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white @-@ off of a photo .
the white @-@ out correction is somewhat limited because of a far@@ br@@ aum with 8 @-@ bit per colour . if you are able to perform too far from the original screen . if you can perform the white @-@ off in the pipe mode that works in 16 @-@ bit mode so you will make your possibilities to make correction better .
this tool is based on an un@@ bal@@ ancing sal@@ m of the copyright of Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . you start it across the menu item white @-@ out of the image processing .
the preview can be adjusted in size . on the left side you can see both the original image as well as the preview of the target image . if you want to see the original comparison of the tool . if you want to see the original comparison , then it is enough to click the sub@@ window . &quot;
the preview of the Target photo has a red Mar@@ ker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixels on this Mar@@ ker is shown as vertical line in the history .
&quot; on the right top is a hist@@ og@@ ram displayed that dynam@@ ically change , as soon as you can change one parameter . this hist@@ og@@ ram is very helpful , even in well illuminated images , most of the pixels very small L@@ umin@@ ants values . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . &quot;
&quot; the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shade adjust@@ ing lets you improve the attend@@ ance of your photos or also download dim@@ ming . &quot;
&quot; using the above controls , you should use the color temperature pip@@ ette . press the color temperature control . press the color for the calculation of color temperature of the white element . to this type , the temperature and green values are automatically set . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can set the white @-@ off with the list of preferences . the following settings are available : &quot;
the over@@ flow @-@ indic@@ ator increases the colors when more than a color channel of the pixels . it is displayed in the preview as a re@@ iner indic@@ ator and has no effect on the final picture .
the buttons stor@@ ing as and store exactly this . each setting of the white @-@ equ@@ als you have set to save you in a text file and then load again .
the button pres@@ ets puts all filter@@ ing values back on their standard values and the neutral neutral white . note that also neutral settings another photo than your original shows . if you save this original picture .
&quot; you can set here the co@@ ded output for a color channel of the elab@@ or@@ ated image . 8 @-@ bit co@@ ding is the widespread JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit co@@ ding is better for high @-@ quality images . this co@@ ding is also needed for high @-@ quality images . this co@@ ding is required even more for high @-@ quality images . this co@@ ding is also needed for high @-@ quality images , typ@@ ing time and stands for the formats PNG , P@@ N@@ M , TIFF and DNG . &quot;
&quot; this tool opens the same dialogue as the processing of raw materials . it uses the change and assignment of colour pro@@ filed . colour mapping can be carried out by the sub@@ window for the use of color pro@@ filed . a detailed guide for the use of color profile , you can draw the chapter color management . &quot;
&quot; another important tool is available in the menu under colors ton@@ ic corre@@ cted . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels at the same time and allows you to use your settings again , so you can always use your settings . this is always the same correction . you can always find the same correction . &quot;
a very powerful option to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
&quot; the sque@@ ez@@ ing ; tool col@@ oration provides you with four color effects , a solar effect , a bicycle effect , a ne@@ on effect and a cant@@ at@@ filter available . &quot;
&quot; in times of chemical processing was solar , even Sab@@ at@@ ians called , a effect of being developed into a short light@@ ning light . it had the effect that the bright@@ ens areas dar@@ ker and the colors used by the second illumination . this tool was a part of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fin@@ ely . &quot;
the intensity controls the solar radiation . at about 50 % intensity shows the image what is chem@@ ically possible . another increase is generated a neg@@ atives picture that is not to be used on phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier .
this is an example of the solar effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed ( 2 ) . applied intensity is 30 % .
&quot; the Vi@@ vid filter simul@@ ates the so called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it is different from a satur@@ ation that he makes a stronger contra@@ sting effect of the colors brilliant and gl@@ owing . try it simply , he em@@ bell@@ ished many photos . &quot;
&quot; Vel@@ via is the brand name for one in day@@ light optim@@ ised colour film produced by the Japanese company Fuj@@ if@@ il@@ m ; and therefore a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very complex colors at day@@ light and high contra@@ sts . the characteristics make it a film of choice for natural photograph . Vel@@ vi@@ as strong complex colors are also some photographs , especially the little landscapes ab@@ sent to too much . &quot;
the ne@@ on@@ filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on@@ light on the contra@@ sts . the parameters Level controls the brightness of the result and the sliding repet@@ itions the strength of the incl@@ ination . at large images the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras frequently have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual to change the color seat and the lumin@@ osity of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . all your alignment can be satisfied in the preview . once you are satisfied with the result you will use the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
&quot; if you have a photo in bad light conditions , you can get the reverse problem : one too large satur@@ ation . even in this case the tool is a good choice to reduce the satur@@ ation instead of them . all changes you can perform in the preview . if you confirm the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k . &quot;
&quot; between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ ous lumin@@ ous / contrast / Gamma is the tool corre@@ ctive to improve the exposure . even if the dialogue about this tool is very complicated , you need for the use of use only the range of sli@@ ders . concrete the three sli@@ ders below the Hist@@ o@@ gramm@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graph of Int@@ ensity , a hist@@ og@@ ram , the active channel or the selected area . below graph@@ s are three sli@@ ders to change into the picture . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas . &quot;
the easiest way to learn the operation it is to move the controls and consider it on how the picture changes .
&quot; on the right side the original and the preview of the image can be viewed . the preview is dynam@@ ically , based on the settings of the image , updated . on the left side are the following options available . &quot;
sc@@ aling : with this selection box can be adjusted whether the hist@@ og@@ ram with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y @-@ axis is often depic@@ ted . for pictures of a constant color will contain the linear history of a single column . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic distribution is useful .
&quot; three controllers : the top for dark tones , the middle for bright sounds and the lowest for medium tones , frequently called g@@ amma values . &quot;
&quot; the three color pin@@ pet@@ ten can be used in the preview of the original image , in order to adjust the interventions , middle and bright tones . furthermore , there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment . &quot;
Aus@@ ga@@ ited : the out@@ sourcing allow the selection of manual values for each field . there are also two controllers that can be used to change the out@@ set . the compression of the out@@ set can be used for example to create something else in the background while to see something else in the fore@@ ground .
automatically : with this button the image values are automatically set depending on the Int@@ ensity values .
&quot; save as and store : with these buttons , the values can be stored in the files@@ ystem and later . &quot;
&quot; if you use this mode and the three color pip@@ ettes , the input connector will be new to all shade , means and solar @-@ tints . enable the color pip@@ ette that you want to use and click on the preview of the original applications for Rot@@ - , Green - , blu@@ e@@ - and the L@@ umin@@ ous channels . &quot;
&quot; the option over@@ flow @-@ indic@@ ator controls all color channels to see over@@ hau@@ led pixels , and the combined result of all channels are display . here it is an indic@@ ator , i.e. you get the effect only displayed in the preview and it is no effect to see the final result . &quot;
&quot; below you can see an example of the adjust@@ ing of the intervention applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and Alpha channel , as well as the outputs are unchanged . the original picture is marked with ( 1 ) and the corre@@ cted picture with ( 2 ) . &quot;
on the left side the half of the original and the target image is displayed . the preview is dynam@@ ically updated depending on your settings . on the right side the following options are available :
modifications : this selection box allows the channel to specify the channel of the module :
besides this cas@@ ket there are two symbols to change between a linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for pictures featuring large areas of a constant color is generated the linear mode of the linear mode of the linear mode . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode is further developed .
&quot; if you want to move for example a cur@@ vent@@ er to the right , e.g. the bright tones , then you can see that these bright tones with dark cre@@ ases and the related image pixel are dar@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; on the preview of the original fot@@ os is a red mark@@ er to see . if you want to change this mark@@ er on the curve which represents the original value . create a point on this line and move it to and from , until the value is adjustable according to your taste . &quot;
save as and store : with these buttons you can do exactly this . each curve you can have created in the files@@ ystem and will be loaded later . the file format is the Gimp spa format .
&quot; if you create this method and the three color pip@@ ets buttons , automatically create the check@@ points of the curve for all channels of sh@@ ady , central and solar @-@ sounds . enable the color pip@@ ette you want to use and click the original image to put the check@@ points for the red , green , blue and lum@@ bar curve . &quot;
&quot; the option over@@ flow @-@ indic@@ ator controls all color channels to display over@@ bel@@ ated pixels , you get the combined result . here it is an indic@@ ator , so you get the effect only displayed in the preview and it is no effect to see the final result . &quot;
below you can see a black @-@ white picture which was corre@@ cted in L@@ umin@@ anz@@ kan@@ al . shade and sun @-@ tints was applied with the color@@ pip@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original picture is ( 1 ) and corre@@ cted ( 2 ) .
the channel bl@@ ender of the &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; imaging is a tool to improve the color channels or change the shade of the photos .
the channel bl@@ ender is another high @-@ developed tool to mix the shades of the images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel bl@@ ender of image processing .
you can select the color for the hist@@ og@@ ram : this gives you a first reference as you can correct the channels by pressing the relative distribution and rash . the left section of the window will show you a preview . the original can be seen as opposed to your own rider .
the preview of the target has a red Mar@@ ker . if you put this in the picture a vertical line in the history will display you the corresponding color value .
&quot; the controls for the module are right below : controllers for red , green and construction allow you to switch to these channels . if you are able to maintain the appropriate colour components . this is particularly convenient if you want to reduce the appropriate color components . this is particularly convenient if you want to reduce the appropriate color components . this is particularly convenient if you want to reduce the appropriate color components . this is particularly convenient if you want to reduce the appropriate color components . this is particularly convenient if you want to reduce the appropriate color components . this is especially convenient if you want to reduce the corresponding colour components . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially if you mix Mon@@ och@@ rom , the reduction of a color comes to a visible rust@@ ling , which comes from the same place in the color canal , and their rust@@ ling patterns in each channel looks different . if that is the case you can improve your mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion . &quot;
the stor@@ ing and store buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any mi@@ xer @-@ setting can be saved for later and then download . the user file format is the Gimp channel bl@@ ender format .
&quot; the option over@@ flow @-@ indic@@ ator controls all color channels to see over@@ hau@@ led pixels , and the combined result of all channels are display . here it is an indic@@ ator , i.e. you get the effect only displayed in the preview and it is no effect to see the final result . &quot;
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been re@@ adjustable . the option is activated by L@@ umin@@ anz . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography was always fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction capability . with the development of digital photography is black / white a work step as color images can be converted to the computer . also with a set of film roll@@ ers profile .
Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3200 , Il@@ ford FP@@ 4 Plus , Il@@ ford HP@@ 5 Plus , Il@@ ford X@@ P2 Super &quot;
&quot; green filters : simul@@ ates a black / white film s@@ ighting with a green l@@ ent@@ filter . this looks good , with all scen@@ arios and fits especially good to portraits against the sky . so similar to the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter . &quot;
Oran@@ ge@@ il@@ ter : simul@@ ates a black / white film s@@ ighting with an or@@ bit lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and bubble . so similar to the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Oran@@ ge@@ il@@ ter . &quot;
rot@@ ect : simul@@ ates a black / white film s@@ ighting with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic element and can be simul@@ ated on the day@@ time . so similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Rot@@ ator .
Gel@@ b@@ filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film s@@ ighting with an yellow l@@ ent@@ filter . this is the most natural color corre@@ ctive and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Yellow filter .
&quot; Se@@ pi@@ aton : generates warm bright and medium tones during it adds a bit of cold in the legs , and the re@@ development in a se@@ pi@@ at@@ oner . this is typical of the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Se@@ pi@@ af@@ il@@ ter . &quot;
with the &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; tool texture can be used to apply decorative tex@@ tures on one image .
&quot; adding a texture to your image , regardless if it is a color picture or not , you can look like a oil painting on a canvas , the bull of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or as a wall image on the wall . the menu item can be used for this image . &quot;
relief : move this parameter to the right to the appearance of the depth and three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the picture .
a paper text effect is applied on the photo below . the original picture has been shown ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) . the parameter is set to 200 .
add a decorative frame with the &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; tool frame can add a decorative frame around a picture .
the eye of a ob@@ server in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . an opportunity to keep his attention is to set the picture a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the stream eye .
type : with this parameter you set the desired frame type for your image . continuously conver@@ se the image with a colored line and a wide frame ( ideal for black / white pictures ) bl@@ ended with a nice three @-@ dimensional effect of ideal for a button @-@ effect and decorative adds a ornam@@ ental frame with patterns .
width : returns the width of the frame in percent . the valu@@ ation is limited to the width is from 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; it will be larger than the original , but the same aspect ratio have to be larger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for the pressure of the pictures , especially if you have to put the tool after aspect ratio before . &quot;
&quot; with this convenient tool , you can insert easy to insert a formatt@@ ed text in a picture above . this is also going on several places if you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to users . simply enter the text , and place it with the mouse . use text alignment , orientation , color from the Far@@ br@@ aum and the character set . &quot;
&quot; each setting you have chosen for your text , can press up to the button &quot; OK button . once the image was saved , the text is part of the picture . he cannot be changed anymore . &quot;
with the &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; tool Sch@@ abl@@ ons can be applied to a st@@ enc@@ il about one image .
the menu image sho@@ ots apply in the image editing can be used to put st@@ enc@@ ils over a picture .
for the st@@ enc@@ il there is no restrictions on the size and orientation . you just need to add the PNG file format . if you want to add an e @-@ mail in English to the black@@ out of the con@@ cess@@ ions . if you want to add an e @-@ mail in English to the &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; ma@@ iling@@ list dig@@ ik@@ am @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; if you use this tool for first time , you need to set your st@@ abl@@ on@@ en@@ folder with the button basic folder in dialog . select the folder to the folder you will be copied to the next start . &quot;
&quot; after the root folder is set for the Tribal St@@ enc@@ ils , which reflects the folder structure of the Sch@@ abl@@ on@@ ord@@ ner . the selection of a folder will be updated automatically . &quot;
under the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magn@@ ifying factor and change the position of your picture .
enlarge : this button enlarged the present picture . it is cent@@ red around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
reduction : this button res@@ ized the picture below . it is used to apply the position of the mouse . if you want to use the loop on the whole picture , you need to check the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
move this button to move the picture below the tray picture . take the image and place it on the desired position .
use OK if you want to use the loop on your image . the image will then be automatically adapted to the default size .
&amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; provides three different tools for shar@@ pen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
&quot; shar@@ pen@@ ing is a traditional tool for shar@@ pen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but created especially in dark areas , gra@@ ined pictures . &quot;
&quot; un@@ shar@@ p@@ ness mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture shar@@ per . indeed , it &apos;s not a bit , it works rather psych@@ o @-@ visual . you can use it to atmospheric Dun@@ st and it makes it a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is protected by W@@ inst@@ on Chang . &quot;
foc@@ uss@@ ing is possibly the best of the three as it really improves the shar@@ p@@ ness . he is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters to adapt .
photos without focus as well as most digit@@ alised images need a correction of shar@@ p@@ ness . this is due to the digital@@ ization process colors with only minimal differences . this again leads to a common color together . S@@ LR cameras usually need more foc@@ al shar@@ pen@@ ing as normal cameras for the private application .
at JPEG @-@ images often have been applied to the camera internal shar@@ pen@@ ing . pictures in the pipe @-@ format must always be har@@ dened in during processing .
&quot; some scanner use a foc@@ al filter already during the read@@ ing of the picture . if you de@@ activate this , you get control of your image . &quot;
in some situations you can get usable results by shar@@ pen@@ ing a photo with the shar@@ pen@@ ing value .
&quot; but you should deal with this , however , since the results are not very natural : the shar@@ p@@ ness increases the shar@@ p@@ ness of the edges , but also improves the smo@@ kers . in general , the beneficial technique for shar@@ ehol@@ ding the tool is focused . you can find further information and a comparison of all techniques for shar@@ pen@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is being cr@@ ack@@ y . the solution , the image is a little soft , it is much easier than to shar@@ ks . use the tool to display with the menu . use the tool on the right side of the dialog box shows you the effect on your photo . &quot;
the filter no@@ bl@@ ur mascul@@ ine is a very good tool to remove the ve@@ il of your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and the preview help the picture to edit . the preview of the movie shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the standard values are often good results and should first be tried . an increase in the radius or the amounts are increasing the effect . if you create the un@@ shar@@ p@@ ness mask , smo@@ othing and the impression of gr@@ ates near sharp edges . &quot;
the radius makes such as many pixels on each side of a can@@ te affected by the filters . high @-@ resolution images allow greater radi@@ i . you should therefore have a look at the best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the intr@@ icate image one of the original is added . thereby the strength of the shar@@ p@@ ness is set .
&quot; the sw@@ elling is a break@@ down from the maximum R@@ GB value and to use differ@@ ential amount . one can therefore use a minimal difference to make a can@@ te of filter . in this way , areas can be avoided with a soft change between the tones of shar@@ pen@@ ing and therefore beauty in mind , heavens and water surfaces . &quot;
this is an example of the bl@@ arf mas@@ king filters . the original image is the ( 1 ) and this processed image the ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp mas@@ king has been used with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a sw@@ elling = 0.0 . &quot;
the &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; tool Re@@ foc@@ uss@@ ing ref@@ us@@ uss@@ ed an image by improving the shar@@ p@@ ness . it used to use the copyrighted power filter algorithm for Ernst Lip@@ pe .
this tool tries to get an image to &amp; quot ; ref@@ ok@@ uss@@ ing quot ; in which it is a better approach than just try to shar@@ ply the photo . it is used to use a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ ing . it is used to start a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ ing . it can normally launch better results than un@@ sharp mas@@ king . you can start it from the menu by adding colors re@@ focus on the image processing .
&quot; in practice , the circular folding is much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche F@@ folding . the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche F@@ folding has a very long tail , which is the mathematical result also depends on the source pixel which is far from the original pixel . it causes unwanted results even very strongly from the remote pixel . it causes unwanted results . &quot;
circular shar@@ p@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular folding . it is the most important parameter for the use of this module . for most pictures it should put a higher value when your image should be very un@@ sharp and then on healing .
cor@@ relation : an increase in cor@@ relation can help to reduce art@@ if@@ acts . the cor@@ relation can be chosen from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0,95 and material . a high value for the cor@@ relation reduces the shar@@ pen@@ ing effect of the module . &quot;
&quot; smo@@ k@@ filter : an increase in the room filter can help you reduce art@@ if@@ acts . however , values can help from 0 @-@ 1 . however , values higher than 0.1 is only rarely helpful . if the smo@@ k@@ filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 the image quality is very bad . a usable value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value is still to decor@@ ate the image . &quot;
&quot; Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche shar@@ p@@ ness : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ß &apos; sche shar@@ p@@ ness . use this parameter if your un@@ shar@@ p@@ ness Gau@@ ß &apos; is . in most cases , you should use this value to 0 to make anno@@ ying art@@ e@@ facts . if you might use a value to zero , you might also need to increase the cor@@ relation and / or sound filter . &quot;
mat@@ ric@@ ian size : this value determines the size of trans@@ former matrix . an increase in the mat@@ ric@@ ian size can have good results especially if you choose large values for the circular shar@@ p@@ ness or Gau@@ ß &apos;s shar@@ p@@ ness . note that the module is very slowly when you choose large values for this parameter . in most cases you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the stor@@ ing and store buttons are used exactly for this purpose . each audit@@ ing parameter is set to you and can then be saved for later and can then be loaded .
try to perform all of the addit@@ ive and Int@@ ensity representation on the picture before you use the module .
&quot; otherwise , you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that a lot of operations changes which are not immediately visible , but later un@@ pleasant art@@ if@@ acts leave . &quot;
&quot; if you read pictures and press , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image . &quot;
&quot; generally produced un@@ sharp masks for better results as shar@@ pen@@ al@@ izing . this could be caused by this , the un@@ sharp mas@@ king is used as shar@@ pen@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; theoret@@ ically , un@@ sharp mascul@@ ine always must create art@@ if@@ acts . even under optimal conditions it can never be the effect of the un@@ shar@@ p@@ ness . for the Vienna filters it is possible to show at least as good as the un@@ shar@@ p@@ ness mask . the FI@@ R Wiener Filter is often better in the processing of small details . &quot;
below you can see a comparison between different filters on a small un@@ focused image :
the original un@@ sharp colour picture must be corre@@ cted . this picture has been made with a analogue camera . the most focused result is due to in@@ sufficient light for the auto @-@ focus lens .
&quot; for more information about the methods of shar@@ ehol@@ dings in digital image , you can read a technical comparison in English under this address . &quot;
the regul@@ ator made the in@@ shar@@ p@@ ness of the area that was dar@@ ken@@ ed to create a natural Pup@@ un@@ ner .
&quot; the colour tin@@ te allows a customized color for the Pup@@ pets . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can adjust this here . &quot;
the tool imaging is one of the most advanced tool to remove not desired art@@ if@@ acts with un@@ preced@@ ented speed .
the algorithm algorithm was developed by the I@@ MAGE Team of G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains different preferences as starter points to simpl@@ ify the restoration . the available preferences are listed below :
&quot; if you want to adjust the filter@@ ing settings , you can use the rider smo@@ othing and advanced settings . &quot;
&quot; detailed wareh@@ ous@@ ing p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the maintenance of the details . a small value leads to an equal passenger via the image . why a value of 0.@@ 9 should not get details so that no shar@@ pen@@ ing is necessary . please note that the details will always be sub@@ ordin@@ ated to the sign@@ code . &quot;
direct@@ ness Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es equally into all directions while a value is close to 1 just in a direction . if you have a scre@@ ening and CCD Rau@@ schen will create a high value of wave @-@ like pattern . JPEG art@@ e@@ facts will be best by 1 .
&quot; smooth@@ es &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this puts the maximum gluten factor above all . p is then defined the relative smo@@ othing . place this value therefore suitable to the degree of space in your image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects greater structures . the higher this value is necessary , the more it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ let@@ in effect , he needs to be higher than 3 . &quot;
repet@@ itions : on how often the algorithm is going through . normally there is 1 or 2 out .
&quot; angle gradu@@ al as &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ ot@@ rope alpha . if Alpha small will be chosen , there should be too small for a long term . you should make this value as greatest possible and acceptable to your needs . &quot;
&quot; integrated step @-@ wide &#91; 0.1 , 10 &#93; : Integrated Gradu@@ al range in pixels . you should put the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smo@@ othing and never greater than 2 . &quot;
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation to use : the more quality that you get through selection of this option is only low . he dou@@ bles the term . we therefore recommend it to that .
the buttons saved as and store exactly this . each setting of image error can be saved in a text file and will be re@@ charged later .
&quot; however , it is compar@@ atively very fast at work . but it can still last very long and a high CPU load to move . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the kno@@ ck . &quot;
below you can see such as pictures with Small art@@ e@@ facts . the module is done on a photo that is caused in Guatemala City with a analogue camera . as you see there is a peculi@@ ar black art@@ if@@ act while the journey is caused by a poor film storage . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the corre@@ cted picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; Rau@@ sch@@ reduction is a very powerful tool to decrease imaging . it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter H@@ eck@@ ert .
&quot; this tool sets out select@@ able image filter available to remove spots and other art@@ if@@ acts , e.g. from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensors from the camera or mo@@ i@@ re@@ ac@@ ute ; -@@ effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about Sens@@ ors of digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial . &quot;
the screen@@ shots above shows a typical scene that was done with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ ined space that can be successful with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases you only need the sub@@ window details and the sub@@ window advanced settings may remain with default settings .
&quot; radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) which is used for the filter . large values increase the time of the filter per pixel and can replace the picture above the image and the color in it becomes gl@@ aci@@ ated and therefore smaller errors . &quot;
shar@@ p@@ ness : controls the level of shar@@ p@@ ness . this value sets the pixels that can be deleted from the filter to the front . you may need to adjust the edges filter if you have to change this setting . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter image details can no longer obtain and rust@@ ling or lubr@@ icate it again . &quot;
edges : controls the cant@@ at@@ ness for the shar@@ p@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter@@ ing . if it is too strong can not occur a value close to the maximum when you want to remove it a growing Rau@@ schen or JPEG @-@ art@@ if@@ acts without any details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance intoler@@ ance of the image . we recommend you to change either color or lumin@@ ance to change a picture . these settings do not affect the fluid process of the details of the details .
colour : controls the colour toler@@ ance of the image . we recommend you to change either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the fluid process of the details of the details .
&quot; g@@ amma : controls the g@@ amm@@ ering of the picture . this value can be used to increase the toler@@ ances of the dar@@ ker areas , which typically become stronger , however , it also spar@@ ked the down@@ sides . &quot;
&quot; ste@@ aming : controlled the adjust@@ ing of the phon@@ em@@ bedding . this value is defined as fast the adap@@ tive filter radius of variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is increased , the edges of the lumin@@ ance , when he can occur at his minimum , one can remove rob@@ ber@@ y and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter on the edges . he can remove smo@@ k@@ tips and is the recommended method for it . &quot;
&quot; save under and store : these buttons are used exactly for this . all parameters of the space reduction , which you have set can be stored and loaded into the files@@ ystem . &quot;
this is an example of how space reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and corre@@ cted with the default settings .
&quot; sometimes a picture is a cr@@ ack@@ y for your purpose . the solution to draw the image a little soft , is fortunately much easier than one image to shar@@ ks . use the tool to display with the menu . use the effect on the right side of the dialog box shows the effect of this operation on your photo . &quot;
the &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce Photo@@ production .
&quot; this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted art@@ e@@ facts from your images . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ge &apos;s , sc@@ atter@@ ing , crat@@ ers , com@@ pressors , com@@ pressors , sc@@ oring images and thus gets the content like it is also the human eye . &quot;
&quot; the same algorithm can be used for color and texture , the texture is done with another tool , the image error corre@@ ctions . the algorithm for restoration was developed by the I@@ MAGE Team of G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ kre@@ ich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
JPEG art@@ if@@ acts reduce : the compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away . as a left com@@ pressors com@@ pressors , he produces some compression &amp; quot ; art@@ if@@ acts ; - small standards that can be adjusted in un@@ compressed image . this setting should be correct . &quot;
the buttons stor@@ ing as and store exactly this . each setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and will be re@@ charged later .
photo @-@ restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . but it can still last very long and a high CPU load to move . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the kno@@ b .
below you can reduce like a photo with Equ@@ al Rau@@ schen .. The module is applied to a black and white photo that with a Min@@ olta ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 film with a Sens@@ it@@ ivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the not@@ or@@ ious film@@ strip on the faces . the original image is under ( 1 ) and corre@@ cted under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo @-@ restoration . this time tex@@ tures can be read on an old colour photo which was caused by a scanner that can be seen from the Sc@@ ann@@ er@@ lights and the phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the corre@@ cted picture below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the det@@ ik@@ am ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows to remove hot@@ pixel from photos that have been removed with an CCD camera , eight . it uses algorithms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pix@@ i project , which are protected by Martin col@@ opp . &quot;
&quot; bright , total or hot pixels are particularly high in high @-@ quality pipe mode photos a problem since many cameras with JPEG compression over a built @-@ in op@@ pression for hot pixels . &quot;
&quot; this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; name Pixel@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright Pixel@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright Pixel@@ quot ; and &quot; &quot; quot ; bright Pixel@@ quot ; &quot; there is currently no manual method to choose the bad pixels . &quot;
download this file in the wiz@@ ard with the button . the tool will detect automatically the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the picture @-@ show .
if you have an old digital camera it is important to you to discover the dark picture directly following to discover new hot or bright pixels by CCD def@@ ect .
&quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should load the matching dark picture of the dark picture . an automatic processing of the dark image will notice the bad pixel and this automatically invites you to the next session . &quot;
the image area and the preview can help you correct the result . the preview of the movie shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
select an area around the defe@@ ctive pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . choose the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ishing this pixel blocks . these are the available filters :
&quot; Dur@@ cut : there will be an average of the neighboring pixel . the resulting color is assigned to all defe@@ ctive pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is made separately for horizontal and vertical line . &quot;
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from Pixel@@ block will be considered to calculate a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ishing the defe@@ ctive pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter@@ ing method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to Pixel@@ block are dedu@@ cted to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ishing the pixels in the block .
Cub@@ ic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are dedu@@ cted to calculate a bi @-@ cub@@ ic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cub@@ ic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ishing the defe@@ ctive pixels in the block .
below you can see the hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo from a defe@@ ctive digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original picture has been applied to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corre@@ cted image is under ( 2 ) .
&quot; Vign@@ ette corre@@ cted is a tool to correct the Vign@@ et@@ izing , i.e. sub@@ mer@@ ged corners , an image . &quot;
&quot; fores@@ kin objective , especially the middle and large photo format , often can illumin@@ ate the entire sensor range . instead &amp; quot ; v@@ ign@@ ett@@ ier@@ en@@ quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they reduce the corners and mar@@ gins of the image by reducing the light that can be achieved there . Tele@@ objective will also show this behavior . &quot;
&quot; however , he has also dis@@ advantages . many centers filters require a factor 1.5 or 2 in the aper@@ ture filter , which is impossible to keep the camera with the hand . fores@@ kin objective , also with center filter , an opening of f / 16 or smaller , since otherwise un@@ shar@@ pen effects are created by movement . &quot;
&quot; with the large exposure of today , fil@@ ming and colour@@ - or gr@@ assy areas of digital cameras and film scanner , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of an Center@@ filter by placing an adequate filter on an image . the algorithm is protected by John Walker . &quot;
with three shelves you can control the Vign@@ ette proper filter and with three further the exposure of the target .
&quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of light ampl@@ ifiers on the point of the largest density . the standard density is 2.0 , which is an optical filter with an aper@@ ture adjustment of 2 , un@@ spr@@ ing@@ .@@ In@@ cre@@ ase the density to compens@@ ate a larger degree of Vign@@ et@@ izing , reduce it around a small degree . &quot;
&quot; lumin@@ ous , contrast and Gamma settings : the processing of a picture with the Vign@@ ette corre@@ cted reduces the lumin@@ osity of the pixels . you need to re@@ use the exposure of the target with these options , as you only need to increase positive values as you only need to increase the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want a fine re@@ adjust@@ ing the exposure of the target image , so let the values for fluores@@ cent / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation of the &amp; dig@@ ging ; image processing from the menu color gra@@ dation . &quot;
this is an example of Vign@@ ette corre@@ cted on an image . the original picture ( 1 ) indicates the original picture ( 1 ) shows the corre@@ cted picture . a lamp @-@ level and contra@@ sting correction was also carried out in the image with this tool .
the &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; Lin@@ sen@@ dist@@ ortion is a tool to correct the effect of spher@@ ical l@@ ent@@ ils to photos . it uses an copyrighted algorithm by David Hod@@ son .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric dist@@ ort@@ ions . colour dist@@ ort@@ ions cannot be corre@@ cted with this tool .
the co@@ efficient of the second Gra@@ des treated the general geomet@@ ric dist@@ ortion of the lens and can correct the con@@ cave or contra@@ sting form of the picture .
&quot; the co@@ efficient of the third degree has a similar round effect , but fl@@ aw@@ ed to the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool . &quot;
the co@@ efficient fourth degree corre@@ cted the remote corners to the second degree . if you can combine these two geomet@@ ric dist@@ ortion almost eliminated .
&quot; generally , this value controls the strength of the dist@@ ortion second degree . with negative values can be corre@@ cted and positive values can be corre@@ cted dist@@ ortion . &quot;
&quot; corner : this value controls the strength of the dist@@ ortion of the fourth degree . this value affects the edges as in the middle of the picture . for most l@@ ent@@ ils , the &apos; Corner parameter has the reverse parameter of the parameter . &quot;
zoom : this value is scal@@ able the image size and thus leads to the correction of the first gra@@ des by . negative values enlarge while positive the image is smaller .
&quot; bright : this value adjust the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values they increase . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best filter settings , illustrated the dialog with a preview the dist@@ ortion corre@@ ctions . the values you use for your image will be saved and used in the next start as standard values . &quot;
the sound and sc@@ rup@@ al correction should be performed in front of all aggreg@@ ation or sizes . best lead you to cut this correction than all the first through . if you need a picture to cut a picture and then a sound @-@ shaped correction would be the effect on the apparent .
&quot; to help you find the best correction to you , this tool will display a vertical and horizontal ob@@ server in your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines on this place . following , you can correct the sound @-@ shaped dist@@ ortion with the help of the lines . &quot;
if you correct a sc@@ rup@@ p dist@@ ortion it will have the resulting picture black corners . you can remove these with the spect@@ ing tool in the menu spect@@ ing spect@@ ing or over the Zoom regul@@ ator of this dialog .
&quot; for most pictures , the sound @-@ shaped correction is sufficient . the next logical step for some mot@@ ifs such as recordings from the front , frame and paintings , it is the perspective to correct it all angles in the image 90 degrees . note that if you keep the camera with your hand you will always have a slight dist@@ ortion of perspective . &quot;
this is an example of the sound @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the corre@@ cted picture below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method of simul@@ ating infr@@ ared film of the G@@ imp@@ gur@@ u@@ .org website which is accessible under this URL ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ i@@ ar@@ ot@@ film , see this URL . this film has a Sens@@ it@@ iv@@ ance range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
in the left side of the window you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the image .
&quot; below the preview you can set two parameters , scre@@ ening and fil@@ tern@@ ess ( ISO ) . enable the gra@@ ving texture of a highly sensitive film simul@@ ating . the ISO controller changed the amount of fil@@ ming and domin@@ ance of color green ( chlor@@ oph@@ yll in nature ) in the conversion . green meadows are white as snow ! &quot;
&quot; as the filter color channels for re@@ produce infr@@ ared film mis@@ ery , especially the green channel does not make sense the effect on black / white photos , as the color form@@ ations are missing . &quot;
this is an example of infr@@ ared effect on a landsc@@ ap@@ ing image from New Zealand . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film has been put on ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a kind of au@@ ra in the sw@@ ift .
&quot; the dig@@ ging on ; filter scre@@ ening is an easy to use tool to re@@ produce scre@@ ening on your images , such as the B / W Kodak Tr@@ i @-@ X , to increase the sensitivity of the films , the manufacturer large silver bas@@ kets of the photo@@ emul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; the fil@@ ming effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . in case you want this special , gallery @-@ like , rhin@@ estones , gra@@ ined sight especially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , so you need to use this filter . &quot;
&quot; the controller can be adjusted to the ISO @-@ sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the Kör@@ ner calib@@ rated . the default value is , although often higher values need to be adjusted to ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need more gra@@ ins , so you can use the filter several times . &quot;
this is an example of the film @-@ sound effect on a black / white picture . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and the processed ( 2 ) . the used fil@@ th is equivalent to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; filter oil painting creates the appearance of a oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm of Piet@@ er Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; filter o@@ il@@ äl@@ zer gives your digital pictures a nice appearance like a oil painting . natural pictures and style @-@ life are good for this effect .
&quot; there are two controllers to influence this effect . the top cho@@ oses the brush size between one and five out . thick@@ er brushes are better suited for large images . smooth brushes are suitable for large images . smooth brushes controlled the smo@@ othing or , from the other side of view of shame . &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the processed ( 2 ) is marked with the ( 2 ) .
&quot; the &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; filters Koh@@ le@@ dge used shades and Int@@ ensity gra@@ dient to produce a carbon , therefore emphas@@ izes . pictures whose gra@@ dient are slow are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful when you would have chosen to sk@@ ate you . this would be good pictures to make you start . &quot;
there are two shelves with an impair@@ ment of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the top reg@@ eller elect the pins and adjust the contrast ( credit@@ ed ) .
this is an example of the consistency filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the altered picture ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used . the result may be further improved by adjustment of Int@@ ensity .
&quot; the dig@@ ik@@ am ; filter engraving , your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was engra@@ ved in wax . it is used for a copyrighted algorithm of Piet@@ er Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the dig@@ ik@@ am ; filter engraving is a fast tool to give your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . he does not work well in pictures with a simple structure where color is not the most important part of the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity , to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ d@@ ant landscape . &quot;
&quot; the depth allows the contrast of the filter@@ ing . a value of 30 , equivalent to 10 % , is equivalent . &quot;
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the depth is 10 % .
with this filter@@ ing group you can transform a normal photo into a artwork by means of dist@@ ortion effects . it uses protected algorithms by Piet@@ er Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave @-@ blocks 1 : shares the image in cells and can look it as if it is seen through glass blocks .
wave @-@ blocks 2 : analog to the shaft blocks 1 is dist@@ orted to the picture here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects need a long time to calculate and create a high CPU load . you can break these effects at any time using the kno@@ b .
with this filter@@ ing group you can transform a normal photo into a artwork by means of un@@ shar@@ p@@ ness effects . it uses protected algorithms by Piet@@ er Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom un@@ shar@@ p@@ ness : conce@@ aled the image along st@@ ern@@ ing lines that goes from a focus . this simul@@ ates the un@@ shar@@ p@@ ness of a zo@@ om@@ iting camera and thereby generates a dynamic expression of often in the phot@@ ogen@@ ic photography .
radi@@ al im@@ shar@@ p@@ ness : conce@@ aled the image by rotation of the pixels at a centre . this simul@@ ates the un@@ shar@@ p@@ ness of a revol@@ ving camera .
Rem@@ ov@@ aries : promise the image to create the effect of a not focused on camera . the object seems to go back in the background .
&quot; bl@@ ur@@ ring the image by horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the un@@ shar@@ p@@ ness of a linear moving , z : B : out of a car or train photograp@@ hed , camera . &quot;
&quot; soft di@@ shar@@ p@@ ness : promise the picture soft@@ ly in the dark and strong in the light tones . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ or photos or add a warm and subtle bul@@ b . &quot;
&quot; sh@@ aken , bl@@ ur@@ red the image by random shift in pixels and simul@@ ates the un@@ shar@@ p@@ ness of an arbit@@ rary moving camera . &quot;
intelligent un@@ shar@@ p@@ ness : finds the color @-@ color in the image and negoti@@ ate it without the rest .
&quot; mos@@ aic : shares the photo of rectangular cells and creates it , through the col@@ t with an average pixel value , new . &quot;
some effects need a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time using the kno@@ b .
the reg@@ ent@@ ro@@ ps are a nice little tool to make ra@@ ind@@ ro@@ ps on your picture . this gives it natural your images a n@@ id appearance . it uses one of Piet@@ er Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n protected by protected algorithm .
dri@@ pping size allows the size of the drops to change . as the trop@@ ics size is not automatically growing with the size of the image . number changes the number and density of drops . fish changes the vis@@ ually effect of drops on the picture .
&quot; you can hold an area free from reg@@ ent@@ ro@@ ps . use the range of tools to select the area , e.g. a face that is freely to stay freely . if you start the filter reg@@ ent@@ ro@@ ps , the area will remain free from reg@@ ent@@ ro@@ ps . &quot;
this is an example of the shelf filter . the original picture ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the processed image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the standard values were used for this example .
&quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it through mir@@ rors or turning into the right orientation . the tools can be found in the menu transform@@ ers or transform@@ ers mir@@ rors . &quot;
&quot; photo bl@@ owing is definitely one of the most advanced tools , in order to enlarge a picture with a minimal loss of image quality . &quot;
a picture is easy . the big question is simple . the big question is how can you find a picture bl@@ owing and the details sharp ? how can you find the missing information again ? how can you find the missing information again ? how can you find the missing information again ? how can you find the missing information again ? how can you find the missing information again ? how can you find the missing information again ? how can you find a good job . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size you can change it to the desired size with the tool size . choose trans@@ forming size in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is below .
&quot; the tool to change size uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method in order to enlarge the pixels . if you want a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool for bl@@ owing . &quot;
many educational programs use a type of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge a picture . &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm Photo infl@@ bl@@ owjob from the I@@ MAGE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
you need to say the tool as you want to change the size . these settings are available in the rider New size and are listed below :
&quot; to maintain the aspect ratio : when this setting is enabled , the input of the new size will keep the aspect ratio of the original image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects greater structures . the higher this value is necessary , the more it is difficult to appreciate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ge effect , he must be higher than 3 . &quot;
buttons Save as and store are used to be used as a text file and can be downloaded again and later .
&quot; photo bl@@ owing is very fast when it makes , but it can still last very long and a high CPU load to move . you can break the calculation at any time with the kno@@ b . &quot;
you can see below an example for photo bl@@ owing when a small color picture has been enlarged . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged image ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard gau@@ ge .
&quot; the spect@@ ing of a photo is not only a common surgery , but also a often under@@ estimated tool to put an image with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and draw the rect@@ angle , then you will see this rect@@ angle while you move the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you go down the mouse button again , the area of the photo will be cut away . therefore , you get a good overview of how your photo will change to the spect@@ us . you can create the size of the rect@@ angle by clicking on the corners of the rect@@ angle . a new rect@@ angle simply by clicking on the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the cutting button , use the kno@@ b button of the image processing in the toolbar and the photo will be tailored ( Ctr@@ l ; + X ) . use the file file saving or files in the file to save the newly created photo . &quot;
&quot; in the pre@@ stige area , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by placing the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in dialog is preserved . &quot;
&quot; in the tool After aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as a high @-@ format or cross @-@ format . in the disk format is always assigned to the larger value of height and in the format of the width . &quot;
&quot; the tool after aspect ratio is also used to use a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always equal to whether you are cent@@ imeters , in@@ let or any other physical size . you can see example below a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier and their aspect ratio . &quot;
at the right end of the dialogue there are two buttons to get the selection automatically horizont@@ ally or vert@@ ically .
&quot; at the bottom of the dialog you can use the Max . relation to the area for tri@@ mming on the greatest possible , depending on the chosen relations and orientation . &quot;
&quot; the tool After aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the image orientation ( horizont@@ ally or vertical ) . if you use the spect@@ ator to display the next time , these settings are reflected in the EX@@ IF tables so that the EX@@ IF data are reflected in the EX@@ IF data and not the original image . &quot;
the settings of the compositions help to include help to enable you to make your pictures better . these support are :
&quot; harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic particles are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third @-@ party , harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles are a possibility to share a rect@@ angle in similarly harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles on the diag@@ onal . &quot;
&quot; Golden mid : the golden middle is a division on various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Naut@@ il@@ us sh@@ ells or the in@@ flo@@ ating sheets of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things we consider as beautiful . &quot;
&quot; the golden number is the irr@@ ational number 1,6@@ 00@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it has been used by the ancient Egyptians , and Greeks used to put your temple and pyram@@ ids . artists and architects have made the golden participation in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to put your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number is derived from the Fib@@ on@@ acci sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; from where every number is the sum of its two pro@@ gres@@ sed numbers . a composition that is usually followed as visual harmon@@ ious . &quot;
the golden middle represents liquid guides . these ass@@ aul@@ ts are listed below :
&quot; the Golden Spir@@ als will bring you to your destination good results for your photos . compared to the third @-@ party , the golden spiral is generated a fluid line of the eye through the image . this type of composition leads the view of the spiral , along the line of spiral and creates a symmet@@ rical visual flow . &quot;
&quot; a further rule is the rect@@ angles of the golden spiral , also called Golden law . it should be something that the eye is in the center of composition . this something can simply be there without the eye to guide it will fulfil its task . &quot;
&quot; the golden tri@@ angles are also guided by the above golden spir@@ als . their vert@@ ices are the middle points of the sides of the golden rect@@ angles . note that in contrast to harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not equal to these lines . diag@@ onal object can leave a static object of dynamic . &quot;
if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame around your frame . try your image focus on one of the inter@@ sections and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that can not be reached differently .
the options horizont@@ ally reflect and vertical mirror can be used to reflect the harmon@@ ious particles .
with the button color you can put the color of the auxiliary lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast can be invisible . in this way you can custom@@ ize the color of the lines of your current picture .
free rotation is a tool to rot@@ ate an image around any angle .
&quot; if you make a photo , then it is easy to keep the camera not exactly vert@@ ically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which the things are fil@@ med . you can fix this with the &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; imaging , and the tool free rotation . &quot;
&quot; turn your image with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this sli@@ ders are indicated in degrees . with the button preferences you can put the sli@@ ders again on 0 degrees . a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are shown on the right side . &quot;
&quot; to your help , the module provides free rotation in horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse over to position the two lines . once you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in the previous section . &quot;
after you have shot a picture you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to fix it is the function transform@@ ers from the image processing .
an elegant way to cut the picture is the function automatic spect@@ ing . choose one of the following options :
the option anti @-@ Ali@@ asing smooth@@ es the picture a bit after the spin . note the above warning .
all per@@ spe@@ edy transform@@ ations are performed to a fixed point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is shown in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle .
&quot; to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares to the corners of your image . the preview is then automatically re@@ calculated . on the right side of the dialog box will find some information which help you to change the perspective : &quot;
&quot; new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas which are created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
&quot; new height : shows the height of the new image , including the empty areas which are created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
angle left top : shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed territory .
angle on the top : shows the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed territory .
angle left below : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed territory .
angle right below : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed territory .
&quot; following the adaptation of the perspective , the image is a bit prescription , but two adjustments generate a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
after which you have adapted the perspective you get irre@@ plac@@ ental tri@@ angular holes on the corners . an opportunity to ber@@ ing it is the picture with transform@@ ers of the imaging .
&quot; sc@@ iss@@ ing tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part to the opposite . a horizontal she@@ ar , the image will be dist@@ orted . in other words , a rect@@ angle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ og@@ ram . you can start this module via transform@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; add your image by pressing the Horiz@@ ont@@ al angle and vertical angles , you can set horizont@@ ally and vert@@ ically at the same time . a preview of the effect will display you and the new dimensions of the target will be shown on the right of the pre@@ views . &quot;
&quot; to your help become a vertical and horizontal line built @-@ in . move the mouse to fix an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines to adjust your image . &quot;
&quot; after which you have carried out the she@@ ar , the picture will be somewhat negle@@ cted . for a single she@@ ar this effect is mostly negl@@ ig@@ ible , but two deposits generated twice as much ad@@ mi@@ red and therefore you should avoid this . &quot;
after the she@@ ar the image has un@@ beautiful tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate it is the image with transform@@ ers of the imaging .
&quot; &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write . the available formats are therefore depend on your system and , in some cases , by the way these libraries have been comp@@ il@@ ated . in most of the distrib@@ utions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; dig@@ ging . &quot;
&quot; due to this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to provide a list of all available file formats , but you will always find JPEG and TIFF below . &quot;
&amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; only shows files in formats to know . this happens on the basis of the file extension and a comparison of these with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is displayed in the list . you can change this list of file extensions ; you can change this list of file extensions . in the section configuration you will find more information .
nearly all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras allow you to select the format used to select the format . a detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; supports both formats .
compression compression is the application of data compression procedures on digital pictures . thereby red@@ und@@ ant information is reduced to save the image data to an efficient way .
&quot; JPEG 2000 is also supported . generally , there are better , gl@@ atter@@ e results as JPEG in the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s version can also be saved if this is indicated in the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to learn more about the raw format , you can read in Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . you can find raw materials in JPEG or TIFF with the raw material converter of &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; convert in the section configuration you will find further information on the use of modules with &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; &quot;
&amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; supports the loading of raw materials only with the program d@@ cra@@ w which is included in &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; they can see more than 200 raw material formats ; the table below shows a short list of raw materials that are supported by &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; the table below shows a short list of raw materials that are supported by &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ;
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are often stored in the avi@@ da or MPEG format . if you click on a film file ; it is not a film @-@ file program . if you click on a film file ; the &amp; KDE ; settings to play movies can be used to play the program .

&quot; if you exchange the steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well when the initi@@ als were very good , then you can perform the first four alignment with the module white . &quot;
many tools you need to do the Phot@@ al processing are in &amp; dig@@ ik@@ am ; included . your description follows here .
&quot; display all imaging tools such as shar@@ pen@@ ing , soft@@ eners , smo@@ ked mascul@@ ine , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform dialog box , which will be applied in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you can see &amp; quot ; text@@ book application , in this dialog : &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : this progress report shows the status of the filter on the current picture . to the left of him allow five buttons to change the compar@@ ative mode of the pre@@ cin@@ ct . these modes are : &quot;
vert@@ ically sharing without dupl@@ icate . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected range area .
&quot; horizont@@ ally , without dupl@@ icate . the upper part indicates the original and the lower shows the filter applied to the area below the selected range area . &quot;
&quot; vertical parts . the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter . &quot;
&quot; horizontal , the top area shows the original and the lower to the effect of the filter . &quot;
&quot; mouse over &apos; style : shows the preview when the mouse is not in the pre@@ cursor , and otherwise the original . &quot;
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can switch off to display excess and exposure . the users can be adjusted in the general settings .
( 3 ) : the frame to choose the preview . you can draw this frame with the mouse within the image and put on the part of the image from which you want to see the preview . the preview in the left part of the dialogue is immediately updated .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings of the last use of the module are measured .
the side@@ bar properties shows the essential information about the selected image and is largely explic@@ able . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo properties : shows a summary of the most important parameters in the shooting of the photos . these data are from the EX@@ IF data when these are available .
this rider provides an intuitive map search engines based on the Mar@@ ble mini@@ ature program . you can press Ctr@@ l ; lin@@ ker mouse button to pull a square . all pictures within this coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . this course requires your images Geo @-@ data .
&amp; col@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; is an editor for pall@@ ets Files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ese and for selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
the pall@@ ets files that are installed by &amp; KDE ; can either be installed for the whole system or only a user . in the latter case they are in your personal folder for &amp; KDE ; -@@ settings and hot user @-@ defined color and authorisation used .
in the dialog palette you can select from a list of installed pall@@ ets or browse the folder to files .
the cursor is displayed in the p@@ allet view as a line . he can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
it shows up on the colour . the color is described under the p@@ allet view . here also the color name can be changed .
&quot; it can also be used to choose . to create such a selection , click the area next to a color to move the cursor . then move the mouse on pressed left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if the c@@ ified field can be activated under the button of the button , the color is inserted at the cursor on the cursor . the color will either be inserted or over@@ writes a different ; depending on whether the mode is over@@ writing . &quot;
&quot; a selection that is generated as described in the last section , can be used together with actions , cutting and paste . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; uses the following format for data in the clip@@ board : for each color three values for the parts of red , green and blue and an optional color indicate , if another color follows . if there are three numer@@ ical values in the clip@@ board , these can be inserted into a color in &amp; col@@ ore@@ dit ; &quot;
the colors in the palette and the output of the colours can be drawn with the mouse .
you can select a color somewhere on the screen and then click on the left side .
&quot; graph@@ s ; programs are a KDE program for watching &amp; graph@@ s ; programs are free layout programs . graph@@ s are used in science , especially in computer science . so far , there was no modern &amp; GUI ; -@@ program , in order to visu@@ alize the program author , X11 , or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with only few features . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; -@@ Project has set itself the goal to replace these programs by a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; KDE ; -@@ program .
&amp; C@@ graph@@ s ; is a KDE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graph@@ s ; graph@@ s are free layout programs . &amp; C@@ graph@@ s ; displays graph@@ s with all the possibilities of a good integrated &amp; KDE ; -@@ program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI . it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; Kate ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of graph@@ s in &amp; Kate ; the graph@@ s new ri@@ pping and in &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; represents )
menu to open the graph in &amp; Kate ; to open or Grap@@ h in &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; in a &amp; Kate ; -@@ component to open
&quot; to load large graph ( currently there are problems from about 1000 kn@@ ots and a h@@ ack , to present more than these kn@@ ots ) &quot;
&quot; other required software : &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; is a &amp; KDE ; -@@ program , which pre@@ sup@@ poses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for the presentation of graph@@ s . needs to be required in detail : &quot;
&quot; the main window displays the open Grap@@ h , each in an own sub@@ window . at the beginning , when you start &amp; k@@ graph@@ s , the main window will open only the icon file and the ( empty ) list . click on the first icon to open the dialog file . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected one or more &amp; dot ; files selected , the main window looks like in the bottom screenshot : &quot;
as you can see will be an overview in the corner if the graph is bigger than the string space . you can select a fixed position of this overview or select this position automatically .
&quot; using the mouse bike ( high and above without special scanning , left and right in pressed &amp; Alt ; -@@ button ) ; &quot;
the zo@@ om@@ es is limited in both directions by the factor 10 . below you can see the maximum reduction of a graph .
&quot; when the straight in &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer : charged file from another program , the following window will appear : &quot;
you can choose whether the Grap@@ h is to be re@@ loaded or if you want to change the change . &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; you can change your decision later that later you can change the menu item settings to k@@ graph@@ viewer ; see also .
&quot; if you open a graphics outside of a running &amp; k@@ graph@@ s ; -@@ instance , &amp; eg ; in the file text or at the command line , you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; -@@ instance , or want to display to lad@@ der Grap@@ h in a sub@@ window of the already current instance . &quot;
&quot; as with the last option you can store your choice permanently , but also change with the interior dialog . &quot;
&quot; at the program start , you can open all graph of your last session . again , you can save your choice both as well as later . &quot;
you can also specify how the graph should be divided into multiple pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be chosen freely .
&quot; if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph , which will come to a page on this page , the aspect ratio will be retain@@ ed , the pages may not be filled by the specific parts of the graph . &quot;
side@@ look with one to several pages distributed without head@@ line and with another font
&quot; the page again loading the opportunity to set the behaviour when a file was modified on the hard disk , and eg ; from another program . you can specify a standard behavior ( automatically re@@ load or modify the program every time ) . &quot;
opening the site opening is the possibility to set the behavior of &amp; k@@ graph@@ s ; you can specify a graph outside of a current session ( Grap@@ h in a new window or specify in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or determine that every time will be asked .
the site management gives the opportunity to set the start@@ up of &amp; k@@ graph@@ s ; you can set a standard behavior ( the files of the last session or not ) or determine when you start after every start .
the context menu that normally appear on a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; opens more possibilities :
&quot; here you can choose from different &amp; graph@@ ies ; -@@ Lay@@ ou@@ tal@@ algorithms , select the entries as they are described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; are : &quot;
&quot; algorithm , algorithm , the standard for coated graph@@ s . it produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered represent@@ ations of ger@@ ated graph@@ s . the algorithm lays down the edges to the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then try to produce as short edges and as possible as a few cant@@ ons . &quot;
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for non @-@ coated graph@@ s . it produces performers according to the spr@@ ing@@ ent model . it is used in the Kam@@ ada @-@ Kaw@@ ai algorithm that is syn@@ onymous with statistics of multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
&quot; the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm algorithm for un@@ er@@ ected graph layout . it uses the fru@@ ct@@ man @-@ clean@@ gold sl@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a surplus @-@ up de@@ emer to treat large and cl@@ uster graph . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm defines the no@@ des circular according to the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and meadow , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycl@@ ic structures . &quot;
&quot; opening a dialog where you can specify a Lay@@ out@@ command , which will then be executed by a shell . the command should enter the Graph@@ ite format to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format , or modify the graph with a filter before it is drawn . &quot;
determined the type of graph@@ s ( directed or un@@ coated ) and uses the default algorithm for the respective type of ( dot ; for al@@ igned , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for un@@ coated graph@@ s ) . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is enabled , the overview will be shown if this is necessary . otherwise it will not be displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active . &quot;

the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alisation allows GPS coordinates to add GPS coordinates into the met@@ ad@@ ata of an image and to edit . the geographic data is stored in the EX@@ IF keywords and the loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alisation makes tools available to locate images geograph@@ ically in spher@@ ical coordination system that is used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , long@@ it@@ ud@@ inal and lat@@ itudes are used . &quot;
&quot; to cor@@ relation your images with geographic data , you need a GPS track as XML file in g@@ px @-@ format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ p@@ sman you can download the data for you from your GPS device . &quot;
image Ge@@ ograph@@ ical loc@@ alisation of the cor@@ relation . this interface can lead a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
&quot; select the pictures you want to download kor@@ rel@@ ing in the main window and call the menu . in order to load a possible cor@@ relation over time and loc@@ alization , you have to load a trace file with GP@@ X file . this file contains course the same time in the same places , as the pictures of your camera . &quot;
if the file is loaded a automatic cor@@ relation is performed by the coordinates in red . GPS Sp@@ ur@@ data are recorded in GMT @-@ time and therefore the camera time has to be converted with the time zone . this can be carried out with the time@@ zone .
&quot; the de@@ viation for the maximum period de@@ viation gives a high vari@@ ance for the GPS time and Camer@@ a@@ time . lies the de@@ viation below , the data will be mer@@ ged . the maximum value is 2000 seconds . &quot;
if you have no trace data from one place for pictures you can edit the g@@ px file and add to the images . the time difference between 2000 seconds will then add all pictures in this area .
&quot; options inter@@ pol@@ ishing and difference in min. can be used if you do not have any matching data . if you know that in reality a local difference between camera and GPS , you can set this limits and then push the button cor@@ relation to inter@@ pol@@ ishing . &quot;
&quot; the coordinates can be manually set with this dialog . this is useful if you have a number of photos at the same place . as the dialog must use the coordinates from a call to the next notes , you only need the button OK to put the data in the current photo . &quot;
&quot; location can also be found with the quoted map and to be found here . select the relevant region and enlarge En@@ .@@ Add this again to you . the height must always be selected manually . the map can always be changed manually . the map can be changed between map @-@ mode , satellite image and a mixed mode . &quot;
&quot; completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are possibilities to hang the GPS data to the images . here is a small script that the ex@@ if@@ tool is used to provide a stack of images with GPS data . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module image gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums in a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums which can be exported as HTML pages and select the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set becomes U@@ TF @-@ 8 enco@@ ded to enable the best possible internation@@ alization .
the module has four rider in which the settings are adapted . the rider selection allows you to choose according to HTML . you will only choose a large number of albums on the right side . you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below it will appear quickly a large number of albums . in the area including the Al@@ ben@@ vor@@ schau and the text of the HTML page will appear .
the rider appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this rider is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . the option For each image will create a page in which the image is shown on the picture below . otherwise the image will be shown directly with your default viewer ? eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show is displayed .
the rider album defines the settings where and how the gallery has to be saved with all your related images . choose a folder with the name K@@ I@@ PI@@ A@@ Export which contains everything will be created there .
&quot; if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF @-@ information will also be saved in the new pictures . &quot;
with other color depth you can change the default depth . the settings of course also influences the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the rider Th@@ umb@@ nails allows you to display some of the settings from the album rider for the th@@ umb@@ nails which are small pictures shown in the gallery .
a progress window displays the user to how far the action is . push break down to break the process .
&quot; if the module creates the pages , the window will not automatically shut down . you can therefore read the program regist@@ rations to determine whether errors are started at the end , to display the preview of the gallery . press the module to close the module . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I portrait is a very fast and flexible OpenGL bas@@ ing tool to look for pictures .

&quot; with the import function of the met@@ ad@@ ata module , you can copy data from one picture to another . &quot;
&quot; this feature is not working with all images . you can copy from anywhere , but not in any target format . JPEG is supported by writing . please take a look for ex@@ iv@@ 2 to see which formats are supported . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module is a tool to convert a number of pictures into a MPEG video in the form of a slideshow .
&quot; the module MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer can be used to convert selected pictures into a MPEG @-@ video , using a defined length , to convert . this module uses the packages M@@ j@@ peg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick . you can also add a audio file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slideshow . &quot;
&quot; all pictures will automatically be placed on the correct size for the selected video format . additionally , you can create a background color for the slideshow . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ VCD / SV@@ CD / VCD for your DVD player . to burn the medium to burn the K@@ 3@@ b program . &quot;
you must first select the pictures into the MPEG slideshow . afterwards you can start the module via extr@@ as MPEG sli@@ desh@@ au .
the selected pictures are then listed below image files in the portfolio . there you can also change sort@@ ing of the images or the content of the list .
&quot; after you are satisfied with your list , you should select the other settings . the video format may select from different formats , DVD , X@@ VCD , SV@@ CD and VCD . if you are planning the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pre@@ set and most likely choose the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the next step you should indicate the time in seconds the image will be displayed . the speed of the output will be determined . a low value generates very sud@@ den , a high against it is very smooth image . &quot;
the background color can be set as next . in a doubt you should leave it in black . the name and the path of the generated file can be set under the name of the MPEG @-@ output file . please keep track of the extension .
&quot; if you specify a audio file under the name of the audio file , this will be integrated into the film . after you can start all settings your wishes . depending on the speed of your computer you can go quickly or at all rest a coffee and enjoy the slideshow , if you are back again . &quot;
&quot; if a note appears that co@@ di@@ erer or tools are missing , so you can custom@@ ize the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ peg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick packages to the right below . &quot;
the printer @-@ resistant allows several images on a piece of paper together in standard Photo@@ sizes . the combined images can also be opened automatically with the image processing of Gimp . this is e.@@ g : meaningful to make you improve or printing with the Gimp module .
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import your images in RAW format in one of three formats JPEG , TIFF or P@@ PM . &quot;
&quot; conversion based on the command @-@ tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . a original value of Him is : expect of d@@ cra@@ w not that it creates the same results as the software is generated by your camera . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w better results ! . &quot;
&quot; first , select the RAW file to convert and start the module . the Ra@@ w @-@ image converter window will then appear in mode for a single picture . with the button preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture . &quot;
you can now adjust the values to optimize the con@@ versions process . the first option decides to adjust whether the camera settings can be used as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue amplifier . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the image later . &quot;
a quad@@ ron R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected to use the contra@@ sting information . if your camera works in the R@@ GB mode the R@@ GB@@ G switches has no effect .
&quot; once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . &quot;
&quot; tagged Image Format , TIFF , reserves all the information of your image and uses the verl@@ ust@@ free L@@ Z@@ W Com@@ pressed . &quot;
&quot; if you have prescribed your images frequently or later you should not choose the JPEG format , as there are only a limited number of operations before getting the image quality . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot;
&quot; if you are interested in JPEG as storage format , the met@@ ad@@ ata will be stored in the RAW file to be stored in the JPEG file . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted your settings with the output button . if you want to break this process again , you can use this process . &quot;
&quot; the st@@ acking mode allows you to convert different pictures at once . use this mode so if you are sure , for example by testing on a single image which are the best settings . &quot;
&quot; however , the available settings are almost identical with the version for individual images . however , this is the option to automatically over@@ write file . this is helpful in case it is not available in an earlier trial . a preview is not available . the progress report shows how far the conversion were advanced . &quot;
this module can be used to fl@@ ate all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following picture formats are supported :
&quot; this module can be used for ren@@ aming all images of a album . you can put the pre@@ fix , the number and the tim@@ est@@ amp that should be used . &quot;
&quot; this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a picture collection . it is used to use the convert program from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can use the image res@@ ized , or enlarge . &quot;
&quot; proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal magn@@ itude in a dimension . the width or height of the image is automatically selected , depending on the image orientation , selected . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . &quot;
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : sizes in two dimensions . here the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adapt your image to screen format .
not proportional : not di@@ spro@@ port@@ ionate sizes in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed at this option .
&quot; printing preparation : prepare the image for the phot@@ od@@ ation before . the user can set the print resolution and the size of the phot@@ op@@ ap@@ iers . the target image , including background size , Rand@@ size and background color , will be adjusted accordingly . &quot;
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected pictures with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the best pictures before . additional images can draw on the list of the images on the images and there .
after which you have started the module window will display the picture window with the selected images . via the button pictures you can add to a file selection dialog . for the most recently the selected image will display a preview of the right .
you can also draw images on the picture list and add it to the list of the images to send@@ mail .
the images can remove the selected pictures from the list of the images .
&quot; after you have selected all the images , you can open the new message window of your e @-@ mail clients . you only have to add the addresses and the subject . you have only attached to the addresses and the subject . &quot;
don &apos;t pay attention to many pictures at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations for the size of the send@@ mail e @-@ mails . it may be a good idea to send several mails if you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration will be saved and used to change it again until you change it .
&quot; select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you have to specify the right path for your installation . &quot;
&quot; if you use the Google Mail Service , you will need to install the G@@ mail agent on your computer before you can download it here . &quot;
after the selection of comments in a attached file the comments will be connected to the pictures in a text file and the mail sent .
the PNG format under the menu images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo@@ files such as TIFF . you should therefore use PNG when you have a fast internet connection and the photo@@ quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend you the JPEG format .
&quot; if you are able to select JPEG on images file format and the original files in the JPEG format are , then the original Ex@@ if@@ dates are added to the send@@ mail images . &quot;
&quot; if the process is ready , the window will not automatically shut down , so you can view the status update on the search for errors , see . your e @-@ mail program will automatically start at the end . with the button , you can stroll this window . &quot;
&quot; following the starting point of the module , there will be a window with questions like you want your slideshow . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album . &quot;
&quot; the option OpenGL trans@@ itions in the presentation use very elegant image trans@@ itions by OpenGL . you need to have a corresponding graphics card , since otherwise the slideshow is very slowly . &quot;
the file fil@@ ename can display that the fil@@ ename of the images in the lower left corner will display during the presentation .
the loop provides the loop to display the presentation at an En@@ dl@@ os@@ loop . you can then manually transfer it to Es@@ c .
the option images can random@@ ly select that the images is shown in a random order . thus it is not the order of the pictures in the album .
&quot; under delay between the pictures , the tempor@@ al distance between the individual images can be set . 1500 mill@@ ise@@ con@@ ds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard . the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen trans@@ itions effect . you should therefore show doing so before you show your friends ! &quot;
there are more than a dozen trans@@ itions effect between which you can choose . random@@ ly cho@@ oses in any transition between the pictures another effect .
&quot; during the slideshow you can access a toolbar on the upper left screen , move the mouse in this corner to turn you . &quot;
&quot; with this toolbar , you can stop the presentation and start again , to the preced@@ ing and next picture and stop the slideshow . &quot;
&quot; at the left bottom of the screen , you can see the current fil@@ ename , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation . &quot;
&quot; currently , the K@@ IP@@ I module is currently taking no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the ma@@ iling list of the K@@ IP@@ I team among KDE @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de.@@ org. caution : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module background is a tool to put an image as wallpaper for the working surface .
&quot; this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of sub@@ menus , as the background for your KDE work . &quot;
&quot; once you have provided your images and videos with comments , you can see with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; by this brow@@ sing , see picture . as you can see by a comparison with the image , are now available in individuals , places and in the group keywords entries . &quot;
&quot; in the browser window you can see the categories , for which you have information entered when you look at your images and videos with notes . additionally , there are entries to look at the EX@@ IF @-@ based information , and of course the latest proposals . in the following each one is described for itself . &quot;
&quot; if you press the mouse on the entry , the view of the browser . see picture . &quot;
if you choose another person will only be displayed on which both persons are to be seen . through this selection method you can cut the number of the quoted pictures of a few thousand images on some individual images .
&quot; if you have selected all the people , places and other settings , you can view the images to look at the pictures of your en@@ quiry . &quot;
&quot; in the picture every person has the same symbol before her name . you can store &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person has its own preferences , which of course also applies to places , keywords and other categories that you themselves have defined . see the picture . &quot;
&quot; to view images next to the name , select the button that you want to use right outside on the toolbar . in the apparent context menu , you can choose the view that you can display for each category ( if you have a list of keyword ( if you do not have a suitable images for your keywords . &quot;
&quot; however , you have to set yourself what picture is to be displayed for every single person . now you can select the image Editor window , as shown in the picture window , you can select the picture for the appropriate person . in the check @-@ in window you can custom@@ ize the picture factor for your wishes and then select the image of the image . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search in the entry window , you will tell you a dialogue which is very similar to the dialogue for finding the image properties . this dialog can be viewed on the picture again . &quot;
&quot; if you want to enter a string into the field of let@@ tering or description , the records or descriptions of pictures will be done after this text . if you want , you can also use a date , for example 1971 , or the entire date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options in the lower part of the window , you can search all pictures according to certain names , as you can see in the picture . here is after pictures , on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; . if you do not like to read hand@@ books , but you would prefer to try out hand@@ books , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and look at the quick@@ set entry to the screen@@ shots and the introdu@@ ctory videos .
&quot; start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and select in the first dialogue the demo , if you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for first time , or select in the menu help the menu item k@@ photo@@ album ; -@@ demo will be loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coh@@ er@@ ent HTML document to download . &quot;
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this body can be seen here : . as the name suggests , this list will show you date statistics on the pictures in your database . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can show you several different time units . each track shows you a different unit . you can switch between the units of years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by taking the box only 10 @-@ minutes . &quot;
&quot; the bar button allows you to change in the following ways : you can change the displayed entries view from the database ( if you select a date , the first image of this date in the preview is displayed ) and furthermore it shows the current date of the currently displayed pictures when you see in the preview view . &quot;
&quot; you can also select a range of the bar by clicking the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the toolbar , so you can select a range , you will display the preview of this period . you can drop the selection by clicking on a beams of the bar . &quot;
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; provides you two ways to create HTML websites with your images . one is integrated in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated into &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version which you can create over the menu file HTML ...
&quot; before HTML pages you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three main areas , layout and target . &quot;
&quot; first , enter the title of the over@@ flow and a description which should contain HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML @-@ example pages you can see an example of these settings . &quot;
next select whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album is created to see if a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album is designed to see the page &apos;s page . nutri@@ ent information about export files can be found in .
&quot; finally , you can select what information is displayed on the HTML pages . for example , you can avoid that information is obvious that the vie@@ wers can also be viewed without a description . for example , that all pictures are exported . you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images in front of certain viewing . &quot;
&quot; in this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are clearly , which is not specifically advised . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the page you can set different resol@@ utions for the images . this way , those who need to view the website and have a monitor which supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no images can download the resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
the ob@@ server of your site may change the resolution at any time . he can therefore change your pictures with a low resolution that leads to a lower transmission time . if he wants to get an image larger he changes to a higher resolution .
in this Settings area you place the different folder and the URL where your website is stored .
please select a basic folder for all your HTML files and for each subsequent sentence a new sub@@ folder .
&quot; first , you have to choose the main folder in which all your images will be saved . this folder will be saved and select from the next time you can either select a folder or a by KDE supported protocol , for example : &quot;
&quot; once you have created your images , you can check whether this really all for ob@@ server is visible . if you have created for the basic folder a URL , the URL you define here , the URL should be given here . otherwise the web browser will start in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; if the files created by you created HTML files are not yet in the final folder you need to manually copy it . so that the import function , see , right now you need to specify the final goal of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the basic folder in which all sub@@ folders will be . &quot;
the options described in settings have all three on basic folders or URLs . in these will be a sub@@ folder whose name will set you to output folders .
&quot; if you are looking forward to a family party , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you might want to get up your images with these images . you can of course use a HTML page for viewing the images , then you have to apply with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , then do not have to do this work with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you can export a copy of your images to a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others in your database . &quot;
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ whether the pictures themselves are stored in the file or if the images can only be stored in the file that you can use all the images and this file can be independent . the obvious down@@ side is however the file size . &quot;
&quot; you can create a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the menu file ... or together with HTML pages , see , create a .@@ k@@ im file together with a HTML file , this will create an external .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in a double way . first , the images are not found in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using HTML export . &quot;
&quot; in the following , the dialog is described for export of pictures , which you can call on the File menu file ... &quot;
the most important option of this dialog is whether it is to deal with internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available :
&quot; at the option manuals to copy the .@@ k@@ im file , you need to copy the images in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; with the option Automatic in the vicinity of the .@@ k@@ im file copying &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , the pictures are automatically copied to you . &quot;
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . as most pictures were compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small and it is usually not worthwhile to com@@ press the files . if you want to com@@ press these files so you simply select the option export file .
&quot; the last option of this page is a maximum image size . if you want to send your friends pictures , because the .@@ k@@ im file is otherwise very big . here you can limit the size by example , that each picture should be more than 800 pixels high and wide . &quot;
if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu File import@@ ing ... select is &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in described .
&quot; the wiz@@ ard to import consists of four steps . first you have to select what pictures you want to import , then in which folders will import pictures . &quot;
&quot; it may be that you are to specify the category people of the file ( if you are a Denmark ) , while this category is asked to be imported in the third dialogue window , which should be imported in the third dialogue window , which should be imported to the categories of the files in your database . &quot;
in the fourth step you can see the categories of the file imported file with the categories of your current database . an example of this can be seen in the picture .
&quot; it needs to be easy to search images and see : when you look at images , you want to see pictures of different picture groups &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; if you want to discover pictures of your Italy holiday , you might want to see all the pictures , on which this friend is depic@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; in this manual you will take the different steps from the ( 1 ) Fest@@ ive the information about your images , about ( 2 ) the search and reputation , up to ( 3 ) advanced themes and custom@@ ization options . &quot;
&quot; the Photo@@ album has been started as a program for managing your pictures . however , it has been expanded and today it takes care of your videos . in many places this hand@@ book will be talking about pictures , but often also close this video with one . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , saves all his information in the file index.@@ xml in the top folder of her images . this is a simple XML file that allows you to secure a fl@@ oppy or re@@ visions at the CV@@ S , where they would like . &quot;
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; note the folder in which your pictures are stored automatically . if you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . if you want to start a different folder tree with pictures , you can &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; with the option -@@ c . as example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / images / index.@@ xml . &quot;
&quot; about the menu settings k@@ photo@@ album ; setup ... get to a window , with which you can change the settings from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user book will give you the various settings . &quot;
&quot; on the left you can see six different symbols , with which you can access the preview options and options for the viewer . for each setting is a detailed help available to the F1 @-@ button and a click on the desired option . &quot;
&quot; it has been described to you as you can create different properties , e.g. persons , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums . &quot;
&quot; on the dialog , which is used to process already existing groups . for each existing group you can choose a label and a symbol . &quot;
&quot; in the section sub@@ categories have already mentioned sub @-@ categories . in the dialog options you can set up complete members , i.e. , for example , all members of a group at once in a group , instead of all groups of a medi@@ ator as explained . &quot;
&quot; in view you can choose the settings , which are available to you with the opening of the members , you can choose the category you want to configure . in the left window you can choose a list of the current category and in the right a list of accommodation categories . &quot;
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; shares its modul@@ ating system with other graphic applications such as dig@@ i@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; KDE ; Image Plugin Interface . nutri@@ ent information can be found on the homepage of K@@ ip@@ i .
&quot; modules can be called modules via the menu modules . the modules can not be described in this manual , as they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; but most modules have a help that you can call on the modules itself . &quot;
&quot; as the modules are used by multiple applications among each other , it may be that the modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; demo , you can either call on your own images used with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album &quot; demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or via the menu Help . say not , I would not have been war@@ ned ! &quot;
&quot; the applications that use modules above K@@ IP@@ I will be very different , making it possible that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not work . this is the dis@@ advantage when you share functions with different applications . &quot;
&quot; the main difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications are not supported in albums : this type of order is not supported , simul@@ ates it for some modules the order according to albums , so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; thereby simul@@ ates &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which is simply the current view , so all the images that shows you the picture @-@ show at the moment . &quot;
&quot; apart from the current album &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , the modules also has to pass a list of albums . this is also a list of albums , as follows : &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser displays the content of a category , for example all persons , then each entry of this category is an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; if you have specified the category you have specified in the dialog dialog as a category for virtual albums , so if you have chosen the category for example , so if you would have chosen to view and give the module to the module . &quot;
&quot; as some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not compatible you can remove them from the list of modules . start the dialog dialog and select the modules , which modules are loaded . &quot;
&quot; on the picture you can see an example of a start@@ screen , as soon as you &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , start with your own images . &quot;
&quot; as you are used by any other KDE application , take a look at the top one menu and a toolbar . in the section you will not see any information about your pictures . in the section we will not see any information about your pictures . in the section we will show you at this window , but click on the entry pictures , which shows you an overview of all existing images . &quot;
&quot; one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the opportunity to see any picture with comments , where the picture has been recorded , etc . you can set any image either individually or for a larger number of pictures certain notes at the same time . if you are depic@@ ted on all pictures Jes@@ per , and all pictures in Copenhagen . &quot;
&quot; all these notes can be used for the search and brow@@ sing , as you can read in the section below . if you want to see these notes if you use the built @-@ in viewer . &quot;
&quot; in you can see three lists with a text@@ box by clicking on persons , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; because you will always use it again when you enter information about your pictures . &quot;
&quot; the following idea is based on the shif@@ ting of images within the list : if you are using a family party , and on all 50 images the same 5 @-@ 10 persons are displayed , so that the names used are moved to the top that can be found faster and arrange . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to receive a alphabet@@ ically ass@@ orted list , click on the icon for sort@@ ing by date under the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have any comments available for any picture separately , you possibly would like to edit all the selected pictures and these pictures with notes . click in this case simply click the front and back @-@ buttons , which can be found under the preview of the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you have multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more comfortable to mark all these images and use the menu item surplus entries at once with a note . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles , and California are all located in the USA . furthermore , San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California . &quot;
on the picture you can see a browser window of the USA as an over@@ head . to show you that it is a revision of over @-@ group , a special symbol is displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the context menu of the office , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over@@ - or sub@@ category . additionally , you can also take an entry to a category of this entry . attention , this puts you especially your categories alphabet@@ ically . &quot;
&quot; you can move the individual elements of the case , by filling the body that form the upper edge of the frame , click and move . you can also make your own window by filling it out of the window . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs , please click on the button options ... that allows you to save the current structure and appearance of the window . &quot;
you can also get a frame completely out . if you want to see this window later you will use the button options ... and then window a / out . this process can be seen in the picture .
&quot; if you select the entry images in the browser you will receive an overview with preview of the currently selected images , or any images if you do not have a filter . an example of this can be seen here . you can configure the size of the th@@ umb@@ nails by simply down the drag the mouse with the middle mouse button . try it easy . &quot;
&quot; if you make a picture on the background of your desktop , this image is set as wallpaper for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; once you click on a picture , this is shown in the picture . if you have not yet opened a window with a picture , a new indic@@ ator will be created . &quot;
you can also delete images from the images . simply select the appropriate images from which you would like to delete and press either the remove button or select the window menu . now you will see the window you can see in the picture .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; offers you for this problem a solution . you can also use it to you with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; of course you have to choose the pictures somewhere so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can view the images from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required pictures from the hard disk can be downloaded .
&quot; images , on which the right top left is cut , are not stored on the hard disk . this is e.g. in the pictures 1 @-@ 9 . however , for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 however , the preview of these images can display . you can also view the preview of these images . &quot;
&quot; as you see , this function requires you to copy files from folders and again . k@@ photo@@ album ; does it not support you to insert the relevant CD . if you want to avoid your images , please buy a larger disk in order to store all the images on it . &quot;
&quot; in the menu images you will find a sub@@ menu with the name of privacy . if you want to use a bit more privacy , you can see the pictures so that you can see for others un@@ accessible in the menu of privacy . alternatively , you can also see all the pictures that you can see for others . &quot;
&quot; so you have specified , which images are hidden in the case of the F@@ all . if you are the laptop of your little sister , simply select the menu item , simply select the pictures you want to be hidden . if you want to see the pictures again , click Sper@@ re . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to set a password that must be entered for un@@ locking the images . to set this password , simply select password in the menu of privacy . &quot;
&quot; please note that this picture protection is by no means very safe . for example , all images on the hard drive and the other one can access the file / xml file , the password used as un@@ encrypted text or delete it . this type of password can only be familiar with those who are associated with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar to bl@@ asph@@ eme the view of private pictures . &quot;
&quot; the reason why you can manage all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and hours over hours of course , you can see them at some point . for this reason you have a picture and vide@@ ot@@ hed . you can preview it out of the preview , as described in . &quot;
&quot; the viewer you can see in . he shows of course the picture , but extra all the information you have about the image , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc . &quot;
&quot; if the Info@@ box on the upper part of the image you want to see , so you can easily put it with the mouse , and you can also configure which information is displayed and whether all these options are available after a right click on the viewer . the following context menu can be seen below . &quot;
&quot; some words in the Info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click here on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all pictures from Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you were selected by the browser from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; if you have downloaded multiple images in the vie@@ wers , you can go back from them before and back by using the keys image high and image . you can go to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and end . these functions are also available from the context menu . &quot;
if several images are loaded in the viewer you can run it as di@@ lem@@ ma . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then you can press a new image after a few seconds . how often it can press a new image by pressing the Ctr@@ l button and Plus or Min@@ us . it is stopped by the buttons Ctr@@ l ; S .
a very useful capability of the beh@@ older from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; can be used in full @-@ mode mode . in this mode the viewer uses the entire place on the screen . simply use the entry button to change in full @-@ screen mode and back .
if you use the viewer you can use the picture in the picture and pull out . with the Min@@ us key you can move r@@ aus@@ zo@@ om@@ t into the middle of the image . shows how a zoom rect@@ angle marked and shows the result of the zoom .
&quot; with the point key you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not shown zo@@ om@@ t . with the equ@@ itable key is called the Zo@@ oms , allowing each pixel to the screen to a pixels of the image . &quot;
note that the only zo@@ om@@ oper@@ ations they work with videos that are in and removable with the Plus@@ - and Min@@ ust@@ aste .
with the shooting functions from the context menu you can turn the picture . this does not work with videos . you can also make notes on the current picture with the menu item notes from the context menu .
&quot; if you look at images , you can see a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten in the picture . in the moment you can download the picture and configuration dialog of the image to mark these names , but you will only consider the picture to mark and see more pictures . &quot;
&quot; another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to see the images on paper . to see what photos you want to start using the pictures and select it as good or bad , while you see one according to the other . &quot;
&quot; for the two examples above gives you the ob@@ server the opportunity to push images with characteristics , while you see . features are the letters A to Z and you can put a feature that you can see the appropriate letters . in view it is a picture where the features A , B and C are set . &quot;
&quot; once you have set the features on your pictures , these are available to you in your browser . if you have all the pictures you edit , print or whatever you want to use the selected images to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do . &quot;
&quot; categories and special features can be displayed in the pre @-@ view view , then you can see features in D@@ re pre@@ views , then you can see features for the feature once the picture was selected . this can be seen here : &quot;
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case allows you to paint &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; on the picture to paint .
the mixture will not be saved with the image but in the database .
&quot; in , you can see a picture on the ground . to turn off the Mal@@ mo@@ dus of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; turn on the picture from the context menu . to end the M@@ als , simply press the cross at the toolbar top of the window . &quot;
&quot; to work with &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; do not have to master the application of the program &amp; Pov@@ ray ; not completely domin@@ ate , but the documentation about &amp; Pov@@ ray ; should you be read and understood . &quot;
&quot; in the object tree , you can select single objects . then their properties are shown in the object properties and the object in the wire mod@@ ell@@ - views yellow . &quot;
&quot; you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the object of an already selected object , since all sub@@ objects are already selected with the object . &quot;
&quot; to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position that you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the toolbar or select a menu item in the menu . &quot;
&quot; are there multi @-@ possible positions , the following over@@ lap menu is mounted , so that you can choose the right position : &quot;
&quot; with delet@@ ing either from the menu bar under edit or from the context menu of the right button , you can previously remove selected objects from the scene . &quot;
&quot; if you have changed properties , click Ap@@ ply to take these changes . do you have invalid values , then you can click on users with a error description . then you can click the input error and again to users with Cancel . &quot;
&quot; if you enter the path to &amp; Pov@@ ray ; -@@ User &apos;s documentation in the interior dialog , you can call the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; reference to the quoted object with help . &quot;
&quot; you need the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this property . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user &apos;s documentation . &quot;
&quot; if you edit a texture or a part of a texture , you can see a preview in the peculi@@ ar view . &quot;
&quot; click on preview in the peculi@@ ar view and a small example of the scene will be selected with the chosen texture , even if you want to have a sub@@ ordin@@ ated element ( for example a texture within a text @-@ map and not the entire text @-@ map ) , crossing locally on . &quot;
the screen@@ shots shows the check@@ points of the camera . you can draw these check@@ points with the mouse button and thereby change the position and direction of the camera .
&quot; when a transformation will disappear , the control points and it will display a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the centre for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shif@@ ts . you can change the shift by drag@@ ging with the mouse within the entire window . &quot;
each object has a refle@@ cting level . you can specify this value relative to the view of the above @-@ level object or as absolute value . objects are only shown if they are selected or their view @-@ contra@@ cting smaller or equal in the toolbar selected by the scene .
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; has a window rules as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are displayed on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
&quot; if you do not like the standard Window , or if you need any other arrangement , you can set them as required . you can also store multiple shut@@ down and easily switch between different regulations . &quot;
&quot; to anchor a window on or under a point view , drag the beginning to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle then shows the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the beginning to the right or left side of a view . the new view is mounted on the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height . &quot;
&quot; if you would like to arrange several views of each other , drag the beginning to another view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the Kart@@ e@@ ik@@ art@@ en@@ ite top in the views . &quot;
&quot; the last possible window rules are spl@@ itting views : views , which are not listed in the main window . to view a view from anch@@ oring , drag the beginning to the work@@ space or click the small to the left top of the arrow button in the beginning bar . &quot;
&quot; to close a view , click on the small cross at the initial bar . to prevent the closing , click the small square between arrow and cross . &quot;
you can insert additional views to the main window . in the menu View you will find entries for any type of views . new views are p@@ ending you can anchor them at any position .
&quot; the current window view can save you with view window , store . it will be a dialog in which you can store the window rules under an existing or new name . &quot;
&quot; if you have created a scene , you can ren@@ dering it . &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for ren@@ dering , this program must be installed properly . as this manual was written in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 is not supported . &quot;
&quot; to ren@@ dering the current scene , click on the icon Ren@@ dering The icon Ren@@ dering in the toolbar or select the menu item . &quot;
&quot; a R@@ ender mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; Pov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of the ren@@ dering . if you want to insert a scene in different sizes and quality levels , you can insert a number of R@@ ender modes , from a quick preview of up to full range of highest quality . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the icon of the render settings in the toolbar , or select the menu View R@@ ender Mo@@ di ... , the following dialogue will be opened : &quot;
&quot; each one mode has a name . you can enter any name in any name , but it is a name that can recognize the properties of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in the card size , you can insert the width and height of the spac@@ ed image . if you want to take only a small area of the image , select the box section and enter the image section to ren@@ dering the input fields . &quot;
&quot; in combination @-@ field quality you can select the characteristics , the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; for ren@@ ders . this goes from a very simple colour and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user refle@@ ctions . a detailed description of the R@@ ender properties can be found in the user manual . &quot;
&quot; if a picture with only one ray depending on the pixels , there are many mistakes in curves and lines , sometimes details are not shown if they are smaller than one pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing . &quot;
&amp; Pov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of this error . generally we see pictures with this property better .
&quot; when you switch anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calculated and connects and Pov@@ ray ; more than one ray per pixel . this technique is called super @-@ sam@@ pling . &quot;
&amp; Pov@@ ray ; supports two methods of great sam@@ pling . as standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ re@@ cur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because the super sam@@ pling method is adap@@ tive and adap@@ tive because every pixel is increasing and adap@@ tive because the record of rep@@ uted color is dependent on . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the first method , follow POV @-@ Ray a ray depending on pixels . if the difference between the color values are covered with super @-@ sam@@ pling , then both pixels are calculated by the persecution of a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sam@@ pling . if you are calculated by the persecution of a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sam@@ pling . if you pay the low@@ ering of 4x4 additional points , with a depth value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then : &quot;
diff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; the re@@ cur@@ sive method starts with 4 beams per pixel . if the difference between the color , the pre @-@ given thres@@ hold , then the pixel rate is divided into 4 sub@@ pixel , which can be followed individually and set to further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the cage can be set with the low@@ ering . &quot;
&quot; another possibility to reduce al@@ asing effect is the production of rust@@ ling for the ray process , called J@@ itter@@ ing . if you turn J@@ itter@@ ing , altered &amp; Pov@@ ray ; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
the last setting for quality of the ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use re@@ flex@@ ion . this is an experimental property of &amp; Pov@@ ray ; the diff@@ use of light reflection . it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property .
&quot; on this card @-@ card , you can set whether the alpha channels are calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixels is transparent , if the corresponding rays have no object made . &quot;
&quot; opens a new window for the display of the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; con@@ soles issue . if &amp; Pov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly , you can find the reason for this . &quot;
&quot; to import a &amp; Pov@@ ray ; -@@ scene to import the menu item import , and select a file in the dialog window . &quot;
&quot; currently , &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er does not support the full command of &amp; Pov@@ ray ; if in import@@ ing error messages or warnings , a dialog window displays a list of all messages . &quot;
if you do not support source text in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; write this source text between the two special comments / / * P@@ MR@@ aw@@ Beg@@ in and / / * P@@ MR@@ aw@@ End .
&quot; you can draw objects from the object tree in the editor to export the source text for &amp; Pov@@ ray . this adds to the source text in the editor to import the text file in the editor , simply highlight the source text in the editor and drag it into the object tree . &quot;
with copying and paste in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor lets you insert source code for &amp; Pov@@ ray .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called if &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ dering . usually this is Pov@@ ray or x @-@ Pov@@ ray .
&quot; if you click on the help in the peculi@@ ar view , opens &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; user documentation to the quoted object . ask the path to your document@@ ing and the version . supports the versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 . &quot;
&quot; Pov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example elevation data ) in the paths to the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; -@@ libraries . if you include files that do not enter into the folder of the scene , you also need the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found is used . &quot;
the second color for the wi@@ red models . the second color is used for viewing the selected objects .
the second color for the check@@ points . the second color is used for viewing the selected check@@ points .
the colour of the rect@@ angle for the view in the camera view and in the window type marks .
&quot; you can adjust the object of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set the R@@ aster separately for shif@@ ts , sc@@ aling and rot@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; larger values result in the exact wire model and therefore a better nails for the quoted objects , but require more time to ren@@ dering . for some objects such as the ball , you can set the details level for two directions . &quot;
&quot; if you merge High Detailed view for extended proje@@ ctions , all the wire @-@ views are used . advanced proje@@ ctions are all proje@@ ctions with exceptions to the perspective and per@@ pen@@ dic@@ ular proje@@ ctions . this property results in a better approach to proje@@ ctions , but requires more time to ren@@ dering . &quot;
if you can view wall the wall is depic@@ ted behind the objects . the wall is shown in a ch@@ ess@@ board pattern of two adjustable colors .
if you show ground floor a floor is depic@@ ted below the objects . the floor is shown in a ch@@ ess@@ board pattern of two adjustable colors .
&quot; if you activate cant@@ on , the non @-@ re@@ cur@@ sive Anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for ren@@ dering the scenes . the values for depth and moment@@ um can be set . more detailed information on parameters can be found in the paragraph R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di . &quot;
&quot; on this page you can change existing windows , or create new window regulations . in the section window , you can create window regulations and store . &quot;
the combination @-@ field standard window : displays all available shut@@ ters . &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window order at the start of the program .
the list of existing window regulations shows all existing window locations . a new order can be made using the button Add and delete a selected arrangement with the button .
each panel is identified by the name . the name must be clear and must not be empty .
the list under the name shows all views of the selected window rules . new views can be downloaded and delete selected views with the button .
&quot; with new column you create a new column on the right side of the existing windows , with Below the window below you will find a cart@@ o@@ ik@@ ar view together with the previous view and susp@@ ended the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window . &quot;
&quot; so you have just started &amp; Pov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; and now you would like to follow more detailed knowledge of the two programs . if you can follow all steps in this guidance , you should create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a bul@@ let on one layer . &quot;
&quot; but you should carefully consider the following warnings , before you decide to use it as a result only for a black screen . if you use a 3D program for first time , you should consider these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you do not set camera , no rules can be applied to ren@@ dering , as a result you get a black picture . &quot;
if you want to insert no light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you get only a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you have everything error @-@ free installed , take a look at the first start of &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; the following pre@@ set components : &quot;
&quot; take a little time to get the menus and the existing symbols of the toolbar . read the documentation that you can get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program . &quot;
&quot; you will need to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and also their application . &quot;
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide you first need to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and select the menu item . so you now have a scene without objects .
the wire model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene which you generate . especially notice the scene from the view of the camera . this is the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera . this is the result of the ren@@ der@@ ns of the scene .
&quot; the Object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , see the content of the view object , in which the various parameters of the camera will find . in the user &apos;s documentation about &amp; Pov@@ ray . &quot;
&quot; do not change anything to the basic settings of the camera , this is later changes , but note that the camera in the view control points , with which you can change the target point of camera . just click with the left mouse button on a check@@ point and drag it to the desired spot . &quot;
if you press the button user or press Enter to change the wire model and the object tree immediately according to these settings . as a result they see the scene from the point of view of the camera .
&quot; there are many possibilities to create the ground for the scene . you could add an Qu@@ ader ( Insert body Qu@@ ader ) and the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but that is an in@@ compreh@@ ensible method of solving this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; does actually offer an easy way . you can use an infinite plane as floor :
&quot; a good advice : choose the level in the object tree , change the name and press Enter . in the object tree , the new name is immediately displayed . &quot;
&quot; the classic model view now shows the level , even at the moment only as a limited end@@ point level . if you run the scene , the level will stretch down to the horizon . &quot;
&quot; if you look at the object tree , you will notice that you can click on the icon at the bottom of the object . in this case you can see the different parameters of the object . in this case you can see the different parameters of the object . in this case you can see the different parameters of the object . in this case you can see the different parameters of the object . in this case you can see the different parameters of the object . in this case you will see only the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . choose one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the object features . &quot;
&quot; in this scene you should move the floor to exercise a unit under the sky@@ line , just so that you can get to know some of these parameters . choose a shift and put the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; first , choose the ground to set up its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose something different from the moment . &quot;
in both cases a dialog opens in which you can choose how the object is inserted . please select the name object ( name = floor pigment ) with one click on the button preview you see how the pigment looks now .
&quot; of course , the preview of Pig@@ ments only shows a matt black material because you need to check settings for the pig@@ ments . therefore , you can always check the colors for the pigment . also there are many possibilities , but you now take the easiest . &quot;
if you look at the preview No color on Qu@@ ader and ball just click on the button user and then call the preview .
the material for the ground is now properly adjusted . if you have a picture with a click on the icon , you should get the following results : &quot;
&quot; of course , this is not the color . here you have to enter two new attributes . here you will have to type two new attributes . then edit this entry twice ( you can do so well , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
&quot; select in the Object tree , and change the colors in the view of the object features : &quot;
&quot; this step should you just be able to perform , since you should have understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; the ball is just as easy as the ground : &quot;
in the view of the object properties you can immediately change the settings . put the value for the radius : to 1 ( do not forget the ball contact with the ground . otherwise the ball would lie over the floor as you have moved the ground around a unit down .
&quot; of course , the ren@@ dering is now a strange result : how to see before , the ball @-@ surface appears like a matt black material . put in the following step a suitable material . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the ball , you can now point a material . as well as in the ground , give the ball a pigment as colour : &quot;
&quot; select the first object and change the name for example in the sphere of pig@@ ments . click on the sphere of Pig@@ ment , then select one @-@ coloured and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; but you can gain more interesting effects if you take the time , some finish characteristics : &quot;
then change the values like in the following screen@@ shots and click Ap@@ ply or press Enter .
&quot; the settings shine effect and reflection result already some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrom@@ ed surfaces , even if metal : not even selected : &quot;
you should now have a good impression of what possibilities to you &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; hopefully you have already learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ tracing is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
&quot; when you get a scene ra@@ y@@ trac@@ er , the ren@@ dering hyp@@ oth@@ et@@ ical rays from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera , which reflects the scenes ) through each pixels in the scene . the ration@@ ale effects are reflected in the scene and how atmospheric effects are discussed as such as fo@@ g . thus the scene is processed for pixels . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you will see without a camera nothing , the camera is your eye with which you see the scene . without a light source you will see nothing , the image is simply black . obviously , every scene needs to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
in the usual file dialog you can select your file . Pov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ inc .
opens a file . in standard file dialog you can select a file that you have previously with &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ;
&quot; whenever you open a new model or create , the file will be inserted into this sub@@ menu and replace the oldest entry in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you already saved the model already stored , it is stored under the same name . it is a new file , you have to enter a name and a storage space . &quot;
rest@@ ores the scene in the last stored version . all changes since the last storage will be rejected .
this menu item you can only select if you have not yet saved changes in the scene .
&quot; to repeat the last retro@@ fitting command . this menu item can only be chosen if you have used conversion . &quot;
&quot; saves the current window order and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new order , or write an existing arrangement . &quot;
&quot; in this menu you can find options for setting &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; , here you can change the appearance , the keyboard short@@ cuts and the default behavior . &quot;
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can change this option default for &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; instructions change or new ones .
opens a dialog to set up the tool@@ bars . you can add and remove this option Tool@@ symb@@ ole for &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ;
a B@@ ump map is an opportunity to apply smo@@ other surfaces without any loading on the surface individually and without changing the geomet@@ rical form of the object itself .
it is usual to use the same file for a B@@ ump map as well as for a texture map .
&quot; basic body are simple geomet@@ rical shapes , which you can use as modules : very complex 3D models are generated from do@@ z@@ ens or even hundreds of this ground@@ body . these models will then be processed to give them a realistic appearance . &quot;
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel base by using a picture file as a color card .
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a more comfortable picture @-@ looking and -@@ browser . the application has a file image in which you can select images for viewing .
images can either be displayed in a separate window in the size of the picture or in full @-@ screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is very simple . the file image lists files that you can display with Click the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the button return .
you can adjust if each image should be displayed in an own window or if all images should always use the same window .
&quot; if you are looking for a specific file , simply tap the first signs of the fil@@ ename in the right bottom . when a password file has been found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c . &quot;
&quot; in the dialogue - &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; there are five card types . in three of them , General and editing and slideshow , you can set the working method of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show . in the two other , short @-@ out for the browser , the keyboard short@@ cuts can be set for the respective windows . &quot;
&quot; if the image is not selected , then the pictures will be filled in full @-@ mode . if the image is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the sco@@ re@@ print is filled with the background color , which you can continue to set below . pres@@ etting is not a full @-@ screen mode . &quot;
&quot; this point is activated , invites &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; already the next picture in the folder , while you still see the current picture . this reduces the delay when you choose the next picture and is particularly suitable for a slideshow . &quot;
with this option saves &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; while finishing the name of the last opened folder . at the next start opens &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; this folder is in the browser window .
&quot; click on the colored beams to select a background color . this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in wind@@ owed mode the window is bigger than the picture , the background is filled with the selected color . &quot;
you can &amp; sp@@ ick@@ show ; so that only some of the file types can be displayed that the program can also be depic@@ ted .
this option will be enlarged for large images on the display screen on the full screen . this option is swit@@ ched as default .
specif@@ ies whether the slideshow is to start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
&quot; the time span between the image change in a slideshow . to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or the small arrows on the right next to the input field . the default is 3 seconds . &quot;
&quot; the number of repet@@ itions . this value is set to 0 , the slideshow is repeated until it is interrupted by the user . to enter the value , you can use a new value into the input field or the small arrows on the right next to the input field . the default is 1 . &quot;
change the keyboard short@@ cuts for the different modes of business cards ; in the cardboard boxes for the advertis@@ ment and short command for the browser .
this option allows you to switch between the two @-@ piece view of the files@@ ystem ( a window for the sub@@ folder and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the files@@ ystem with folders and files in a window .

&quot; the main window of &amp; show@@ photo , has a side@@ bar on the right edge , which provides you with important information and actions to the selected images . the same side@@ bar can also be found in the image processing . you can display this in which you click on one of the five riders : &quot;
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is a application for the scan of pictures that does not make more than pictures to sc@@ ans and pick up .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application to scan pictures which does not make more than pictures to scan and pick up the pictures immediately in a specified folder with automatically generated name and format . the user can also display the images from the chart .
you can check the status of the support of your scanner on the SAN@@ E project page : http : / / www.s@@ ane @-@ proje@@ ct@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; using the command sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner was not opened or if no default scanner is opened then a dialog to choose the scanner will be opened .
the user can select the scanner scanner and push OK to open the scanner .
the further settings contain more detailed options of the drivers . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) treated these options not particularly .
&quot; in order to get a picture , the user can only start a pre@@ ch@@ can and then start scanning area for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview Button . &quot;
to choose the picture can choose better the user into the picture and out of the current selection . he can also adjust the zoom that the complete preview in the window fits .
if the picture has been selected then the final image can be read with the scan button .
&quot; when the stor@@ ing a preview is selected in the settings , then the image is shown in a preview of how to see below , then the image will be saved and then leads to a break and you will get back into the main window . &quot;
through the button settings the ep@@ onymous dialog will be opened in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
&quot; the user can see the image if desired , prior to stor@@ ing . in this case the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview of the user is not required , then the option must be selected . &quot;
this setting allows them to select the type like &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; pictures stores the dialog in front of each one @-@ sc@@ anned image . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; these are automatically saved with a generated name in a previously defined folder then you have to ask them to ask without a fil@@ ename .
&quot; this setting defines where the images can be saved on the option without prior to a fil@@ ename , then this folder is used as default for dialogue on saving . the default is your home directory and you can change it with the button ... &quot;
&quot; this parameter defines a pre@@ fix for the automatically to save pictures and is beyond the proposed name for the image in dialog to save . it is automatically saved , if a picture is saved . the string # # is replaced by the numbers . &quot;
the user can custom@@ ize the quality quality . this value also changes the compression value when saved . if select the image quality is not selected , then the default value is used by Q@@ t . &quot;

you may need to set up existing Multimedia @-@ buttons so that it works as &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; -@@ short command . this makes your keyboard to &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; -@@ Control Centre .
&quot; the D@@ CO@@ P interface from Amar@@ ok has many general functions , which are mostly found in other KDE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context @-@ browser , players , playlist , play@@ lists , play@@ lists and scripts . &quot;
AM@@ AR@@ OK supports the command line options by Q@@ t and KDE ; . in addition , Amar@@ ok has still several own commands options . &quot;
&quot; you should give the user a feedback , if the script can be done because of a missing dependence . please check in your script whether all required modules are available and use them , so that the user may not run , why a script does not run . &quot;
begin 21 &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Er@@ ror error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( KDE binding for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ binding v@@ 3.4 is the for this script . &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; exit end
in the folder Scri@@ pts / DVDs you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can easily use it as a basis for your own script or simply add it to the required functions . you will quickly notice that the writing of scripts is relatively easy .
&quot; with the help of D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with amar@@ ok , and Amar@@ o@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the command of d@@ co@@ p ; that each KDE @-@ installation should be solved . &quot;
most script@@ ing languages allow the output of external programs and commands . in this way the function ex@@ ec can be called d@@ co@@ p &gt; relatively easy . here is an example in Python :
&amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; sends messages to all current scripts . for this reason scripts should constantly monitor their standard delivery and respond accordingly to events . of course a script can also ignore the events if there is no use for it .
&quot; configure the script to display the script dialog . to display the stor@@ ing and loading of the furnishings , each script will take care of each script . if a script will take care of your work@@ folder on the folder , where all data should be stored . &quot;
tr@@ ack@@ Change sign@@ aled that a new piece is played . the script could now be played &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions further information about the new piece ( for example the met@@ ad@@ ata or the st@@ akes ) .
vol@@ um@@ e@@ Change new@@ volume sign@@ alized a change of volume volume . the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100 .
&quot; custom@@ ize Cl@@ icked : Sub@@ menu item@@ Title Path@@ s dis@@ covers the path to the selected files of the playlist , if a custom menu item is also used to remove the D@@ CO@@ P function d@@ co@@ p AM@@ AR@@ OK script remo@@ ve@@ custom@@ izing Item ( Sub@@ menu item@@ eyer ) . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK , or if the user ends a script stops , sends &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M to do the script . this signal should be processed for example , the stor@@ ing data or configuration settings . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ oks script Administration can also install script packages that downloaded the user &amp; z@@ b ; such packages can be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ b@@ z@@ 2 ) , which can also be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ b@@ z@@ 2 ) , so that the user can clearly recognize the archive as the Amar@@ ok script package . &quot;
&amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; 1.3 is only accept script packages with the extension amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason you should use your script packages right .
&quot; the main script must be execut@@ able ( + x ) , the remaining to lad@@ der modules should not be execut@@ able . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file right : &quot;
&quot; if your script is ready , you can watch it at www.k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.org and the link to the W@@ iki script page of &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; for your entry on KDE @-@ apps you should use the category AM@@ AR@@ OK ; script . &quot;
&amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; is an audio player for &amp; KDE ; . &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; has many useful and powerful functions and is still surprisingly simple to use .
&quot; with &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK , you can simply drag music to the playlist instead of endless menus instead of thousands in your collection . with &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; &apos;s collecting browser and the quick search you will find the piece within seconds . &quot;
&quot; maybe you have already decide some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which you want to hear ? then the play@@ lists is still hard to select the dynamic mode and the intelligent play@@ lists automatically select the right music for certain criteria . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ AR@@ OK has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers IF@@ P and many generic USB devices . &quot;
&quot; usually , one must enter the folder of the Amar@@ ok sources to comp@@ ile the folder to comp@@ ile Amar@@ ok and install : &quot;
&quot; because &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake , you should not comp@@ ile in the comp@@ ile . if you encounter problems , please report these to the following &amp; KDE ; ma@@ iling lists . &quot;
&amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; does like most applications enable some options to activate or dis@@ able the comp@@ ile script using the configure script . this is a list of available options .
some of the compilation options must be filled with certain depend@@ encies in order to use them . details can be found in the section system requirements .
&quot; activated Debug@@ ging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you would like to help with the development of &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; you should have full use . &quot;
&amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; can be set up without effort on the design dialog . the interior dialog has several kart@@ cards to set up the various functions of &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ;
player window displays the player window in addition to the playlist or out . if the option is swit@@ ched on the option is only the play@@ lists .
vot@@ ing bar@@ ometer use : this function is only available if &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; with support for mo@@ od@@ d . the option swit@@ ched the experimental function of the voice @-@ bar@@ ometer .
&quot; atmospheric : this feature is only available , if &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; with support for mo@@ od@@ d , this function is used for mo@@ ods for the voice @-@ bar@@ ometer . &quot;
&quot; tun@@ es files in the music files : this feature is only available if &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; the .@@ mood files in the memory folder of the respective music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files in the settings folder of &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; stored ( normally ~ / .@@ k@@ en / share / apps / AM@@ AR@@ OK / mo@@ od@@ bar / ) . &quot;
external browser : lets you choose which browser is required by &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; if a browser is required .
&quot; other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser , which is not in the list below . &quot;
playlist by saving the current playlist automatically stor@@ ing the current playlist automatically at the end of &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; . enable this option if you want to lose the running playlist when you do not want to lose the current playlist .
&quot; relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : if you activate this setting , is used &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the storage location of the playlist , otherwise the absolute position of the music files are stored . &quot;
current piece can be visible in the piece of change that the play@@ lists @-@ window - / ab@@ rolls to keep the current piece always in the visible window .
&quot; switching to the context @-@ browser , automatically displays the context @-@ browser as soon as the next piece is played . &quot;
in the section image you can custom@@ ize &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; s appearance . the section is divided into three parts sub@@ section .
&quot; in the fonts section you can use the use of different fonts in &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; you can select fonts for the following area : play@@ lists windows , player @-@ window and context @-@ browser . press files , so you can select a desired font out of the selection dialog . &quot;
with the selection of user @-@ defined colour sch@@ ema you have the qu@@ al of choice and can set your own shade . use them below for front and background color .
&quot; continue playing at the start , that &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; after the program start playing automatically with the piece in the place , with which it was stopped by the end . &quot;
the sub@@ window on @-@ screen display allows you to use the Swit@@ ching of the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display is displayed , a preview of the O@@ SD display and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview . &quot;
the first option is the font . click select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the An@@ ter@@ feld shade causes that the text is sh@@ aded in O@@ SD .
&quot; own colors use the opportunity to adapt the O@@ SD colors for Script@@ ures and background . a click on the Far@@ b areas opens the dialog to the color selection . if you use your colors are not activated , the default &amp; KDE colors are used . &quot;
the input field display text sets the text displayed in the O@@ SD text . by using plac@@ hal@@ tern the O@@ SD can be adjusted to your needs . below you can find a list of available plac@@ ements and what they mean .
the option screen is intended for X@@ in@@ ama user . so you can commit to which display of a multi @-@ monitor environment the O@@ SD will appear .
the card @-@ card audio @-@ output lets you select a audio driver from the selection box . some drivers will enable further settings in this cart@@ oons .
the card collection is used for setting up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
&quot; here you can select the folder , select &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; after music files , select the c@@ ified field next to its name . this section also contains links to the collection , as well as with the selected folders . &quot;
sub@@ folder re@@ cur@@ sive : this means that &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; both the cru@@ c@@ ified and their sub@@ folder as well as their sub@@ folder to music .
&quot; changes : enables &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; to monitor the selected folder on changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) , in order to make the necessary changes to your collection . &quot;
play@@ lists : causes that &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; all found play@@ lists into your collection folder ( .@@ pl@@ - and .m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection is then later in the play@@ lists .
the part of collecting database is used to choose a database for the collection . the combination @-@ field driver : allows you to choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ ql . if My@@ S@@ ql is not necessary to set up in the sub@@ window My@@ S@@ ql institution .
&quot; the section My@@ S@@ ql @-@ setup is used for setting up the database for &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; below calcul@@ ator , the computer is entered , which is accessible under port : the network port . name : is the user database which is connected to which the connection is established . &quot;
use username : and password : to enter the data for the connection to the database .
the card @-@ card last@@ .@@ f@@ m is supporting the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; can be the name of played st@@ resses at a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece .
&quot; here , enter your username and password for your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you have no profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website . &quot;
split pieces and to update the profile : this setting allows it &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
&quot; similar interpre@@ ters de@@ viation : after activation of this setting , &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; a list with similar interpre@@ ters used to score . note : you can not require the list in the context of your browser . note : you do not require a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this feature . &quot;
&amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; is a audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . further information can be found in the summary of functions and gallery with screen@@ shots .
&quot; AM@@ AR@@ OK only needs the package box and otherwise no further KDE packages . you have to install K@@ del@@ ib@@ s ( including the programs contained therein , because &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; we need a small guide on how to compiled K@@ del@@ ib@@ s minimal . &quot;
&quot; some features such as the O@@ SD will set out that your window manager holds the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . we try to support AM@@ AR@@ OK on all platforms , therefore we use K@@ del@@ ib@@ s and Q@@ t , because these are an excellent development environment . &quot;
&quot; probably one of your files will take a bug in the Tag@@ li@@ b library to days . you can view the file by clicking in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / AM@@ AR@@ OK / collection _ scan@@ .@@ log . after that , you can delete the file and create the collection again . &quot;
mostly that Tag@@ lib is short@@ ened by reading the met@@ a @-@ info from this file . please report this bug to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers under bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; if you use MySQL as a database , then try SQ@@ Lite . the support for this in &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; is something mature . &quot;
&quot; sure that all of &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; used libraries with the same comp@@ iler version . if you have compiled libraries with the same comp@@ iler version . if you were compiled by GCC 3.4 , Tag@@ li@@ b but with GCC 3.@@ 3.@@ x . &quot;
&quot; when you use KDE with art@@ s@@ d , then de@@ activate automatic . dis@@ able when in@@ active for ... in the setting of sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second . &quot;
you can also send us the Bac@@ kt@@ race by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail will automatically open on a crash ) . if it is a common b@@ aking race and send us a good store .
&quot; this is because a lot of program may write data as U@@ TF @-@ 8 into the met@@ a @-@ info , but not as Un@@ ico@@ de . the following Perl script fixes the problem . &quot;
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l die &quot; The file $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ pl@@ ib ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ pl@@ ib@@ - &gt; new ( $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ) ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ pl@@ ib@@ - &gt; new ( $ arg@@ v &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ day ) ;
this script requires Perl @-@ module MP3 : : M@@ pl@@ ib . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ pl@@ ib &apos;
&amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; s symbols in the status bar ( random playlist ) see KDE 3.@@ 4.0 always active . this is a well known error in KDE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes the symbol@@ ism can be easily forgotten . this can be found in some cases up to three times on a symbol until this setting shows their effect .
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : amar@@ ok@@ app : amar@@ ok@@ app : Un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map then please check whether AM@@ AR@@ OK is the correct Q@@ t library . this can be found with ld@@ d &apos;@@ which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BAR _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
&quot; to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ded Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf that AM@@ AR@@ OK is the right version first . &quot;
there are some possibilities . most installation processes are clear by the help of a expert your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or the developers . you can also use the forum and IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ de@@ .net in the channel # AM@@ AR@@ OK .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help to search . please enter there only one error when you find a bug in AM@@ AR@@ OK .
after the start of &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; only a blank playlist does not appear there ?
this is simple . use the file text on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files in the right part of the playlist .
&quot; to keep the surface intuit@@ ively , the start window has been converted into the Stat@@ istics window . you will find it under extr@@ as statistics . &quot;
the meaning of these symbols have been changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for the evaluation by the user while the points are automatically calculated .
&quot; to evaluate pieces , must be displayed in the playlist , click the title bar of the playlist and select column review . click somewhere into the new conversion column to set the review for a piece . &quot;
&quot; select the files that you want to remove , and then click on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then select from play@@ lists from the item menu . &quot;
&quot; drag a playlist file with the mouse in the playlist , and let them fall there , just like you would make it with other files . so simple is : - ) &quot;
&quot; in the toolbar of the playlist , right next to the add @-@ button , the button playlist is stored . click on it . &quot;
probably the program x@@ m@@ ms @-@ config . install the package x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel and install &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; new . also look after lib@@ visual , this package contains a lot of very nice visu@@ alis@@ ations . &quot;
the equ@@ al@@ izer can be reached in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) .
&quot; no . yes , that really is true ! no ! &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; used to support G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we are supporting so pretty every just conce@@ iv@@ able audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even support text and PNG ! &quot;
&quot; perhaps you use Fed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which will be supplied with any MP3 @-@ decades ( from patent legal reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F2 , g@@ g : Red@@ Hat mp3 KDE , input &quot;
start the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . well ... &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; plays MP3 &apos;s from : - )
&quot; if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa @-@ S@@ ink , the device must provide a bl@@ ender . a bl@@ ender allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and can be reached by the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) . &quot;
the issue of this command should help you find the problem of problem and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer you may need to specify another sex@@ ink ( e.g. os@@ ss@@ ink ) .
&quot; sorry &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; already . do not forget that media must first de@@ co@@ ded . G@@ Stre@@ amer is the best choice when you are looking for a decade or little over@@ head . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ co@@ ded them and sends the PCM @-@ data to AL@@ SA . exactly like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
X@@ M@@ MS de@@ co@@ ded the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can give directly to AL@@ SA just as well as x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open control Centre Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable the size of the Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System ( warning ; see the next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ sw@@ rap@@ per su@@ id is set to :
&quot; with KDE 3.@@ 2.@@ X there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia co@@ dec@@ s , which can cause enhanced reproduction . read this error report . read this error report . the enlarge of the sound @-@ Pu@@ ff@@ ers in your AL@@ SA @-@ file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help well . &quot;
&quot; either you do not use the Arts driver , but instead of G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install KDE @-@ Multimedia completely to get the faster Arts co@@ dec@@ s ( lib@@ arts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; probably use the Arts driver . use a different driver ( the x@@ ine driver was optimized for Analy@@ zer ) , or reduce the size of the Arts buff@@ ers in the control center and sound &amp; Multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buff@@ al@@ lo@@ ys . yes , this is a mistake , please help us to fix it . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , cr@@ ashes &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK . why ? &quot;
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer you need to register all components . run G@@ ST register to register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if this does not help you can ask the IR@@ C channel # g@@ stre@@ amer .
try this ( finish AM@@ AR@@ OK before ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg out , comp@@ ile and install it . run G@@ ST register as well as your usual user . delete all ff@@ m@@ peg files ( you will find the module folder with G@@ ST @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer files ) and run G@@ ST register . &quot;
please report it in bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de.@@ org. if you have a full list of suggestions / wishes please send them to our ma@@ iling list : AM@@ AR@@ OK @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ s@@ ource@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; is an album of the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very and find that the name sounds good . also includes the name the magic K ... : )
thanks D@@ CO@@ P is that already possible . put an alert in your calendar program and execute the alarm on this command : d@@ co@@ p AM@@ AR@@ OK player play
&quot; this command lets you start playing &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; run safely that &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; run before you go to bed , then you will let the gentle killing of the music you stopped in front of the bed . &quot;
how can I find out the current in &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; current title if you are on another computer ?
if a working SSH environment is present you can proceed as follows . Diesel command gives you interpre@@ t and titles of the current piece of : SSH -@@ I ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ R@@ SA ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user su@@ re@@ user name AM@@ AR@@ OK player now@@ Pl@@ aying
replace IP address with your IP and your username . this puts ahead that your identification in the file ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ R@@ SA is available .
&quot; the visu@@ alis@@ ations can be separated from &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; window , click on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent , in the size changeable window . &quot;
the combination of Ctr@@ l + rights mouse button puts a piece in the queue into the queue . by pressing the intervention on a search in the playlist will be played the first search results and search the search .
&quot; OK , the player window and the playlist have tr@@ icky features , but what about the icon in the system section of the control system ? &quot;
&quot; click with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; on the title of a browser . in the context menu , you can select which browsers are to be displayed . &quot;
my personal folder $ HO@@ ME is on a NFS drive . after the start of AM@@ AR@@ OK the collection database cannot be created and on the console will appear many trou@@ bles . what now ?
&quot; the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; does not work with NFS . either you have to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / AM@@ AR@@ OK to a local drive , or use amar@@ o@@ K@@ s MySQL @-@ Support . &quot;
&quot; put the CD then click on Audio CD . it opens a file browser with multiple folders . to normal reading , select a few pieces and drag them into the desired folder in a con@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic enco@@ ding instead , take files from folders mp3 or og@@ g . &quot;
&quot; Q@@ Str@@ ing@@ List values = query ( Q@@ String ( &quot; SELE@@ CT play@@ counter , creat@@ ed@@ ate , &quot; F@@ ROM statistics &quot; &quot; W@@ HERE ur@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; &quot; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( escap@@ e@@ string ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; basically this fits the previous assessment with a decre@@ asing value , based on how often the piece was played . the more often the piece was played , the less influence has every single rating on the total result . &quot;
&quot; you can click the review for a piece of yourself by clicking on a sp@@ alt@@ en@@ script in the playlist window . then , you can select the review of a piece as well as all other attributes , by clicking on the piece and edit . &quot;
the developers do not want to present to you when you want to publish a stable version of AM@@ AR@@ OK . this means that KDE packages have a fixed publishing plan of the AM@@ AR@@ OK .
&quot; this is a new feature in AM@@ AR@@ OK , but some users can also find anno@@ ying . dis@@ able the option icon at the playback animated in the general settings . &quot;
the Analy@@ zer is part of the toolbar . select settings and take the desired changes before .
&quot; download a design and create your own . install this then under AM@@ AR@@ OK ... Ap@@ pear@@ ance context @-@ Browser @-@ Design , click on new design .... &quot;
the symbol was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ quest@@ .com ) to avoid difficulties it was removed .
&quot; con@@ quer@@ ors navig@@ ational area allows you to view monitoring and control of &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; while you can display con@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to display the navigation area . then click on the button settings ( the top ) and select &quot; &quot; Add AM@@ AR@@ OK &quot; . &quot; &quot;
audio osc@@ rob@@ bler is a free service to be sent to the information that will be played on an independent server . the service is free and you only need a free user name and a password . Audi@@ osc@@ rob@@ bler is completely supported by &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ;
&quot; if you want to use AL@@ SA , then please use the latest available version . old AL@@ SA versions have caused a lot of waste and hence a lot of error reports . &quot;
&quot; probably it was installed &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; compiled , before you have x@@ ine or g@@ stre@@ amer . therefore , the / configure routine does not comp@@ ile this output modules . you need to configure and install it . &quot;
&quot; now I have &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; new installed , but the output modules appear still not . and now ? &quot;
&quot; probably , use a distribution that is installed from the actual program . although G@@ Stre@@ amer are installed , the same applies to x@@ ine , you have to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . afterwards , you need to re@@ comp@@ ile and install it . &quot;
I get the mistake G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ Crit@@ ical * * : factory for &apos; ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How can I fix it ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer was compiled with Pre@@ cision that is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you have to comp@@ ile G@@ Stre@@ amer without Pre@@ cision . a tip of Merlin @-@ TC : use no L@@ DF@@ LAG@@ S if you comp@@ ile AM@@ AR@@ OK .
I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s m@@ imet@@ ype au@@ dia / mp@@ 4 although the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed .
&quot; to play mp@@ 4 or M4@@ A files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , must also be installed at g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad also the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ qu@@ ic@@ kt@@ ime . &quot;
you get the error There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s m@@ imet@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
you play a MP3 stream and the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ mad is not installed . install the module and then run as a system for@@ ter G@@ ST register . then start AM@@ AR@@ OK .
I have a second sound@@ card and use AL@@ SA . how can I use AM@@ AR@@ OK the second sound@@ card ?
&quot; under settings AM@@ AR@@ OK ... Audio @-@ Edition enter the device . typically , e.g. H@@ W : 0 for the standard sound@@ card and H@@ W : 1 for the second . &quot;
here you can see an example for ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with a on@@ board AC@@ 97 codec and a USB audio device :
pc@@ m.@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type plug sl@@ av@@ e.@@ p@@ cm &quot; H@@ W : 0 } pc@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type plug sl@@ av@@ e.@@ p@@ cm &quot; H@@ W : 1 &quot; } ct@@ l@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type H@@ W card 1 }
&quot; in the design dialog of x@@ ine now us@@ b @-@ audio , and the output takes place on the USB @-@ sound@@ card . so @-@ lib takes care of the conversion of the scan@@ rate , channels and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , de@@ activate the h@@ oses by sound@@ card . &quot;
&quot; sorry , but the audio output with Arts will not continue to take care of . you may course take this issue of course to your hand ! if you want , you can choose the new as urgently needed car@@ eg@@ iver for Arts : ) &quot;
&quot; listen to music should be quite simple ! for this reason there is the interior assist@@ ants , which at the first start of &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; if you do not like your collection , then this quick start @-@ guide will be a help . with their help you will be set up with their help you &amp; AM@@ AR@@ OK ; in a few minutes . &quot;
&quot; when creating a playlist is very easy . draw the mouse entries from the collection page in the playlist , so you can see something in the text@@ box . if you are using the playlist , you can save it with the help of the button playlist , you can save this button in the toolbar of the play@@ lists . &quot;
&quot; if you have your own play@@ lists , you can add this to the playlist browser . if the playlist is activated in the folder of your collection , and you will find the option to import play@@ lists . with a right @-@ click on a playlist , you can find various possibilities , as the playlist should be loaded . &quot;
&quot; to play an audio CD , select a file browser with multiple folders and the CD @-@ pieces in WAV format . drag the WAV files in the playlist and press the button . &quot;

&quot; to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions to use , you can either use the command line program d@@ co@@ p , or the somewhat more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are crucial in the functioning of the function , so it is more likely to give your taste and the type of your tasks . &quot;
in this chapter we take on that you use the command line program d@@ co@@ p . to make use of the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; you have to make sure you have to make sure &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; then enter something like the following at the console :
&quot; besides the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; -@@ functions , all &amp; KDE ; -@@ program have been painted , supported &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts that are described below . &quot;
&quot; the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface from &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions such as cop@@ y@@ CD , format DVD and other features for generating new projects . &quot;
D@@ CO@@ P@@ ref cre@@ ate@@ c CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ ref cre@@ ate@@ c DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ ref cre@@ ate@@ c DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) void cop@@ y@@ C@@ d ( ) void cop@@ y@@ C@@ d ( ) void bur@@ y@@ C@@ d ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ vd@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you can create a project about the command line : # K@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project by means of # d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project D@@ urch using this reference is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proje@@ ct@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proje@@ ct@@ Interface and the high @-@ performance K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proje@@ ct@@ Interface which is applicable only to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name ) void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String ) void Lost Ur@@ l ( Q@@ String ) void remo@@ ve@@ Item ( Q@@ String path ) void remo@@ ve@@ Item ( Q@@ String path ) void set@@ ve@@ Item ( Q@@ String path ) void set@@ Vol@@ um@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String )
&quot; with this , it is possible to fill out a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , multiple folder and add files into the new folder : &quot;
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der foo d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der foo d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ect / some@@ fil@@ e.@@ txt / foo / bar
&amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ Sel@@ er for &amp; KDE ; it can be easily read and stored in MP@@ 3- or OGG files . also other formats are possible depending on enc@@ oder on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; is the user interface of cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for the reading of &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on disk ) and by many co @-@ enco@@ ders ( press release ) are still supported by the Linux distribution ( press release ) . additional co@@ operations can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
&quot; first , the titles of the &amp; CD ; read and stored in WAV files on the computer ( left @-@ free and compressed ) ; and then &quot;
&quot; in a second step these WAV files ( usually one title ) compressed to the MP@@ 3- or OGG format , or in other formats such as the loss @-@ free FLA@@ C . &quot;
&quot; for the first step , the reading of the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must now be done . &quot;
&quot; for the second step l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , O@@ gg@@ Vor@@ bis ( for OGG ) or other co @-@ operations are already available , it is therefore very likely not necessary to comp@@ ile for any Linux distrib@@ utions . however , it is not necessary to be comp@@ ile for any Linux distrib@@ utions , but it is not necessary to be used for example FLA@@ C , its installation is not necessary . &quot;
&quot; which enco@@ ding / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer is a small introduction over Ko@@ di@@ erer , audio quality and compression factors . &quot;
&quot; a word about copying audio CD ; s : as mentioned , used &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read the audio data from the &amp; CD . if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; the program is not possible to avoid a protected audio CD . &quot;
&quot; while the set @-@ up only has to be carried out ( the interior dialog , but so often called for a suitable configuration has been found ) , the daily handling is explained to read a &amp; CD ; this leads to the understanding of the slim approach to the user interface , which you may be proud of the beginning . &quot;
&quot; can convert into many formats - depending on which co@@ di@@ erer are installed ( MP3 , OGG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) &quot;
&quot; can &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB from the Internet , or can work completely without network , whereby everything is recorded manually . &quot;
this is only a brief list of the commands of the main window . on the page step for step example contains more information how this program is used as well as screen@@ shots of the tab for the configuration of the program .
&quot; starts the CD@@ DB request of the CD @-@ data according to the setup of request in the tab CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be locally or online , in the latter case the connection must first be produced to the Internet . ) &quot;
starts reading and - if an enc@@ oder is configured in the tab of co@@ di@@ ment settings in the furnishings - the co@@ ding .
opens a sub@@ menu with a list of available Enc@@ oder so that the selection can be read with another enc@@ oder as the default settings . it is to note that previously the enc@@ oder settings are configured in dialog with dialog box .
opens the files@@ ystem so that an already selected file will be selected instead of a complete &amp; CD ; read and co@@ ding .
opens the design dialog to configure the type of not@@ ifications ( like prot@@ ocols , Pie@@ p@@ sen ) for program events ( like reading the &amp; CD ; finished ) . &quot;
opens the main dialog dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; with various kart@@ cards ( like Enc@@ oder , for the setup of the En@@ co@@ ders ) . here you need to go before the program can be successfully used ! &quot;
this chapter describes key quality , co@@ di@@ erer and compression @-@ rates and helps you in choosing the right enco@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information is lost , there is a left @-@ free audio format required . besides FLA@@ C there are also other such as &quot; hormone &quot; or &quot; monkey &quot; which may be available for this distribution . the cons are the low compression rates and barely available commercial devices that can re@@ produce these files . &quot;
&quot; among the audio formats , the information generated by data com@@ press according to their p@@ sycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and OGG , today may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 kb@@ ps ) , but above these bit@@ rate the differences will generate very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; O &apos; not so &apos; free , l@@ ame will still be delivered free with most distrib@@ utions , but there are open license questions &quot;
&quot; + high up to very high key quality ( with high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to OGG slightly deeper quality in deeper bit@@ rates . &quot;
OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or a computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG playback is available .
&quot; MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special car stereo systems . today - initially in 2009 - support these devices mostly only the MP3 format . &quot;
a short list of parameters for audio @-@ quality and the resulting com@@ pressors for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos; --@@ pre@@ set medium &apos; = This setting results in good transparency for most people and most of the music
&quot; --@@ pre@@ set standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer transparency for most people and most musicians accepted transparency , and has quite high quality . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 kb@@ ps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 kb@@ ps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pre@@ set extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 kb@@ ps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . needs always 256 kb@@ ps for complex and less complex pieces of a titles . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos; = 128 kb@@ ps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate approximately 11 128 kb@@ ps for all pieces of a titles . good gene for music of young people , portable devices and car facilities . but not good enough for better Hi@@ Fi stereo systems . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pre@@ set Ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ kb@@ ps C@@ BR . this setting will be ex@@ agger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want the absolute highest quality without regard to the file size , then select this setting . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; CD ; information , the manually entered or replaced by the free@@ DB via the Internet , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can also pass / k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; and the co@@ ding program to create the folder and file name , as well as the properties of the music files . &quot;
&quot; in connection with enco@@ ding programs , there is often a combination of programming settings for the co@@ operations and these parameters here . the manual or the help of the enco@@ ders explain the switch for these programmes . &quot;
&quot; e.g. around the &amp; CD ; titles to the keywords ( English : day ) add to MP@@ 3@@ s with l@@ ame , the switches must be added by l@@ ame and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; the result looks like : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; . &quot;
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; parameters that can be used ( = button recording in assist@@ ants ) :
&quot; this is what the free@@ DB is : a free database in which people can read the audio CDs , so that all the other information can be downloaded from yourself in the computer : &amp; CD ; title , artist , names of the pieces &amp; etc ; not by the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal but I am not an attor@@ ney . however , no one can prevent it from the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so no more information or less worth@@ less , so no information can be added to the artist or CD ; business , physically or virtu@@ oso . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; is an active part of an address ( sending an address ) . for the use of free@@ DB can be used with another ( fake ) address when used in the system . in this type of configuration , the email address is not used by the server ( This may only the programmer know who has checked the code . ) &quot;
&quot; in many countries , there are copies of the main database . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; used to use free@@ DB , the geographical range is to be used in the network and is bal@@ ances the load between the computers . &quot;
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mir@@ rors for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information throughout the reading of a &amp; CD ; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which out@@ sourcing program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ors that is used to be cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ; who is more precisely to know in the source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; see that the cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package from the appropriate distribution must be installed first if this is not yet done .
&quot; for stor@@ ing the ext@@ ingu@@ ed WAV files , the co@@ di@@ erer and therefore the desired file format are selected . at the first opening you will be pre@@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a left @-@ free com@@ pressing for audio data ) . &quot;
the Ko@@ di@@ erer package must be installed from the concerned Linux distribution before the Ko@@ di@@ erer can be used . this is also necessary for pre@@ defined co @-@ operations . more information about co@@ operations are in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
&quot; after installing a co @-@ operation , further information on its switches can be obtained through the input of a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a con@@ soles window ( eg ; con@@ sole ) . it must be replaced by the name of the installed enco@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; this can have many causes . check out the device recording of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the writing and reading of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , fl@@ ac &amp; etc ; ) . try to give both programs with a command line in a terminal . this could give an indication of what is wrong . &quot;
check if you do not want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the envelop@@ e of the &amp; CD ; it will not succeed !
there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this tips can give you how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; have you read the complete manual , everything understood , but are somehow still un@@ certain what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by step example , and you will get enough information to make the program exactly what you want . &quot;
in this example we will start the program for the first time everything set up and read our first &amp; CD ; we are l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; to create MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit rate ) from 224 to 256 kb@@ ps on average and I@@ D3@@ v@@ 1 keywords ( tags ) .
&quot; it must be installed cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution , since it is not necessary to comp@@ ile the source files as it is not necessary to comp@@ ile the source files . &quot;
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd is and that you have writing your right to copy it ( eg ; by trying to copy with the cross @-@ section ) .
the first section covers the basic settings of &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; something which is probably only done once and
the second section describes how to read a &amp; CD ; what has to be repeated for every trigger &amp; CD ;
here we determine how to use Ko@@ di@@ erer for the compression of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pre@@ set extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 kb@@ ps ) . it is intended where the files are stored and which structure is used to use the free@@ DB to download the free@@ DB from the Internet .
&quot; although we can change this settings at any time , we will most likely not be found in any reading of a &amp; CD ; change if once the matching settings are found . &quot;
the device recording will be handed over to the read@@ able program so that it can read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces read .
&quot; frequently / dev / c@@ drom is a symb@@ olic link to the actual device recording of your drive . if this is not working or if more than a &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , can also be accessed into the file / etc / f@@ st@@ ab and an attempt with the available entries of the device drivers for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot;
the card @-@ card general settings . here there is not much to do . here you can see an additional conversion . in our example it all will be as bel@@ low / entered as shown in the screenshot .
&quot; only in case of complete information , please select , so you will be informed when data is missing from keywords ( tags ) . &quot;
the card @-@ card CD ; settings . just choose both entries . we are comfortable and leave the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the Internet from a free@@ DB machine .
note : the computer must be connected while reading the &amp; CD ; can be connected to the Internet to access the free@@ DB server .
&quot; the second outlet field is simpl@@ er , a &amp; CD ; entry is found immediately the reading of the &amp; CD . if you are later un@@ happy with the database entry and the file name / fil@@ ename or file name , they can easily change . the directory or fil@@ ename is changed with Kon@@ quer@@ or@@ - &gt; ren@@ ame and the ID@@ 3 tags with Kid@@ 3 , the &amp; KDE . tag@@ e.@@ at . &quot;
&quot; apart from this example , if you want to manually give everything manually , so de@@ activate the selection fields and free@@ DB will not be used if you are able to use the database before . however , this is about 620 MB large , consider these two select@@ ions , at least the first . the mode will be set up on the following boxes . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB is for us free@@ DB . these are settings for the data en@@ quiry , for the subscription of the &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB server over the Internet . how does the system you get the CD ? read everything as it is displayed in the image . &quot;
mode : we have not downloaded the database because we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet .
&quot; CD@@ DB @-@ Server : please go to the page fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server in your vicinity . on this path the load is distributed between the computers . this setting will be the first attempt to work . &quot;
&quot; both work equivalent to what the server concerns , but there are many fire@@ walls that are called 88@@ 80 standard@@ ly , because the &amp; HTTP ; protocol is usually open to surf the Internet . &quot;
in this example we do not want to transfer any &amp; CD ; data to the free@@ DB server . the first cru@@ c@@ ified test should be dis@@ closed .
simply take the settings of the screen@@ shots . ( make sure that the folder / tmp is available on your computer )
&quot; at the same time per@@ mis@@ sible pieces : sorry , there is a reason why there is more than one at the same time when using only an existing drive ? parallel reading and enco@@ ding ? the author knows it not , so simply try . &quot;
CD ; after reading the last piece : cross this to the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process .
&quot; defin@@ able folder for temporary files : if you are unable to specify the path / folder in which the WAV files will be stored , if only space on a different drive . do not forget that files in the private folder . don &apos;t forget this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files . &quot;
&quot; everything to enter as it is on the screen@@ shots . the command is a bit long , under circumstances something must be bl@@ amed to the right to see everything . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &quot; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good Hi@@ Fi stereo systems . it is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption . &quot;
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the restriction of the production of tags to version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; I@@ D3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags may also be deleted if required . Kid@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; ID@@ 3 &apos; tag@@ ger for &amp; KDE ; in the event of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
Set the rest as at the screen@@ shots . some comments for future use outside of this example :
&quot; number of simultaneously to co@@ ded wa@@ v files : with a Du@@ al@@ Core or Quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine can be tried to co@@ ding more than a WAV file simultaneously . &quot;
&quot; this is , we have just finished the basic setting of &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; this configuration is used as standard for each out of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music , you never need to change it again . &quot;
&quot; in this section it is described , as the process of performing the &amp; CD ; on the hard drive , we will create MP3 files . the folder structure , as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from the free@@ DB will be described , has to be repeated in this section , must be repeated for every trigger @-@ CD . &quot;
&quot; as we use a &amp; CD , which is not included in free@@ DB , see the screen@@ shots of the data for a &amp; CD ; with successful from free@@ DB termin@@ ated data . therefore you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually to pick you up from the Internet . comments will point to the differences . &quot;
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this hand@@ book .
&quot; if this is not yet to happen , now the &amp; CD is defined in the drive , which was defined in the main window . &quot;
after a short moment the pieces and length should be listed in the window as shown in screen@@ shots . this only if the &amp; CD is identified as audio CD ; can be identified and can be read by cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this is not happening then you are looking for questions and answers according to help or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings .
&quot; attention : if the &amp; CD was completed successfully by the free@@ DB , all the titles of the pieces are already filled out , and the name of the artist and the album are shown . &quot;
&quot; for the event that there is more than an entry in the database with the &quot; unique &quot; &amp; CD ; key for your &amp; CD ; there , a window will be built , and you can select the database entry that your opinion is best to your &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; if you do not have the cross @-@ box for the automatic query of free@@ DB ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in dialogue for settings ) , you can also manually rede@@ em them by choosing the first button in the toolbar . if you have no local database , but the data from the Internet you will need the connection to the Internet . &quot;
e 1.2 step 02 : the CD @-@ Editor - input of the CD @-@ data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen@@ shots . the title of the piece in the first line of the &apos; registration title &apos; the rest of the data in the input field &apos; album &apos; .
&quot; the artist does not have to be entered in the input field &apos; current title &apos; , unless you have a compilation with various artists for each piece . &quot;
&quot; the lower comment field can be used for individual comments , the comment field of the album , the comment field of the album is used for comments that are valid for all pieces of the CD . &quot;
&quot; attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of data from the free@@ DB , the CD @-@ Editor is not empty , but it has always been satisfied with the artist and album which can not only be satisfied with the artist and album ( such as all words with big letters or not ... ) but also to examine whether there are any unwanted remarks . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example we use I@@ D3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this is limited to the length of fields on 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the commentary area . if you use I@@ D3@@ v@@ 2 tags ; this option will be arranged at the tab tab to the tab . &quot;
you can change the day @-@ information of the generated files later at any time with the day editor . Kid@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files with it you can also create I@@ D3@@ v@@ 2 Tags .
tags are not supported by all co @-@ enco@@ ders or file formats . see in the help of the co@@ di@@ erer to get more information .
simply select an entry that obviously with the style of the in@@ compatible CD ; this example is not important as we do not give the information about the categories of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or rap for example can be found under Rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD Edit@@ ors will be back and you see that the fields marked for the album has already recorded with the entered data . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . enter the title of the piece in any case and other information you wish .
click on the next line in the main window and proce@@ eding in the same way until you have entered all the title details of the &amp; CD ; entered .
attention : this window will not appear if you have downloaded data from the free@@ DB . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the toolbar . note that the artist and the album will be shown on the rear list .
&quot; note that there is a check @-@ character in front of each line of a piece . only the titles which are selected are selected . a simple click on the line switches , or enter the button all the pieces select at the bottom of the screen to choose all the pieces at once . &quot;
&quot; was started by clicking on the button selection , this window appears on the confirmation . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow the way . &quot;
&quot; click on the rider orders to switch on the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the toolbar . &quot;
this is the window for controlling the orders . the first piece is just read on the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the lower left part of the window in the status line .
this error message can be seen if you are trying to work with a co@@ di@@ erer you have not yet installed . pieces that were not successfully co@@ ded with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
&quot; by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the folder are not what we have entered here in the example . have you tested whether you write access to the folder for the temporary files and the target folder ? ; - ) &quot;
&quot; now , it is clear that the error occurred directly after the end of the ex@@ termination of the first piece . &quot;
&quot; the job 1 reads the first piece , he is finished . but we have a new entry : commissioned 4 is the co@@ ding of piece 1 to the format MP3 . so check out and co@@ ding parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
the author of the program has no configuration position to under@@ press this behavior . the only thing configur@@ able is the result of parallel machines to read and co@@ ding . with high @-@ performance machines the result is un@@ clear . the machine used with a AM@@ D@@ 64 seems to have no problem at simultaneous reading and co@@ ding ( but two different pieces ) .
&quot; now the last title will be read , while another piece will be co@@ ded and a third order in the queue is enco@@ ded , a small window will be enco@@ ded with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window . &quot;
&quot; for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator , you need &amp; KDE ; 3.@@ x. or 4.@@ x and cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG , you need the co@@ incidence of your choice . &quot;
&amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; can now be found within the &amp; KDE ; CV@@ S as part of the k@@ dem@@ ic package . if you can download an anonymous package because &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; a part of an important &amp; KDE ; package is a part of an important &amp; KDE ; -@@ package . if you read this you have already done it already ...
&quot; this section is addressed to people , compiled by source files , and not for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for help , how the program can be adjusted to your needs at once , then the following is correct for you : &quot;
a program that calls for many different programs to learn how many variations in settings . best read the step by step example to know the options and settings . it shows screen shots of the different mapping cards of settings and also contains comments for options that can not be used in the example .
&quot; hello , still on the reading ? even if only the help menu after the first time of the program click , without any cl@@ ue as it should go on this somehow empty screen ( especially when the program starts not an audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu . &quot;
&quot; what is it ? who read this , probably already started the program . it should somehow look like this : &quot;
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately no email . the author can not maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator . if you want to add something use@@ full or change , let it do . at least only after the contact with the author . and if you read this , he has written this section and is therefore agreed with this proposal . &quot;
&quot; strange if it succeeded to get to you the source file from &amp; KDE ; SV@@ N , then you do not need to do this information but ... &quot;
&amp; km@@ id ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kar@@ a@@ ok@@ esp@@ iel@@ er of &amp; KDE ; next to others he has no properties that others &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have .

&quot; once &amp; km@@ id ; one piece play , you can jump to any point by using the middle mouse button and drive with the controller and drive . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song goes too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows left and on the right of the Tem@@ po@@ its and then change the game speed . to get back the original speed , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
&quot; the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar like a pressure on the button break or the expression of the menu item in the menu , inter@@ rup@@ ts the playing . bet@@ s the space bar will start , starts &amp; km@@ id ; the playback . &quot;
lyrics can be saved on two species in a piece of music . some pieces use texture . some pieces do not use lyrics . some pieces do not have any text : - )
&quot; in &amp; km@@ id ; you can set what events are to be displayed and even better : the type of type is automatically identified , so you have to set nothing in the menu settings for automatic text selection , but you still have the possibility to change this if you want to see the other way . &quot;
&quot; if you want to set up a type of type , select from the menu settings of the entries and songs events . the same function also have the keys 1 and 2 . &quot;
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you summar@@ ize . these are the series to be played . in this section is how you can use Colle@@ ctions efficiently .
&quot; to create a collection , you first open the collection ager . this can be found in the menu collection under the point . click on New and give the name for the collection . &quot;
you can also copy a existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs like the original one .
&quot; if you have more than one collection , you can set the res@@ ellers in the collection . &quot;
in the temporary collection you will find all the songs that you want to add any other collection .
&quot; when leaving the application this collection will not be saved . raise concerns that if you add many pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collectors &quot; Add to a song . it appears in turn the file dialog , with whose help you can select the desired song . &quot;
&quot; a second method to add a song , depends on the setting automatic adding to the collection . &quot;
&quot; if automatic add @-@ up to the collection is activated , a piece at opening ( using file Open or Dra@@ g &amp; Drop ) automatically added to the active collection . &quot;
&quot; if automatic to the collection is not activated , when opening a piece the temporary collection is activated and managed . this collection will then continue to open pieces . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection ager to select the collection and the desired song and then click remove . &quot;
&quot; you can select the order , in which the songs will be played . if you select the line from the sub@@ menu of the menu collections , the songs are played in order as they were added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; if you add songs or remove them or select the order in the menu , the order will be re@@ established . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , select it in the collection ager , or use the dro@@ p@@ iste over the kar@@ aoke text . &quot;
&quot; to jump a song , select the button next song from the menu item or press the button arrow to the right . &quot;
&quot; to reverse a song , select the button pre@@ dict@@ able piece , the record pre@@ defined piece of the menu or press the button arrow to the left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection ager , select the collection collection and click the button . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not play a role since it is not saved when leaving &amp; km@@ id ; not saved . &quot;
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thesizer which are not generic @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case the MIDI @-@ Map General @-@ MIDI events in events that understands the syn@@ thesizer .
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI map which can change all events of this type Change patch to Br@@ ight Piano in Events of this type Change patch to Tru@@ mp@@ et and thus always leaves a trumpet if originally a piano should play . &quot;
&quot; if you only have a sound@@ card , you do not need MIDI @-@ Map because all Sound@@ cards GM -@@ compatible ( incl . a@@ we - and G@@ US -@@ cards , FM -@@ devices and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI @-@ Maps . so you have to edit the corresponding file from hand ( with your favorite gu@@ or ) . &quot;
a MIDI @-@ Map is a text file that saves all required survey@@ s for playback of a piece .
&quot; each section may only appear once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MAP section , which may appear as often as desired . it is necessary that every occurrence has a different text@@ ID ( see below ) . &quot;
define P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D define KE@@ Y@@ MAP &quot; name of the Key@@ map ... EN@@ D define KE@@ Y@@ MAP ... EN@@ D define CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Options ... EN@@ D
you see that define is needed to indicate that one section starts ( except for Options ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is achieved .
&quot; please send me your Map file as E @-@ Mail , so that I can provide support in future versions of &amp; km@@ id ; assistance can offer for devices that are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ compatible . &quot;
in this section the patches will be displayed as the patches of General MIDI on your specific keyboard . the general use looks like this :
&quot; please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are subject to the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the sequence for one of the 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; the optional All@@ Ke@@ ys@@ To M is used to put all sounds that this instrument need to put on the tone with the number M . if your keyboard is not supported ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which is similar to a thread . in addition , you can use the following in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section . &quot;
&quot; so if a MIDI file is to play a note with patch 127 ( Win ) , it takes a patch 100 ( the Drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , regardless of which tone in the MIDI file is . &quot;
&quot; please note that here with the term Drum patch of the patch is meant to be a different per@@ former instrument ( drum , pel@@ vis , Marac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) , and not the one who means the sound height of the always equal drum ( like it does some key@@ boards ) . &quot;
the KE@@ Y@@ MAP section is needed to specify how sounds on a particular channel or instrument . use is :
&quot; as the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section is the order of rows very important , as well as their presence . you must therefore create 128 entries . &quot;
you can define for each channel and every instrument multiple Key@@ maps . you just have to use different names only in the first line .
Key@@ maps are used mainly to form tones on the per@@ k@@ uss@@ ions channel . look for example the key@@ maps .
&quot; this section can be used to form a few channels to others . if you want to change the first and second channel , you can easily put it in CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards , which have the percussion on a particular channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; Midi @-@ Devices need 16 channels , the CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , built according to the following patterns : &quot;
n is the channel that is depic@@ ted on the Channel N . if you use the key@@ map option will of course be defined in the file name for this channel . if you are using the For@@ ce@@ Patch option will try to change the patch on this canal . in this case the patch will always be a patch .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option may be useful for example to use the per@@ k@@ uss@@ ions patch on the per@@ k@@ uss@@ ions channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ rat@@ io can be multipl@@ ied in which ratio of Pit@@ ch is multipl@@ ied with the value of n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then only for@@ warded . the value 40@@ 96 is used in the map file ( no dec@@ imal as ) .
&quot; this setting will be used because GM gives you a keyboard , which should play a pitch for two sounds to one oct@@ ave . unfortunately , try to play a few key@@ boards up to one oct@@ ave . unfortunately , try to try the right value on your keyboard , you have to try a bit with &amp; km@@ id ; around . &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI @-@ map , simply open the dialog MIDI settings . this can be found in the menu under settings , point MIDI settings . &quot;
the can@@ als view is a window with a whole series of Kla@@ vi@@ aturen ( one for every MIDI channel ) . on these Kla@@ vi@@ aturen you can see which sounds just played .
&quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel . for each channel you can choose a tool . if you have changed an instrument , the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used . &quot;
the can@@ als view ( up to now ) two different views to view the played sounds . the view can choose from the menu settings below the item tab : settings
&quot; the speed @-@ LCD shows the speed , with which one song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the pace of a song . if you find e.g. , a song is too fast to follow the text , you can slow down the pace , use the arrows left and right from the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a music piece must be played . it contains the notes , the rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; it can lead the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results , just like two different musicians play the same notes to very different ways . &quot;
&quot; good , I can force anybody to use &amp; km@@ id ; but a typical MIDI file is used for about 50 KB , while an mp3 @-@ file you need a similar sound quality . with a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything . &quot;
&quot; this can happen if you have compiled a bin@@ ary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; km@@ id ; have happened because &amp; km@@ id ; without a@@ we support , you must download a source distribution and install an source distribution ( for example of km@@ id ; &apos;s Home ) &quot;
&quot; I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I have no desire to add all files individually . &quot;
&quot; therefore agree , supports &amp; km@@ id ; drag &amp; Drop . just open the folder you want to add to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all the files and drag them to the &amp; km@@ id ; -@@ window . &quot;
enable the setup automatic adding to the collection . otherwise the files are added to the temporary collection .
you can click the arrow key to the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD and to restore the playback . to restore the standard temp@@ o .
I have been installed on a &amp; KDE ; -@@ desktop a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window with my MIDI files and &amp; km@@ ar ; on this way I must play a file or I want to play a file just into the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window and enter the desired file into the window of &amp; km@@ id ;
&quot; if you just want to listen to a file without adding them equal to a collection , turn off the setting automatic adding to the collection , and the new ; file is added to the temporary collection added . &quot;
&quot; if we take you , you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . you only want to play automatic adding to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection contains then this a MIDI file . &quot;
then join B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid to play and create a collection of all three files . how do you do that ?
&quot; these people have sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you so much ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , anim@@ ates me to programmed . &quot;
&quot; and km@@ id ; was written by &amp; Anton@@ io.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ J@@ im@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ ac@@ ute ; laga ( Spain ) , so I am not much leisure time for my Hob@@ bies but I try to take a bit of time for my Hob@@ bies but I try to collect some time when hob@@ bies I have programming , MIDI files , and make sent@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know where to download MIDI / kar@@ aoke files if you want a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; km@@ id ; or even if you want to make me feel happy , write me an e @-@ mail : Lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is.@@ &quot;
&quot; if you really want to send me a postcard from your home or an MI@@ DI@@ - / kar@@ aoke file from a local group , I will send me a postcard or a MIDI file , but if you want to contact me a MIDI file , as I might have a MIDI file . &quot;
I have &amp; km@@ id ; completely written in my spare time and from none of it . I want to emphas@@ ize that I can only ask for it because ... if I get feedback from users ( post@@ cards or e @-@ mails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ w@@ ai and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - Beh@@ avi@@ ation of the bug that the Ton@@ gs at a@@ we cards was too high .

and of course my thanks also all these excellent musicians on the net which give us this wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ aoke files .
&quot; additionally , km@@ ar can be found at http : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is.@@ it / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / km@@ id@@ .html . on the homepage you can also watch the development and look at the homepage with further kar@@ aoke songs , &amp; etc ; &quot;
a sound@@ card . I recommend you a good sound@@ card or an external syn@@ thesizer because the sound quality is essentially dependent on your sound@@ card . it is not the same as if you use a FM device or a a@@ we map .
&quot; if you have no sound@@ card , you need to comp@@ ile and km@@ id ; with the parameters MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it runs then as if you could hear a sound@@ card , except that you do not listen to music . &quot;
&quot; if problems occur , please contact one of the &amp; KDE ; -@@ ma@@ iling lists or send an error message directly to me . &quot;
&quot; features player ; is a simple user interface for M@@ Player , Ph@@ ono and FF@@ M@@ peg . the program is needed to play video files from M@@ Player or PH@@ ON@@ ON supported formats , as well as play DVD &apos;s , VCD s or TV and camera . &quot;
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet ended than &amp; KDE ; on this computer was installed .
for additional support please check the page The KDE website to new versions or send the question to The &amp; KDE ; user ma@@ iling list .
the application window will be made of so @-@ called and@@ ock@@ able windows . there is always the window with the key view . and finally there is a information window that can only be displayed when information in it is re@@ produce .
&quot; it is possible to en@@ rich the preferred connections under the menu book@@ marks , but these are individual entries . if you want to play a list of entries that use each other so you should use the category continuous playlist . &quot;
&quot; of course you can add groups to groups to obtain an additional hier@@ archy , his group and all its sub@@ groups will be copied to the current category and the play begins with the cl@@ icked entry . &quot;
&quot; the categories &apos; Current piece &apos; , television and continuous playlist may also be changed by direct@@ ing Edit@@ ing of XML configuration files . of course you can only do the different files in the directory ~ / .@@ k@@ en / share / apps / km@@ player . &quot;
&quot; following modif@@ ying XML files , must be selected from the menu of the same with playlist , and selected either the processing mode , or any other category will be selected . &quot;
all changes are lost if the processing mode are leaving or another group is selected without the playlist .
&quot; as a result of the convenience of the author , features , some of the functions can only be swit@@ ched by changing the XML configuration files . &quot;
the animation at the starting point and finishing can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ er@@ c and change from &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ iger option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available it can be easily inserted .
it is also possible to enable another animation . &amp; km@@ player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / km@@ player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ en / share / apps / km@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be an supported XML file .
&quot; the animation during the starting time does not need to be short , it is automatically termin@@ ated by opening a different source . this would be distur@@ bing the user at the end of the animation , the user can thus end a second time . &quot;
&quot; a simple example of a start @-@ animation can be the ads of a favorite photo : &amp; lt ; body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .g@@ if , &quot;
there is a rider on the configuration of M@@ Player in the configuration dialog by &amp; features player . here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the clip@@ board size of the disk from the network and other things .
a different tool for trou@@ bl@@ es@@ ho@@ oting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the toolbar of km@@ player . here is the output of m@@ player .
there is no rider for this r@@ end@@ ition in the configuration dialog by &amp; features player ; it all must be configured by manual Edit file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ er@@ c . here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; with the module sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa is played :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; features ; it can even be inserted in the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
&quot; thus , the km@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages can be recovered , the &amp; features ; module as a service provider for the M@@ IME @-@ type application / x @-@ sh@@ ock@@ wave @-@ flash in the design dialog file to be specified by KDE . &quot;
&quot; the con@@ quer@@ or or km@@ player ; is in a con@@ soles to start application and search for error messages regarding the shop of the browser module library . if there is no mistakes , the back@@ end output is to check inside &amp; km@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) . &quot;
&quot; this is always taken a pre @-@ given back@@ end for a certain M@@ IME type ( of course only if this was also determined ) , this must be done by manual change of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ er@@ c . for example PH@@ ON@@ ON all og@@ g files re@@ produce : &quot;
&quot; features player ; can play with TV cards , either by M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV , you need to use the used device and the TV channels can be edited manually from the configuration dialog box , or the configuration file can be edited manually . &quot;
&quot; configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( video data record ) settings in the features - &gt; Qu@@ elle@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video port to use . there , ports should be detected by which one has to be found ( e.g. , it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name will probably contain a DVB in it . &quot;
since the V@@ DR support of km@@ player can only use X@@ Video ( probably this type of subscription of video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . this is why the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must also be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / XF@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) .
&quot; intern@@ ally used by K@@ M@@ Player for sources of different names . at the time of emergence of these documentation are dv@@ d@@ nav@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , written source , sc@@ cd@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . if you are activated , starting with the playback of the playlist . &quot;
are there evidence as I can make my CD@@ ROM drive when I play with him ( not from the VCD / / ) ?
&quot; yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ e 8 / dev / c@@ drom is to be able to execute the root / c@@ drom to the CD@@ ROM drive . &quot;
X@@ ine will only start slow down , why every time my CPU needs to be tested on their performance ? &quot;
&quot; note : the answer is over@@ hau@@ l k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the last stored value , only the first time the CPU will check the CPU . &quot;

&quot; lat@@ ex ; : a professional writing application . among Unix @-@ like systems will likely be back on the package &amp; tex@@ live ; or &amp; te@@ TeX ; ( for older systems ) . &quot;
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux ; distribution . for installation should be the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD .
the &amp; k@@ ile ; -@@ Project contains some already compiled packages of &amp; k@@ ile ; for different distrib@@ utions . these allow easy installation without additional comp@@ iling and are available on the k@@ ile ; -@@ Website .
&quot; this manual is for everyone - independent of the experiences with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; KDE ; , &amp; k@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; &quot;
&quot; advanced users must hardly read this manual . however , all the proposals have been taken into account . however , the support for this project or its documentation is required , the contact should be made via the k@@ ile ; -@@ Website . &quot;
&quot; if you have questions or comp@@ iling / k@@ ile , on or if extensions desired , this should be addressed to the ma@@ iling list c@@ ile @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ s@@ ource@@ for@@ ge@@ .net . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ area for the use of all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ functions in a graphical environment and within this one simple , immediate and tailor @-@ made access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ programs . furthermore , the possibility to complete comp@@ iling , repl@@ ication and bug@@ ging tools for this . in conclusion , the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference and the powerful project management . &quot;

&quot; all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document in the following elements ( part is the most important and sub@@ s@@ ory the lower element ) : &quot;
&quot; at the view of the document in the structure , the individual elements can be changed by clicking on the respective dates and be viewed . &quot;
in the preparation of your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be very helpful as soon as a DVI ; -@@ File &#91; rounded file . once a single click with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ viewer to the corresponding line in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code .
&quot; a DVI file , a description of the formatt@@ ed document and other information like the font and is next to PDF the view output of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; there are many tools to view , transformation and to printing of DVI ; -@@ files for different systems and straight@@ ened . &quot;
&quot; when using the R@@ Ã ¼ ck@@ n@@ oses are the elements of the DVI ; -@@ file for@@ ged with the editor , is the exact opposite of it . once on a section in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source text is recorded , the corresponding position in the DVI ; -@@ source text is made available in the DVI ; -@@ viewer . &quot;
Master @-@ Document : this function is simpl@@ ified when working with multiple files . with a master document the work with others is simpl@@ ified . with the use of a project can be set up a project @-@ wide master document .
quick @-@ construction : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source text is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if no error occurred in the source text ) .
&quot; monitoring : in this mode the DVI ; -@@ File to include , gu@@ ilt , and there is no call from &amp; e@@ ye@@ piece ; after the quick @-@ construction . &quot;
&quot; for viewing the processing tool@@ bar , the three co@@ res of the document should be developed for the quick setup of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The pre @-@ supply &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands for the under@@ division are : &quot;
&quot; further information can be found in the entries of articles such as keywords , fu@@ gues , notes or refer@@ rals . &quot;
name : with this command a term for a section , an image or different element is created . &quot;
reference : is used for reference to a specified design@@ ation ( selection of a selection ) .
using c@@ itation is a p@@ est list with liter@@ ary settings . at &amp; bib@@ tex ; files are required by the file to a project . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bib@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; -@@ files can also be written in &amp; k@@ ile ;
&quot; the final selection with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ Ã ¼ e is used for fixing the fonts . it can be determined by the fonts for the main text , the fu@@ zz , notes etc . there are the following signature : &quot;
&quot; when calling &amp; k@@ ile ; two choices are available for setting : 1 . the wiz@@ ard for the creation of a new document , by selecting the document art and fixed the settings . 2 . the document may be written by the ground up with the hand . &quot;
&quot; the brackets to the command \ \ document@@ class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; sets the fonts . the fonts is not fixed at the beginning , this can also happen in the text . &quot;
&quot; once the above source code was entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex version has to be compiled . the easiest way to this is the use of the menu or the button of fast @-@ construction . &quot;
the source code must be saved before comp@@ iling . &amp; gt ; for storage automatically .
&quot; the comp@@ iling of the document was missing , should be done in the log@@ ging of the mistakes . when using quick @-@ construction should be started &amp; e@@ ye@@ piece ; this is not the case , it should also be noticed . &quot;
&quot; an environment ( engl@@ . environment ) is a text , which is different from the rest of the document . will , for example , a report with the secretary to have created a different fonts . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } , then re@@ alis@@ ing the Script@@ ure in the area , &quot; &quot; Ries@@ ig@@ â &quot; &quot; ( engl@@ . Hu@@ ge ) . &quot;
the courses are merely used within the area ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no circum@@ ference ( number ) for the re@@ efs within an environment .
&quot; there are many possibilities for creating the read@@ ability and user @-@ friendliness of the document . it can be used for example certain fonts , fat , cur@@ ative , etc. can be added either with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the surroundings . &quot;
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the cur@@ si@@ v@@ print and is long as gest@@ ures until he is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a set can be displayed with \ \ emp@@ h { word } ital@@ ic .
\ \ ratio : created a quot@@ ation in the document . the quote begins with \ \ begin { rate } and ends with \ \ end { rate } .
&quot; after the background for writing the source code with the &amp; lat@@ ex &quot; &quot; recording language , now follows a step @-@ by @-@ step guide to create a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; &quot;
&quot; once in the wiz@@ ard was entered a bit text , a few adjustments to achieve the better read@@ ability of the document should be mind@@ ful and a poem to the application to see the differences of these commands . &quot;
&quot; once the document has been viewed , can be returned by editor @-@ view or Ctr@@ l E back to the editor ( in the internal vie@@ wers ) . with an external viewer , its window must be closed . &quot;
&quot; once the DVI ; -@@ file has been created , the document can be converted or into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try and try . &quot;
DVI . ( English e V ice I n@@ osed ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; Latex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi output such as printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF @-@ trans@@ itions or computer screens . &quot;
for the printing of a &amp; DVI ; file are the same steps as for the creation of the document ( see ) . on the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - then the document can be printed out ( if the printer is properly adjusted ) .
the toolbar allows the conversion of the DVI ; -@@ file has been created in other formats ; as soon as the DVI ; -@@ source code was created from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source text , the conversion can start into a different formats by using the button in the toolbar . &quot;
the w@@ igs allows direct le@@ ap from the editor to the associated position within the DVI ; -@@ File .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ bin@@ aries . you need to do only Modern under settings K@@ ile ... tools bro@@ ws .
&quot; in order to get the cursor in a line of the source code , the mouse must be positioned in a line of the source code and close to Vor@@ w@@ Ã ¤ r@@ ts@@ search . the jump to the corresponding position in the DVI ; spect@@ ator is done then . &quot;
with this function in &amp; e@@ ye@@ piece ; this function comes with one click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex file . this must be defined as text editor ; in &amp; e@@ ye@@ piece ( settings e@@ ye@@ piece ... Editor )
&quot; if the use of quick @-@ construction of the &amp; DVI ; the ob@@ server cannot be fixed , this can be found in the log file or in the news window . &quot;
the file files Er@@ kl@@ Ã ¤ rt the error source in the source code . in the Editor you can always select the line in which the error appears . to click the faul@@ ty line in which the error must be cl@@ icked on the error in the log files .
&quot; once on the appropriate button in the toolbar , a window appears to select the template of the template for the document . the pre@@ set orders are : &quot;
&quot; in the selection of empty document , a document may be written either by the reason or the assistant to the fast creation of a new document . additional information can be found in the section . &quot;
&quot; new user of &amp; lat@@ ex ; most often use the same introduction for nearly all documents . templates can be created and loaded , stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new template , either must be created either a existing and tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; a new template can be created by using an existing document and selection of file template . &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document , a template using a file will be replaced by a file ( such as name or string co@@ ding ) . these variables can be set in settings are set in settings . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know what results are replaced by the variables : &quot;
&quot; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ TC@@ LA@@ S@@ SO@@ P@@ TIONS $ $ : this string is used by entering documentation : \ \ document@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ TC@@ LA@@ S@@ SO@@ P@@ TIONS $ $ &#93; { article } . &quot;
the easiest way to create a template is the use of the wiz@@ ard and this makes understanding of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way the following steps have been completed :
&quot; when creating a new document , then the own template can be balanced rather than the standard . &quot;
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; a simple way to create a template should be sought after one on the Internet and the steps described below .
&amp; Kate ; uses &amp; Kate ; as an internal editor . &amp; Kate ; is a text@@ editor for reading and thir@@ ds of many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and bib@@ tex ; ) . many settings for &amp; Kate ; can be carried out in the menu .
&quot; to learn more about Kate &amp; Kate , and its possibilities , the manual should be drawn to Kate , users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can be done directly with the reading of the chapter with the editor of &amp; Kate ; &quot;
&quot; a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; does a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command commands , which can be called for the menu of La@@ TeX @-@ Reference . you can see a spin @-@ up description of almost all commands that can be found in &amp; Latex ; use as well as their syntax . &quot;
a double @-@ click with penet@@ rated Ctr@@ l -@@ button to select the &amp; tex ; meaning that in this way when clicking \ \ par \ \ big@@ sk@@ ip only \ \ par excellence .
&quot; when drag@@ ging the text with penet@@ rated lin@@ ker , the selected text is automatically copied to the clip@@ board . &quot;
&quot; when using the arrow keys with penet@@ rated conversion , parts of the source code can be balanced in the edit window . &quot;
&quot; che@@ ile ; has the possibility to browse the most diverse types of source contex@@ ts and emphas@@ ize them . for example , the Bed and Latex formul@@ as are different from the normal text and also the mathematical formul@@ as are highlighted by another color . &quot;
many assist@@ ants can be highlighted inside the text . it is also possible to create their own type of book@@ marks within the text . the menu structure can also emphas@@ ized the jump to the pon@@ ds or the last jumping mark . it is also automatically highlighted the jump in the first input of a character .
&quot; this is probably one of the main aspects of using a program like &amp; k@@ ile ; . although &amp; Kate ; already outstanding possibilities for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; important functions for the writing of a &amp; lat@@ ex ; special features for their selection . &quot;
&quot; using a complete paragraph ( group of lines that contain on both sides a blank line ) . with a paragraph does not include a text with penet@@ rated lines ( like in other text editing ) . the only ident@@ ifying thing in &amp; k@@ ile ; is that the fact clearly separated by two blank lines . &quot;
&quot; choose the word below the current cursor position . this selection has also an advanced meaning , since this command has also a lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands with a r@@ Ã ¼ s@@ sel@@ f@@ ights ( \ \ ) and another star ( * ) at the end . &quot;
&quot; to the end of a part of the document may be balanced , and by pressing the button de@@ f Ctr@@ l ; K with which the entire line will be removed . &quot;
remo@@ ves a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; k@@ ile ; is included in the description of mach@@ ining the paragraph .
&quot; it has already been clearly revealed that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; for this reason , it offers more commands under mach@@ ining environment for a good easy work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; &quot;
with this command will be trac@@ ed at the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the command for the re@@ curr@@ ing of the environment .
with this command will be trac@@ ed to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed right behind the command to the closure of the surroundings .
if the cursor before or within the command \ \ begin { Environment } is located at the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
&quot; with the entry of many wel@@ ded ambient commands can go quickly to the first sight . this command slept , so that the sl@@ iced ambient structure is not destro@@ ying . &quot;
&amp; k@@ ile ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ groups that are determined by par@@ enth@@ eses { ... } are determined by par@@ enth@@ eses . among them TeX @-@ group are a few important commands that correspond to those of them .
with this command the cursor is placed at the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the wel@@ ded cl@@ amps .
this command will be trac@@ ed to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed right behind the s@@ wollen che@@ ers .
&quot; when the cursor before or behind the we@@ ed cl@@ amp of a &amp; tex ; group # is , will lead to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; with the entry of many poll@@ uted groups @-@ par@@ enth@@ eses can go quickly to the first sight . this command slept , so that the excav@@ ated structure of the &amp; tex ; groups cannot destruction . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple beginnings are used as G@@ Ã ¤ n@@ se@@ ware . for the purpose of the beginning , the sign &quot; is used for two simple beginnings . &quot;
this automatic inser@@ tion of the double penetration can be set under settings K@@ ile ( La@@ TeX ... La@@ TeX ) .
you can also use l@@ Ã ¤ n@@ der@@ specific settings ( e.g. n@@ german or french ) and with the German or french beginnings . there are also many other languages available .
&quot; if the current position within a list of lists ( such as enum@@ er@@ ate or item@@ ize ) is , for the current position within a lists ( e.g. enum@@ er@@ ate or item@@ ize ) , but at the same time the command \ \ item . &quot;
inside a tables -@@ area near the current line with \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to accommodate pre @-@ set &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or user @-@ defined environments .
&quot; some users want to arrange the columns in tables and thereby all the E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) among themselves . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; Kate ; already offering a good source text file , this was built in &amp; k@@ ile ; in order to have special commands ( usually for bed and lat@@ ex ; ) , these modes of work can be set up for different working methods of settings . &quot;
at the beginning there is a new environment by means of the command \ \ begin { Environment } and k@@ ile ; automatically the command \ \ end { Environment } is added to an empty line ( for the text ) .
&quot; at the wi@@ res of the r@@ Ã ¼ c@@ kt@@ aste , the last letter of the entry is removed and allows you to select the complete list . on the other hand , the list can also be decre@@ ased by entering a further letter . &quot;
&quot; all commands will be written with a brief description of their parameters . alternatively , you can choose nat@@ ures from choosing a command . alternatively , that a simple jump to these positions can be viewed by using jumping on the jump . &quot;
&quot; in settings , you can set up settings to these lists . it can be done different w@@ Ã ¶ ter@@ ation units for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands , as well as guardi@@ an of the general voice @-@ hand @-@ hand @-@ hand @-@ hand @-@ hand . &quot;
&quot; the command mode is not useful for complete environments . there are always a few letters entered with \ \ begin and the call of the complete list will be used to follow . on the other hand , the environments used to be used as often , that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for refin@@ ement of environments . &quot;
&quot; when calling the ful@@ fil@@ ing mode , the menu bar or key@@ chain taste space is automatically re@@ structured and it appears \ \ begin . then the environment appears to be completed in the easiest way and it appears to be finished in the input taste . &quot;
&quot; after this is accomplished , the environment is automatically closed again . once &amp; k@@ ile ; det@@ ects that it is a list of lists and is even a first \ \ item command with enclosed . &quot;
among settings k@@ ile ; setup ... k@@ ile ; con@@ spic@@ uous settings to these lists are done . this mode uses the guardi@@ an list of the full @-@ list mode ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands .
&quot; you can set up custom @-@ defined lists of choices , which can be set immediately through l@@ Ã ng@@ ere string . the lists can be used under settings K@@ ile and can be used ex@@ amp@@ le@@ .c@@ w@@ l , in which example the entry L = \ \ La@@ TeX is included . &quot;
&quot; for example , the letter L is entered and the word obsolete mode , the menu is replaced by the string code , the letter L is replaced by the string \ \ La@@ TeX . &quot;
&quot; mostly not helpful , but it has been noted that many guardi@@ ans are written in a document more than once again . with that it offers &amp; k@@ ile ; all already written guardi@@ an . &quot;
&quot; this mode can be set up in the menu g@@ ile settings ... K@@ ile Ver@@ ful@@ st@@ Ã ¤ n@@ ach . here , the tail @-@ value can be set up for the display of ful@@ fil@@ ment . &quot;
the complete files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ en / share / apps / k@@ ile / complete / mode / des Persian
&quot; the dialogue graphics inser@@ ts designed the inser@@ tion of graphics as simple as possible . for the fact , the bas@@ ics of the bas@@ ics should be considered as possible . &quot;
&quot; PS files are not as well known as PDF files , but also offer an excellent basis for real estate and re @-@ ordin@@ ances of pages . the PDF @-@ issue can be used with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; -@@ tools can be ordered and then converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf to a PDF file . &quot;
&quot; to worry about the result of work has to be compiled , needs to comp@@ ile the source text . all construction tools are group@@ ed in the men@@ Ã ¼ s create comp@@ iling , create and create view . &quot;
for the comp@@ iling of the source code for ob@@ server like &amp; e@@ ye@@ piece ; or the further conversion can be used by the key@@ note that can be converted into a PS file with Alt ; 4 the DVI ; -@@ File to a PS file and be viewed by Alt ; 5 the PS file .
&quot; when using the command @-@ construction , an ob@@ server is normally called after comp@@ iling . should not be used in a built @-@ in viewer , each other window will open a new window . &quot;

&quot; due to the amount of documents with those &amp; te@@ TeX ; / tex@@ til , the finding of the right document does not always easy . as an individual help offers &amp; te@@ TeX ; / tex@@ live ; the small application of tex@@ tu@@ k , provided a database with all the documents and for a graphical upper floor . &quot;
all documents are divided into categories and the gr@@ illed advantage is the search for pack@@ et name or stroke . of &amp; k@@ ile ; then only the results are displayed .

&quot; J@@ aw@@ ohl , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from lib@@ xml@@ 2 library . &quot;
&quot; should the execut@@ able file in &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; already be marked , then they let the current file simply select . if not , remove the selection of the current file and select the file to processed file using the other file file selection . &quot;
enter the name of the file as the result is to be named . the file is usually stored in your home folder .
&quot; the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; does not have little to do with &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for yourself , the plug @-@ in system is very powerful . you can &apos;t wait until someone can benefit from the additional functionality at &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the plug @-@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI . more about it can be found below . &quot;
&quot; to install a plugin or a K@@ Part , we start working with the menu plugins . thus , the following dialogue will be opened : &quot;
this dialog enables you to manage all the plug @-@ ins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; -@@ element in it :
&quot; here you can enter the search ad . when adding plug @-@ ins without a storage location , and quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this path to search the plug @-@ in . &quot;
&quot; often , working on a project several persons in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship with each other . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; supports the indication of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Properties dialog . &quot;
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nickname is the nickname of the user and serves to identify .
one member can have several roles in the project as well as sub@@ project manager .
the user can look out for himself from the list of pon@@ ds who he is . this happens by pressing the te@@ amm@@ ing link from the list and the button S@@ etze as pressed . the currently selected member ( their ident@@ ifier ) will appear before you are : text .
nickname and setting of own identity are important regarding messages and comments . see further information on remarks .
&quot; in addition to the overview of their team there is another advantage by the collection of the members of the team : it can be created an event for information to the team leader , if something happens . see in for more information . &quot;
&quot; event actions are actions which can be executed when a particular deals in the project . an example would be seen how much someone worked out , or the sending of a message when a file is secured , or a script that will be added to the CV@@ S as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; on the site event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project project settings dialogue dialog can be created , edited and deleted . &quot;
an E@@ Mail is sent to the recipient in the receiver list . the add@@ sat can be a team or sub@@ project manager .
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments using the following things :
notes to enter is simple . it can either be selected either the note entry from the editor @-@ context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword in a comment area followed by the text text .
notes can be a determining member of the team in this case is the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nickname ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nickname ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nickname ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nickname ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation
&quot; nick@@ names and roles names are independent of wholesale or small sp@@ elling , but spaces around the par@@ enth@@ eses and the : make the note invalid . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; is a development environment for script@@ ing and formatt@@ ing languages , the D@@ TD @-@ ag@@ nost@@ ic is and web @-@ based formatt@@ ing and script@@ ing languages supported . &quot;
the settings are accessible via the settings menu . here are only about &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ specific settings treated , a short description for the others can be found in . &quot;
the settings may be called by settings Qu@@ anta . diesel dialog extends over a few pages that will be dealt with each other .
&quot; the behavior of &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; in terms of tags , including meetings can be changed . the entries are : &quot;
&quot; large / to@@ elling of tags : large / to@@ d@@ elling of automatically added tags . normal Groß / Klein@@ pl@@ icate means , the tags are as inserted as they are described in the day XML files . &quot;
&quot; large / to@@ elling of attributes : large / to@@ elling of automatic attributes , the attributes will be inserted as inserted as they are described in the day XML files . &quot;
&quot; optional tags automatically shut : when stopped , is optional for tags , for which the subsequent day is optional , this immediately after &amp; gt ; &quot;
not optional tags automatically include : as above for all other tags except the simple tags .
&quot; start @-@ up and finish day automatically update : if swit@@ ched , the corresponding day will be changed and vice versa . &quot;
automatic detection of acc@@ ent character : controls the automatic conversion of ac@@ ar@@ ized signs into the corresponding co@@ ding during the entry .
M@@ IME @-@ types : M@@ imet@@ yp@@ es to detect different types of files . using the standard button can be restored .
standard string : the co@@ ding of newly created or in other ways than with File opening files ( where the co@@ ding of the file can be transferred ) . this setting will be presented by the same in the project characteristics if a project is loaded .
&quot; standard D@@ TD : the selected D@@ TD is used for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ TD was not recognized . this setting is written by the same in the project characteristics , if a project is loaded . &quot;
&quot; creating a backup copy : &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; created regularly back@@ ups , so that in a black@@ out of the program can re@@ produced the document from this backup file . this is not the same as the stor@@ ing file . also , for not yet stored documents will be created regularly , according to the specified time . &quot;
&quot; the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editors or any own view ( or the documentation in a cardboard box ) , which makes it possible to look the documentary , the preview and the source code simultaneously . &quot;
Set the window settings back to the next start is useful when the user interface is done by changing the M@@ DI modes and and@@ po@@ x . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameters .
the warning sub@@ missions is used to control the control of the possibility of reve@@ aling the indication of warnings by sight of no longer in@@ quiries .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can change the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ ization of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source section in the shared mode . with regard to the various modes .
&quot; here the Par@@ ser and the structural tree , which represents the illustration of the Par@@ ser @-@ node in the document in detail . &quot;
&quot; in the range of mouse click on the structure @-@ tree , it is possible to change the action by clicking the structural tree with the mouse buttons . &quot;
&quot; in the field of structural settings , the visibility of no@@ des can be opened automatically in the tree which should be opened automatically and how deep in a change of structural tree should be opened , empty kn@@ ots are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are found in which the current document is not found in the current document . &quot;
&quot; the area for setting abbre@@ vi@@ ations ( a type of templates ) which are un@@ folded in groups , each one can be divided into groups , each one can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it can be a valid group for PHP , in which the if@@ cl@@ ause abbreviation something else means something different for Javascript . &quot;
&quot; plugins can be managed by the plugins . plugins are K@@ Part @-@ applications from the third page , which can be used by any K@@ part @-@ capable application , at the most famous &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ tion of a plug @-@ ins must be indicated in the following : &quot;
&quot; address : the path to plug @-@ in , if it is not in a standard place like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib . &quot;
&quot; input : this information is transferred to the plug @-@ in , so you can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the folder folder . &quot;
&quot; component in &quot; &quot; Just @-@ L@@ ese &quot; &quot; mode : check if the plugin denied the store . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts denied the store , if this option is not selected . &quot;
&quot; check the plugin : is this activated , then test@@ et &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; whether the indicated information is correct . pick @-@ up the order is also available if the plugin is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; from version 3.3 , the error was completely new developed . the support for the db@@ g de@@ bug@@ ger ( 3 ) de@@ bug@@ ger was implemented , as well as support for the db@@ g de@@ bug@@ ger . instead , it has been implemented a de@@ bug@@ ger plugin which allows various implement@@ ations about plug @-@ ins . &quot;
&quot; currently only one plugin is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; in@@ quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; add . &quot;
the use of the de@@ bug@@ ger for a project begins with the selection of a suitable de@@ bug@@ ger plug @-@ in in the project settings . with the Options button next to the de@@ bug@@ ger plug @-@ in order you can change the specific settings .
&quot; if a de@@ bug@@ ger is activated , some additional elements appear in the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ user interface : &quot;
a view that is displayed in the content of over@@ grown variables . usually appears in the left dock .
a view that are listed in all half @-@ points with time numbers and conditions are usually listed in the lower Dock .
a view that is shown in the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bug@@ ger . usually appears in the lower dock .
&quot; depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bug@@ ger , everything or part of the following functionality is available . &quot;
&quot; with this action , the connection is required to de@@ bug@@ ger if necessary , or it shares the plugin to listen to de@@ bug@@ ging requirements . this action is trig@@ ger@@ ed by default if a project is opened , that a project must not be respected for a de@@ bug@@ ger . &quot;
the counter@@ part to de@@ bug@@ ging session Start the session . close the connection to the de@@ bug@@ ger or ends the fol@@ i@@ ries according to your requirements .
send a HTTP request to the server to transfer a de@@ bug requirement . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this requirement is displayed in the view de@@ bug@@ ger issue .
&quot; indicates the de@@ bug@@ ger , with the execution of the script to begin and information about the over@@ grown variables , as well as the current line will begin to send . if this happens during the script will continue , the script starts with the request . &quot;
&quot; if this de@@ bug@@ ger indicates the de@@ bug@@ ger to begin with the execution of the script , without information about over@@ grown variables and the current time number , running the version runs even before a de@@ bug@@ ging begins , running the execution as soon as a requirement is provided . &quot;
the de@@ bug@@ ger will take the next statement in the script without address the functions or includes .
&quot; the de@@ bug@@ ger will take the next statement in the script , whereby if possible functions and includes one in error @-@ adjusted . &quot;
&quot; indicates the de@@ bug@@ ger to move the directive and go to the next one , as if there were the current not . &quot;
opens a dialogue which can be monitored in which a variable or an expression can be monitored . the super@@ vised value appears in the variable view .
this dialog can be entered a variable or set a new value to a variable .

&quot; this chapter describes how you can adjust &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , adapt to your needs and how to help you &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; can help better . &quot;
&quot; documentation Typ@@ es ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , to provide support for mark@@ up and script@@ ing languages as well as &amp; CSS . you enable &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; skills like car understanding and node ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web@@ developer , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; s &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two ways , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages or &amp; CSS . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing D@@ TD . see in for details about the conversion . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how equin@@ XML files are to create , then the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tive ; and also tool@@ bars . short , one &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; &quot;
&quot; Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes of tags as well as the layout and content of the Features@@ Rec@@ ent , the &amp; tem@@ ap@@ l@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; &quot;
&quot; tag files are nothing as a folder . it only contain the &amp; tem@@ at@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag files bear the name of the certificate language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict ) &quot;
&quot; the table below lists the elements of the diary and declar@@ es whether they are necessary , or not . although not all necessary , it is advis@@ able to use as many as possible , so many users have better insight and more information about working with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limits is set in simple way .
&quot; this is the root element of a meeting document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains nothing but only element type about himself . &quot;
the type of tags is a script function . when using it &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only for the conference class . the name of the ground@@ class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only for the type method valid . returns the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the day has a common attribute group and the attributes within this tags can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 ) &quot;
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; -@@ Day . this is an element type element .
&quot; describes a attribute of a tags . this element can only occur once for each attribute . additionally , it specif@@ ies the name and type of the attribute . additionally , it contains more tags to describe how this attribute should be displayed &amp; etc ; This is a single element item element . &quot;
returns the source code for the comp@@ artment for the attributes in the Day of Edit@@ or@@ dialog and in the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; is used for reaching the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p inter@@ name within &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is used to achieve the data source .
&quot; requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a cutting and method name . the arguments that have been handed over to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tags . &quot;
a container day that group@@ ed the elements of a list together . it can only occur for an attribute description only once . it is a only element type element .
specif@@ ies the position of the attribute of a tags in a dialogue . this day can occur in a dialog only once ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; -@@ day ) . the item is empty .
returns the position and size of a field in dialogue . this day should be present for each field in dialogue ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Day ) . this item is empty .
gives a list of elements that may occur inside the defined tags . this element is an element type .
returns a list of elements that end a day . this element is an element type .
all equin@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; -@@ declar@@ ations : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 enco@@ ding = U@@ TF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be neat and closed .
&quot; spaces influence nothing but pay attention &amp; lt ; notes , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; note ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; replaced , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
&quot; to review the equin@@ XML files is the tools dialogue at the top of the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ window to start and check out Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . another dialogue will appear , whose simple instructions will follow . &quot;
this function is currently not available . currently the review takes place only when loading the diary files in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us .
in the following an example of a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes it &amp; lt ; sch@@ ema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3C ; &amp; XML ; -@@ sch@@ ema . the fil@@ ename for this Tag@@ XML file is supposed to be schem@@ a.@@ day .
the following an example of a working family 2 diary file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; over@@ la@@ de function is described . the fil@@ ename of this Tag@@ XML file is to be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; enco@@ ding = &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; function &quot;
the &amp; rep@@ ut@@ r@@ c ; -@@ file is just pretty simple and there is an editor to be easily accessible via D@@ TD settings . this enables di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ ption ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; Version = Use 1 for &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for every higher version . name = D@@ TD HTML 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ it@@ ional / / EN ) nickname = The simpl@@ ified name of D@@ TD . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ it@@ ional ) . if not specified , the name is used as a nickname . &quot;
a action can set up with settings actions ... click New Action leads to the same dialog :
this action is assigned to the keyboard short@@ cut . by clicking the user can be assigned a keyboard short@@ cut ; with K@@ one is the current short@@ cuts removable .
the simpl@@ est promotions . it can be entered a text in the details settings and in execution of action will be inserted in the document on the current cursor position . see the example below .
&quot; this is the most powerful action sty@@ p . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that can change the document or use it as input ( or parts of the document ) ; themselves are the quick start @-@ dialog box or the various see in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ EP@@ s . &quot;
&quot; first , the name of the script and interpre@@ ter will be given . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Script@@ .@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; although qualified paths allows , it is recommended to use the % script@@ able variable in the command line : global Script file : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / quantitative / script / apps / quant@@ a / Scri@@ pts in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variations that can be used in the command line : &quot;
% f : we replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file file : / from the document name .
&quot; % p@@ id : is replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; only one instance is replaced , the text is unique to the P@@ ID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from external script . &quot;
&quot; the parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ ename of the current document or the path to the project . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the above mentioned methods , a script can be accepted by &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; on the default input . in the input field you may be determined what to send to the default task . possibilities are : &quot;
selected text : the selected range of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is normally sensible with this setting .
&quot; according to the input , the output of the completed application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types issue : normal output , written to the default issue . it can be specified on the standard edition written by clicking the default issue issue is set to : &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups . it is necessary to create a own toolbar . in the given case it is not too many , therefore you can create a toolbar with the name of the watch . &quot;
&quot; once a toolbar is added , you need to add actions and configure . select settings . &quot;
the parts of this window are rather self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts the Edit mode .
fill out all the required fields and add the day to the right toolbar .
&quot; complete all and , if the day attribute has and you can plan your use , enable dialogue &quot; &quot; Day &quot; &quot; if available , so that an input when using the action is possible . &quot;
Ig@@ itt ! is this an ugly symbol . who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol ? we replace it before we have difficulties .
&quot; to create a symbol that action is better represented , we will use &amp; k@@ icon@@ edit ; , graphics other programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ icon@@ edit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size . &quot;
&quot; please note that the historical symbol does not only help you remember what the action does , but also to all other users of &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to that the day start , I decided to create a start@@ up as a symbol . through the use of green ( green is mostly interpreted ) , or if at least , a message to the user will be sign@@ aled that An@@ clicking this symbol is a &amp; lt ; start to start the day in the current document . &quot;
&quot; after the creation of the symbol it must be associated with the action . this happens over the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; ) and selecting the desired action . besides the text field is a button , press it . &quot;
&quot; select the folder in which the stored icon is , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; push the user button and continue with other tags , so there are still what you are , or confirm with OK to complete . &quot;
&quot; suppose you want to complement a few usual &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ functions to the toolbar , or it should be used for better overview of some tr@@ acking in multiple groups . do you open the tool@@ box . make sure that the required toolbar can be selected . &quot;
&quot; I would like to select the denom@@ in@@ ator ( completely left top ) for my toolbar . after selecting the item which is to be added to the toolbar , push the arrow key to the right . this adds the item to the toolbar . &quot;
&quot; for example , I would like to preview the fast way to access the Con@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add it to the toolbar . &quot;
&quot; please note that the denom@@ in@@ ator does not know the group@@ ing . someone who does not know my toolbar , could believe that the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; kno@@ b the opposite of the start @-@ button . &quot;
&quot; the new toolbar must be tested by means of all symbols , to ensure that everything works . &quot;
&quot; once you do not exist in the right folder . after new XML will not exist , but your toolbar item ( s ) should be saved in the right folder ( s ) should be loaded in the right folder ( s ) if a file is opened from the respective type . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the mentioned extension of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the normal user is the ability to add documentation for the script@@ ing language or the formatt@@ ing language , which you may most like , as I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use . &quot;
&quot; before you start your own documentation , you could examine in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Re@@ pository , whether someone can already done for you . &quot;
there are two parts in this process . first you need to create an existing documentation for the formatt@@ ing / script / etc ; -@@ language . then you need to create the doc@@ r@@ c file . then you have to let the second part we handle here .

the section tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example you can see now in the &amp; PHP ; documentation like something :
# KDE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element Top Element = PHP 4.2 Table of Cont@@ ents = index@@ .html G@@ etting Start@@ ed = Intro@@ duction
note the # before G@@ etting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . it shows that there are sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the box of box ( except for reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
you notice that the contents of the directory is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consistent with the upper end of the construction projects &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is displayed ! ) .
&quot; spaces influence nothing , but pay attention to &amp; and &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us . &quot;
&quot; the in@@ cision section is the area of the doc@@ r@@ c file , which is intended to be displayed in writing a &amp; PHP ; script the documentation for the m@@ ys@@ ql _ fetch _ array _ function . by marking the function , there would be the documentation right here . there are only two types of entries here : the context menu ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file connector . &quot;
&quot; a simple list of by Be@@ ist@@ rich isolated context @-@ elements which should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) . &quot;
now you can easily save your file doc@@ r@@ c and get to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ en / share / apps / quant@@ a / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / quantitative / doc for local or global use . then create a folder as doc@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
&quot; if you are sure that these well and it is worth to be shared , send your doc@@ r@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. what documentation have been used to use by the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ community . you will not be rich , but proud to have worked with the best web@@ design platform . &quot;
&quot; with quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the differenti@@ ated resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; resources can send by email to friends , partners or else to whom we send an email menu item , such as D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the Templates and in the scripts tree . &quot;
&quot; the resources can be up@@ loaded into our main archive , from where all others &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ users can download it . the contributions will be checked and only available when our team needs them as accurate and usable for the release . thus , the origin of the resources is guaranteed , both for our team and for later users . &quot;
&quot; when up@@ loading , you will be asked for your pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase for their private G@@ PG key ( the Pas@@ c@@ hr@@ ase will not be saved ) , or in the event that you have several keys to re@@ fill out the input fields ( URL news cannot be empty ) and clicking OK the up@@ loading . &quot;
&quot; up@@ loading is up@@ loading of the menus D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , and in the context menu of files and folders in the Templates and scripts tree . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , still before installation , studied &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the in@@ verse of the resource by checking the integrity and sign@@ age . if the integrity is given carefully and it can be broken down . please note the warning and the resource is displayed correctly , a message appears with the indication of the author of the resource . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work with XML @-@ languages which is currently not created by &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; it is necessary to work by using a D@@ TE@@ P package . it can be time consuming , because hundreds of day files in the day XML format may be necessary . there is the easiest way to convert a D@@ TD automatically into a D@@ TE@@ P package . &quot;
the conversion can be started by D@@ TD Download and Convert a D@@ TD . select the .@@ dt@@ d file with the D@@ TD description which is to be used . afterwards the following dialogue appears :
target directory : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / quant@@ a / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! DO@@ C@@ TYPE definition : the string that appear in the ! DO@@ C@@ TYPE tag as HTML P@@ UB@@ LI@@ C - / / W@@ 3C / / D@@ TD HTML 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ it@@ ional / / EN http : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / ht@@ ml@@ 4 / lo@@ os@@ e.@@ dt@@ d
&quot; tuning of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion , when activated , brings &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; after conversion the &amp; descri@@ p@@ c ; -@@ Editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this opportunity . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , there are some key concepts . to draw these to understand and fully familiar with these fundamental concepts . this chapter attempts to make them exactly these concepts , without their understanding &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; little benefit . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the work@@ space is divided into three sections : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction affects a number of components in &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us . &quot;
&quot; global elements are available for each , the &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us , available . from tool@@ bars about actions is everything that is marked globally , in the common folder structure of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this allows the group of administ@@ rators various tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in global tree , which will be available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment . &quot;
local elements provide a personal collection of web developers for a single user . these are the user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
&quot; project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be done everything from &amp; CSS ; -@@ patterns to the files of a particular project . simply said , this is the most restricted size of the project , which is the common use of special tools and designs of all employees within the project . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main divisions : the Edit@@ ors window , the construction @-@ window to provide information and tools . please check in , and for more information on these areas . &quot;
&quot; you can click the Kart@@ ei@@ re@@ iter with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document pass@@ able entries , such as close the current , other or all Kart@@ ei@@ re@@ iter , jump to a bookmark or execution of CV@@ S commands to the current document . &quot;
&quot; legal links in the Edit@@ or@@ area lead to another context menu on the specified document contents , such as basic adapt@@ ations to the word under the mouse button , help to the word under the mouse button , or opening the file when the string is described under the mouse button . &quot;
&quot; at the top end of the Edit@@ ors there are the tool@@ bars of the Edit@@ ors . currently , &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ it@@ ional is shown as standard for which a set of tool@@ bars are shown . in the course of the further expansion of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the tool will be adapted to the new functions and the associated user needs . &quot;
&quot; the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if they want to insert a simple day , for example , click on the icon which the day is represented . now they can insert the data for this just added day . if they are a day that has several attributes , you can fill in a dialog different fields . &quot;
&quot; the buil@@ ders ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow you to open and navigate into the information about &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to be able to open and stri@@ ps . in the representation of mapping files are available for files , project , templates , scripts , attributes , and documentation . &quot;
&quot; project management is a powerful tool that presents &amp; quantitative tool . this view shows all the files in the project and allows the managing files in the project by means of right mouse click . actions such as add , remove , up@@ loading or delet@@ ing the files from the storage medium can be carried out with the quoted context menu . &quot;
&quot; a further way of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , programming , a whole website &amp; etc ; it stand all possibilities . &quot;
templates can be divided into three categories depending on which the connection they are used . the category depends only for the corresponding user and templates in projects are available only in the project . more on templates is to be found in .
&quot; here you will find information about the available script languages . the concept of break@@ down in Global , local and project also works here . by clicking on the left mouse button , you can link the available information to a script via the right mouse button , such as the script will start , edit or send with an email . &quot;
&quot; with this view , one shows the internal structure of the active document . through links @-@ clicking it is set the cursor in the document to the position of the item . by Right Click the tab opens a list of commands in relation to navigation and refres@@ her of the tree . &quot;
&quot; this tree appears under the other construction of construction . with it , man@@ sw@@ ift attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces change . it enables the modification of all available attributes with few clicks . &quot;
&quot; here is the complete documentation on the web technology for your development to find . it can be downloaded documentation for &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &apos; documentation site , you can create own documentation , and add a folder link to a project may be edited and considered a project @-@ specific documentation . &quot;
&quot; the default information can be reached by default , at the bottom of the window , at the bottom of the window , which can be reached via the user window and the problem of the problem . &quot;
this Kart@@ ei@@ re@@ iter shows information about each in Qu@@ anta running script . for example the D@@ TD of the current document changes and all changes to the D@@ TD .
&quot; this Kart@@ ei@@ re@@ iter shows all the errors in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; scripts which are executed , give all error messages ( such as there are ) in this window . &quot;
the &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they obtain the appropriate command . the ch@@ ocol@@ ates of the tool@@ bars is the possibility to define own commands as symbols in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us .
&quot; a further function of &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; is the ability to send a toolbar with E@@ Mail . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; send the toolbar as a compressed T@@ ar archive via &amp; K@@ mail ; . if they get a toolbar in an E@@ Mail , they can secure it in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; as any other back and load ! &quot;
it is reasonable if you want to custom@@ ize the place of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; files on your system will be able to provide a complete list of options that can be connected to the configure script .
&quot; if you have trouble passing by &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , you should check whether your path contains the &amp; KDE ; 3 am folders . also you should make sure that does not apply any older version of &amp; KDE ; 3 in P@@ AT@@ H before her bin folder is the same for &amp; Q@@ t ; &quot;
&amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; is a web @-@ develop@@ mental tool for the KDE surface . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; was optimized for a rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
&quot; during the effort , the best &amp; HTML ; -@@ Editor to create , the developers of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us were to deal with a close idea ; a stand@@ alone , expand@@ able Mark@@ up languages would be ? well , this would make him absolutely great Web development tool for &amp; KDE ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; no longer limited to re@@ ines &amp; HTML ; it is limited to the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . together , if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then it should be in &amp; XML ; it should be the appropriate &amp; IDE ; for this purpose . &quot;
&quot; now , to the above mentioned demand has to be arrested , that &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this is based in good use of free software , the idea of Why developments , which has been developed for someone else ? thanks to the &amp; KDE ; -@@ rum@@ our is not only this possible but it allows users and developers , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to expand how they need it for their needs . &quot;
&amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; allows Web@@ developers the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document interface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can increase productivity dramatically . through the program com@@ mander they can notice them &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; ( more about it can be found in . )
&amp; quantitative a ; Plus ; is a web@@ development environment for HTML and related languages . it has been designed for a fast web development and was quickly expanded with many powerful functions .
&amp; quantitative a ; Plus is in any way associated with commercial versions of &amp; quantitative ; connected . the original developers left the GPL @-@ licensed version and produced a commercial program .
&quot; more in the details of the documentation is available with help : / quantitative a ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / quantitative a ) . &quot;
&amp; quantitative ; is currently being developed and maintained by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon sequ@@ it@@ ur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; access list of files that you have opened . this list is modified every@@ time when you open a file , which is not out of the oldest entry . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to store code parts and whole files as templates for later use . if they try to store the selected file / text outside the local / project pre@@ sup@@ porter , only an error is reported . &quot;
&quot; when inser@@ tion of the clip@@ board there are special characters to &amp; HTML ; note , so that they are correctly shown correctly and not understood by the browser as formatt@@ ing assignment . &quot;
convert the text from the clip@@ board in &amp; URL ; -@@ Sch@@ hr@@ ase which is the correct way to the inser@@ tion of special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s is primarily used for inser@@ ting &amp; URL ; s into the anchor day .
&quot; off the block@@ selection of or from . this allows you to select text blocks , with the help of the &amp; Shift ; taste . &quot;
goes directly to a time number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; -@@ script bug@@ ging there !
seek a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined phrases to help you .
displays the window window or not . this is the window in which you can see the display of scripts and de@@ bug@@ ger .
exit and switching of the problem of the lower edge of the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main storage of the problem is activated once you switch to the structural tree .
displays the symb@@ i@@ old left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
&quot; if there is book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu together with the entries , depending on the position of the cursor in the document . &quot;
bookmark the documents appear in the menu according to the fil@@ ename of the other documents .
opens a existing project from hard disk . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ projects are stored with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog to calculate files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
&quot; searches the project directory according to new files that could be there . that allows , e.g. graphics files in your project folders or sub@@ folder and add them to the project . &quot;
loads the files in your project on the server high . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; KDE ; and if you have downloaded more settings / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings like &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; the project managed . in chapter &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Projects you will find the details .
loads a project speed . these are kept in project / tool@@ bars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned it to this project .
a dialog to save your tool@@ bars . allows you to select the type of toolbar : local or project .
opens a dialog to add a new toolbar . this creates only the name . actions must be stored by means of settings .
&quot; remove a toolbar from the sight . this does not delete it from the hard drive . if you have not saved the toolbar , you will be asked if you want to do that . &quot;
&quot; so you can send your own toolbar to someone ( maybe at the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Team , so that the toolbar can be present in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new e @-@ mail message with the toolbar . &quot;
allows up@@ loading of tool@@ bars to the main server where everyone can access it . see in .
download a &amp; D@@ TD ; that you or anyone else has made and convert into the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; own label format .
&quot; un@@ loading of the de@@ ities from the &amp; D@@ TD ; it is useful if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; to ren@@ ew , without the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this global is not present and a copy of the global KDE folder is not present , fail the store . &quot;
&quot; this menu features a list of tags that are available in the currently charged toolbar . if the standard is loaded ( HTML ; ) toolbar , there are in the tags menu a sub@@ menu standard , which contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar . &quot;
&quot; allows access to the current day input dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the menu tags , followed by &amp; D@@ TD ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus . &quot;
&quot; currently , the intelligent inser@@ tion of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ tion means that &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the inser@@ ters using toolbar , if this day is contra@@ di@@ cted in this place to the rules . &quot;
in the plug @-@ ins menu the available plugins are listed below the listed menu items . please click on it . click the activated plugin de@@ activated .
select the syn@@ dic@@ ular mode for the current file . the list of available Her@@ vor@@ he@@ b@@ acking schem@@ ata depends on the k@@ ate ; -@@ version .
select the type of time ident@@ ifier . very useful if you know people to use other OS platforms for de@@ bug@@ ging . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh . &quot;
checks the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; D@@ TD ; by means of external application tidy .
&quot; immediate switch between the different types of the user interface . through some limitations in KDE @-@ libraries , the envelop@@ e can sometimes use or un@@ nice graphics . recommended is the mapping mode , which is also the default mode , which is the display at &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; 3.2 and earlier . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this menu provides an entry menu for each open sub@@ window . with a selection of the entry , the corresponding sub@@ window will be activated . &quot;
&quot; off the display of the status , at the bottom of the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main road or off . &quot;
&quot; the changes in this dialog influenced every application to use the K@@ HTML part , including &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Web@@ browser . &quot;
Set the behavior of the Edit@@ ors . in the documentation of &amp; Kate ; can be found details .
a dialog appears in which you can delete entries from the toolbar or which can add and change the sequences .
&quot; this should create a help according to the environment of the mouse cursor , but is not yet implemented . &quot;
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and freely licensed but as with any open source project the developers can always support help . if they want to support the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ development in financial form can be found here .
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be completed at the top of the project , as after filling the project called the whole directory structure for the rest of the project will be completed automatically with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties can be set . &quot;
&quot; here is the name for the project to enter , for example foo . when you enter name , file is automatically filled . &quot;
this is the name of the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; proje@@ ctors . by default it has the name of the project in small letters and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
&quot; here you can access the server address of the machine that you want to access , one , except for processed local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exempl@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible . &quot;
lets you be empty this field below the default settings of the selected prot@@ ocols may be used . depending on the adjustment of the remote host could be an adaptation necessary .
&quot; this is the folder in which the templates for the project is stored . it is a relative path to the project and default . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder in which the tool will be saved for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
this allows files to include files from local files@@ ystem to the project . there can be multiple files or whole folder .
&quot; this setting is great if you have static web , which one would like to download and change . in serial scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to go differently . &quot;
&quot; to leave , if files that are somewhere in the main folder of the project . if a project is started on new , not An@@ ger . &quot;
this option will display all the files and folders within the main folder and you can make a detailed selection of vou@@ chers .
&quot; this shows a list of files in the main folder . one can select the desired files by clicking or , by removing the h@@ amm@@ ing , cl@@ amps from the project . &quot;
&quot; the last screen of the new project assistant contains three settings that simpl@@ ify your work . these settings can be up@@ loading in the menu with project properties in the menu profile , or with the short@@ cut Shift ; F@@ 7 . &quot;
some settings correspond to those in the project assist@@ ants and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames can be found in project @-@ related operations such as a project folder .
&quot; additional option to above , even files that are listed in .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore , are excluded from the project . &quot;
the project view that will be loaded in opening the project . in case there can be read more about project insights .
thus the desired de@@ bug@@ ger can be selected only . more information about Gu@@ bed can be found in . the de@@ bug@@ ger plug can be set in . the de@@ bug@@ ger plugin can be set with the Options button .
&quot; up@@ loading profile can be adjusted in the sub@@ window profiles ( see in ) , as well as the display of a design view for the content of the server for any profile , being stopped for any profile . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window configuration you can add project members , edited or deleted as well as a ma@@ iling list . see in the details . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window event , one can switch @-@ up event and add these actions , change or delete . event can be executed when a previously defined event occurs , such as the en@@ rich one file . see in the details . &quot;
&quot; by default &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; the last project , which was open . this behavior can currently not influence . &quot;
to open another project ... from the menu project or the icon Project open from the toolbar . the dialog project will be displayed and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as enlargement .
&quot; if &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; closed , the project file is automatically saved . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , if &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; changed files . same happens when you download a new project . &quot;
the proje@@ ct@@ iveness gives free access to the files in the project . there can be managed to manage files in the current project .
folder will be as well as entries opening and opening with ... in the right mouse button at the context menu :
here you can export different profiles . the profile contains information about the place of high @-@ images files .
&quot; enables the removal of the current profile . if only more a profile is present , the button will be hidden in order to remove the remove . &quot;
the password will be kept in the core memory and forget about programming . this possibility is useful when common up@@ loading files is necessary and the rather in@@ secure password on the plate is not saved .
&quot; this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your opinion in front of the up@@ loading . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us , many high@@ lighting profiles can be created and thus to upload the project ( or parts of the project ) to different servers . when working or create a profile will display this dialog : &quot;
this is the name of the server to which the files will be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address function .
the transfer protocol for the up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; KDE ; and the installed K@@ IO sl@@ aves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( locally ) and n@@ fs . &quot;
the port for transfer . usually this does not have to change except the network administrator operates a service not at the usual port .
&quot; depending on your anxiety , this is either a time @-@ saving function or danger . use them on the record , so that it is not easy to read , but everyone with programming kn@@ ives can be easily seen in the plain text . &quot;
a project view is only one set of files and tool@@ bars . it can be loaded in a project many views that can be loaded in a project by simply di@@ ver the view and replace the current files and tool@@ bars .
views can be opened or deleted in the menu Project or the Project toolbar .
&quot; this chapter describes the parts of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , with which one has to do most . this helps not only increase productivity but also allows adjustment of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to the own working method . &quot;
as mentioned above are tool@@ bars in &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; best via the menu tool@@ bars are designed . use and add @-@ to : adding tool@@ bars is treated below in the section add @-@ button .
&quot; the tool@@ bars and the symbols can be configured either by using context menu ( right click on the toolbar ) , can remove other actions such as tool@@ bar , allowing other actions such as toolbar , which can be specified in the dialog , where actions can be seen on this or other tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a toolbar , in addition the entries will remove action and action processed , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
the tool@@ bars and actions on them can set up in the menu with settings tool@@ bars ... and settings actions can be set .
&quot; templates are in essential document@@ aries , code sh@@ aks and files to connect . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used templates basically , such as an exercis@@ ed files@@ ystem with expanded organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or any on the system existing directory in the pre @-@ tree surface . templates have been in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in about the limitations that you set up for the files@@ ystem . &quot;
some with &amp; quantitative templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions at the beginning of each template at the beginning of each template .
&quot; bin@@ ary is all that is not pur@@ er text . it can be added any file except text , so images , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; bin@@ ary . some examples can be found in the pre @-@ tree surface under global templates . &quot;
documents can be created by any text file . on the basis of these templates you can create new documents for the purpose and organized the work in appropriate manner to be efficient . some examples can be found in the pre @-@ store space under global templates . see in for more information on the templates .
this type of templates is useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text area always be inserted into the documents . you can find everything from a comment on a complete menu item on Javascript or Perl base . see some examples in the pre @-@ store space under global templates . see in for more information about the Templates tree .
&quot; as the name says , these templates are organized for all sites as templates . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a press structure ; currently there are no examples in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us . &quot;
&quot; create a document structure according to Bel@@ ie@@ ben ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) , and select a file as a template as a template store .... &quot;
&quot; once the happen is , notice that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) , the template is not visible in the project tree . &quot;
&quot; select text in your document and click File As a template store as a local / project location . alternatively , the selection can easily be drawn with pul@@ ling and deriv@@ atives on the design @-@ view templates . &quot;
&quot; the creation of bin@@ ary templates is simple : the file can only be used in a pre @-@ storage folder . it can be used all the file system functions , such as dial and deriv@@ atives or paste over the file area of Kon@@ quer@@ or . &quot;
&quot; one can select in the file area or in the project files to a folder on the right and secure site template , secure a name for the template and secure by default , but of course it can be stored as local or global template . &quot;
&quot; project managers make a very specific @-@ oriented adv@@ ancement . you can insert head@@ lines and foot@@ ers , or dynam@@ ically connect with them . additionally , you can insert some things when using templates in projects very profound . &quot;
the pre @-@ store structure in the sub@@ window Templates is based on the $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / quantitative and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ en / share / apps / quant@@ a / m@@ ou@@ p files . each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of container , as described above . &quot;
to set the behavior of a folder is set to click the folder with the right mouse button to click the folder and select in the context menu Properties . the following dialog appears :
&quot; a selection of these types with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is hidden , as soon as El@@ ter@@ matic attributes are stopped . &quot;
&quot; this is enabled by default and adapted for anything but the stem cell in the pre @-@ store survey . if a trunk folder would be dis@@ abling , unless they would be explicitly activated . in case of a normal folder , the bl@@ ah would be explicitly activated with something like Text @-@ bau@@ stein . if nothing appears , there is probably in a trunk @-@ folder . &quot;
allows for a previous or recorded text for templates in this folder . this could be general head@@ lines or foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project and enables copying of ingredients to be used in a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ ers .
&quot; in addition , one can display the context menu ( there@@ on display , right mouse button press ) via a full command collection for adding folders or copy and insert templates from one place to another . &quot;
&amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor that are accessible via the menu View . the first mode re@@ places the source window in two parts : the source @-@ editor and the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor .
the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor works as follows : he invites you a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; XHTML ; page and a cursor to the source code that can be seen in which the completed changes in the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor are visible in the source code .
&quot; when working with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor to a document , which contains a small green symbol the V@@ oh@@ and@@ al of &amp; PHP ; -@@ source code . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor to edit , is continuing the source code editor . there is no plans to change this behavior . &quot;
&quot; the second mode is just like the first , except that simultaneously the changes in the source @-@ editor and the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor is visible and the cursor of F@@ 9 , this mode is already active , the keyboard short@@ cut the active cursor from a window to another , whereby the position in the document will be retain@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the synchron@@ ization range between the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and the source text editor can be set in addition to settings Qu@@ anta .... after choosing V@@ PL ; -@@ view it can be set between synchron@@ ization after one click or automatically . in addition , the recommendation can also be adjusted for quick computer and a big sp@@ oon for slow . &quot;
&quot; suppose you want to change the title of the website , tools is possible to choose from the invisible tags in working with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor is also called once a new document with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor is also created . this can be used as a new document with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor , it is possible to change the following : &quot;
&quot; met@@ a tags , storage of information about the document itself , e.g. keywords for internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons at the bottom or removed . one click into the list allows modification of content , e.g. key words on the column name and keyword key . &quot;
CSS @-@ rules are the new way to design the creation of sites in the browser . you can add CSS @-@ rules with the buttons under the list or delete a change on the list is exactly as with the met@@ a @-@ elements . the processing of CSS rules is currently not supported .
&quot; it is possible to connect to an external CSS style , by clicking on the file button and select the corresponding file . &quot;
&quot; the use of the cursor is as usual in a text processing , possible by filling with the arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the cursor acts as usual . text can be inserted by typ@@ ing or removal or removal . &quot;
&quot; the inser@@ tion of tags is made in the same way over the tool@@ bars , as in the source text editor , it is to note that the inser@@ tion of tags before existing identical tags will not be removed e.g. when an anchor day , surrounded by text must be removed with text , any other surrounding an@@ ker day will be removed . &quot;
some tool@@ bars like the tables @-@ Assistent or the lists are disabled . you will be able to work later in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release the tables or lists can be used .
&amp; x@@ sl@@ db@@ g ; is a tool for the examination of styl@@ ish@@ ings . in contrast to other programs for styl@@ istic periods the search for certain elements can be possible and the execution of the style of style can be pursued .
&quot; to be able to comp@@ ile &amp; x@@ sl@@ db@@ g ; successfully compiled , apart &amp; KDE ; still the libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ bex@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ xml , which are already present at a typical installation of &amp; KDE . &quot;

there are many graphical tools for the same . why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me tell me briefly why I have written .
&quot; the mer@@ ging was very complicated , because one of the contrib@@ ut@@ ors had done many changes and at the same time it had corre@@ cted many points in the same file . another programmer had changed a lot of conflicts in the same file . the result were numerous conflicts in interaction . &quot;
&quot; the program used by me only the changed rows , but I could not see what exactly had changed within these lines . and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation was changed . the mer@@ ging of these changes was a small night@@ mare . &quot;
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could be differences within a row and changes to white signs . later any amount of more useful functions were added .
&quot; if you want to compare the example fast text , just copy it into the clip@@ board and add it into one of the comparison window . &quot;
&quot; a function that made a lot of work was the same and mer@@ ging of folders . this feature turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , almost into a fully @-@ fle@@ d@@ ged file browser . &quot;
also 3 @-@ way connection is fully supported . this is useful when two persons are independent of each other at a piece of Ko@@ de work and make changes in the original file . in this editor you can even edit the result in the correct result . in this editor you can edit the result even directly . the screen@@ shots shows three Qu@@ ell files in conjunction with :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; helps you with the compar@@ isons and assem@@ ble complete folder . this screenshot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folder link :
&amp; C@@ diff@@ 3 ; indicates the exact differences and covers the possibilities of current color monitors . if you often have to check Ko@@ de you will like this function .
&quot; differences in white signs and tab@@ s are visible . if lines differ only in a certain number of white signs , one can see at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no trouble anymore , when Jem@@ and the dispos@@ ition changes . ) &quot;
&quot; when a file is equal , and the other is different in a line , then the color indicate which file is different . red color means that both files differ . &quot;
&quot; if all files have the same name , but in different folders , then you can easily facilitate the Tip@@ box by using only the fil@@ ename of the first file . example : &quot;
&quot; k@@ diff@@ 3 folder , and folder s@@ 1 folder s@@ 1 folder s@@ 1 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder &quot;
&quot; opening dialog enables manual inter@@ mitt@@ ing of fil@@ ename , the selection of the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a last modified file from the list . you need to enter no third file ; if you need to do the entry for C , the analysis of the differences will be performed with two files . &quot;
&quot; via the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the compar@@ isons or mer@@ ging of folders will be selected , for B and C , then a folder , then used &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ ename from A in the two other folders . &quot;
&quot; if inter@@ rupt@@ ing is crossed , the input field is active for target and can process it . however , it is not necessarily required to consolid@@ ate a output file . you can also get this step later in the stor@@ ing . &quot;
the set button opens a dialog with settings . here you can specify options before you start with the compar@@ isons / cohesion .
&quot; sometimes one does not want to compare all the file , but only parts of a text file . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to draw text parts from the clip@@ board to the active compar@@ ative window . the comparison will then you have to select files , you can easily connect the dialog with the de@@ duction button . &quot;
you can also use pul@@ ling and deriv@@ atives : simply drag a file from a files@@ ystem or selected text from a editor and let it fall over a comparison window .
&quot; what thought is behind it ? sometimes a file contains for example several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar files are , it would be a relatively large amount of effort ; it would have to add two relevant files , it would be in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; now you can just copy the relevant sections , paste and then compare the relevant sections . &quot;
note : currently you can do nothing from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the fall of text into a comparison window is supported .
&quot; warning : some editors interpre@@ t the dial and deriv@@ atives of text into another program as cutting and inser@@ tion ( instead of copying and paste ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost . &quot;
&quot; in the upper part of each text window , the Info @-@ line of the source window features the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ ename and the line number of the first visible row in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) E@@ de Info @-@ line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is to rest . then a small auxiliary window will show the full name . ) &quot;
&quot; the three source types are the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( this preferences can be changed via the settings menu ) . &quot;
&quot; when a difference is recognized , one can see in the color , what file is different . if both files differ . ( colour for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files . this is in the next section ( mer@@ ging ) well . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the text there is the link @-@ column . if differences were found , the column shows the corresponding color . in some programming languages where white signs is not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + ) , it is useful to only relevant to the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + ) , it is useful to only relevant changes only in string and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in few , rare parts . &quot;
&quot; the vertical line , which separates the combination @-@ column of the text , where the respective source file has no lines . if the fore@@ str@@ enum@@ eration is activated , the line is shown on a broken rows . &quot;
&quot; the result window ( among the comparison table ) also has a info line with the inscription output : , the fil@@ ename and &#91; hits &#93; when you have edited the result . usually it contains the automatic mer@@ ging already text , but often it contains conflicts . &quot;
! ! ! to all conflicts are resolved , this is saving off ! ! ! ( use the buttons to be re@@ deemed / un@@ solved conflict to find the remaining conflicts with the remaining conflicts . ) &quot;
&quot; if only two compar@@ isons , each difference is also a conflict which must be solved manually . &quot;
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows that marks the line belonging to the line in all windows and the first line of the group will not be visible . ) This group will then be highlighted in the color background color for the current area and each on the left will appear a black bars .
&quot; sometimes , through automatic mer@@ ging or through manual mach@@ ining no more line left in the group ; then no row is displayed in the Qu@@ el@@ ip . this text is not displayed in the final stored file , nor in a mark@@ er which you might want to copy and elsewhere . &quot;
&quot; the text &amp; lt ; summar@@ izing ; however , appears in the clip@@ board when you copy such text from the result window . go carefully with this function . &quot;
&quot; note : when selecting the sources indicate the options numbers or ignore C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are treated like white characters . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the keyboard and mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you are using one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys next to the bottom , at the beginning , end , Ctr@@ l @-@ beginning and Ctr@@ l @-@ end , you can also use it from other programs to navigate . &quot;
you can also use the other buttons to edit . using the paste button you can switch between inser@@ ts and over@@ writing mode . ( default is the entry ) .
a click with the left mouse button in one of the link columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the start of the respective group ( as already in the section called assem@@ bling and the ed@@ itable out@@ ga@@ ze declared ) .
the toolbar contains seven buttons to navigation with which you can jump to the latest / first / last difference to the next / previous conflict ( Ctr@@ l @-@ pictu@@ red / Ctr@@ l @-@ pictu@@ red ) or to the next / previous conflict ( Ctr@@ l @-@ pictu@@ red ) or to the next / pre @-@ pictu@@ red conflicts can continue to be regarded as a conflict . therefore it must be distinguished between sol@@ dered and un@@ solved conflicts .
&quot; to copy the mark@@ ings to the clip@@ board , you need to copy the copy button ( Ctr@@ l @-@ C or Ctr@@ l @-@ paste ) . &quot;
&quot; Unix flavors are stored in accordance with the underlying operating system . Unix flavors are used to use Wag@@ en@@ vor@@ sch@@ ub \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 reserves the pointer of source files to + Ze@@ il@@ en@@ vor@@ sch@@ ub \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 reserves the pointer of source files , so you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also does not use bin@@ aries . &quot;
the options and list of the most recently used files will automatically be saved and re@@ produced in the next start . ( menu Settings &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 set ... )
&quot; select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems the dialogue also presents fonts with variable width to choose , you should not use it . ) &quot;
&quot; if you activate this option , there are differences in cur@@ sive script@@ ures . if the chosen script does not support this presentation , nothing happens . &quot;
&quot; on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in its pure form but would be framed . on these systems the button pres@@ ets automatically poses an un@@ lock color . &quot;
&quot; if this option is enabled , when using the Tab@@ ulator , the appropriate number of spaces are inserted . otherwise , a tab@@ ulator will be inserted . &quot;
if you insert input or return the entry is automatically used for the next line .
if this option is enabled to specify any selection automatically into the clip@@ board . the manual copy into the clip@@ board then falls .
you can choose which line type you prefer to save . the default value is the generally usual selection on the operating system .
&quot; when the same of files tried &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , all completely identical lines in the source files . only during this first step , white signs can be ignored . in this step , white signs will not be ignored . &quot;
some editors ( on some systems ) store a wagon &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a row ; but then they could only be activated with different sizes in the side @-@ side @-@ side comparison ; but then they could be activated with different sizes in side @-@ to @-@ side . if this option must be activated . if this option must be disabled if this option must be disabled . in the default this option must be disabled .
&quot; in preference , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis the numbers and related signs ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . in the result the differences will be shown nevertheless , but they are treated like white signs . &quot;
in the pres@@ etting this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated as changes in white signs .
intensive after even smaller differences . the option is activated in default and large files but slow with very large files .
&quot; in the Auto @-@ continue mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection is shown before the next un@@ solved conflict will continue . &quot;
&quot; solve automatic all conflicts in white signs by selecting the selected file as a source . if you need this only from time to time , then take advantage of the functions of voters in numbers or comments , if the options ignore the numbers or ignore C / C + + -@@ comments . &quot;
these options are treated in chapter to scanning of folders and run a break@@ down . look for details under documentation to directory and co @-@ operation .
&quot; when a file is stored and already exists an older version , then the original version runs the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ or@@ ig . if already exists a back@@ up@@ file with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ or@@ ig , it will be deleted without further backup . &quot;
&quot; the change of this option does not fit the current current program . you need to stop and start the current program . ( this option is not available in the KDE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available , because the language is set globally over the control center . ) &quot;
the following co@@ di@@ zation settings can be adjusted for each entry separately . if you are activated this option is used for all entries the upper setting .
about the selection of the co@@ ding appears a short notice what the local co@@ ding is . ( this can not be changed here and has for you purely informal character . )
&quot; adjust the file enco@@ ding for source files . this influences , how special marks can be handled and interpreted as the co@@ ding for each file is individually adjusted , can be compared with different co@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; if you have edited a file , you can specify which enco@@ ding should be used for stor@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre @-@ processing errors , they may not work with your codec . ( for example , your files are 16 @-@ bit Un@@ ico@@ de , but the pre @-@ processing command can only be done with 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can specify the co@@ ding of the output of pre @-@ processing errors . &quot;
turn off to sup@@ press these changes in white signs in white signs in the text or over@@ view . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments when the options ignore or ignore C / C + + -@@ comments are activated . )
&quot; this selection is only available when you see three files . in normal mode , all differences are shown in a far@@ ed@@ itary over@@ lap column . however , B , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C , C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C , C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C , C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C , C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C , C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C
sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen for long lines . bl@@ ending simply the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu ) .
submit the comparison of each other or survi@@ ving . this can also be useful to the ads of long lines . ( this option is in the window @-@ menu ) .
&quot; sometimes you consider the differences and then decide to merge the files together . a simple click starts to merge the file name as a pre@@ set name for the output file . ( if this function is used to run the mer@@ ging file , then the name of the most recently used output file will be maintained . ) &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it will appear first to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own preferences that can adapt exactly your demands . you can use this function as well as to correct or correct the entry . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file it was given first to this external command ( see above ) , then the output of the command will be used only when using the command . you can write your own preferences that corresponds exactly to your demands . each input line must have a corresponding output line . &quot;
&quot; the thought behind it is to enable the user more flexibility when setting up the D@@ iff results . however , an external program needs to program , and most users do not want to program . the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l completely sufficient . &quot;
use this pre @-@ processing command for pointer to the input in large letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ n \ \ 1 / &apos; The \ \ 1 in the previous string refers to the found text in the first fra@@ ct@@ ures . the \ \ U conver@@ ts the found text in large letters .
CV@@ S and other version control systems use some keywords to add automatically generated character ( info : / c@@ vs _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \
&quot; while you experiment with sed , you might begin to understand it and maybe you like this regular expressions even . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
&quot; the ignor@@ ance of numbers is actually a built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of a further pre @-@ processing command for Ze@@ il@@ en@@ ab@@ rupt &apos; s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 678@@ 9@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; every sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is one , and everyone is replaced by nothing but practically deleted . &quot;
sometimes you might want to perform several considerations on once . then you can use the sem@@ icol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the requirements of each other .
instead of sed you can also use something different such as per@@ l . per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / Er@@ ment / switches &apos; aller@@ dings are available at per@@ l some details different . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs per@@ l only ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre@@ processor will maintain for the ad and to maintain the mer@@ ging . the other operations are only changing the data that is facing the Ze@@ il@@ en@@ ab@@ equ@@ als @-@ Al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus .
&quot; note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the pointer is the output of the normal pre @-@ processor as input . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function , the text changes or differences hidden , you can not notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case . &quot;
often programmers will deal with a folder many files . for this reason you can compare with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folder re@@ cur@@ sive and merge .
... &quot; makes for each object a proposal to assem@@ bling , you can adjust the proposal before the start , &quot;
... &quot; can sim@@ ulate the mer@@ ging and displays the simul@@ ated changes , without them really run , &quot;
... guides selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) .
this is the compar@@ isons and mer@@ ging of individual files very similar . you just need to specify folder on the command line or in the dialog file .
&quot; if three folders will be mer@@ ged , then folder is used as a base . if no target folder is used , used &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as the target folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , not the mer@@ ging . to select the connection , you need to select the appropriate menu item or press the F@@ 7 key . ( further details follow . ) &quot;
&quot; while reading the folder you will give you a little news window of the current progress . if you break the folder of the folder , only the files are listed until then compared . &quot;
&quot; when using the folder is complete , displays &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list of list with the results on the left side , ... &quot;
each file and each folder of the scan was found here is displayed here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is normally folded . you can double a folder by clicking on the + / - button or by pressing the arrow keys for left / right . the directory menu contains two functions all sub@@ directories and all sub@@ directories .
&quot; if you double click on a file , the file will be started and there will be a comparison window . &quot;
the icon in column Name reflects the aper@@ ity@@ p in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
&quot; if the file is different in the other folders , then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case the connection @-@ feet will not be automatically selected . if the mer@@ ging will be started , you will be informed about problems of this kind again . &quot;
&quot; as shown in the above picture , are used in the columns A / B / C the colors red , green , yellow and black . &quot;
&quot; identical entries , the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different . &quot;
&quot; folder will be considered as identical if their overall content is identical . then the same color will also be the same color . in folders , the age is ir@@ relevant for its color . &quot;
&quot; the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ diff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow is and later when it is old . &quot;
&quot; a and C identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; a and B are identical , but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; B and C identical , but not a : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... a , B and C do not have the same file bag ( e.g. if a folder and B is a file ) : error : contra@@ dict@@ ory file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects can exist , the mer@@ ging can not be started . &quot;
... A and B do not have the same file bag ( e.g. if a folder and B is a file ) : error : contra@@ dict@@ ory file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects can exist cannot be started .
&quot; the mode for syn@@ cing is active , if only two folders and no explicit target group have been specified and if the option directories are synchron@@ ise . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action is identical , so that both files are identical . if for an entry ... &quot;
&quot; a and B exist , but not identical are to lead and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ ename for the output file only B ; directly after mer@@ ging copies &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. ) &quot;
&quot; if two folders will be mer@@ ged together and select the option of new file ( uns@@ afe ) , then the date files and suggests the newer file to copy . if the files are different , but the date is identical .. As such mistakes can not be removed , the inter@@ ing of the folder can not be started . &quot;
&quot; while the mer@@ ging will be a file after the other . it &apos;s status column shows fer@@ rite , and according to other reports , when the mer@@ ging is completed , you should make a last check and see if the status has done anywhere in order . &quot;
&quot; if in the design dialog the file method is selected , K@@ Diff@@ 3 other columns . these contain number of un@@ sol@@ dered , deleted , not wel@@ der and white conflicts . ( the column for deleted conflicts will only be displayed if three folder are compared or mer@@ ged . ) &quot;
&quot; you can either run the selected entry ( file or Od@@ ner ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the assem@@ bler actions ( also in all sub@@ ordination ) , you can run the mer@@ ging . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you have no target folder , then in the three @-@ folder inter@@ connection mode C is used as the target and used to synchron@@ ize A and / or B as a goal . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected a target folder , please check whether all entries will be displayed in the folder structure , even in the folder structure . &quot;
to perform all entries : select directory containing directory / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cuts ) to execute the current element : select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
&quot; if by contra@@ dict@@ ory files still exist , a message appears that the faul@@ ty elements appears . you can select a valid action for them . &quot;
&quot; if you merge all entries , a dialog window will appear with the options , sim@@ ulate and v@@ om@@ iting . &quot;
choose simul@@ ating if you want to see what would be going to happen without the really changes . you will then get a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then perform certain actions with all entries . if a manual procedure is necessary ( merge a single file ) then opens a mer@@ ging window ( note the screenshot ) .
&quot; if you are ready to start with a file , please select directory cooperation / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you have not yet been saved , there will be an appropriate dialogue . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; his work with the next entry . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a mistake , a message and detailed status information . at the end of the list you will see some error messages that can help you to select the cause of the problem or solve the problem in any other way before you continue with the mer@@ ging . &quot;
&quot; if some entries have been selected individually , remember &amp; diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and results them together again . even if you do not saved the mer@@ ging promotion , these entries will be done again . only if you change the mer@@ ging promotion , these entries will be mer@@ ged again . &quot;
the Settings menu from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 set ... ) now has a section called directory connection with these options :
only files that fit on the specified pattern will be displayed in the elementary tree . separate the patterns with a sem@@ icol@@ on ; . valid space : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( such as * .c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) .
files and folders that correspond to this pattern will not be displayed in the elementary tree ; you can use the sem@@ icol@@ on ; as separ@@ ators . valid spac@@ er : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . pres@@ etting is * .@@ or@@ ig ; * .@@ O .
files and folders that correspond to this pattern will not be displayed in the elementary tree ; you can use the sem@@ icol@@ on ; as separ@@ ators . valid spac@@ er : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . pres@@ etting is * .@@ or@@ ig ; * .@@ O .
ignored files that may be ignored by CV@@ S . many aut@@ matic produced files are ignored by CV@@ S . the great advantage is that this folder is specific with a .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( look at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
&quot; in some files@@ ystems , files are marked a leading score . a file is marked as hidden . this option makes you decide whether these files are displayed in the elementary tree or not . this option is swit@@ ched on the default . &quot;
&quot; when links to files : when the option is swit@@ ched , symb@@ olic short@@ cuts is compared . if the option enabled , the files will be compared to which the links shown . this is de@@ activated in preference . &quot;
&quot; with links to folder : when the option is swit@@ ched , the symb@@ olic links are compared . if the option enabled , the links like normal folder will be treated and re@@ cur@@ sive . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not on possible record . ) This option will be swit@@ ched to a repository . ) This option is swit@@ ched in preference . &quot;
&quot; results in a complete analysis of each file by and displays the statistics columns . ( the number deleted , un@@ sol@@ dered , non @-@ whit@@ ish and white conflicts . ) The full analysis is sl@@ ower than a simple bin@@ ary analysis , and significantly sl@@ ower when they are applied to files that do not contain any text . ( enter an appropriate anti @-@ pattern ) . &quot;
&quot; if you compare big folder on a slow network , it may possibly be faster , only the chan@@ gel@@ og date and the file size . however , this speed does not cost you a certain level of security . please use caution . this option is set in preference . &quot;
&quot; similar to the chan@@ gel@@ og date . there is no real comparison . the files are considered identical if they are equal to , when copying the chan@@ gel@@ ing date . please use caution . this option is swit@@ ched in preference . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ating the synchron@@ ize mode when two folders are compared and no target folder is specified . in this mode , the proposals are identical to the mer@@ ging of files are stored in both folders . this option is shut down in the pres@@ etting . &quot;
&quot; if there are differences , instead the copying of the newer file is proposed as an action . ( this is considered uns@@ ure that the other file has not been changed . &quot;
&quot; if a file or folder is replaced by another or deleted , then the original version is ren@@ amed and gets the extension .@@ orig@@ ine . if an old backup file is already deleted . this also affects the normal mer@@ ging of individual files , not only the mer@@ ging @-@ fold folder . this option is swit@@ ched on the default . &quot;
&quot; normally , the folders link will remain visible from the mer@@ ging of individual files ; you can switch to the window of the mouse window . if you do not want to switch the option directory with the window menu and switch between a directory &amp; text window between the two views . &quot;
&quot; however , you prefer to compare a file with double @-@ clicking menu . however , there is a single file directly together with the folder menu . you can use a single file or run the file , will start the status of the folder and run the file will not start once again if you start the folder . &quot;
&quot; however , this status will be lost if you re@@ read the folder again : directory menu : new read &quot;
KDE supports mesh @-@ saving with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ Diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way you can specify files and folders for opening which are on local or remote computers .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one to a FTP server . the second command line is compar@@ es a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders . a few things should be considered :
a path can be relative . or .. included . this is not possible with URLs that these are always absolute .
&quot; ( # - &gt; % 23 , empty ) . for example , a file with the name / # foo # the URL file : / % 23@@ foo % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes due to the files@@ ystem on the server , sometimes through the protocol used . it follows a short list of constra@@ ints : &quot;
&quot; or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows . then a file is accepted as a link goal . ( FTP : , s@@ ftp : ) . &quot;
there is no way to deal with per@@ missions or modification of the date . hence you can get the elig@@ ibility or modification of the original . ( note the option trust@@ worthy of the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the main objective is currently available as the differences in K@@ De@@ velop . K@@ De@@ velop are first laun@@ ching the built @-@ in differences . to display K@@ Diff@@ 3 and then select the right mouse button of the differences and then select In K@@ Diff@@ user menu from the context menu .
&quot; usually needs &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . if it is used as K@@ part , takes a patch file in the Unified file . then one of the two files must exist . then , k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch has to restore the missing file . &quot;
in the cross @-@ section you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu item in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that it does not work if any of the original files exist . moreover it is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the generation of the patch file .
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports the compar@@ ing of two files , a very small toolbar and menu . the mer@@ ging or the same of folders will not be supported in the K@@ Part mode . &quot;
tools with the name K@@ D@@ iff and K@@ diff@@ 2 ( now he@@ w it is already it . also the name C@@ diff@@ 3 is already pointed out that it can lead together as the program diff@@ 3 out of the D@@ iff Tool collection .
I use GPL programs already very long and have learned a lot in the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programmers who went this way or go to it .
&quot; you have compiled the program from sources and configure the configure script , probably not the right pre@@ fix installed in / usr / local , but then KDE can not find resources for the user interfaces ( such as k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ ADM@@ E file you will find more information on this topic . &quot;
&quot; if only the number of white signs is different , these lines will be treated as identical ; if only a non @-@ white signs is different , the line will appear as not identical to each other , this &quot; is co@@ ed this &quot; is the case of the case . &quot;
&quot; the editor will notice any difference in the files where he begins and where he ends . this is necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking the source code and selecting the button , and it is too much effort to have an extra file format , which could store this information . &quot;
the effort for this was far too big . you can restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger quantities of text should be used another editor .
after removing text is suddenly there ; no sr@@ c lin@@ eg@@ t ; and the text can not be clear . what does it mean and how can that be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; already uses many colors to emphas@@ ize the difference . even more her@@ ons would be confusing and lack the purpose . use a different editor .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
&quot; to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need to use KDE , 3.1 or newer . &quot;
information on how to use K@@ Diff@@ user on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage .
a list of recent changes can be found at http : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ s@@ ource@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the Qu@@ ell package .
&quot; to comp@@ iling &amp; diff@@ use ; on a system with &amp; KDE ; to comp@@ ile and install , use the following command in the basic folder of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ Distribution : &quot;
&quot; KDE @-@ you will be installed in your system in which KDE is installed . if you are uns@@ ure , you will find further details in the RE@@ ADM@@ E file . &quot;
&quot; da &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake , you should not have problems with comp@@ iling . should still occur difficulties , please report on the following &amp; KDE ; -@@ ma@@ iling lists . &quot;
&quot; cutting ( Ctr@@ l @-@ X or Shift ) copies the text from the clip@@ board , insert the text from the clip@@ board to the current cursor position or replaced the current mark@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; only differences : files that are identical in all folders , do not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the folder . &quot;
( in the current program version you need to make changes to these options to folder the folder with the function Update . )
&quot; there will only be entries displayed , the differences will not be copied in the folder . if the target sub@@ folders will not be copied in the folder . ( the behavior will probably be cancelled in a later program version . ) This option is swit@@ ched in the default version . &quot;
&quot; note the buttons to choose from the source with the lab@@ eling A , B and C below the menu bar . if you are on one of the buttons to the end of the selected group in the repository ( if they are not already present ) . if the lines are already present , they are clicking on the button accordingly . &quot;
&quot; in preference , this option is disabled . under@@ slide in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white signs . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; shows a Min@@ iv@@ or@@ schau of all virtual surfaces . it is quite convenient to change the current programs on your desktop , to finish their size or move it . this works both within a work@@ space and more . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual work@@ space as well as in the ongoing applications . the applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others .
&quot; with the middle mouse button , window can be moved within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both within a work@@ space and other work@@ space . &quot;
&quot; the context menu depends on where the right mouse button drops click here : when on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; then click , the context menu appears just the two entries p@@ ager ; then click here , the symbol and the name of the application as well as entries minim@@ ize , maxim@@ ize , on desktop and finishing . &quot;
maxim@@ izing the application window to the full size of the desktop . only when applied to one application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . appears only when applied to one application .
&quot; is this approach , marked window within the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; s can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other desktop . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , you will appear in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the names of the virtual desktop . &quot;
&quot; cross @-@ crossing of this field lets the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the numbers of virtual work@@ space show . it is together with name to display , the names are equipped with folder you , &amp; eg ; 1st work@@ space . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , the background of each desktop is also shown as background in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , the current programs are displayed as small windows in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise , only the empty spaces are shown to make their choice . &quot;
&quot; here , the view of the program window will be selected . simply shows simple rect@@ angles with the pro@@ portions of the program window . icon shows a small view of the actual program . re@@ mark : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems . &quot;
&quot; here , the arrangement of the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager is to be determined : classic lets &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ n @-@ grid , shows all virtual work@@ spaces in a horizont@@ ally and per@@ pen@@ dic@@ ular in a vertical line which is very good for the representation on the desktop . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager @-@ mini@@ ature program . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size to display the windows as symbols or with its content . furthermore it runs outside the control bar .
click the right mouse button within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; and subsequent expressions of switch switches ... lets the dialog settings appear .
&quot; currently , this can not be changed in the dialog settings . you can do this manually : &quot;
&quot; open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor , e.g. &amp; ke@@ dit ; or VI@@ . if you do not have any writing permission for the file , you have to apply to your system root or write to your system admin . &quot;

&amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click as soon as the mouse cursor on the same place as soon as the mouse cursor on the same place . it is thought to help people who suffer from R@@ SI syndrome ( Re@@ pet@@ itive @-@ In@@ jury syndrome ) and which each mouse click pain .
&amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click on the same place as soon as the mouse cursor on the same place as soon as the mouse click pain . furthermore it is possible to em@@ ulate the pul@@ ling with the mouse . this does not require a bit of exercise .
&quot; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle pain , which is created while clicking the mouse , and helps so many people to connect the computer without pain . unfortunately , you can also find a doctor when using your computer you should have a doctor if this is not done . &quot;
&quot; in order to clear it once again : even if &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , pain helps when clicking with the mouse , it is against pain , which is caused by using the mouse , us@@ eless . and as with all ergonomic a@@ ids , the result may apply to everyone . &quot;
the use of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitor your mouse mot@@ ions and performs a mouse @-@ click as soon as you break the movement shortly .
&quot; if the smart shif@@ ting is activated , makes &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a break , after it is run down the mouse button . move the mouse , wait until the end of the movement before leaving the Los@@ ers requires a little exercise , but you get used quickly . &quot;
this verse @-@ time must cut out after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click excursion .
&quot; is Intellig@@ ent shif@@ ts swit@@ ched on , the revol@@ ving shif@@ ts ( 1 / 10 s ) are active . here the time will be adjusted , the shut@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after the download of the mouse button , before it leaves the mouse button again , if inter@@ tempor@@ al is no evidence of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; and km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now this feature is activated by mouse displac@@ ement . this function is enabled by a break , a click with the right mouse button . a long @-@ click . these movements are started in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ txt , if &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time will be started , but they can later be changed . &quot;
&quot; if the sound is del@@ ayed , you can cut &amp; KDE , to shor@@ ten the response time . open it on sound &amp; Multimedia , choose sound system and here the rider language . there is a sli@@ der sound bu@@ ffer to shor@@ ten you at a lower level to shor@@ ten the antenna times . &quot;
&quot; is this setting marks , is marked &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at each start of &amp; KDE . this function is currently only under &amp; KDE ; available . at GNO@@ ME or other window , please refer to the respective documentation to find out how to start there a program automatically . &quot;
sets all settings back to the values which were set when opening the dialogue . have you already pressed the button to adjust the settings on the state after the final pres@@ sures of users .
&quot; best use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , first with the pres@@ ets . especially the intelligent shif@@ ting you should first go off . if you get to the automatic mouse click here , you can later increase the smart shif@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to decrease the antenna times by &amp; KDE ; with sounds . &quot;
&quot; first , you should be aware of what places a mouse click without effect remains : clicking on the neutral components of windows or on places in the browser window , which does not represent a link , does not allow the mouse to park in such places until you want to use them again . &quot;
&quot; if your mouse ru@@ mm@@ ed , you should clean your mouse . this is usually quite simple . the trick is that you are not only the mouse button clean but also the roles that come into touch with the mouse . &quot;
&quot; first , you have to take the mouse button . as that happens , the mouse can be different from mouse to mouse . but it should quickly be clear when you see the under@@ side of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have the ball , you would have to see the roles . these are on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used . the dirt and the pollution can easily be scrat@@ ched with a flat blade or the F@@ ing@@ ern@@ ag@@ el . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations the operating system breaks the execution of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , if just a bit imp@@ ending is started . if you are in this case the smart shif@@ ts means that surgery can no longer end through the slogan of the mouse button . &quot;
this happens when you use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; using another window manager and move a window .
the solution to this problem is that you perform a mouse click . this is the status of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; reset and you can work as usual .
problem : if you enter the text I tried &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute Maus@@ icks and sets the cursor to another point .
&quot; solution : use the mouse to place the cursor , where you want to create it . however , the mouse on a neutral area of the working space , if you want to create a keyboard short@@ cut . secure zones for the mouse of mouse , and eg ; the gray areas around the tool@@ bars and menus and the head@@ lines of windows . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with the intelligent move , but I do not create it to edit text . &quot;
&quot; the intelligent sy@@ ll@@ ables is an advanced function of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it needs his time to mark the text to copy it into the clip@@ board , to insert it into the clip@@ board or to insert any other action . however , there will probably be some advice to them . here are some advice to them : &quot;
&quot; use the smart shif@@ ts not when you just start to use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use text instead , perform at an end of the text area a mouse click , while you move the mouse button to move the mouse button to the other end of the text and there again the mouse button again . &quot;
&quot; thus , use the audi@@ ble mouse click . thus , the mouse button de@@ pressing a sound like a mouse click . so you can know exactly when when intelligent moving the move . later you can use the intelligent shif@@ ting also without the audi@@ ble mouse click . however , it requires some exercise . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , use the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window ; it should be installed on most system . &quot;
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse is only available when the system has a sound@@ card and speaker and this is correct .
&amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; bet@@ s the mouse button as soon as the mouse cursor short ver@@ di@@ ced . this program has been developed for people who suffer from R@@ SI syndrome and to which the bet@@ s of the Mau@@ st@@ asten pain .
&amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured so that there is a certain time that is waiting for a certain time before the mouse button begins . in this way the accordion can also be carried out with the mouse .
you can find detailed user documentation with help : / km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ( enter either this &amp; URL ; in the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; a or start k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ) .

&amp; km@@ outh ; is a program that can speak to their computer for itself .
with the program &amp; km@@ outh ; can st@@ um@@ me user to speak the computer for itself . the user can choose from a list with the convers@@ ing propositions which are to be spoken again .
&quot; on the first page of the wiz@@ ard ( left screen@@ shots ) enter the command , which is later used for the voice issue of text . further details can be found in the description of the design . &quot;
&quot; on the second page you can select the default text file . from the text pass@@ over , you can often choose text passages without having to inter@@ mitt@@ ing them . the text passages can of course be processed . &quot;
&quot; on the third page ( right screen ) you define the dictionary for the Wor@@ ter@@ rac@@ euticals . &amp; km@@ outh , reads the KDE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of the individual words . &quot;
the main window of &amp; km@@ outh ; is clearly visible and contains essentially a input field for the key@@ ing@@ ing of your propositions ( the lower white box in the screen@@ shots ) and a deteri@@ or@@ bit of the already s@@ wollen sent@@ ences ( the upper white box in screen@@ shots ) .
&quot; if you have km@@ outh , correctly you have to enter the propositions you want to hear in the input field you want to hear . any given sentence is app@@ ended at the course memory . you can select from propositions which are to be spoken again . &quot;
&quot; with the menu @-@ entry settings km@@ outh ; setup ... open the opening dialog of &amp; km@@ outh ; . this dialog contains two cardboard boxes , voice edition and settings , the side of Wor@@ ter@@ rac@@ euticals and the site K@@ TT@@ SD @-@ language service . &quot;
&quot; in the input field of the card @-@ card , you give the command to call the language generator . in the input field below the input field , you will be shared with the text to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; km@@ outh ; knows two ways to pass on the text , select the text box when the text can be passed as default to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; if the c@@ ified field is not selected , the text is passed as parameter . you can also use the following wild@@ card : &quot;
of course the command is on the language version of your language generator . this command can be found in the documentation to your language generator . examples of this can be found in the anne@@ x .
&quot; with as possible to use as a language service , km@@ outh is a first attempt to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service , which provides a standardized interface for voice @-@ over@@ s and the choice of this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD will not be installed . &quot;
with the first selection of action after selecting a text track you determine what action is trig@@ ger@@ ed by the keyboard short@@ cut or by choosing a text track in the menu of text pass@@ agen@@ ers or in the body for text files .
&quot; with the selection of So@@ fort he will speak directly to the chosen text file , and in addition to the pres@@ enter . with the selection of In the input field the chosen text stops will initially only be entered into the input field . &quot;
&quot; with the second outlet field of the processing device for text pass@@ agen@@ ers , you can specify whether the text of the text file will be saved automatically . &quot;
&quot; in the selection of text passages , the book will be saved . if you choose modifications will not be saved , the text pass@@ agen@@ ers will not be saved . please select whether the text can be saved . &quot;
&quot; the website Wor@@ ter@@ rac@@ euticals contains a list of diction@@ aries for the Wor@@ ter@@ rac@@ euticals . in the main window next to the entry field shows &amp; km@@ outh , a selection , if this list can choose more than a dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons on the right side of the page you can delete diction@@ aries or add , the order of books change or export it into a file . below the list you can set in the input field the name and selecting the language for the dictionary . &quot;
&quot; select for this source the desired language ; &amp; km@@ outh , reads a . the frequency of each words is determined simply by count of an occurrence . additionally , you can add the wor@@ dl@@ ist with an Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary , to just add the words to the new dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with this option you can perform the available diction@@ aries . &amp; km@@ outh , asks , what diction@@ aries are mer@@ ged , and how it should be executed . &quot;
&quot; with this option you put a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; km@@ outh ; new entered words automatically into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your voc@@ abulary . &quot;
the main section of the window for the processing of text @-@ pass@@ over is divided . in the upper part the text sli@@ desh@@ ows are presented as tree structure .
&quot; in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text track , you can change the text track or the corresponding keyboard short@@ cut . if you have chosen a text file , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; add actions such as new lyrics or books add or delete selected text passages , either by selecting the menu on the menu bar , in the toolbar or via an elev@@ ators menu . &quot;
the order of text pass@@ over or text passages can be changed by drag@@ ging with the mouse to the new place or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; -@@ button .
the chosen text is cut out and copied into the clip@@ board . if in the input field is selected an text section is used to be the selected areas of the memory .
the chosen text is copied to the clip@@ board . if in the input field is selected an text section is used to be the selected areas of the memory .
&quot; the currently active proposition is spoken . if text is used in the input field , it is used to otherwise the selected phrases of the memory . &quot;
&quot; this menu item is crossed , a movable toolbar with buttons for frequently used commands . the toolbar can be ordered directly below the edit button directly under the menu bar . through mouse click on the left mouse button and pul@@ ling the toolbar can be moved to another point . &quot;
&quot; this menu item is crossed , is a narrow @-@ list in the lower part of the main window with hints of the condition of &amp; km@@ outh ; shown , if not crossed , this status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; this menu item is exposed to this menu item , will be arranged as default for text @-@ sli@@ ders with entries . by mouse click on the left mouse button directly under the toolbar . by mouse click on the left mouse button and pul@@ ling the toolbar can be moved to another point . &quot;
&quot; probably you have the command for voice output , not properly or not completely entered . open settings km@@ outh ; setup ... , open the page General settings and enter the command for voice output on the box tutorial . ( see Settings dialog for voice syn@@ thes@@ izers to further details . ) &quot;
Festival is a language @-@ issue system of the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and W@@ alis@@ ically supported . the license allows you to use the festival free of charge and spread without any restrictions . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting up language , it is assumed that festival is installed in the folder / usr / local / festival . &quot;
Free@@ T@@ TS is a in &amp; Java ; written language generator . currently he only supports the English phrases . the license allows you to use Free@@ T@@ TS free of charge and spread without any restrictions .
&quot; in order to show an example of the command line for setting up language , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS installed in the folder / usr / local / fre@@ er . the voice output is then possible with one of the three following commands : &quot;
for the third example the option must be enabled as standard input . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
&quot; M@@ BR@@ OL@@ A is a language generator for many languages . he conver@@ ts a list of Ph@@ on@@ emen into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to dis@@ integrate the text into ph@@ on@@ eme . the license allows it to use M@@ BR@@ OL@@ A for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications . &quot;
in our example H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text into Ph@@ on@@ eme for M@@ BR@@ OL@@ A in the assumption that H@@ adi@@ fax and M@@ BR@@ OL@@ A are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / M@@ BR@@ OL@@ A .
&quot; unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax likes the last sign of the text , so that an additional character needs to be added . the complete command is therefore more elab@@ orate than in the other examples : &quot;
( Cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BAR _ / usr / local / M@@ BR@@ OL@@ A / M@@ BR@@ OL@@ A / M@@ BR@@ OL@@ A / M@@ BR@@ OL@@ A / M@@ BR@@ OL@@ A / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in a line . the option is to send data as default .
&quot; W@@ TT@@ SD ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; KDE ; -@@ further language service , which provides a standard interface for voice @-@ over@@ s . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various voice @-@ over@@ s systems . &quot;
&quot; as the attitude of the language @-@ generator is done only in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you just need to use as desired as a language service as a language service . &quot;
&quot; to set up the page K@@ TT@@ SD , which is installed in the dialog dialog by &amp; km@@ outh ; if K@@ TT@@ SD will be installed . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; km@@ outh ; successfully to use , you need a language generator ( and natural &amp; KDE ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; km@@ outh ; requires approximately 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for the language generator ) , but it depends on the individual from your computer and its configuration . &quot;
&quot; km@@ outh ; is an application , with the people who cannot speak , text through the machine . there will be a list of already given sent@@ ences that the user can always be re@@ printed again . &quot;
note that &amp; km@@ outh does not include any language syn@@ thesizer . on the computer there must be a language syn@@ thesizer .
you can find detailed user documentation with help : / km@@ outh ( enter either this URL into the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; a or start k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / km@@ outh ) .

&quot; the voice output is done via the program speech disp@@ at@@ cher , the various background program such as es@@ ign , festival , &amp; etc ; &quot;
allows production of language editions to the command line ( or with shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; -@@ utilities .
&quot; in Z@@ UK@@ UN@@ FT : support for Spe@@ ech Mark@@ up languages such as Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Meta ( SM@@ ML ) . &quot;
&quot; the VO @-@ service of &amp; KDE , a application without visible windows , the T@@ TS @-@ Services over &amp; D@@ Bus ; offers . &quot;
a application with &amp; GUI ; for configuration and setup of kt@@ ts@@ d about kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr in the system section .
a module for the web browser &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; for the pre@@ reading of the texts of a web page or parts thereof .
&quot; a module for the text editor , with which a text file can be read completely or partially . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; KDE ; ( http : / / bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) you can find discussions about https : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ boxes / KDE @-@ Acc@@ es@@ sibility . the developer can also be found at IR@@ C ( ir@@ c.@@ k@@ de@@ .org , channel # KDE @-@ Acc@@ es@@ sibility ) . &quot;
&quot; before you can use &amp; kt@@ ts , you need to install program @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher and set correctly . see also &quot;
&quot; at the first start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr or as long as no speaker are set up , the cart@@ oons are set up , see also . if you have at least one rec@@ iter , the cart@@ oons will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; most of the T@@ TS @-@ Syn@@ thes@@ izers offer different languages and voices , so also different male or female , or such that differ in volume or speed . you can also set multiple variations for a syn@@ thesizer . you can also use multiple variations for a syn@@ thesizer , before you use , as the program speed @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher otherwise uses the standard speaker . &quot;
various actors for the same syn@@ thes@@ izers are comparable to several pres@@ sures for the same printer .
&quot; if you click on the cardboard box speaker , the map is shown on the box speaker . it will also be automatically created when you start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and still no speaker is set up . &quot;
all the speaker already appear in this list . the preferred speaker will appear at the top of the list . the top speaker is used for the voice issue when a application has no speaker .
&quot; click with a mouse click a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list . &quot;
&quot; select a mouse click on a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below . &quot;
&quot; select a mouse click on a speaker from the list , and click on this button to push the speaker on the list a line further down . the order of the nar@@ rator in the list also determines their priority . &quot;
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; interface system .
&quot; here you can choose a vote , there are three male and three female voices as well as a jun@@ k and ped@@ ago@@ gues to choose from . &quot;
click here to appear on the new speaker at the Kart@@ e@@ ik@@ arte spokes@@ person . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit . &quot;
&quot; now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; already almost using . go back to cart@@ oons ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , so that the T@@ TS @-@ Service of &amp; KDE . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; use to display text presentations to create text applications and manage . &quot;
&quot; if you have at least a speaker at least one speaker , you can open the language system system from &amp; KDE . click on the Kart@@ e@@ ik@@ art@@ en@@ re@@ iter to open this cart@@ oons . here you can set some general options . &quot;
&quot; select this approach , to activate the &amp; kt@@ ts ; this start successfully will display the card orders and you can make text entries and read them . see . remove the mark@@ ings , the K@@ TT@@ SD will be halt@@ ed and the T@@ TS system of &amp; KDE . &quot;
&quot; post@@ pon@@ y is finished , runs &amp; kt@@ ts ; further , provided the field language version ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; if this approach is marked and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr appears automatically in the system range of the control bar , it appears as soon as the pre@@ reading is completed . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this series you can start text @-@ orders , break , stop and re@@ sume . &quot;
with the buttons in this series you can read the current text in the &amp; KDE ; -@@ clip@@ board can be read or open a text file to read . you can also change the speaker for an order .
&quot; click Ap@@ den or OK , then all changed settings on all sides . &quot;
the card orders will only be shown if K@@ TT@@ SD has been started to launch K@@ TT@@ SD . click on the Kart@@ e@@ ik@@ art@@ en@@ re@@ iter and cross@@ roads there ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
&quot; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; KDE , you can read the text of the quoted website . check first , if &amp; kt@@ ts ; then select the text , which is to be read and select in the main menu tools text . after a short time the voice @-@ over@@ s should start . &quot;
&quot; it is almost always sensible to mark the desired text of a web page . you can also jump this step , but then a number of &amp; HTML , pre@@ amp and other invisible brands are also read . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; Kate , the extended text editor of &amp; KDE , you can read added text here . check first , if &amp; kt@@ ts ; then select the text , which is to be read , and select the start menu . then you should start the voice . &quot;
&quot; this also works when &amp; Kate ; in other applications is embedded , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; quantitative . &quot;
K@@ Not@@ ify is the news system of &amp; KDE ; that you may be not@@ ified through you determined events . you can also read the text of this news also from &amp; kt@@ ts ; read .
&quot; in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IR@@ C program of &amp; KDE , you can set up different types of messages ; for example , you can be not@@ ified when in an IR@@ C channel is a message which can be found in the IR@@ C channel . with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can then read the IR@@ C news text . &quot;
&quot; supports a &amp; KDE ; -@@ program K@@ Not@@ ify , appears a menu item not@@ ifications in the menu settings of this program . the possible settings for K@@ Not@@ ify vary depending on application . &quot;
&quot; the filter for strings offer a good option in &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is a good example . it is a good example . you removed the tags br and b from the messages , the mail sent , and also the expression / local / In@@ box , since this in most cases can be accepted as provided . read also . &quot;
filters are an advanced skills of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; are filters not required .
&quot; in filter@@ ing , text is processed , before it is sent to the program speech disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for improving the consultation , to choose wrong language and speakers or to handle certain defects of voice @-@ syn@@ thes@@ izers and their voices . &quot;
&quot; to understand the working method of filter@@ ing , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher is working with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; diff@@ ers four types of texts . &quot;
&quot; the output of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ ars has the highest priority . it is pre @-@ drawn to all other orders , and keeps this ass@@ ign@@ ments . if the output of the Screen reader is read , the elev@@ ated orders will be continued . &quot;
warnings have the next priority . this stage is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved to hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will be continued after the issue of warning .
&quot; News have the no@@ ct@@ ual priority . a message inter@@ rup@@ ts normal text . &amp; km@@ outh ; is an example of an application to read the messages . while you &amp; eg ; a long text on a web page , you can enjoy the room . &amp; KDE ; -@@ not@@ ifications are also news . read more . &quot;
&quot; the rest are simple text@@ iles . each order that you are used by the Kart@@ e@@ ik@@ arte orders . K@@ Say@@ it is an example of a applications that have been used for the issue of prolong@@ ed texts , which have no particular ur@@ gency . &quot;
&quot; all four comm@@ issions are worked in queue , except for the output of Screen Re@@ aders . if an application will send the output of a screen re@@ aders , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just such a pre @-@ reads , this edition will be stopped and ended . &quot;
&quot; first , you must know that filters never be applied to the output of screen re@@ a@@ ids . you will be applied to normal warnings , messages and text applications as well as on &amp; KDE ; -@@ News . &quot;
filter handle the text and give it further to the next filter . at the moment there are three types of filters .
filters are executed as modules . in the future there can be further types of filters .
&quot; they replace parts of a text by other text . it can be delivered either as words or as regular expressions , which enable the creation of chat @-@ emot@@ icons like : - ) by text or for the formatt@@ ing of messages from &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; or &amp; K@@ mail ; in a better intellig@@ ible form . &quot;
&amp; XML ; trans@@ duc@@ ers use a X@@ SLT @-@ File ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert and XML ; from one format to another format . in delivery of &amp; XHTML ; are some X@@ SLT files to the translation of &amp; XHTML ; in SS@@ ML .
&quot; you can purchase orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; if you have set up a female voice , you can read text by KDE messages about it . &quot;
&quot; each of these different filters has adjustable rules , according to which it is applied for a voice @-@ over@@ s . if the filter is not correct , he will not apply the text to the next filter . &quot;
&quot; when a text yield , a message , warning or a &amp; KDE ; message to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent it by all activated filters which were placed at the bottom in the list from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; this shows the list of the standard normal filters . is a filter not crossed , it is not activated and is not used . filter will be made up from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filters , and it will be shown further below the following design . &quot;
&quot; if you need a list of words or regular phrases as compar@@ ative pattern . these patterns are found in the text , then the text is ex@@ changed against the corresponding replacement text . &quot;
&quot; enter your filter a name . this name may choose any number , it must be distinguished only by the name of the other filters . &quot;
this is the list of words and regular phrases . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column and re@@ placing it in accordance with the string . the list is processed in the quoted order from top to bottom .
click here to move the marked word or the regular expression in the list .
&quot; with these buttons , you can upload a list of words or regular phrases from a file to save the current list or delete a list from a file , the entries will be app@@ ended to the existing list . &quot;
&quot; here is a language registered , the filter is only applied when the speaker for the text is one of the languages listed here . click on the button to display a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you click the mouse click the Ctr@@ l ; -@@ button pressed . &quot;
&quot; here is a value entered here , the filter is only applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by Kom@@ mat@@ a . example : conversation , K@@ mail &quot;
the application ID @-@ ID programs get you with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ Num@@ bers you have to switch . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the applic@@ ant ID kop@@ ete @-@ 34@@ 32 indicates you can only copy .
&quot; the subscription filter is applied only on the text when all conditions apply with an entry in the box , the filter is empty , the filter will be applied to all texts . &quot;
in the comparison of words the string conver@@ ters used in the form \ \ s word \ \ s. the words must therefore be limited by separ@@ ators ( spaces ) .
&quot; in this manual you will find no guide to write regular phrases . if you have installed the &amp; KDE ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular or Edit as help to assem@@ ble these expressions . the &amp; KDE ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expressions can be found in the package . &quot;
&amp; XML ; trans@@ duc@@ ers translate &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SLT files from a format to another format . X@@ SLT ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3C standard for such form@@ ations . it can only be applied to the shap@@ ing XML . the help program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c must be installed on your system .
enter the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the ambient variable P@@ AT@@ H which is also x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
&quot; with the speaker filters , you can send texts to a specific speaker that is set up on the Kart@@ e@@ ik@@ arte spokes@@ person , or to set a speaker with certain properties . you can specify that texts from K@@ mail from a female voice should be read . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text to the filter , there is a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected based on the speaker . the speaker is selected based on the text file ; send the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; send the text to &amp; # speaker . with the spokes@@ person you can write the chosen speaker . &quot;
&quot; here is a value entered here , the filter is applied in case of the text . it is installed on your system of &amp; KDE ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regul@@ ate , you can call it with a click on the button to get help with the input . &quot;
&quot; to achieve a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DA@@ TA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; click here to display the properties of the requested speaker . if the text is fulfilled the above mentioned filter terms , the speaker will be selected to view the requested requirements on the right hand . click on the button to the right to display the dialog box . &quot;
use this buttons to store or upload or delete all settings .
the filter drill filter is applied only to the text when all conditions apply with an entry in the box . you must apply at least one condition .
&quot; the voice @-@ issue API , by &amp; KDE , with the programmers give their applications T@@ TS skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD over &amp; D@@ bus ; &quot;
&quot; the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the voice syn@@ thes@@ izers to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , allowing you to use this syn@@ thesizer . &quot;
the following section contains a brief description of the &amp; KDE ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; -@@ interface of the voice output API of &amp; KDE ; . the complete documentation for both API@@ s can be found on the KDE ; Acc@@ es@@ sibility website ( http : / / acces@@ sibil@@ ity.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications call for voice output by the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ interface of &amp; KDE ; from the program kt@@ ts@@ d about the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
&quot; here is text of the text to read and option a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ; &quot;
there are even more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands you will be available
&quot; open two &amp; console ; -@@ windows . start just kt@@ ts@@ d in a window , then kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr in the others . &quot;
none of the mentioned language syn@@ thesizer is supported my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
&quot; I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ reverse filter , but when using the module for festival will not be read . &quot;
due to an error in the Festival 1.@@ 95 beta you need to install the ( male British ) voice of Rab _ di@@ phone so that S@@ able does not work if you do not use this voice to read websites . please also make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found via the ambient variable P@@ AT@@ H .
certain signs or pun@@ ctu@@ aries seem to cause faul@@ ts at syn@@ thesizer so that whole sent@@ ences will be issued or only gib@@ ber@@ ish . what can I do against it ?
&quot; first , make sure that the option is set on the right value for the corresponding language . there are problems with certain signs or words , these may possibly be fixed by a string . &quot;

K@@ T@@ TS works with any language syn@@ thesizer which can be started at the command line in a &amp; console ;
&quot; the list of the above languages can be in@@ complete or out@@ dated , hence draw the description of syn@@ thes@@ izers to the supported languages at rate . take a look at the website of kt@@ ts ; , by information that are not included in this manual . &quot;
the program &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; uses a customizable module for voice syn@@ thesizer . if you want to expand it ; for the use of another syn@@ thes@@ izers , contact the development team . &quot;
the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter is not mandatory . Debian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command ap@@ t @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
&quot; to comp@@ ile and comp@@ ile ; you need a current development environment of KDE ( version 3.4 or newer ) including the packages , and the drainage files for the program &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot;
&quot; if you can refer to the source texts from &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source code for k@@ de@@ , or to have downloaded the tar@@ ball , and install the program with the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before you &amp; order ; use first , whether speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher is correct with your language syn@@ thesizer . you can use the shell script SPD . &quot;
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; KDE ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; that is to be further developed by the program &apos;s disp@@ at@@ cher . the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr is to be further developed and the script SPD @-@ conf is no longer needed .
&quot; a long text is di@@ pped into individual sent@@ ences . the user can leave stat@@ utes , or demol@@ ition back , repeat the output stop or v@@ om@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; if there is an application text on &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can specify the characteristics of the preferred speaker for the issue . so if you choose a spokes@@ man , whose language is English and its gender feminine is used , otherwise the best suits you want to find out how &amp; kt@@ ts ; an speaker will choose to see you in . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the card @-@ card speaker , and click on the map to insert a speaker in the list or click Edit , the cardboard card will be displayed . as an example is shown below the decor of the module for Festival Interactive . &quot;
enter the path to the execut@@ able festival program . if the path to Festival is included in P@@ AT@@ H you just need to enter the festival .
&quot; select the drawing code for text , which will be delivered to Festival . in case of voices , the &amp; kt@@ ts ; generally , this setting will be automatically created . generally speaking countries are ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , eastern languages such as Czech or Slov@@ ak@@ ian use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; with these sli@@ ders , you represent volume , speaker at the speed and pitch of the synth@@ etic language . if you cannot choose some reg@@ imes and displayed this grey , which can not choose from you chosen voice these settings . &quot;
&quot; some voices such as Multi@@ Sy@@ n @-@ voices require given several seconds to be charged with their size . if you want to mark this column , these voices will already be syn@@ thes@@ ized with the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so ( with greater memory consumption ) the first set will be syn@@ thes@@ ized faster . &quot;
if this approach cannot be selected , you still have not set a speaker ( or forget to click on request ) . &quot;
&quot; if this approach is marked , the program window will be visible at the start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr . otherwise , after the start only the symbol kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr in the system section is visible , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; if this approach is marked and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is not yet , it appears in the system range as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD will read a text as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD will hold a text as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; here all orders are listed in queue , along with the application that has adjusted the order to the current status of the contract , the number of propositions and the currently working set . the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the Kart@@ e@@ ik@@ arte spokes@@ man . &quot;
&quot; with buttons in this series you can choose sat@@ i@@ ise in the mission , which is selected in the list below , or return . ( but not every order consists of several movements ) . &quot;
&quot; by clicking OK , all changes of settings ( also on the other boxes ) and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr will be res@@ ized to the icon in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; if the sound@@ system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the Kart@@ e@@ ik@@ arte Audio . see also . &quot;
&quot; here are only text entries and managed . expenditure of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ ars , warnings and messages will not appear . for more information about the news types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; can be found in . &quot;
&quot; select the type of audio output , if a component can not be selected , has been compiled , either without support for the appropriate audio module or &amp; kt@@ ts ; can not load the necessary libraries . &quot;
&quot; if g@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is to be used for audio output , please select the audio output . if no output C@@ lock is displayed in the list , you have to install at least one module . have AL@@ SA selected , select the PCM device . see also &quot;
&quot; Set the speaker speed here . 50@@ nbsp ; % corresponds to about half and 200@@ nbsp ; % around the double normal speaker speed . this settings can be implemented , the program must be installed so@@ x . &quot;
click Ap@@ ply to take the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ts ; system to take over .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PCM devices and modules that are decorated in your system . most of them will not work . you need to find out what device works with you . in doubt you choose standard .
&quot; on this card , you can set special promotions that will always be executed when the text yield is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processed four types of language orders : &quot;
&quot; the output of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ ars has the highest priority . it is pre @-@ drawn to all other orders , and maintains these orders . after the output of the Screen reader , the elev@@ ated orders will be added again . &quot;
warnings have the no@@ ct@@ ant priority . this stage is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor is going to hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are continued after reading the warning .
&quot; News have the next priority . a message breaks normal text . &amp; km@@ outh ; is an example of a application to read the messages . if you &amp; eg ; just have a long text on a web page , you can welcome with &amp; km@@ outh ; nevertheless , you can welcome the room . &quot;
&quot; if a text yield is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen re@@ aders , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio issue in queue . &quot;
&quot; this audio file is always played when a normal text yield is interrupted . if both introdu@@ ctory sound is active as well as introdu@@ ctory news , the introdu@@ ctory sound is played before the introdu@@ ctory message . &quot;
&quot; the settings on this cart@@ oons are only valid for normal text@@ iles . for news , warnings and expenditure of Screen Re@@ a@@ ars , there are no special promotions if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority . &quot;
&quot; to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; K@@ Not@@ ify messages to be read , run kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and click messages . &quot;
&quot; highlight this c@@ ified field to assess the pre@@ reading of &amp; KDE , -@@ not@@ ices . this setting is not marked , the other settings are de@@ activated and &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads no not@@ ifications before . &quot;
&quot; this setting is marked , are not@@ ifications of which a sound is played , by &amp; kt@@ ts ; not pre@@ read . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to add events to the list or delete it . if you click on the button , the application will be able to select the application and event you want to add to the list . &quot;
&quot; this event reads the message before , the &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; send if someone mentioned in an IR@@ C @-@ news of your nickname . &quot;
&quot; all events , for which in the list nothing else is specified , be ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts ; ignored . &quot;
&quot; use this selection , to determine what &amp; kt@@ ts ; do if an event does . you have the following choices : &quot;
&quot; if you have chosen user @-@ defined text , enter the desired text . you can also use the following wild@@ card : &quot;
&quot; you can enter the characteristics of the desired speaker . standard select the speaker , which is displayed in the list on the cardboard card speaker . see also . &quot;
&quot; note that there are three levels for events . is specified for a certain event of a certain application , it is executed . otherwise , the action for all other events of certain application is executed . as the last way the action comes to wearing , which is under standard ( all other events ) . &quot;
the event All not@@ ifications for the application standard ( all other events can not be deleted from the list . for this you can specify the pre@@ dat@@ ory not@@ ifications as follows :
use the button saving to store the settings for the notification into a file . use the button to load stored settings from a file . if you want to start with an empty list then click Delete . all entries except all not@@ ifications are deleted .
&quot; the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3C standard to mark text for the control of voices , the speaker speed , the volume , the volume , the voice and pitch size . &quot;
currently it supports &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partly and only in the basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
&quot; you need to install the Rab _ di@@ phone voice ( brit@@ ish male ) as this is the default , the festival in the edition of SS@@ ML . &quot;

&quot; there are two types of filters - normal filters and pro@@ posit@@ ional interface ( SD@@ B @-@ Filter ) . S@@ B@@ Ds sign@@ ify text in single phrases . this may also be the first set to be syn@@ thes@@ ized , not the whole text assignment . so you can also stop or stop off the box , even if the language syn@@ thes@@ izers do not directly support . &quot;
&quot; here you can see the pro@@ posit@@ ional recognition filter . when the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is automatically set up as a provision of a s@@ posit@@ ional recogn@@ izable filter . you can change its settings , or add another stat@@ utes . &quot;
&quot; on the easiest way you learn the furnis@@ hing selection by selecting . place the speaker selection from and give text to read , change some properties and check out how to set the selection of the speaker . you need to know more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; then faster with the pre@@ reading can start , as only the first sentence has to be processed and not the entire text block , which can last very long , &quot;
&quot; you can then stop orders on the card orders or v@@ om@@ iting , even if the voice syn@@ thes@@ izers do not support this function . &quot;
&quot; for these reasons the normal pro@@ posit@@ ional recogn@@ izable filter is automatically set up when you run kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr for the first time , it cannot be secluded only away . change anything at this filter , unless you know what you do . &quot;
&quot; with a regular term , compare text with a regular expression for stat@@ utes and add a tab@@ ular sign ( dec@@ imal code 8 ) on the stat@@ utes automatically from the text ) . note that the standard de@@ posit@@ ional recogn@@ izable filter is automatically removed from the text ) . &quot;
S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; KDE ; -@@ messages ( kn@@ ot@@ ify ) warnings , news or the output of screen re@@ a@@ ids . &quot;
&quot; if you want to see the normal S@@ atz@@ unlimited filter , you can insert this again by placing the file in &amp; kt@@ ts ; included file standard _ sb@@ dr@@ c . &quot;
on the cart@@ oons selection : you can write the microphone settings for the application . the card card is displayed if
use of the standard Spe@@ aker ( the top on the card @-@ card speaker ) . with other words : there will be no talk properties .
&quot; when using the pass@@ end@@ ous speaker , the features of a modular speaker . if you do not delete the settings of the speaker . if you select the settings of the speaker . otherwise , select &quot;
&quot; select the method to enter the desired speaker , by clicking on one of the Options button . &quot;
&quot; select the properties of the desired speaker . if this property does not play a role , enter nothing . &quot;
select this approach if the property has to have priority from other properties . you can also set several mark@@ ings here .
&quot; since the language is a critical factor when dealing with the issue is , these feature is rarely use . the only case , where you might want to specify the attribute language , is before you know that a certain application text was recorded in another language than that in the working environment . &quot;
&quot; to use all properties in the area of speaker , using the following below to delete below , click on the select@@ able standard speaker and then use on speaker that corresponds to the following below . &quot;
in this case 0 for the last text yield in queue . you can also specify an order number . ( without order number the entry is 0 required ) .

I downloaded an additional voice for the festival from the internet . I installed it and can use it in festival but kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr shows this voice out .
&quot; in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / festival@@ int / voices add the new voice . if this is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; in which you have found the voice to the developer . &quot;
&quot; on the cardboard card audio is there a setting speed . so this works , the program must be installed and controlled via the ambient variable P@@ AT@@ H . some syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ er@@ modul@@ ations like Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed . depending on the chosen voice is this active or in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; the settings for the speaker can be ignored if &amp; HTML ; ( see that the HTML is controlled in SS@@ ML . ) De@@ activate either the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; to &amp; XML ; ( see ) or if you are very cour@@ ageous to change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ to @-@ SS@@ ML , and set the speaker speed . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t create it that web pages can be read with a female voice . I have set a female Festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the web pages with a male voice . &quot;

&quot; Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thesizer , whose source code is open in general , and there are several voices and languages supported . with many voices you can adjust volume , speaker at speed and ton@@ ight . &quot;
&quot; you need to install at least one language . help with this you will find in the instructions that can be delivered with festival , you will need to read web pages that you need ( male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone . &quot;
&quot; for these voices you need to comp@@ ile an additional module , so you need the source code of festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on the transfer . &quot;
this voice sets the festival 1.@@ 95 beta or later . the voice is still in an early stages of development . un@@ zip the software in festival / lib / voices / rus@@ sian _ di@@ phone . choose a k@@ yr@@ ill@@ ical ( 8 @-@ bit ) co@@ ding such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux ; distrib@@ utions available as first on the CDs of your distribution .
&quot; if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages the option must be adjusted to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the option must be set to a 8 @-@ bit k@@ yr@@ lic such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
Festival can be used together with the &amp; M@@ BR@@ OL@@ A ; -@@ syn@@ thesizer . then Festival the lex@@ ical analysis and &amp; M@@ BR@@ OL@@ A ; it creates the audio output . the &amp; M@@ BR@@ OL@@ A ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from

&quot; this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; , which allows the management of the network interfaces , the routines and the DNS settings . &quot;
&quot; the user interface ; allows users to manage a number of system and des@@ kt@@ op@@ settings via a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; che@@ ek center ; can be accessed by a selection of K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was developed to provide the users manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple surface for the following tasks :
after installing a new module network settings in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the module networking settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting from k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in &amp; low @-@ menu ;
&quot; it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers have already fully functional and configured , so that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device is all connected and the setting of net properties . &quot;
&quot; in most cases drivers are used for the network hardware and other devices in installation of &amp; Linux ; with installed and set . the network devices later , the driver must be loaded into the kernel version , according to the kernel version , &quot;
the module network settings will be loaded when the option networking settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index is selected . when starting the module network settings tries to detect the platform used on the system automatically .
&quot; if the platform can not be recognized , the key choice is offered . it is the platform from the list to select the distribution and the release of non @-@ again issues . by marking the setting non @-@ again , this selection will automatically be default . &quot;
changing the network settings is possible only in the system management mode . previously all options are displayed only what does the settings can only be considered to change the settings . it is possible by clicking the button of the module . it is the entry of the password .
the full functionality of the module is available in three riders :
the rider network interface serves to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed .
the settings displayed in the displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and click on the button to set up in the dialog device .
by default only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the button Advanced settings shows the dialog with further options .
&quot; the TCP / IP settings are done by a DH@@ CP server or BOO@@ TP Server . in the automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings are required for the system at the same time with the start of the system services . the DH@@ CP@@ - or BOO@@ TP servers will be required by either DH@@ CP or BOO@@ TP , according to the system . &quot;
with the selection Manu@@ ally can be done without DH@@ CP or BOO@@ TP the TCP / IP address . in the input field IP address the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . in the input field
&quot; this setting is marked , initi@@ al@@ izes the system the network interface of bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated . &quot;
the values in this dialog are shown as the characteristics of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address will not be used in the network . entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; console ; you can find whether the desired address is already in use . in doubt the network administrator should be asked .
&quot; network devices may be enabled , depending on the need to be activated or swit@@ ched off . input of an extra@@ cted NIC can be activated by selecting from the list and click on interface . &quot;
network devices may be activated or off @-@ off . switching an activated network device is done by selecting from the list and click on interface .
&quot; specif@@ ies the IP address of the computer in the local sub@@ net , which convey@@ s the physical connection to remote networks and is used as standard to TCP / IP communication with computers . &quot;
&quot; if the computer is more than a network interface , the interface is necessary to be found in which the gateway computer is to be selected . &quot;
&quot; a computer with DNS support re@@ places a full domain name by the appropriate IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP @-@ addresses . if the machine is required http : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , solve DNS this name into a IP address like 12@@ 3.4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.90 . &quot;
the computer to the name resolution section allows a simple management of this list . entries can be added or changed wer@@ den@@ .@@ DNS entries can be ordered through selection of an entry and execution or desc@@ ending in the list with buttons or down in the priority .
by clicking the button Add ... from the group calcul@@ ator to the name resolution can be added to a DNS server . it will be added to the dialog New Nam@@ es@@ er@@ ver .
&quot; first , you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then add the button . the entry is then inserted in the list . &quot;
&quot; from the group computer to the name resolution , select an entry and then click Edit ... It will be shown in the dialog box . &quot;
&quot; the list of well @-@ known computer describes computer @-@ name @-@ to @-@ IP address for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily associated with boats if no DNS server are available . in small , closed networks can replace it DNS servers . &quot;
&quot; normally , the list of well known hosts includes several entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses support . this is still in the test , it is intended to replace version 4 in the future version 4 . &quot;
enter the IP address of the known computer and click &quot; Add .... The dialog New Ali@@ as Add .
&quot; to enter the name of the known computer and click the Add button . if the well known computer has several ali@@ ases , the button Add several times and enter the other ali@@ ases name . &quot;
select an entry of a well known computer from the list and choose Edit .... The dialog acquain@@ t@@ ance is displayed .
&quot; it can be executed one of the following tasks , then by clicking OK the list of static hosts will be updated . &quot;
&quot; the settings in the module network settings are not immediately effective in the system . to activate the changes , must be placed in a single bed ; the following command must be cancelled . &quot;
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is http : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ s.@@ s@@ ource@@ for@@ ge@@ .net that allows you to download the latest version of the source code .
for the installation of bin@@ ary distrib@@ utions ( mostly rpm packages ) it ranges when &amp; KDE . and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users . it is simply to download the rpm package and install in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
&quot; alternatively , a tool can be used with graphical user like k@@ package or the installation tool of their distribution . &quot;
&quot; for this case the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; KDE ; not , but in addition , the development packages will be required with libraries and other things . &quot;
&quot; this is recommended only for experienced users . however , it is not difficult to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should do this . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information on fundamental network technology , in the second are all discussed by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; changing configuration files . &quot;
&quot; this area can not replace further knowledge of IP networks . in this anne@@ x , basic information on the integration of PCs into a small ( home@@ - ) network convey@@ s . &quot;
currently IP networks with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) is operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 is expected to continue in the near future . this description is therefore focused on the spread IP@@ v@@ 4 .
&quot; one of the most important information is the knowledge that the IP address of a network interface is to be assigned . in foreign networks , on &amp; eg ; workplace is the network administrator to be assigned or if available , the IP address can not be chosen as easy as the IP address ! &quot;
&quot; when setting up an own little ( home ) network , the IP address should be chosen from a specially selected for this purpose to prevent IP @-@ address con@@ flu@@ ences with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not for@@ warded to the internet , so it is possible to any use . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the internet can be made for such machines by setting up a g@@ at@@ ew@@ ays . &quot;
for smaller networks are mostly used addresses in the range from 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 calcul@@ ator .
&quot; additionally , the mesh mask usually set on 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 so that all the computer participants are on the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second @-@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own machine ) . &quot;
the ma@@ ins address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine . usually the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to an own so named lo@@ op@@ back interface that works like a closed circle .
in this part the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; and where they are stored in the different distrib@@ utions .
&quot; this file is sometimes modified at DSL connections , so it will not be surprised if in the case of active DSL connections another content is defined there . &quot;

&amp; cr@@ cr@@ on ; is an application with which you can run other programs according to a schedule in the background . it is a graphical interface for the &amp; UNIX ; -@@ system program cr@@ on .
&quot; at the start of &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; see a list of already provided tasks and related environment variables . if you use &amp; cr@@ cr@@ on ; as root , this will appear both for all users of the system and system @-@ internal tasks . &quot;
in a de@@ activation task you will not appear and parameters are not displayed and displayed below .
the variables contained here is the otherwise existing ambient variables for all of the tasks except force . for a de@@ activated variable will appear as a description of de@@ activated variable .
&quot; to create a new task , you first select the tasks -@@ folder . then go back in menu to Edit New .... Altern@@ atively , you can also click with the right mouse button on the tasks folder and click &quot; &quot; Ctr@@ l &quot; &quot; button . &quot;
enter the name of the starting program . you can specify either a relative or a absolute path name . if you want to look at the program first you want to choose .
&quot; select the minute ( s ) , to which the task should be executed . with &amp; cr@@ cr@@ on , you can specify the minutes in five thousand . &quot;
&quot; if you specify both Mon@@ at@@ stag ( e ) as well as week@@ day ( e ) , the task will be executed with a suitable date and on a suitable week@@ day . if you run the program on the 1st and 15th of the selected months , regardless of the date and on every Sunday of the months , no matter what will they fall . &quot;
&quot; as with the creation of new tasks , changes will only be active when the cr@@ acks was saved . &quot;
&quot; to cut a task , they first select the remote task . go then to Edit . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can click with the right mouse button on the task and select the cutting , or press Ctr@@ l ; X . &quot;
&quot; to copy a task , she first select the task to copy their task . go to Edit Copy . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can click with the right mouse button on the task and select Copy , or press Ctr@@ l ; C . &quot;
&quot; to include a task , first needs to be cut into the clip@@ board , first to be copied or copied . only then , paste the tasks of the folder . go to Edit Insert . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can click with the right mouse button on the tasks -@@ folder and paste , or press Ctr@@ l ; V . &quot;
&quot; to make changes to a task , choose first one . go then to the menu item Edit ... &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can click with the right mouse button on the task and change ... or you press Ctr@@ l ; O. It will then edit the dialog task where you can edit the chosen task . &quot;
&quot; to delete a task , select the ext@@ ingu@@ ishing task . go to the menu item Edit . &quot;
&quot; to activate one task or de@@ activate it , select it and determine the condition with the menu item . in@@ active tasks are marked in their description with in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can also click with the right mouse button on the task and select activ@@ ating that program name , parameters and description must be displayed correctly . &quot;
&quot; to run a task immediately , select this out and then go to Edit now . &quot;
&quot; to create a new ambient variable , select the variable folder . then go to the menu item Edit ... &quot;
alternatively you can click with the right mouse button on the variable folder and select New ... or click Ctr@@ l ; N .
enter the name of the variables . you can also select one of the list of the most commonly used environment variables ; click on the arrow next to the field for the variable names .
to send e @-@ mails from the back @-@ up program to another than the normal address
as with the creation of new variables changes will only be done when the cr@@ ont@@ ab was saved .
&quot; to cut a variable , they first select the variable variable . go then to Edit . &quot;
&quot; to copy a ambient variable , first select the variable variable . go then to Edit copy . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can click with the right mouse button on the variable and select copying , or press Ctr@@ l ; C . &quot;
&quot; to insert a ambient variable , first needs to be cut into the clip@@ board or copied . only then the option paste is available at all . then select the variable folder . then go to Edit Insert . &quot;
&quot; to change a variable , you first select the variable variable . go to Edit ... aging to edit button , or edit Ctr@@ l ; O .@@ It will then edit the dialog variables , in which you can edit as above , the variable . &quot;
&quot; to delete a ambient variable , first select the variable . go then to Edit . &quot;
&quot; to enable an ambient variable or de@@ activated , select it and place the condition with the menu item . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can also click with the right mouse button on the variable and select activ@@ ates . make sure the name and value of the variables can be displayed correctly . &quot;
&quot; if all tasks and environment variables were entered or modified , you still have to save the cr@@ ont@@ ab . select the menu item . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can Ctr@@ l ; S press . changes or additions to tasks or variables will only be active . &quot;
&quot; it appears the default KDE ; -@@ press dialog . if you choose out , you can see that there are two additional &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; -@@ specific options in the press dialog . &quot;
prints the cr@@ unch of all users on the system . this option is only accessible for users to own the extended author@@ is@@ ations .
cr@@ on for example vi@@ x@@ ie @-@ cr@@ on . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses the command cr@@ ont@@ ab to change the sched@@ ules of the user .
&quot; a PO@@ SIX @-@ compliant &amp; UNIX , for example with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands of &amp; UNIX ; to find time and date . &quot;
&quot; the second goal is to store multiple archives on a band . the second goal was to create multiple archives on a band . the second goal was to answer the question of d@@ ds@@ 2@@ tar for quick , sel@@ ective un@@ packing . the second goal was to answer a question that my wife presented : how much longer takes it when you sec@@ ures ? &quot;
&quot; before a band can be used , it must be done by &amp; k@@ dat . this can happen to three types : &quot;
&quot; soldier , c@@ ult the band back and reads the exciting information about the belt . det@@ ects &amp; k@@ dat ; the pre@@ sp@@ ann on the band do not , you will be asked if the band is being formatt@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; det@@ ects &amp; k@@ dat ; the pre@@ ach , searches it according to the appropriate index on your plate . can this not be found if the Band@@ index is to be created . &quot;
&quot; if everything went smoothly , the symbol for the band@@ work , to indicate that the band has been incorporated into the status bar . the contents of the banking can now be carried out by cl@@ apping of the contract for the tape . &quot;
&quot; in front of the throw of the belt , initially the integration needs to be solved . there are three methods to do this : &quot;
&amp; nbsp ; returns by a change in the symbol for the band that the integration for the band has been solved and shows in the status bar a corresponding message .
&quot; before a band can be used by &amp; k@@ dat , it must be formatt@@ ed by &amp; k@@ dat . &quot;
&quot; a band @-@ types must be formatt@@ ed before you use the formatt@@ ing , it does not correspond to formatt@@ ing , it must be formatt@@ ed before you use the band of &amp; k@@ dat . fl@@ oppy disk drives are usually not formatt@@ ed . fl@@ oppy @-@ strap , however not . &quot;
after entering the band and the capacity drives &amp; k@@ dat ; with the formatt@@ ing of the belt . all data on the band will be lost ! after completion of the formatt@@ ing process the band is automatically mounted and is operational .
&quot; before you get the backup process , you need to select the required files . this can happen to three types : &quot;
select a file or folder in the local file tree . it will only be secured to this file or folder .
select a backup time in the tree . it will only be secured in the profile specified in the profile .
select files in the local file tree with a skins . only those selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be secured .
click with the right mouse button on the local file tree and select in the menu
&quot; once the backup has been introduced , the dialogue settings will open up . in this dialog you can once check the selected files and change the settings for secur@@ ing your backup . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings , the dialog will appear . the dialog shows the progress of the back@@ drop , including the data rate and the remaining time . &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it is only checked the selected file or folder .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the band with a skins . it is only checked the selected files and / or sub@@ folders .
click with the right mouse button on one of the archives and select the menu item .
&quot; once the test process was started , the dialog settings for checking . in this dialog you can check your selection and change the work@@ folder for checking . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for the review , the dialog appears to check . this dialog shows the progress of the program process as well as the data throug@@ h@@ put and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; before you can manage the re@@ produce , the files which are to be restored , marked . this can be done on two ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the band@@ p works . it is only re@@ produced the selected file or sub@@ folder .
select the files from one of the archives on one of the archives . it will only be the selected files and / or sub@@ folder .
click with the right mouse button on a file or folder in one of the archives and select in the menu restore ....
&quot; once the recovery process was started , the dialogue will appear for restoration . in this dialog you can check your selection and change the work@@ folder for recovery . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for recovery , the dialogue will appear . this dialog shows the progress of the re @-@ creation , as well as the data throug@@ h@@ put and the remaining time . &quot;
sometimes it proves to be necessary to create the band &apos;s file on the basis of the band &apos;s contents . this process will delete all existing index files for this band . you can create the index of two types of band :
&quot; here , a backup of the files and the default settings are created . you can make the following settings : &quot;
the current working folder in which the backup is to be made . the list of saf@@ es files will be automatically updated according to the selected working folder .
&quot; for all files that are listed under backup files , that only those files are stored on the same file system , which can be stored on the same file system , you can insert separately under secure files . each entry is independent of tar regardless of the others . &quot;
perform a incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have been changed since the last incre@@ mental Backup . it is only secured the files that have since then changed .
the name of the file that is used to capture changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
delete the snapshot file in front of the call of tar . this means that all files are secured and a new snapshot file for the next backup will be created .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; and lt ; lt ; files was not fully implemented at the time of creating these documentation .
the settings can be set via the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . the following settings allows you to make :
the full path to device drivers for the band@@ work ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ te variant of the band@@ ages .
&quot; is this setting active , transmitted &amp; k@@ dat ; before the band is inserted the command to load the drive . with some drives this is necessary before reading or writing operations . &quot;
&quot; is the option enabled , the option is trying , trying . maybe this setting does not work with all band@@ works . &quot;
&quot; is the option enabled , it is subject to the sol@@ der of the integration of &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically use this option not for fl@@ oppy @-@ Stream@@ ern . &quot;
&quot; is the option enabled , it is trying to change &amp; k@@ dat ; the hard@@ disk space for the band@@ work . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you must not have to say , in any case the block@@ ing size for your band@@ work . &quot;
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a band formatt@@ ed it writes a file to the beginning of the belt . this file should only take a memory block on the tape . the contents of the file is composed as follows :
&quot; ( n Byte ) The band ID . the format of this string is audit@@ ed : seconds , whereas the name of the full name of the system has been formatt@@ ed . seconds is the number of seconds that has passed since the epoch . &quot;
the band ID is used to use a file with the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat .
the remaining files on the band are pure tar -@@ Archive which can be directly managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar will work . even other tar versions should work as long as it is not related to incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a backup center . this symbol is only active when a band is mounted .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; KDE project prot@@ ocols for system prot@@ ocols . the program is suitable for un@@ experienced users where you can get information on your system or where the system allows the different protocol files ; experienced users the fast access to information about problems that appear on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what your computer makes . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simpl@@ ified representation of the protocol files . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system allows the various protocol files .
&quot; moreover , k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users the fast access to the example of information about problems that appear on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; try to provide some extended functions , with which help the protocol files are fil@@ tered and evaluated . &quot;
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions .
support for many different types of prot@@ ocols files for the format of the sys@@ log server and for sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included in addition and are explained in the further chapters of this hand@@ book .
&quot; as you can see in the following screen@@ shots , presents &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; features available , with the help of the individual protocol line of a protocol file easily filter and sort@@ ing . the individual possibilities for sort@@ ing and filter@@ ing will be shown in the next chapter of this hand@@ book . &quot;
&quot; after start@@ up and k@@ system@@ log ; first , the most important protocol @-@ file of the system - the system protocol is not displayed , and it opens up instead of a small news window , so you can not find it under Linux usually in the folder / var / log , for the normal user usually no just@@ ification for reading . &quot;
you can also use the filter bar to filter a selected crit@@ er@@ ion or after a selected string . the list of the log files will be automatically displayed so that only the list of the log files will be displayed in addition to the filter . then a protocol line is displayed only when in one of the columns the string box contains the filter @-@ box .
&quot; you can also select another entry in this place . the string of the filter search@@ engine is then used only with the entries in accordance with selected column . select the name of a process , so will show you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all protocol lines that have been sent or created by this process . &quot;
this option is activated in default and helps you to see the important protocol lines . protocol lines of stage errors are shown with a striking color as the protocol @-@ lines of the stage note . the colored representation of the protocol can be swit@@ ched .
&quot; if you want to show only certain process ( for example in the system protocol or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , so you can get the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process . this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case you will use filter@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can choose the option to view new lines in the context menu of the main window to display all new additions to the upcoming protocol . &quot;
&quot; k@@ system@@ log ; allows the display of multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ contractors . to open this function , use the entries in the menu window to open additional sub@@ window . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a protocol to display the menu . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website at http : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ s@@ oftw@@ are@@ .@@ org. D@@ ort can be found further information about the reference of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; can also be found in the following folder of &amp; KDE ; -@@ Subversion @-@ Archiv@@ s : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; KDE ; -@@ Archive
&quot; to the &amp; KDE , System V In@@ it Editor , more known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; k@@ sys@@ v ; this section leads a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; _ sys@@ v ; &quot;
&quot; the V In@@ it develops rapidly to the control of the program starts at the high level of the system in the &amp; Linux ; world . and therefore , because it is easier to use , powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD style . &quot;
I will not go here further on historical aspects ( e.g. because I do not know about it himself : - ) .
&quot; the In@@ it bin@@ aries is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because maybe someone might try to make a machine on System V In@@ it , without a re@@ installing and re@@ formatt@@ ing . therefore , you have to make sure that the old in@@ it was removed from there , if there was one . &quot;
the Sys@@ V In@@ it is also different from the BSD in@@ it that is the configuration files in a sub@@ folder of / etc are directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folder :
&quot; init@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically you need a script for each system service that you want to start using the system or when changing to another run@@ level . system services do not include such things such as network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things such as set@@ serial , which is only once started . such Views belong to r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
&quot; r@@ c.@@ local should lie on the one hand under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d , if you need it . most systems do this file . you can also do a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d when you want to do something with the serial port . &quot;
the kernel search for different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one finds it .
the default Run@@ level is available in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . you should see a line like the following :
&quot; at this point you can take a look at the second column and probably notice that the pre @-@ set Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab from hand and change the 3 . if you want to change it , then you can fix it by making the system new and execute the following : &quot;
&quot; but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you enter ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you will probably see some as the following : &quot;
you will notice that in this folder there is no right files . instead , each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the directory . &quot;
how does and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simply : each of the scripts is so written that there is an argument like start and stop . you can start this script actually by hand on the command line :
&quot; this would hold the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and when the one K contains , the script will be called to the argument stop . if it includes a S , the script will start with the argument start . &quot;
&quot; some people desire a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could &amp; eg ; a server @-@ Run@@ level , which can only be htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . furthermore , I could also have a user -@@ Run@@ level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc . &quot;
here you learn how to use &amp; k@@ sys@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
using &amp; sys@@ v ; using a mouse or another pointer of time is easy to not to say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the area of the Available system services to one of the six Run@@ level to start it at this level ( or stop ) .
you can also change scripts between Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n or change position within a level by changing it elsewhere . this will only take place in the area of its original run@@ level ( or its position ) . this does not happen if you want to pull an entry out of the field of dispos@@ able system services .
&quot; note : entries will be post@@ pon@@ ed if you want to copy them into a new field . to select it only to a new Run@@ level , you must explicitly select from the menu or from the context menu , even if the same entry exists previously in the target area of the action . &quot;
&quot; the sort@@ ing number of a entry cannot be charged at times . in such a case , you must edit the sort@@ ing numbers of the surrounding entries before you can again try to insert the system . &quot;
&quot; at present , there is no possibility to restore entries that were thrown into the tr@@ ash . be careful . &quot;
&quot; you can use the Tab@@ ulator button to enable the various operating ranges ( Available system services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one . &quot;
&quot; to move an entry to another Run@@ level , move it with car@@ ving into the clip@@ board ( you can also Ctr@@ l ; X ) and add it to the desired run@@ level with insert ( Ctr@@ l ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to change the sort@@ ing number or the name of a contract manually , press the entry button to switch between different fields . use the dialog box to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to change the changes . &quot;
&quot; because of the risk of the data you require all entries in the menu file a confirmation , before they are executed . &quot;
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ svr@@ c .
I have been experiment@@ ing with the Standard @-@ Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n and now starts the machine consistently new . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO -@@ Pro@@ m@@ pt linux single one and press the input button to start in the single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the default Run@@ level at a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be in order ) .
&quot; I have some system services provided with &amp; k@@ sys@@ v ; for execution under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed . &quot;
&quot; if you use &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Del@@ ix ( DL@@ D ) , then you need to edit additional files in / etc . please read the details on the manual of distribution . &quot;
&quot; the way , such as system services can be started in these distrib@@ utions , but simpl@@ ifies the configuration for the propri@@ etary design programmes of this distrib@@ utions , but is unfortunately no standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sys@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you use any other distribution : check whether all configuration files are available , which are required by the respective system support ( and even if they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( like &amp; eg ; Apache and htt@@ p@@ d ) just finish any message if their configuration files are not available or wrong . &quot;
&quot; the importance of &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use another distribution , please send me information about the Run@@ level , so that this manual can be added . &quot;
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
&quot; to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient , the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; to read . &quot;
&quot; after you have made changes , you need to save this . either use the appropriate icon of the toolbar or the entry is stor@@ ing in the menu . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two cardboard boxes , the user and user groups . to edit the desired user or the desired group with a double @-@ click on the entry . &quot;
&quot; some cartridges are only displayed if you have extended system settings . only if you have registered user settings ( quot@@ a ) for users , if you are able to make individual settings , if Shadow -@@ Pass@@ words or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as used in BSD Unix . &quot;
the card administration is released if Shadow -@@ Pass@@ words or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as described in BSD -@@ Uni@@ xes .
this cart@@ oons appears only if for at least one built file system ( Qu@@ ota ) is activated and initi@@ al@@ izes ( recogn@@ izable at the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the files@@ ystem ) . here you can change the information required for each user data .
these parameters can be set individually for each file system . the current file system is selected with the help of the field system with space .
&quot; cart@@ oons group inform@@ s about the group related activities of the selected user . the standard group , to which the user can be found in the field primary group . furthermore , the user can be registered in other groups by clicking this in the large field . &quot;
the dialog features of the group contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list . &quot;
&quot; to add a user or a group , select Add from the menu user or group or click on the appropriate adding button of the toolbar . we work or delete the selected user or the selected group in analog . &quot;
&quot; using this module you can install the LI@@ LO @-@ Boot@@ manager , remove the boat address , remove and change the time up to the bo@@ oting of the standard operating system to change operation system , change operation , change , change and more . &quot;
