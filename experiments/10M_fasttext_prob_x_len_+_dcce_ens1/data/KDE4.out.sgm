<seg id="392">"automatic disadvantage: this method maximizing the color area in the Rot-, green and bluechannel. you determine the dark and bright border-ones and adjust the rotary, green and blue channels to the complete history program."</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improves contrast and luminosity of the RGB values of a picture by moving the lowest and highest values in the greatest possible area and a rejiustation of all values between. this is only visible at balanced images and can be a good correction for poor photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white-out of & digikam; is an semi-automatic tool to perform the white-off of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white-out correction is somewhat limited because of a farbraum with 8-bit per colour. if you are able to perform too far from the original screen. if you can perform the white-off in the pipe mode that works in 16-bit mode so you will make your possibilities to make correction better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on an unbalancing salm of the copyright of Pawel T. Jochym. you start it across the menu item white-out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview can be adjusted in size. on the left side you can see both the original image as well as the preview of the target image. if you want to see the original comparison of the tool. if you want to see the original comparison, then it is enough to click the subwindow. "</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the Target photo has a red Marker. the luminance of the pixels on this Marker is shown as vertical line in the history.</seg>
<seg id="399">"on the right top is a histogram displayed that dynamically change, as soon as you can change one parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well illuminated images, most of the pixels very small Luminants values. with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed."</seg>
<seg id="400">"the contrast of your result depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. the shade adjusting lets you improve the attendance of your photos or also download dimming."</seg>

<seg id="409">A very powerful option to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you can find under colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">"the squeezing; tool coloration provides you with four color effects, a solar effect, a bicycle effect, a neon effect and a cantatfilter available."</seg>
<seg id="411">"in times of chemical processing was solar, even Sabatians called, a effect of being developed into a short lightning light. it had the effect that the brightens areas darker and the colors used by the second illumination. this tool was a part of the image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect finely."</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar radiation. at about 50% intensity shows the image what is chemically possible. another increase is generated a negatives picture that is not to be used on photopapier.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar effect. the original image is the (1) and the processed (2). applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">"the Vivid filter simulates the so called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it is different from a saturation that he makes a stronger contrasting effect of the colors brilliant and glowing. try it simply, he embellished many photos."</seg>
<seg id="415">"Velvia is the brand name for one in daylight optimised colour film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm; and therefore a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very complex colors at daylight and high contrasts. the characteristics make it a film of choice for natural photograph. Velvias strong complex colors are also some photographs, especially the little landscapes absent to too much."</seg>
<seg id="416">The neonfilter simulates neonlight on the contrasts. the parameters Level controls the brightness of the result and the sliding repetitions the strength of the inclination. at large images the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras frequently have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual to change the color seat and the luminosity of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. all your alignment can be satisfied in the preview. once you are satisfied with the result you will use the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">"if you have a photo in bad light conditions, you can get the reverse problem: one too large saturation. even in this case the tool is a good choice to reduce the saturation instead of them. all changes you can perform in the preview. if you confirm the result you can confirm the changes with Ok."</seg>

<seg id="479">& digikam; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">"sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but created especially in dark areas, grained pictures."</seg>
<seg id="481">"unsharpness mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture sharper. indeed, it's not a bit, it works rather psycho-visual. you can use it to atmospheric Dunst and it makes it a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is protected by Winston Chang."</seg>
<seg id="482">Focussing is possibly the best of the three as it really improves the sharpness. he is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters to adapt.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitalised images need a correction of sharpness. this is due to the digitalization process colors with only minimal differences. this again leads to a common color together. SLR cameras usually need more focal sharpening as normal cameras for the private application.</seg>
<seg id="484">At JPEG-images often have been applied to the camera internal sharpening. pictures in the pipe-format must always be hardened in during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">"some scanner use a focal filter already during the reading of the picture. if you deactivate this, you get control of your image."</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get usable results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening value.</seg>
<seg id="487">"but you should deal with this, however, since the results are not very natural: the sharpness increases the sharpness of the edges, but also improves the smokers. in general, the beneficial technique for shareholding the tool is focused. you can find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="488">"sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is being cracky. the solution, the image is a little soft, it is much easier than to sharks. use the tool to display with the menu. use the tool on the right side of the dialog box shows you the effect on your photo."</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter noblur masculine is a very good tool to remove the veil of your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and the preview help the picture to edit. the preview of the movie shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the standard values are often good results and should first be tried. an increase in the radius or the amounts are increasing the effect. if you create the unsharpness mask, smoothing and the impression of grates near sharp edges."</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius makes such as many pixels on each side of a cante affected by the filters. high-resolution images allow greater radii. you should therefore have a look at the best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the intricate image one of the original is added. thereby the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">"the swelling is a breakdown from the maximum RGB value and to use differential amount. one can therefore use a minimal difference to make a cante of filter. in this way, areas can be avoided with a soft change between the tones of sharpening and therefore beauty in mind, heavens and water surfaces."</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the blarf masking filters. the original image is the (1) and this processed image the (2). unsharp masking has been used with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a swelling = 0.0. "</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digikam; tool Refocussing refusussed an image by improving the sharpness. it used to use the copyrighted power filter algorithm for Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries to get an image to & quot; refokussing quot; in which it is a better approach than just try to sharply the photo. it is used to use a technique called FIR Wiener Filing. it is used to start a technique called FIR Wiener Filing. it can normally launch better results than unsharp masking. you can start it from the menu by adding colors refocus on the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">"in practice, the circular folding is much better than the Gauß'sche Ffolding. the Gauß'sche Ffolding has a very long tail, which is the mathematical result also depends on the source pixel which is far from the original pixel. it causes unwanted results even very strongly from the remote pixel. it causes unwanted results."</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular folding. it is the most important parameter for the use of this module. for most pictures it should put a higher value when your image should be very unsharp and then on healing.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help to reduce artifacts. the correlation can be chosen from 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0,95 and material. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpening effect of the module. "</seg>
<seg id="501">"smokfilter: an increase in the room filter can help you reduce artifacts. however, values can help from 0-1. however, values higher than 0.1 is only rarely helpful. if the smokfilter is too low, & eg; 0 the image quality is very bad. a usable value is 0.03. a high value is still to decorate the image."</seg>
<seg id="502">"Gauß'sche sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauß 'sche sharpness. use this parameter if your unsharpness Gauß' is. in most cases, you should use this value to 0 to make annoying artefacts. if you might use a value to zero, you might also need to increase the correlation and / or sound filter."</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrician size: this value determines the size of transformer matrix. an increase in the matrician size can have good results especially if you choose large values for the circular sharpness or Gauß's sharpness. note that the module is very slowly when you choose large values for this parameter. in most cases you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The storing and store buttons are used exactly for this purpose. each auditing parameter is set to you and can then be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to perform all of the additive and Intensity representation on the picture before you use the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">"otherwise, you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that a lot of operations changes which are not immediately visible, but later unpleasant artifacts leave."</seg>
<seg id="507">"if you read pictures and press, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image."</seg>
<seg id="508">"generally produced unsharp masks for better results as sharpenalizing. this could be caused by this, the unsharp masking is used as sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="509">"theoretically, unsharp masculine always must create artifacts. even under optimal conditions it can never be the effect of the unsharpness. for the Vienna filters it is possible to show at least as good as the unsharpness mask. the FIR Wiener Filter is often better in the processing of small details."</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between different filters on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp colour picture must be corrected. this picture has been made with a analogue camera. the most focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto-focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">"for more information about the methods of shareholdings in digital image, you can read a technical comparison in English under this address."</seg>
<seg id="513">The regulator made the insharpness of the area that was darkened to create a natural Pupunner.</seg>
<seg id="514">"the colour tinte allows a customized color for the Puppets. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, then you can adjust this here."</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool imaging is one of the most advanced tool to remove not desired artifacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The algorithm algorithm was developed by the IMAGE Team of GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different preferences as starter points to simplify the restoration. the available preferences are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">"if you want to adjust the filtering settings, you can use the rider smoothing and advanced settings."</seg>
<seg id="519">"detailed warehousing p [0, 100]: this controls the maintenance of the details. a small value leads to an equal passenger via the image. why a value of 0.9 should not get details so that no sharpening is necessary. please note that the details will always be subordinated to the signcode."</seg>
<seg id="520">Directness Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes equally into all directions while a value is close to 1 just in a direction. if you have a screening and CCD Rauschen will create a high value of wave-like pattern. JPEG artefacts will be best by 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">"smoothes [0, 500]: this puts the maximum gluten factor above all. p is then defined the relative smoothing. place this value therefore suitable to the degree of space in your image."</seg>
<seg id="522">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects greater structures. the higher this value is necessary, the more it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbulletin effect, he needs to be higher than 3."</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: on how often the algorithm is going through. normally there is 1 or 2 out.</seg>
<seg id="524">"angle gradual as [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of the anisotrope alpha. if Alpha small will be chosen, there should be too small for a long term. you should make this value as greatest possible and acceptable to your needs."</seg>
<seg id="525">"integrated step-wide [0.1, 10]: Integrated Gradual range in pixels. you should put the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never greater than 2."</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear interpolation to use: the more quality that you get through selection of this option is only low. he doubles the term. we therefore recommend it to that.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons saved as and store exactly this. each setting of image error can be saved in a text file and will be recharged later.</seg>
<seg id="528">"however, it is comparatively very fast at work. but it can still last very long and a high CPU load to move. you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the knock."</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see such as pictures with Small artefacts. the module is done on a photo that is caused in Guatemala City with a analogue camera. as you see there is a peculiar black artifact while the journey is caused by a poor film storage. the original picture is below (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digikam; Rauschreduction is a very powerful tool to decrease imaging. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">"this tool sets out selectable image filter available to remove spots and other artifacts, e.g. from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensors from the camera or moireacute; -effects of scanned images from books or magazines."</seg>
<seg id="532">"if you need more information about Sensors of digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial."</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshots above shows a typical scene that was done with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grained space that can be successful with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases you only need the subwindow details and the subwindow advanced settings may remain with default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">"radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) which is used for the filter. large values increase the time of the filter per pixel and can replace the picture above the image and the color in it becomes glaciated and therefore smaller errors."</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the level of sharpness. this value sets the pixels that can be deleted from the filter to the front. you may need to adjust the edges filter if you have to change this setting. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer obtain and rustling or lubricate it again. "</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the cantatness for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filtering. if it is too strong can not occur a value close to the maximum when you want to remove it a growing Rauschen or JPEG-artifacts without any details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance intolerance of the image. we recommend you to change either color or luminance to change a picture. these settings do not affect the fluid process of the details of the details.</seg>
<seg id="539">Colour: controls the colour tolerance of the image. we recommend you to change either color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the fluid process of the details of the details.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gamma: controls the gammering of the picture. this value can be used to increase the tolerances of the darker areas, which typically become stronger, however, it also sparked the downsides."</seg>
<seg id="541">"steaming: controlled the adjusting of the phonembedding. this value is defined as fast the adaptive filter radius of variations of the luminance. if it is increased, the edges of the luminance, when he can occur at his minimum, one can remove robbery and phasenjitter on the edges. he can remove smoktips and is the recommended method for it."</seg>
<seg id="542">"save under and store: these buttons are used exactly for this. all parameters of the space reduction, which you have set can be stored and loaded into the filesystem."</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how space reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and corrected with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">"sometimes a picture is a cracky for your purpose. the solution to draw the image a little soft, is fortunately much easier than one image to sharks. use the tool to display with the menu. use the effect on the right side of the dialog box shows the effect of this operation on your photo."</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digikam; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce Photoproduction.</seg>
<seg id="546">"this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artefacts from your images. it is very well adapted to remove Gauge's, scattering, craters, compressors, compressors, scoring images and thus gets the content like it is also the human eye."</seg>
<seg id="547">"the same algorithm can be used for color and texture, the texture is done with another tool, the image error corrections. the algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMAGE Team of GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the CImg project."</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG artifacts reduce: the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far away. as a left compressors compressors, he produces some compression & quot; artifacts; - small standards that can be adjusted in uncompressed image. this setting should be correct. "</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons storing as and store exactly this. each setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and will be recharged later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo-restoration is comparatively very fast at work. but it can still last very long and a high CPU load to move. you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the knob.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can reduce like a photo with Equal Rauschen.. The module is applied to a black and white photo that with a Minolta (tm) HP-5 film with a Sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious filmstrip on the faces. the original image is under (1) and corrected under (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo-restoration. this time textures can be read on an old colour photo which was caused by a scanner that can be seen from the Scannerlights and the photopapier. the original picture is below (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">"the detikam; tool Hotpixel allows to remove hotpixel from photos that have been removed with an CCD camera, eight. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project, which are protected by Martin colopp."</seg>
<seg id="554">"bright, total or hot pixels are particularly high in high-quality pipe mode photos a problem since many cameras with JPEG compression over a built-in oppression for hot pixels."</seg>

<seg id="558">"first, as described in the previous section, you should load the matching dark picture of the dark picture. an automatic processing of the dark image will notice the bad pixel and this automatically invites you to the next session."</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and the preview can help you correct the result. the preview of the movie shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area around the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. choose the best filter method to interpolishing this pixel blocks. these are the available filters:</seg>
<seg id="561">"Durcut: there will be an average of the neighboring pixel. the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation, this is made separately for horizontal and vertical line."</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from Pixelblock will be considered to calculate a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolishing the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filtering method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to Pixelblock are deducted to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim) which is then used to interpolishing the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are deducted to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim) which is then used to interpolishing the defective pixels in the block.</seg>

<seg id="656">"a further rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called Golden law. it should be something that the eye is in the center of composition. this something can simply be there without the eye to guide it will fulfil its task."</seg>
<seg id="657">"the golden triangles are also guided by the above golden spirals. their vertices are the middle points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonic triangles, golden triangles are not equal to these lines. diagonal object can leave a static object of dynamic."</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use golden triangles to break your frame around your frame. try your image focus on one of the intersections and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that can not be reached differently.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options horizontally reflect and vertical mirror can be used to reflect the harmonious particles.</seg>

<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters for audio-quality and the resulting compressors for 'lame' (see 'lame --help' for further parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium' = This setting results in good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">"--preset standard '= This setting should usually offer transparency for most people and most musicians accepted transparency, and has quite high quality. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice."</seg>
<seg id="1523">"--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. needs always 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a titles. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality."</seg>
<seg id="1524">"-h '= 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate approximately 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a titles. good gene for music of young people, portable devices and car facilities. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want the absolute highest quality without regard to the file size, then select this setting."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"the & CD; information, the manually entered or replaced by the freeDB via the Internet, are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can also pass / kaudiocreator; and the coding program to create the folder and file name, as well as the properties of the music files."</seg>
<seg id="1527">"in connection with encoding programs, there is often a combination of programming settings for the cooperations and these parameters here. the manual or the help of the encoders explain the switch for these programmes."</seg>
<seg id="1528">"e.g. around the & CD; titles to the keywords (English: day) add to MP3s with lame, the switches must be added by lame and the title parameter of & kaudiocreator; the result looks like: '... -tt {title}...'."</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button recording in assistants):</seg>
<seg id="1530">"this is what the freeDB is: a free database in which people can read the audio CDs, so that all the other information can be downloaded from yourself in the computer: & CD; title, artist, names of the pieces & etc; not by the audio file itself."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"yes, it should be legal but I am not an attorney. however, no one can prevent it from the & CD; more or less worthless, so no more information or less worthless, so no information can be added to the artist or CD; business, physically or virtuoso."</seg>
<seg id="1532">"in & kaudiocreator; is an active part of an address (sending an address). for the use of freeDB can be used with another (fake) address when used in the system. in this type of configuration, the email address is not used by the server (This may only the programmer know who has checked the code.)"</seg>
<seg id="1533">"in many countries, there are copies of the main database. if & kaudiocreator; used to use freeDB, the geographical range is to be used in the network and is balances the load between the computers."</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of mirrors for the online retrieval of & CD; information throughout the reading of a & CD; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or (usually monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which outsourcing program is used to store pieces from the & CD; in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumors that is used to be cdparanoia; who is more precisely to know in the source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; see that the cdparanoia package from the appropriate distribution must be installed first if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="1537">"for storing the extingued WAV files, the codierer and therefore the desired file format are selected. at the first opening you will be predefined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a left-free compressing for audio data)."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Kodierer package must be installed from the concerned Linux distribution before the Kodierer can be used. this is also necessary for predefined co-operations. more information about cooperations are in the chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">"after installing a co-operation, further information on its switches can be obtained through the input of a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a consoles window (eg; console). it must be replaced by the name of the installed encoders."</seg>
<seg id="1540">"this can have many causes. check out the device recording of the & CD; / DVD drive, the writing and reading of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, oggenc for OGGs, flac & etc;). try to give both programs with a command line in a terminal. this could give an indication of what is wrong."</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you do not want to read a copy-protected audio CD; check out the envelope of the & CD; it will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you use other settings, this tips can give you how to proceed. "</seg>
<seg id="1543">"have you read the complete manual, everything understood, but are somehow still uncertain what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by step example, and you will get enough information to make the program exactly what you want."</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example we will start the program for the first time everything set up and read our first & CD; we are lame '--preset extreme' to create MP3s with a VBR (variable bit rate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3v1 keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">"it must be installed cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be found as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution, since it is not necessary to compile the source files as it is not necessary to compile the source files."</seg>

<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic settings of & kaudiocreator; something which is probably only done once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes how to read a & CD; what has to be repeated for every trigger & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine how to use Kodierer for the compression of the music (lame) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). it is intended where the files are stored and which structure is used to use the freeDB to download the freeDB from the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">"although we can change this settings at any time, we will most likely not be found in any reading of a & CD; change if once the matching settings are found."</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device recording will be handed over to the readable program so that it can read the & CD; data / pieces read.</seg>
<seg id="1552">"frequently / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the actual device recording of your drive. if this is not working or if more than a & CD; / DVD drive, can also be accessed into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the available entries of the device drivers for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives."</seg>

<seg id="1557">"the second outlet field is simpler, a & CD; entry is found immediately the reading of the & CD. if you are later unhappy with the database entry and the file name / filename or file name, they can easily change. the directory or filename is changed with Konqueror- &gt; rename and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & KDE. tage.at."</seg>
<seg id="1558">"apart from this example, if you want to manually give everything manually, so deactivate the selection fields and freeDB will not be used if you are able to use the database before. however, this is about 620 MB large, consider these two selections, at least the first. the mode will be set up on the following boxes."</seg>

<seg id="1661">In this section the patches will be displayed as the patches of General MIDI on your specific keyboard. the general use looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">"please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are subject to the correct order (from 0 to 127), you may not change the sequence for one of the 128 instruments."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"the optional AllKeysTo M is used to put all sounds that this instrument need to put on the tone with the number M. if your keyboard is not supported (e.g. with sound 60), which is similar to a thread. in addition, you can use the following in the PATCHMAP section."</seg>
<seg id="1664">"so if a MIDI file is to play a note with patch 127 (Win), it takes a patch 100 (the Drum on your keyboard) and plays the tone 60, regardless of which tone in the MIDI file is."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"please note that here with the term Drum patch of the patch is meant to be a different performer instrument (drum, pelvis, Maracas & etc;), and not the one who means the sound height of the always equal drum (like it does some keyboards)."</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is needed to specify how sounds on a particular channel or instrument. use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"as the PATCHMAP section is the order of rows very important, as well as their presence. you must therefore create 128 entries."</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define for each channel and every instrument multiple Keymaps. you just have to use different names only in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used mainly to form tones on the perkussions channel. look for example the keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">"this section can be used to form a few channels to others. if you want to change the first and second channel, you can easily put it in CHANNELMAP section."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"however, these settings are useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a particular channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9)."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"Midi-Devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, built according to the following patterns:"</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is depicted on the Channel N. if you use the keymap option will of course be defined in the file name for this channel. if you are using the ForcePatch option will try to change the patch on this canal. in this case the patch will always be a patch.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option may be useful for example to use the perkussions patch on the perkussions channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderratio can be multiplied in which ratio of Pitch is multiplied with the value of n * (r / 4096) and then only forwarded. the value 4096 is used in the map file (no decimal as).</seg>
<seg id="1676">"this setting will be used because GM gives you a keyboard, which should play a pitch for two sounds to one octave. unfortunately, try to play a few keyboards up to one octave. unfortunately, try to try the right value on your keyboard, you have to try a bit with & kmid; around."</seg>
<seg id="1677">"to use a MIDI-map, simply open the dialog MIDI settings. this can be found in the menu under settings, point MIDI settings."</seg>
<seg id="1678">The canals view is a window with a whole series of Klaviaturen (one for every MIDI channel). on these Klaviaturen you can see which sounds just played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">"you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel. for each channel you can choose a tool. if you have changed an instrument, the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used."</seg>

<seg id="1682">"you can change the pace of a song. if you find e.g., a song is too fast to follow the text, you can slow down the pace, use the arrows left and right from the LCD."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a music piece must be played. it contains the notes, the rhythm, speed, & etc; it can lead the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results, just like two different musicians play the same notes to very different ways."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"good, I can force anybody to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file is used for about 50 KB, while an mp3-file you need a similar sound quality. with a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc; you have control over everything."</seg>

<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of protocols files for the format of the syslog server and for samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included in addition and are explained in the further chapters of this handbook.</seg>
<seg id="2946">"as you can see in the following screenshots, presents & ksystemlog; features available, with the help of the individual protocol line of a protocol file easily filter and sorting. the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering will be shown in the next chapter of this handbook."</seg>
<seg id="2947">"after startup and ksystemlog; first, the most important protocol-file of the system - the system protocol is not displayed, and it opens up instead of a small news window, so you can not find it under Linux usually in the folder / var / log, for the normal user usually no justification for reading."</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter a selected criterion or after a selected string. the list of the log files will be automatically displayed so that only the list of the log files will be displayed in addition to the filter. then a protocol line is displayed only when in one of the columns the string box contains the filter-box.</seg>
<seg id="2949">"you can also select another entry in this place. the string of the filter searchengine is then used only with the entries in accordance with selected column. select the name of a process, so will show you & ksystemlog; all protocol lines that have been sent or created by this process."</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is activated in default and helps you to see the important protocol lines. protocol lines of stage errors are shown with a striking color as the protocol-lines of the stage note. the colored representation of the protocol can be switched.</seg>
<seg id="2951">"if you want to show only certain process (for example in the system protocol or in the Cron protocol), so you can get the process identification (PID) in the column process. this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the Samba server. in this case you will use filterbar."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"in addition, you can choose the option to view new lines in the context menu of the main window to display all new additions to the upcoming protocol."</seg>

<seg id="2956">"to the & KDE, System V Init Editor, more known (and in the following also named) as & ksysv; this section leads a few concepts and describes what you can do with & _ sysv;"</seg>
<seg id="2957">"the V Init develops rapidly to the control of the program starts at the high level of the system in the & Linux; world. and therefore, because it is easier to use, powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD style."</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go here further on historical aspects (e.g. because I do not know about it himself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">"the Init binaries is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because maybe someone might try to make a machine on System V Init, without a reinstalling and reformatting. therefore, you have to make sure that the old init was removed from there, if there was one."</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init is also different from the BSD init that is the configuration files in a subfolder of / etc are directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.sysinit and the following additional folder:</seg>
<seg id="2961">"init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically you need a script for each system service that you want to start using the system or when changing to another runlevel. system services do not include such things such as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things such as setserial, which is only once started. such Views belong to rc.local."</seg>
<seg id="2962">"rc.local should lie on the one hand under / etc / rc.d, if you need it. most systems do this file. you can also do a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d when you want to do something with the serial port."</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel search for different places after the program init and starts the first one finds it.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default Runlevel is available in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">"at this point you can take a look at the second column and probably notice that the pre-set Runlevel 3 is. if you want to change / etc / inittab from hand and change the 3. if you want to change it, then you can fix it by making the system new and execute the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how does it start all the right scripts? if you enter ls -l in rc3.d, then you will probably see some as the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that in this folder there is no right files. instead, each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the directory. "</seg>
<seg id="2968">How does and stop init actually system services? quite simply: each of the scripts is so written that there is an argument like start and stop. you can start this script actually by hand on the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would hold the httpd server. init reads the name, and when the one K contains, the script will be called to the argument stop. if it includes a S, the script will start with the argument start."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people desire a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could & eg; a server-Runlevel, which can only be httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc. furthermore, I could also have a user -Runlevel, the & eg; & kdm;, network & etc."</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Using & sysv; using a mouse or another pointer of time is easy to not to say trivial: simply drag an entry from the area of the Available system services to one of the six Runlevel to start it at this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also change scripts between Runleveln or change position within a level by changing it elsewhere. this will only take place in the area of its original runlevel (or its position). this does not happen if you want to pull an entry out of the field of disposable system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries will be postponed if you want to copy them into a new field. to select it only to a new Runlevel, you must explicitly select from the menu or from the context menu, even if the same entry exists previously in the target area of the action."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the sorting number of a entry cannot be charged at times. in such a case, you must edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can again try to insert the system."</seg>
<seg id="2976">"at present, there is no possibility to restore entries that were thrown into the trash. be careful."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the Tabulator button to enable the various operating ranges (Available system services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"to move an entry to another Runlevel, move it with carving into the clipboard (you can also Ctrl; X) and add it to the desired runlevel with insert (Ctrl; V)."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"to change the sorting number or the name of a contract manually, press the entry button to switch between different fields. use the dialog box to accept the changes, or press Esc to change the changes."</seg>
