&quot; although I had visited the United States for 2012 at least once a year , I would now live there for the first time . &quot;
and that was very exciting for me .
my love of America is extraordinary .
&quot; as many of my generation I grew up with American movies , I have read American music and operated by American authors . &quot;
indeed this country had such a very profound effect on me that I was mainly journalist for an American film journalist .
&quot; as a 14 @-@ year @-@ year I played the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , a fe@@ ar@@ less re@@ porter , who used with the help of Julia Roberts as a Jura student , who were the first Federal Court with judges that were his interest . &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; free to Meth@@ od Man , &quot; I was , as if the absolute truth is , disc@@ ern@@ ing everything else , that is what I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the US had only strengthened . &quot;
&quot; I always said , &quot; America is the only country where I ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting you are always the one that you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of equal people . &quot;
I even had a very sul@@ try love of love about his size .
then Donald Tru@@ mp arrived .
much has been written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his asc@@ ension is for me how he goes with his commitment .
he never holds the mountain behind the mountain as you say so beautiful .
&quot; he says exactly what he thinks about like a former colleague , and publicly declar@@ es his contem@@ pt for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ Americ@@ an@@ ians and women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the people in his statements are re@@ acted and stopped for him . &quot;
&quot; the 13 million voices that he won by the re@@ publ@@ ican pre@@ domin@@ ate , was the highest number that was ever reached by the party of nom@@ inee candidate . &quot;
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
&quot; who are the Americans who support these big@@ otte person , I asked me ? &quot;
I could not get to meet Tru@@ mp and his voters to meet people during my time in Phoenix .
&quot; as for example my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ c@@ ock , Director of Journ@@ alism , which takes people from all over the world , a deep believing man , with whom I could talk about Islam and his past . &quot;
&quot; also agreed with the author of Peter B@@ hat@@ ia , the current publisher of the &quot; Cincinnati In@@ quir@@ er &quot; . &quot; &quot;
B@@ hat@@ ia and I met us at our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the &quot; Phoenix Suns . &quot; to play .
&quot; tru@@ m@@ ps intoler@@ ance is also in contrast to gener@@ osity I lived in Sandy Bah@@ r who fought for her life for her life , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me as their son . &quot;
&quot; still fits them to the commitment of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who helped me with much patience and grace to me and my colleagues helped to get used to the complexity of the American life . &quot;
&quot; then Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise advice has helped me much with my career . &quot;
these people and those through them em@@ bo@@ died values and dee@@ pen@@ ed my love for America .
&quot; while Tru@@ mp is his way to nom@@ inees re@@ publ@@ ican pres@@ idential elections , they offered me a grip and the counter@@ part to his limited vision of America . &quot;
&quot; however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule . &quot;
&quot; on 8 November 2016 over 50 million Americans , mostly wh@@ ites , the pres@@ idency of a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his contem@@ pt towards non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the conflict with the idea that people saw for Tru@@ mp , because they shared either its rac@@ ism and fan@@ at@@ icism , or because they were ready to over@@ looked these things , broke me almost the heart . &quot;
perhaps it is unfair to describe the Tru@@ mp elect@@ ors as rac@@ ist .
&quot; to arrange people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation . &quot;
&quot; this is su@@ perf@@ ic@@ ially and respect@@ ful and indicates an in@@ ability to understand those who act in another way and think . &quot;
it shows the people that their concerns and fears about the hect@@ ic changes in their communities are not considered .
&quot; could it be that these voters , of which most knows are , for Tru@@ mp , because they would like to repeat control over a country that she has disappointed ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , they might want to say that they are still important in this America ? &quot;
maybe .
&quot; however , you can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick who commented the cruel decision to rise up a man who look different with contem@@ pt upon those who look different than he . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( An@@ m. d . : so much as &quot; charging of the wh@@ ites against all other ethnic and wh@@ i@@ pl@@ ash , which means that much means such as Schle@@ u@@ der@@ trau@@ ma ) as it did the big Van Jones , has exactly what America made so great . &quot;
&quot; millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - which faith or background you may have always like , America is definitely welcome . &quot;
&quot; for this land chose as his president , twice the son of a Ken@@ y@@ man whose history , as he says himself , nowhere else in the world would be possible . &quot;
&quot; however , with choosing Donald Tru@@ m@@ ps , however , there is a huge part of the white Americ@@ anism of this promise and says : to hell with diversity , religious freedom and the whole concept of plur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in the America after 9 / 11 the white man is back on the ruin , say it . &quot;
&quot; with all I have to think about Kh@@ iz@@ r Khan , the father of a soldiers who liked in Iraq , and what he said at the eve of the election . &quot;
on a r@@ ally of Hill@@ ary Clinton Mr. Khan had a voc@@ al change with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp , would have been my son , captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan . &quot;
the crowd repl@@ ied with a lau@@ t@@ strong &apos; no !
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; brit@@ tle the crowd .
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; &quot; answered them . &quot;
have Afr@@ o @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they called them and their voices were l@@ ou@@ der . &quot;
&quot; if anyone who did not have as you , a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a un@@ anim@@ ous and lau@@ t@@ ent &quot; NE@@ IN &quot; !
&quot; Mr. Khan concluded with words : &quot; &quot; God is thanks , Mr. Tru@@ mp , is that not your America . &quot; &quot; 36 hours later he was given . &quot;
&quot; the land , for which his son had fallen , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; this is now Tru@@ m@@ ps land , said the message . &quot;
&quot; and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could not find a place in this new America . &quot;
and that breaks me my heart .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero municipality in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ischen town Cat@@ e@@ ura together ?
&quot; that the music that is played in both places , not only the life of the children has changed , but also a very close connection with ... &quot;
music that lives with the waste
&quot; Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a big gar@@ bage dump , only 16 Kilomet@@ ers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial city which is very popular among tourists but worlds from the nearby pre@@ mi@@ xer ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine . &quot;
&quot; for several years now , La B@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ s@@ ica is now playing in the municipality : one of children and adults already exist with the sym@@ ph@@ ony orchestra Orchestra , which has found an opportunity to overcome them the surrounding poverty . &quot;
a musical school with 100 students is dedicated to the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca for central interest .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; the community that is located in one of the poo@@ rest provinces Mex@@ ik@@ os , is known for their drugs of abuse and the gangs of violence . &quot;
&quot; however , this changed after a random meeting with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth began a rare hop@@ eless . &quot;
the young band members take their obligations to the music group very seriously , the local press Not@@ ic@@ ias O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI : &quot;
once they come out of school they go back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dust@@ y roads to deal with their great passion .
&quot; you always come and play with sh@@ iny eyes and play in the chest you learn day for day trumpet , trombone , pic@@ colo , clarinet , oboe , flute , Wald@@ horn , Pau@@ g@@ os and the Con@@ ga . &quot;
music from Tr@@ ash
&quot; more than 7@@ ,000 kilometers south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura - a village which is conveniently located at the top of the largest gar@@ bage dump of A@@ sun@@ ción in Paragu@@ ays capital - on instruments that are made out of recycled material : &quot;
&quot; music with re @-@ prepared instruments made from local solid waste materials , made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ e@@ ura , where the recycling under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Chá@@ vez began to turn parts of the fall into instruments . &quot;
&quot; instruments im@@ it@@ ate ge@@ igen , viol@@ as , C@@ elli , double @-@ bass , guitars , flutes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trumpets , tromb@@ ones and percussion , which were all made from the tr@@ ash . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire comprises classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ic and Latin American music as well as music of Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article of Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Chá@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and music instructor of the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura , to the beginning time : &quot;
&quot; first , it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach at the same place where children did not know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live with their children . &quot;
this changed when F@@ avi@@ o has been shown something that he never had seen before : one out of waste @-@ asked violin .
&quot; today , there is a whole orchestra that plays with instruments made of re @-@ prepared material and call the recycled Orchestra . &quot;
a documentation named &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( harmon@@ ic gar@@ bage dump ) marks the musical performance on :
the world generates every year approximately one billion ton tr@@ ash .
those who live with him and from him are the poo@@ rest - as the people in Cat@@ e@@ ura , Paraguay . &quot;
and here they transform him into a little beauty .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring spect@@ acle from tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the Orchestra has played his music even before Pope Franzis@@ kus :
&quot; these East African countries show how technology and teamwork , the illegal fishing industry can fight successfully . &quot;

&quot; in West Africa , the ship had already been known that this ship had already operated in liber@@ ated waters and fishing fishing before it was the other coast of Africa . &quot;
&quot; the East African countries were accordingly accordingly , and little gen@@ dar@@ ed to welcome a law@@ ful of this kind at its ch@@ ocol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; Tanzania , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ os , Mozambique and the Seychelles mobil@@ ized quickly against the ship . it denied him to share one of their ports and WE@@ IG@@ ER@@ TEN . &quot;
&quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that you simply denied everything that Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a leading employee of the Ken@@ yan fisher@@ ies . it is part of a team that was discovered and followed by the ship . &quot;
in 2013 the ship was driven out of the waters of the region : it was not successful to catch the fish there .
&quot; ultimately , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars in Liberia , due to pill@@ age the fisher@@ ies of the country . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , the criminal practices crossed by the ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the NR@@ O stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Il@@ leg@@ ale Fis@@ her@@ ies ) . &quot;
members of this network are next to Somalia and Madagascar the six countries that then had driven out the prime minister from their waters .
&quot; &quot; with this we have eight countries , the same @-@ minded and work together . they exchange information and are each other where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; says Tony Long , Head of the Pe@@ w Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project provides F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
illegal fishing is by definition un@@ regulated : what is im@@ pris@@ oned : what is hidden because it is extremely difficult to catch . that &apos;s the illegal fishing is a main cause of over@@ fishing from regions .
&quot; by intent@@ ional missions of existing legislation , using which certain habitats and species are to be protected , the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems may have a del@@ usion balance . &quot;
&quot; but while actions against illegal fishing were used by bureaucrat@@ ic hur@@ dles , and also by the sn@@ ails , with the information between individual countries , the actions are done in real time , with trac@@ eable on F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; here , the individual countries can exchange with each other for example lists , news about sus@@ pic@@ ious activities or details that can be noticed during a port inspe@@ ctions or experienced . &quot;
Fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very attentive when these are moving at the open sea by satellite .
&quot; this makes it possible to discover the authorities , ships which fish in the forbidden areas of fish . also , so sus@@ pic@@ ious obje@@ ctions - about such that points that a ship invites his fallen fish on other ships . &quot;
&quot; ideally , such tests can show whether the participating ships have a fishing licence where they were on the road and possibly also whether they have a crime . &quot;
&quot; countries that are against illegal fishing , can be denied based on these ships in their har@@ b@@ ours . what does the ships cannot sell their charge , and that they can even be forced to numbers from pen@@ al@@ ties , as in the case of the Premier . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is then about significant financial losses for the owners , which means that illegal fishing can no longer be worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; says Per Erik Berg@@ h , condu@@ cting director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a advis@@ er company dedicated to fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also called F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
a closed front
&quot; the already mentioned platform has been created to gain a estimated 20 million USD in lost sales , which awak@@ ens the eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i each year because of the illegal fishermen , which penet@@ rate into Eastern African waters . &quot;
&quot; East @-@ Africa has one of the most productive thin @-@ fish @-@ fish @-@ fish , one of the region &apos;s commercial fishing from around the world . among these also known these illegal fishermen . &quot;
&quot; among their practices include actions such as the sailing under fal@@ ter flag , fake roy@@ alty , specification of Phant@@ as@@ ien@@ amas , the fish sh@@ iel@@ ded species and the fish in nature @-@ areas . &quot;
&quot; &quot; they also use the lack of international cooperation and make yourself increasing the weaknesses of a non @-@ seam@@ lessly organized control system , &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; formerly a ship could be illegal and a country could not say &quot; You dar@@ ed my port . &quot;
but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &apos; and exactly this leg@@ ale sle@@ w tries to close the ISH @-@ i .
so far the closed front .
since its foundation F@@ ISH @-@ i was involved in more than 30 studies of suspe@@ cts ships .
there has been criminal networks un@@ covered the fake lic@@ ences in Tanzania . it discovered ships who used several frau@@ dul@@ ent ident@@ ities and found vol@@ at@@ ile ships .
&quot; due to its collaboration with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to combat crime , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing across great distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; some of our studies lead us quite far into the networks organised crime , &quot; says Berg@@ h . &quot;
he builds a system that is intended to help the F@@ ISH @-@ i to precise ships of precise ships .
photo with friendly permission of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; Fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is always further developed , helps to hide the illegal vessels that are happy to hide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; the illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and position . and that we try to cross , &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , a NR@@ O , which deals with fisher@@ ies and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; some of the ships turn on the example of their automatic ident@@ ifier systems , which can no longer be used by satellite . &quot;
&quot; Cop@@ eland helps to build a system that connects various information from each other . it should help F@@ ISH @-@ i to help crimin@@ alize criminal ships with greater precision . &quot;
a model program
but F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team can actually affect an influence on the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the NR@@ O Sky@@ truth , believes that . &quot;
&quot; recently , Sky@@ truth has been opened together with Google and the marine organisation Oce@@ ana the platform Global Fishing Watch : a platform that offers satellite transmission and can be displayed by using the position of each trac@@ eable ship worldwide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; join forces to get a better picture of what is doing - that is simply meaning , &quot; &quot; says he . &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and to fl@@ ush their resources . &quot;
&quot; we should do this on a global level . &quot; &quot; Pe@@ w char@@ itable tru@@ sts has a similar project to run , when a global system leaves the persecution of ships . &quot;
there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only feel crimin@@ als but they also abol@@ ished .
ships which were used to count earlier without a license and hardly any consequences they know that they are observed .
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participated in F@@ ISH @-@ i participating countries now have a 33 % increase in fisher@@ ies revenue , since fishing boats . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had helped , Gre@@ ko 1 opened , the in@@ spect@@ ators found there on board tow@@ ing networks , whose use is prohibited . &quot;
photo with friendly permission of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; also other countries notice this success . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that us now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; in West Africa there are several hundred million dollars by illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; in addition , 2015 six countries have joined together , the West Africa Task Force . also they are now fighting the illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model like F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; the goal is to make more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s younger member states to report on his first big triumph : in October it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was under wrong flag . and not only was the ship with no licence on the road and were not only forbidden . &quot;
&quot; the ship was also covered in vain waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with the Take of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Berg@@ h . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time evidence that such particular , collabor@@ ative working method works to protect the oceans .

&quot; under the h@@ as@@ ht@@ ag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the Return of Venezu@@ el@@ as ) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them . &quot;
&quot; the debate is also led in other parts of the country - among other things in the low@@ lands of Bar@@ inas , in the Andes @-@ regions of Mé@@ rida and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , in the centrally located Bun@@ dest@@ a@@ at Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva Esp@@ arta . &quot;

&quot; Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , contrib@@ ut@@ ors at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , takes up the current article as follows : &quot;
&quot; within the framework of social , political and economic crisis , the referendum is estimated at 500 % to the annual accounts for many as the only way to withdraw its institutional structures and close to a new governance . &quot;

&quot; there , the prot@@ esters went back to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves according to their own statement against the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government . &quot;
&quot; hours later they were able to leave the cathedral again safely , but the protests went further . &quot;
&quot; in other parts of the country we tried some prot@@ esters , the police force , including this woman in the An@@ den@@ State T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira : &quot;

the interview was translated into English and will be published with friendly permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qu@@ ij@@ ano was forced by his father to see the atro@@ cities in La Perla , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine@@ an city of Córdoba . &quot;
&quot; as now , Qu@@ ij@@ ano now told Qu@@ ij@@ ano now as part of the great La Perla Ri@@ bera process in the province of Córdoba against his father . &quot;
&quot; in the process , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes have been studied while being committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an army . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qu@@ ij@@ ano has not been looking for his life .
&quot; starting at the Bür@@ de , the same name as his father to carry up to the brutal fr@@ atern@@ ities in the prison La Perla , which he observed at the age of 15 he suffered enough . &quot;
34 years he retain@@ ed the family secret for themselves .
in the situation then I believed that was fine .
I felt like a secre@@ cy .
&quot; as a child with 15 years , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father . &quot;
&quot; at that time , I could not know that my father was a th@@ ief , fol@@ ks and mur@@ der@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qu@@ ij@@ ano was G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie@@ be@@ am@@ ter . during the Argentin@@ ian military di@@ kt@@ op@@ ature from 1974 to 1983 , a time of stat@@ err@@ or@@ ism , was his father of 1976 to 1978 dep@@ uty Com@@ man@@ de@@ ur of intelligence services in prison La Perla . &quot;

&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qu@@ ix@@ anos son , a man who had experienced the extent of the atro@@ cities that he had experienced as a boy , and he said before a federal court against his own father . &quot;
&quot; his story shows that great power has a parent over his child , and how this child chose a path of salvation . &quot;
from the Sp@@ orth@@ all to the military @-@ central point
&quot; when my father began to take me to the military to take me , I often went to the sp@@ ans all . there I had made me with a boy who made the martial @-@ sport . &quot;
all called it &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and some days later he showed me a black @-@ white photo and invited me to identify my friend .
he said :
&quot; you are a dick@@ head , you have made you with one of the ERP . &quot;

&quot; therefore he offered me to go back into the sp@@ ans . some days later , he took me to work on the military support . &quot;
he said me I would be secre@@ cy .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine . for so my Father had taken me .
I had to destroy pap@@ er@@ ect that heard the prisoners .
&quot; these were all possible documents : univers@@ ality , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , pro@@ pag@@ and@@ rogen material , books , just everything . &quot;

&apos;@@ So the prisoners are tor@@ tured &apos;
my father took me a total of 4 times after La Perla .
&quot; during the first and last time , he left me at the entrance of the car . &quot;
&quot; when he took me the second time he took me to asc@@ end . he led me to a bar@@ code , in the cars , furniture , television , refriger@@ ators - just everything possible . &quot;
everything from it was st@@ olen .
&quot; he gave me a small in a blank@@ et st@@ icky cand@@ y and commanded me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big cl@@ um@@ ps of silver . &quot;
&quot; on that day , I went to the other end of the Baroque , where the st@@ olen items were picked up and kept me with a wax . &quot;
suddenly he pointed out on an open space and said :
then the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
I wi@@ res and saw a song that were tor@@ tured on the people .
it looked like a field @-@ bed and metal @-@ feathers .
&quot; later , I found out that it was fixed at the end of a cabinet . the other end was fixed at the body of the person who was straight there . &quot;
&quot; you rarely use a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs on the bed , shot him with water and put him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts in gen@@ itals . &quot;

the st@@ ench there was hor@@ ri@@ val@@ ed ... like a dirty win@@ der .
&quot; later , when my father stood under house @-@ rest , the same smell came out of his room . &quot;
I realized the smell immediately and I was clear that the smell of a body in need is .
I could never forget this smell .
&quot; and I asked me , how is it possible only that a person can do another so much suffering ? &quot;
&apos;@@ i knew that these people were killed .
&quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he brought me to the entrance of La cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were captiv@@ ated with gloves . &quot;
&quot; he spoke with &quot; &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilians who was also charged in the process ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
in the background I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people were lying with the face down - all were in hands and feet .
near the entrance to the entrance to the matt@@ resses .
&quot; when my father noted that I saw at the prisoners , he said , &quot; What are you so , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Why hast thou hast brought me anything else ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew acc@@ id that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and buried by soldiers and buried .
I know that because my father told me at home .
beside La cu@@ ad@@ ra there were some rooms that were referred to as offices .
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero there a man mer@@ ged and killed .
&quot; ( according to trans@@ former audit@@ ed of the civilians Jorge Rom@@ ero , which was also charged at the La Perla Ri@@ bera process , the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) . &quot;
&quot; the following video leads Em@@ ilio F@@ es@@ sia , Director of the memorial La Perla , through the former foil chambers . &quot;
&quot; the way to which you came here in , is also the way , on which the kid@@ nap@@ ped came here . &quot;
&quot; if you look at the map , see that they took about this path and then tor@@ tured for the first time . &quot;
&quot; here , their names were changed and they got a number assigned as part of the process of de@@ ception . &quot;
&quot; when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra , until the arrangement of the top came that they should be displac@@ ed . &quot;
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the determination of the people and the dis@@ appearance of their corp@@ ses in most cases .
the &apos; war@@ rior &apos;
my father brought all sorts of st@@ olen things with home .
back then at the age I had no idea what the &quot; war be@@ ute &quot; - as she called it .
&quot; but when I was later in the military , I was in the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie - I was clear that the war was a bay@@ onet or perhaps military signs that one has fought one enemy that is fought . &quot;

&quot; but if one goes into a house and the fridge , the tur@@ nt@@ ables , clothes , paintings , money ... st@@ als , then it is not a war , but Vand@@ al . &quot;
this is theft .
&quot; I always asked me how my father , the head of security forces , with this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I simply understand it simply .
I was also officer at the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter into a house and ste@@ al it all in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my Father could do this .
&quot; once he called me a crimin@@ als and I repl@@ ied , and thou that you walk cars on the street . &quot;
you are not a crimin@@ ality ?
&quot; he explo@@ ded before W@@ ut , struck me and cried : &quot;
&quot; if you go so far , then I will find you and bring you to you . &quot;
that &apos;s why we no one need others !
so was my father .
I have no one good memories of him .
&quot; when I said in the trial , I showed a photo of that time , where I carried a jacket and a roll@@ out pul@@ lover from wool . both had my father from La Perla . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he still brought clothing with home . &quot;
&quot; then he compl@@ ained to the defense , a mer@@ chant of this crimes have been to be . I have ref@@ uted , no problem , they can put me to the load what they wanted . &quot;
I was anyway there to say .
&apos; the dis@@ appearance of the corp@@ se is the last ab@@ hor@@ rible act &apos;
&quot; now , where I am older , I find re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
&quot; I have children . if you have only children , one recogn@@ izes the value of a life . &quot;
develops and realize that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
&quot; well , so you have received during the dictatorship of the dictatorship , but why do the corp@@ ses disappear ? &quot;
why children kid@@ nap@@ ped ?
&quot; one day my father brought a girl with home , whose mother was killed . &quot;
&quot; it was like our pet , almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl . &quot;
I always asked me again the question : they were tor@@ tured but why were they killed ?
you could still have put them in prison .
&quot; I appreciate , it was simply decided to kill these people . but what to leave their corp@@ ses ? &quot;
&quot; had these people not also had families , to whom one was handed over to their mort@@ al remains ? &quot;
the dis@@ appearance of the corp@@ se is the last ab@@ hor@@ rible act to give man to a man .
&quot; my father told me when democracy was introduced again , brought them machinery to eliminate the mort@@ al rem@@ n@@ ants of the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were cru@@ c@@ ated and somewhere ent@@ angl@@ ed - no idea , where . &quot; you will never find something , &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot;
but anything remains of course always .
I have seen how you killed men ! &apos;
only to clarify ... I have nothing against the military .
I even was at the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 crimin@@ als - including my father .
&quot; the thought , show my father was created during a conversation , when he was under house@@ rest . &quot;
I made him accus@@ ations due to all of the atro@@ cities that I had to experience .
&quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; I do not know . I did not kill anyone . &quot;
&quot; I felt inside , and asked myself , why the whole ex@@ agger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings , &quot; which they were supposed to be def@@ ended , actually well . &quot;
then I cried :
how can you tell me ?
I have seen how you killed men !
you have committed aw@@ ful crimes and you have forced me to share with us as a child .
he only ref@@ used &quot; &quot; Na then ze@@ ig me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
exactly what did I do .
in 2010 I re@@ funded the first ad .
I was finally recognized that he was a crime .
nobody can throw myself that I was vo@@ re@@ bi@@ ased . I finally told my own father .

a translation mistake makes elderly people in Kyoto to &quot; fe@@ ar@@ able driving &quot;
the sign with the translation mistake at a centre in Kyoto in which one can extend its leadership .
the photo was widespread in social media .
editing of the original fot@@ os of Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese town Kyoto customers have been a newly opened center in which one can extend its leaders in the last month witness a very particularly mis@@ fortune translation .
&quot; on a sign the Japanese word &quot; &quot; War@@ ran@@ unt@@ en@@ sha ) &quot; , &quot; the &quot; older car &quot; means , &quot; but perhaps also with vic@@ sem back@@ ge@@ vity &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; fe@@ ar@@ tive drive &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was from 1st to 20th September on electronic ads in the input area and in the building itself .
&quot; editing of the original fot@@ os of Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was often divided in social media in many ways . &quot;
&quot; the mistake occurred to the transl@@ ators Julian Hol@@ mes , a inhabitants of Ky@@ ot@@ os , he was also who made the locom@@ otive of it carefully . &quot;
the newspaper Kyoto Shim@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; this is an ins@@ ult to older people and in an international city like Kyoto , &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot;
&quot; the faul@@ ty English translation was initially removed . the term &quot; &quot; drivers &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; terrible drivers &quot; ) was later replaced by the adequate term &quot; Elder &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) . &quot;
the police of the pre@@ fecture Kyoto . furthermore it explained that the error was already included in the text they had received from the transl@@ ators and that the translation has not been tested on their correctness before it was published .
a blo@@ gg@@ ers reported as follows about ap@@ ologies :
&quot; it is really sorry that older people felt by the in@@ sufficient correction ( the translation ) to our turn , &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ cast News set out a bit more detailed with the phenomenon of &quot; terrible &quot; older driving in Japan and wrote :
&quot; the word &quot; fe@@ ar@@ less &quot; was challeng@@ ed as an un@@ appropriate description of driving driving . according to the police there is the share of older driving driving , which are land@@ ed far into accidents , but at the same time for concern . &quot;
in the pre@@ fecture of Kyoto the example in 2005 1.@@ 9@@ 41 of total 19.@@ 460 accidents caused by sen@@ iors . this corresponds to a proportion of 10 % .
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , caused sen@@ iors 1.@@ 8@@ 03 from a total of 11.@@ 850 accidents . &quot;
thus their share rose to 17.@@ 7 % .
&quot; while the number of accidents has fallen in total , the proportion of sen@@ iors caused by sen@@ iors accidents in the same period . &quot;
&quot; the nam@@ ingly not @-@ called re@@ porter brought in the article published version of the article comments to light , which show the pre@@ judi@@ ces of some Japanese seem@@ ingly against older drivers : &quot;
the article on Yahoo over the translation mistake received the following comments :
- &quot; Is this ( &quot; terrible drivers &quot; ) about not the reality ?
&quot; so is the translation actually not , or ? &quot;
- &quot; I do not find that that is a real translation mistake .
there are no few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread in Asia
transl@@ ators are widespread in Japan and across Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a true bul@@ b for this bizarre bug in English .
photo of Flick@@ r @-@ User Andrew .
the reasons for the wide distribution of transl@@ ators are manifold .
&quot; to commit , one needs two important skills : passive knowledge to understand the output text and active language skills to transfer it into the target language . &quot;
the latter requires the active dom@@ ination of the goal - something that is the case in matern@@ al lingu@@ istics . in general , the convict@@ ion is true that transl@@ ators should be in the language language - not in the starting language - mother@@ language should be . &quot;
thus a French mother tongue should translate for example from English to French - not from French to French .
photo of Flick@@ r @-@ User Karl Baron .
&quot; many Japanese companies employ no employee dealing with English as a mother tongue , the translations into English . this may be attributed to the lack of understanding of the transition , the reasons or the relatively small number of English speakers that can learn Japanese . &quot;
&quot; some companies who have no foreign employees to make translations nevertheless fir@@ ing , nevertheless the Japanese staff , whose English knowledge is considered to be the best estimated to transl@@ ators - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are . &quot;
photo of Flick@@ r @-@ User Karl Baron .
machinery translations are also widespread - often with funny results .
&quot; the wor@@ r@@ ile and mysterious propositions which arise by mach@@ ining translations , show that this technique can still replace no human transl@@ ators . this applies to some languages . &quot;
&quot; some of the stran@@ gest English formul@@ ations in Japan , including the mysterious im@@ prints , which often used T @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or even understood . &quot;
photo of Flick@@ r @-@ User Joseph Br@@ ent .
&quot; transl@@ ating error may be acceptable as a jewelry or at least harmless . but by major companies or from the government , which have the means to ensure higher standards , you can expect careful translations . &quot;
the city Kyoto is going to use a serious source of its translations in the future .
Venezuela : protests and f@@ ens@@ ur@@ ances on the Internet and television have to take
&quot; side of the portal &quot; Nav@@ eg@@ ar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( Fre@@ ies surfing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Inst@@ itu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soc@@ ie@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; on Friday morning , April 7th , mel@@ ted ven@@ ez@@ ol@@ ian internet users , that they would have no access to the online transmitter Viv@@ op@@ lay . &quot;
&quot; later , other users wrote that the internet version of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ ol@@ io TV are also no longer accessible . &quot;
also other online transm@@ it@@ oes shots of the protests in Car@@ acas who were organised by op@@ position@@ ists groups which are contra@@ di@@ cted by the government Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro@@ s .
&quot; the protests began in early April , after the Supreme Court opened the Parliament and transferred the duties of Parliament on the ex@@ ek@@ ut@@ ive and the Supreme Court itself . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , released the results of a Trac@@ er@@ out@@ es . he pointed out that the connection is ap@@ pt , and rece@@ i@@ dered to the users , VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet . &quot;
# Zen@@ or@@ ship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that internet pages vene@@ er providers are closed again .
this is from the side by @ Viv@@ o@@ Play@@ Net .
&quot; offers like Viv@@ op@@ lay are popular among vene@@ ers with internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , traditional media have been hes@@ it@@ ated since 2014 in the reporting of protests . then the Commission would like to report on these demonstrations , as the Commission would continue to address this as a &quot; call to violence . &quot; &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels I have already registered at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
amazing that the continued to be cheaper than two lit@@ ers Lim@@ on@@ ade .
&quot; later , the local NGO V@@ Es@@ in@@ fil@@ tro confirmed that not only Viv@@ op@@ lay by a block of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) is in@@ accessible , but also two other online transmitter . this also affects the website , at the National Assembly of their meetings . &quot;
&quot; earlier re@@ research@@ es of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had result that the local internet providers have been able to use DNS . this is a technique to answer the DNS @-@ server requests of certain domains . &quot;
&quot; if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server is incorrect or denied the request when calling for such web site . &quot;
we confirm a DNS @-@ lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net &quot;
&quot; at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third locked channel , the transfer was set on Thursday , 6th April , when the V@@ PI@@ TV @-@ Kamer@@ am@@ ann Elvis Flo@@ res which was transferred the protests in Car@@ acas . &quot;
Flo@@ res was be@@ aten while he was in police .
&quot; eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went back to shipment . &quot;
&quot; although some channels are available on YouTube , was also reported that the government regul@@ ates the Internet connections : thus the Venezu@@ el@@ ans will continue to gain access to m@@ ultim@@ edi@@ al coverage over the current events of the country . &quot;
in Paraguay a lot of girls are too slave to get a training
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a child a cri@@ b ita . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today Tina is fighting for the rights of children and colle@@ cts stuff showing other Cri@@ ad@@ itas that were exactly as they were victims of mis@@ use and discrimination .
photo of Cec@@ ilia Ro@@ jas . use with friendly permission of Kur@@ tur@@ al .
&quot; the following article is the short@@ ened version of a report by Kur@@ tur@@ al , which will be published by Global Vo@@ ices with the kind permission of authors . &quot;
&quot; article is part of a series called &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ uel@@ an , es@@ cu@@ el@@ as que &quot; ( &quot; Flying cows , waste schools &quot; ) , edited by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America and again . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household , in which she did not work together with the family who lived there . &quot;
&quot; shortly before their academic degree at the university she returned again into the house and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about it . &quot; she is like a daughter for us . &quot;
&quot; that , from which something has become &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a has never been treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she was ten years old , she started working as a Cri@@ ad@@ ita for the family . as a Cri@@ ad@@ itas , one described in Paraguay the more than 46.@@ 000 boys and girls who are forced to work to school . &quot;
&quot; the business is quite simple : a big family with little money , there will be their inferior son or her min@@ e@@ old daughter to another , rich family . in exchange receives the child food , a training and a roof over the head . &quot;
&quot; however , what is not mentioned yet , is that the children of doing countless days of house@@ work must be paid , which will never be paid and victims of mis@@ use and abuse - and all this in the framework of a contract , which one can not lift . &quot;
this as a Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go practice is widely spread in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations .
&quot; after completion of their studies Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization , fighting for the rights of the boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; she spoke with Cri@@ ad@@ itas - especially young girls have been affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collect stuff , research@@ ed and p@@ ran@@ ked . &quot;
&quot; she tried to call things to name , because the feeling of gratitude , which is vacc@@ inated the Cri@@ ad@@ itas , guarantees generally silent . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double de@@ ception , &quot; explained Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand the family that their daughter is in the faith that they make their education , their position in society and make &quot; something out of themselves , to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand stands the family that takes up the girls in itself , and its exploitation by faith , that they would give someone a chance that would otherwise no training would get there and maybe even star@@ ve . &quot;
the victims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; when the girl is mist@@ aken , his family will be experienced many years later . &quot;
sometimes they even learn about it .
&quot; in January 2016 there was so far relatively un@@ known phenomenon that will take place in the dark in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen households , but a face . &quot;
as Carolina Mar@@ ín in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú came to hospital her body showed traces of shar@@ pen@@ ed bl@@ ows . shortly afterwards she died .
it was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ ad@@ ita in the household of the former Mil@@ f@@ ran@@ ean Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo who works as a official home at the resident office .
&quot; Mar@@ ín lived in her house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometres east of the capital A@@ sun@@ ción . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ re@@ ira was struck with a stick to Mar@@ ín until they suffered fatal injury . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
some days later the media reported about the inc@@ ident .
they beg@@ ged that the ass@@ ass@@ ination child was a cri@@ b ita .
organizations like UNI@@ CE@@ F or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the deeply responsible for the death of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go for the death of the girl .
they recorded the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came to Protest@@ ants and demanded that there are no more Carolina &apos; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widely used in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay are more cows as children registered , &quot; gif@@ ted Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; without papers , it is much easier to hurt the rights of children . &quot;
&quot; without official documents it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live . &quot;
the neighbours of the couple and almost 60 civil society organisations demanded a fast study of the case .
&quot; they want that Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was their Cri@@ ad@@ ita to be condemned to 30 years im@@ prison@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; if the case before judgment comes , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín will be the case for the first time in the story of Paragu@@ ays a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go before dish . &quot;
the daily life of a Cri@@ ad@@ ita
&quot; cri@@ b &apos;s cri@@ b will not only be exploited , they also live isolated from other girls in their age . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the col@@ ik who worked in her father , and her father had to lose his work . &quot;
&quot; your brothers now had to go all , and began to sell money on the road or on the market of sweets to make money . &quot;
but they all went to school .
only Tina was sent to the capital A@@ sun@@ c@@ ion .
in the house of her employer Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day .
&quot; in doing so , she had to share the time so that you still had time to learning . &quot;
they stood at five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for their employers .
&quot; Fri@@ days for example , they cleans@@ ed the fridge , p@@ used the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the ground . &quot;
when the school was at the end she went home and had time to learn .
&quot; the more it was finished with learning , the more free time it had . &quot;
&quot; however , this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she had to never star@@ ve , but was also not un@@ bound@@ ed food . &quot; I was allowed to get more books from the library of the budget as eating from the fridge , &quot;
&quot; the library was well appointed and belong@@ ed to the landlord , an old military and sympath@@ izers of the Part@@ ido Liber@@ al , a liberal party , which was one of the dictatorship of Al@@ fredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was one of the opposition from 1954 to 1989 . &quot;
&quot; at some canc@@ ers of the households Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , next to him and Editorial from Op@@ posit@@ ors , like &quot; &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; El Pueb@@ lo &quot; . &quot; &quot;
he tried to per@@ su@@ ade them to convince the reports of the official media on the regime of dict@@ ator .
&quot; he held her for intelligent , but did not hold someone with her . &quot; the households had someone found that he spoke about politics , &quot; &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; they allowed me not often to visit my family because they were the opinion that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a I heard that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , which would speak to the indigenous group of the Re@@ vers@@ i to speak at home again her mother tongue . &quot;
&quot; your Lord fe@@ ared that they had the formation that they had to lose , again , explains it . &quot;
&quot; but , it was completely clear that they had paid for everything they had paid by them with their hard work . &quot;
&quot; also in school Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a discrimin@@ ated . &quot; one thing that is almost never spoken , har@@ ass@@ ment and the chic@@ ane where Cri@@ ad@@ itas are exposed when they go to school . &quot;
&quot; because the other children parents have their parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents , a cri@@ b ita . &quot;
I cou@@ ldn &apos;t invite anybody to my home . I had no friends at the school or in the neighborhood .
&quot; in my youth , in time , where friend@@ ships arise , I felt especially clear that I was not one group of people . &quot;
&quot; isolation was the worst of everything , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
the company endor@@ ses the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group , in which one can display for det@@ erg@@ ents and n@@ anny in Paraguay . &quot;
the Administ@@ rat@@ er of the group is Pep@@ a Kost@@ ian@@ ovsky , a city centre in the A@@ sun@@ c@@ ion district . &quot;
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a small companion for my little daughter who plays in the morning and in the afternoon with her .
for learning .
please tell you .
&quot; beginning from Monday , if possible . &quot;
the ad got five &quot; L@@ ikes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the place Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she would have been a el@@ dest girl and gave her phone number .
&quot; another woman who also came from Ñ@@ em@@ by , offered their 15 @-@ year @-@ old nie@@ ce . &quot; &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; in the third comment was written by &quot; a girl from the inland , that would like to work . &quot;
&quot; then , the author of the display has once again a : &quot;
&quot; dear friends , I have found one . I look , whether it works with her . &quot;
&quot; thank you , I write again if something is . &quot;
the business was completed .
in the pro@@ log for the report Cri@@ ad@@ itas @-@ ¿ H@@ asta cu@@ án@@ do ?
&quot; ( Cri@@ ad@@ itas , how long still ? ) , a collection of ced@@ ar @-@ out former Cri@@ ad@@ itas , writes Or@@ ti@@ z : &quot;
&quot; in the course of our history we have made it clear , systems such as slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice dating back to the Spanish conqu@@ ist@@ ors , who had to disp@@ ersed with the Spanish conqu@@ ist@@ ors , and the system of the Mens@@ ú ( in which the workers had to go into a system of slavery , when they are easy victim to abuse and exploitation . &quot;
the social inequality in Paraguay and the vision of power are the key to understanding the phenomenon as cri@@ b az@@ go .
law @-@ design writes Egyptian users social media in order to register with the government

&quot; six@@ ty Egyptian parliament@@ arians have recently agreed to &quot; regul@@ ate the regulations regarding the use of social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if he is accepted by the Parliament , the user must register social media in Egypt at a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the law , then a place would then be set up , which is comm@@ issions to provide citizens with a permission to create social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months of acceptance of the law , users would have to register for use in the website of the site with their right name and personnel numbers , to be able to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; if it failed to do this , so that could bring a penalty up to six months of o@@ ats or a money bu@@ sters . &quot;
&quot; the bill , which consists of six par@@ agli@@ ding and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt independent , defined social media as &quot; every application that runs over the Internet and is used to communicate with others by means of voice , video structures and text . &quot;
&quot; it is un@@ clear how the law is set out when the draft is adopted , as the draft is not able to register as the fact that the Egyptian government does not register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not able to guarantee the regulation on the level of social media companies . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul s@@ ar , parliamentary and promot@@ er of the leg@@ islat@@ ure , told the magazine al @-@ monitor , registered use@@ fulness and users received a username and password &quot; by using the fire@@ wall , the Facebook is blocked . &quot;
&quot; this could mean that Egypt is planning to make a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . because of which it would be necessary for Egyptians to access to their identity , to access the network . &quot;
but it is not so far known that such plans are .
experts and experts on the ground are skept@@ ical regarding the technical feas@@ ibility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Technology is the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; &quot; Egyptian Initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , &quot; told Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
I doub@@ ted strong in technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things that have done with technology .
&quot; in my opinion , they represent it so that just as they are violent physical public and private spaces it could also be done online . &quot;
&quot; if I take it seriously , then it means that they are a strong surveillance system to apply citizens who apply a permit or not . and this means a stir@@ ring system to establish the activities of people and also to establish a trial process . &quot;
this is not by no means realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the leg@@ islat@@ ure of the Parliament and the Const@@ it@@ utional Committee before it enters the pl@@ enary level . &quot;
&quot; whether its acceptance and en@@ forcement will be successful or not , the draft is in line with a pro @-@ military think@@ art in parliament , whose senses is maxim@@ ized and ensured that no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration on the image is present , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;
&quot; last year the Parliament of Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a leg@@ islat@@ ure to Cy@@ ber crime , which was intended for a lifetime prison sentence for those who are intended to be guilty of &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest . &quot;

&quot; high above in the mountains of Kur@@ dist@@ an in the north @-@ east of the Ira@@ ks , the Tier@@ alist H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza and her team of scientists of non @-@ governmental organisation Nature Iraq to protect the spiritual Persian Leop@@ ards . &quot;
&quot; in total , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals that are among the Persian leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ icol@@ or ) . overall , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are always found due to Wil@@ der@@ ei , the loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat , and as they always find less pre@@ y . &quot;
why is this certain kind of leop@@ ards so important ?
&quot; as R@@ aza shows in the video , the Persian Leopard is the only remaining spac@@ ial in the Kur@@ dish ecos@@ ystem &quot; and the health and the thri@@ ve of the ecos@@ ystem also depends on that a large boot@@ leg is available . &quot;
&quot; the chance to see a Persian leop@@ ards actually to see in the free wild line is low and goes against zero . when the team set up in the video that they have a shot of a big cat in the camera all , breaking the R@@ aza breaks into pure joy . &quot;
as a trained Biolog@@ in shows R@@ aza passion@@ ately like another side of their country that exists not only from war and conflict .
it has been involved for six years in field studies to wild animals and on imaging programs of Nature Iraq .
she has also been a member of IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Spec@@ i@@ alist Group and is committed to protecting Kur@@ ds for wild animals in the Kur@@ dist@@ an region .

&quot; in early March 2017 , which were documented in the northeast of Japan &apos;s daily K@@ ah@@ oku Sh@@ imp@@ o , who had been affected by the &quot; Dre@@ if@@ ach disaster &quot; from March 2011 . a huge earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and a atom accident in Fu@@ k@@ us@@ him@@ a had trig@@ ger@@ ed the cat@@ astrophe . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ oku Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in S@@ end@@ ai , which is located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ fecture , which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami . &quot;
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neigh@@ bor @-@ fe@@ ct@@ ures Fu@@ k@@ us@@ him@@ a and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to disappear because the ts@@ un@@ ami had disappear from the map .
&quot; in addition , the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ k@@ us@@ him@@ a lived a atomic accident , already alone they had to leave 160 000 inhabitants their houses . &quot;
the special review of the K@@ ah@@ oku Sh@@ imp@@ o shows from local view which advances six years later to re@@ build the life of local residents .
the detailed report of the newspaper contains both statistics of the Japanese res@@ isting authority as well as survey results of those concerned itself .
&quot; apartment in Fu@@ k@@ us@@ him@@ a , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ oku Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement houses ( &quot; &quot; War@@ ran@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei Ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were finished in the Pre@@ fe@@ ct@@ ures of Fu@@ k@@ us@@ him@@ a , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; the biggest success among the three Pre@@ fe@@ ct@@ ures could be found Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were finished . &quot;
I@@ w@@ ate has finished 75 percent of such houses better than Fu@@ k@@ us@@ him@@ a with 70 percent of the closing light .
&quot; and still , six years after the cat@@ astrophe , ev@@ acu@@ ated of Beh@@ avi@@ ation accommodation ( &quot; &quot; War@@ sz@@ ig@@ su Al@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) can be converted into the final spare parts . &quot;
after the Dre@@ if@@ ach cat@@ astrophe almost 80 000 people were forced to live in Beh@@ ind homes .
&quot; in December 2016 , 36 000 people lived from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ k@@ us@@ him@@ a and I@@ w@@ ate in such homes . &quot;
&quot; nearly 40 per cent of the ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ k@@ us@@ him@@ a live still in emergency accommodations , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful in emergency . more than 75 percent of ev@@ acu@@ ated , which was built after the disaster in Beh@@ avi@@ es , were built in final houses . &quot;
&quot; for I@@ w@@ ate , the number is here at 34 percent . &quot;
the state of works and everyday life in the three affected Pre@@ fe@@ ct@@ ures
&quot; such as the K@@ ah@@ oku Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper , have been affected 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools that have been affected by the mis@@ fortune , their doors until December 2016 , which is almost 98 percent of the schools of the three Pre@@ fe@@ ct@@ ures . &quot;
&quot; six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three Pre@@ fe@@ ct@@ ures are far more difficult . &quot;
&quot; while nearly 100 percent of fisher@@ ies har@@ b@@ ors in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i have now been put into operation again , in Fu@@ k@@ us@@ him@@ a only 30 percent of fisher@@ ies have re@@ produce their operation . &quot;
&quot; the ts@@ un@@ ami and the atomic accident , have moved into the three Pre@@ fe@@ ct@@ ures of the agricultural land . &quot;
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could restore 93 percent of its rural areas with only 66 percent of the ar@@ able land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent of destru@@ ctive A@@ cker@@ land in Fu@@ k@@ us@@ him@@ a .
&quot; it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear un@@ inc@@ ident , because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed ar@@ able land of Fu@@ k@@ us@@ him@@ a , lie in the &quot; nu@@ k@@ lear@@ en pl@@ y@@ zone . &quot;
&quot; in two of the three Pre@@ fe@@ ct@@ ures , tourism has spread over again and here also Fu@@ k@@ us@@ him@@ a still ab@@ be@@ aten . &quot;
the tourist elections in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are back to 90 percent of the same as before the un@@ happiness . Fu@@ k@@ us@@ him@@ a however can only be 75 percent .
&quot; however , the K@@ ah@@ oku Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the disaster almost half of the coast inhabitants , it is more difficult to earn their lifest@@ y@@ les . &quot;
is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake ?
&quot; to determine a total picture , the newspaper introduced numerous survey@@ s under the native population and under the ev@@ acu@@ ated by . she asked them on the state of re@@ building and also how their feeling is changing opposite the ts@@ un@@ ami risk . &quot;
in her introduction of the article explains the K@@ ah@@ oku Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper :
the K@@ ah@@ oku Sh@@ imp@@ o led a survey by more about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness under the native population of experience .
&quot; the survey achieved that 8@@ 3.1 percent of the local residents , measures taken to be taken to the future earthquake and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is . &quot;
&quot; however , 55.@@ 9 percent of respond@@ ents have done still not enough in terms of disasters . &quot;
as it is for those who had to be ev@@ acu@@ ated from the Pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ k@@ us@@ him@@ a
&quot; in her issue to the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ oku Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper has also strengthened its attention to the location of ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ k@@ us@@ him@@ a . &quot;
&quot; Fu@@ k@@ us@@ him@@ a had to be experienced not only the huge earthquake and devast@@ ating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ k@@ us@@ him@@ a was also the witness of worst , astro@@ logy , atomic ignor@@ ant to experience the Japan per night . &quot;
&quot; from 160 000 ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ k@@ us@@ him@@ a have been moved to almost 63 000 people in areas outside the pre@@ fecture , pre@@ fecture . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2016 there were a little more than 23 000 people , back to Fu@@ k@@ us@@ him@@ a , in lasting spare parts . &quot;
after the stand of 2017 there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ k@@ us@@ him@@ a outside their home @-@ pre@@ fecture .
&quot; in the cat@@ astroph@@ ic areas most of the ev@@ acu@@ ated accommodations are more than 50 years old . they have to be returned to the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ k@@ us@@ him@@ a with massive construction projects . here it is building projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo . &quot;
the world is small : our Pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
&quot; if people have met people from other countries , who speak a different language , the differences seem to be larger than the simil@@ arities . &quot;
after a while it is often seen that one more connects than it appears at first glance .
&quot; these global connections are important , as they demand our pre@@ judi@@ ces , our prospects and remind us that the world is ultimately very small . &quot;
&quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we are looking forward to these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we treat issues which will often get less attention in the coverage than they deserve . &quot;
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected with someone over language and country borders .

a Bras@@ ilian student at the age of 33 years was delivered this week into the intensi@@ f@@ station : past Friday the police took be@@ aten in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with a stroke around the head . nation@@ wide took millions of prot@@ esters on a Protestant rise .

in the pictures the face of the police force is identified with a stroke . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ a@@ io .
after the pre @-@ fall the military police were known in the Brazilian federal state of Go@@ i@@ ás that S@@ amp@@ a@@ io has been susp@@ ended until the completion of the investigation into the active ministry .
the pictures show the police officer as he was in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his stroke on the face of the student Mat@@ e@@ us Fer@@ re@@ ira ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Luz ) .
&quot; would be a police force by a prot@@ esters and land on the intensi@@ f@@ station , his face would be six months long on television and the whole op@@ pression would be justified . &quot;

police re@@ efs
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil that occurred in the last Friday of the brutal police authorities against prot@@ esters .
&quot; polic@@ emen continued in protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro , where prot@@ esters were er@@ ected a stage for Red@@ ner , Gum@@ mig@@ esch@@ osse and Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as . &quot;
&quot; member of the member of Fl@@ avi@@ o Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Fried@@ en@@ Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police via loud@@ speakers on violence against prot@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; this is also a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the whole country . &quot;
&quot; once again the Brazilian media protests by putting the focus on another , unexpected prot@@ agon@@ ists : a window disc . &quot;
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported targeted about a cerem@@ onial glass window to make it possible with a photo to illustr@@ ative their title .
&quot; on the other hand , the O glob@@ o preferred a cover @-@ story with a brand of brand . &quot;
&quot; there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason , more about a broken wind@@ shield than the protests of thousands of people who serve the defense of a special thing . &quot;
&quot; this must also recognize , if one is strictly against any form of atomic facts . &quot;
&quot; also here the term &quot; Vand@@ alism &quot; is one of the di@@ spro@@ port@@ ionate significance , and the typical violence of the military police are determined by head@@ lines with the title &quot; demonstr@@ ators on confrontation with the police &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the For@@ gotten villages in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ var@@ o Re@@ yn@@ oso almost hundreds of sugar tubes throughout Cuba the doors ( photo : Jul@@ io Bat@@ ista )
&quot; Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich is located in the western Cu@@ ban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - regardless of the fact that there is no nutrit@@ ious sug@@ ars on site . &quot;
it is two years ago when the activities were placed in the sugar tubes .
&quot; after the appearance , the sug@@ ary industry stood still in the region , and the factory lost after and after its plants , until only the rum@@ ours of steel and concrete remained left . &quot;
about 272 workers had to be new .
some change rarely the work .
&quot; other res@@ ign@@ ed and pen@@ ing daily to the factories , which is still the elections . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an , who stands every day at 4 : 00 am in the morning , the crisis in the sug@@ ary industry does not smoke his sleep . &quot;
&quot; he heard that in the east of the region of sugar tubes , which are still in operation after a long in@@ active time because they were obtained . &quot;
that was something that he did not expect .
&quot; N@@ ene rem@@ inds itself exactly that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich would get the sug@@ ary factory , but the promise was not kept . &quot;
&quot; the sug@@ ars industry has already res@@ isted the pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , the low market money , the in@@ efficiency , the poor administration and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 the production of 1,6 million tons of sugar , less than the 1910 re@@ produced amount . &quot;
&quot; the news would have been a motif for a couple of decades ago for the land of turbul@@ ent for the country , but the bad y@@ ields have no re@@ visions . &quot;
why was the Cu@@ ban sugar pipes ?
the old railway st@@ iff of the church had already looked at better times .
( photo : Jul@@ io Bat@@ ista )
the reduction of the sug@@ ars industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sug@@ ars were technically obsolete , and hardly competitive for the country . &quot;
&quot; the initial idea was to focus the production on the most efficient factories , the annual product target was 4 million tonnes . &quot;
they only have the factories left to produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the mot@@ ives that resulted in such measures were the small productivity of the sug@@ ars plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
&quot; nevertheless , the sugar price rose again about a decade ago . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 to 2025 the price of un@@ refined sugar between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pounds , according to the 2016 published report &quot; &quot; agricultural &quot; &quot; of the OECD and FA@@ O , the agricultural and nutritional organisation of the United Nations . &quot;
&quot; if the current production level would reach the level of 2001 ( 3,@@ 6 million tonnes ) , the Roh@@ zu@@ cker exports would be about 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; today &apos;s day will enter into history with security in history , these were the first words of the Cu@@ ban president F@@ idel Castro in his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
from there began the process of restructuring in the sugar industry .
&quot; in the following years , the st@@ agn@@ ation of 98 sug@@ ars came up to more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further training . &quot;
the same happened in the sug@@ ary fabrik Greg@@ orio Arl@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez has been working in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; if n@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , the closing of the factory is the word that he is repeated most of the &quot; &quot; sc@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot;
almost all respond@@ ents are the same opinion : not one of them has been informed that the factory was shut down .
&quot; in order to get the place , they formed a full time - working group . &quot;
&quot; before the first closing year , the first letters began to come . &quot;
&quot; in order to be officially distributed documents that would be removed only concerning the parts that would be removed , the add@@ sat and the date . &quot;
&quot; all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could permit any withdrawal . &quot;
&quot; from there , the responsibility was over@@ coming and the letters came more and more common . &quot;
Juan Carlos River@@ o was in charge of two years for the breastfeeding factory and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the still in operation .
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waiting for the retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; he was against his will at the st@@ agn@@ ation of the factory , whose construction he helped . &quot;
&quot; with every part , which he removed , dism@@ ant@@ led one of his 31 working years . &quot;
the most developed industry of Cuba and the most important work@@ bench was er@@ ased .
&quot; in many cases , there were no alternatives for working and services that generate the facilities in the municipalities , in which they found themselves . &quot;
&quot; we will never know if during the mamm@@ oth talk of 21 October 2002 , the former president in the eyes of the present persons saw , when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer run in operation for five years . &quot;
the price of the population for closure of sugar tubes
since 2004 sugar is only extra@@ cted by grinding .

&quot; after two years the referendum of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich came to change many things , but not always for the better , when a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; as the sugar tu@@ ition closed , or better said when they began to for@@ er@@ ate them , they also listened to paved road , this dis@@ advant@@ aged also other farms . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy other factories were looking for . &quot;
they have been added to spare parts .
&quot; without warning , many young people settled the region . &quot;
in the area a food factory was created for its production not even for the supply of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new facility remains impressive .
&quot; at the end of 2016 N@@ ene came back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work . &quot;
Ne@@ un@@ und@@ forty flus@@ hes bring the old soldiers a r@@ ente of two thousand Pes@@ o per month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
&quot; Mr. N@@ ene , a man black skin color , small , with few teeth and cle@@ arer voice , is not a subsequent person , yet , he returns the lies , which one told him . &quot;
they have been doing it for ten years .
&quot; N@@ ene starts with 65 years in har@@ ente , not because it is missing him to power , but because he is bitter . &quot;

&quot; as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an @-@ Tour has been able to bring work@@ shop@@ pers mobile sound studios directly to schools and youth centers in order to bring young people &apos;s song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and li@@ ve@@ . &quot;
&quot; the original workshops were guided by the P@@ äd@@ ago@@ gues David Hod@@ ges , who lives in Montreal and in North @-@ Que@@ bec with ten Cre@@ e @-@ communities , and then with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop @-@ Gruppe The North@@ stars . &quot;
&quot; the workshop is the fact that the young participants in talks like &quot; cultural identity , language , examination , love , self @-@ accept@@ ing , or whatever them come into the sense . &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the youth are the main actors .
&quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team worked with other first Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organise similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the U.S. federal state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; this video of the school &apos;@@ Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ Y@@ oo in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First State in British Columbia , tells the story of the Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , at which almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or mur@@ dered . &quot;
the cases were largely un@@ resolved .
&quot; the next video of the Nem@@ aska Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video player , to convey how important to maintain traditional customs and customs , despite the influences of glob@@ alisation . &quot;
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages even though the young people of the First Nations is not always cour@@ ageous .
&quot; in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation , the refra@@ in is sung in Cre@@ e . &quot;
&quot; the young people involved in the young people received a little help from Gary Jol@@ ly from the North@@ stars Hip @-@ Hop group , which gives them a ro@@ ast in dialect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e . &quot;
&quot; on the fac@@ ebook page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an is at your disposal , as a translation into English , which is translated into German translation here : &quot;
sometimes I feel myself as would no ever be interested in me
yet I try to go on earth on earth
that is the day where you will take our scre@@ am
because we lost our way in life as youth
yet I believe that we will rise to one day
I do not want to see how they live a bad life
so they can grow and see also our youth in front of our youth .
&quot; so , they can do that , to which it has determined the Creator . &quot;
in the commentary on the reader the reader and supporters of the Cre@@ e @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also add a contribution and adds the poles in sil@@ ben@@ script ( which also published on his blog and published here with permission ) :
in Japan Plast@@ ic@@ ger@@ ichte are not only shown in the restaurant

in Japan one can see almost every restaurant plastic dishes .
&quot; to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu , are located close to the entrance of the entrance hall , near the entrance to the entrance of the courts &quot; ) of each food , which is served in this restaurant . &quot;
customers can see these sculptures and decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry which is dedicated to the manufacture of these sculptures .
in the Tok@@ i@@ oter district in Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi there is a variety of these small businesses that produce even those plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker Wim Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a was documented over 20 years ago .
&quot; for most of Japanese these sculptures are so usual , that they are not even more striking . a new trend turns it into a striking mobile phone accessories and other gad@@ gets . &quot;
at N@@ aver Mat@@ ome published the Blog@@ ger it@@ in@@ ii series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
&quot; now in special sales : new with plastic bags , as they are shown in K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ yu Kauf@@ haus . &quot;
&quot; many of these artificial foods have been turned to kit@@ sch@@ y collective objects , as in this case , refriger@@ ation magn@@ ets : &quot;
here are a few sho@@ al refriger@@ ation magn@@ ets for a new exhibition at the Tokyo station .
the new boom of the essay is becoming increasingly demanding .
in this case a ka@@ isen @-@ don has turned into a mobile support with seafood ) into a mobile stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a mobile use for a mobile use .
also this part we have produced for the exhibition at the station of Tokyo .
and here is an apple that contains your mobile phone :
&quot; designed to look like an apple , with a candle for mobile phone , this is already a great design . &quot;
and this is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the kom@@ ian .
&quot; some mobile support and mobile phone designers allow you to create your own artwork . in this case , ik@@ ura or salmon che@@ ated is used to be a popular Top@@ ping , which is served with white rice . &quot;
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
&quot; are there someone who would say : &quot; Wow , cool , now I can hide my mobile phone with salmon ? . &quot;
I think I will probably be the only one .
&quot; this interest in plastic bags can also assume a less appet@@ izing form to surprise for example , colleagues or family members . &quot;
our new mobile phone support has the shape of mel@@ ting the ice .
&quot; in addition , there are also travel and hand@@ balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , ear@@ rings and Hand@@ y@@ bands from dried salmon . &quot;
you can view on Twitter : it@@ in@@ ii &apos;s N@@ aver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow Twitter to the h@@ as@@ ht@@ ag # of the War@@ ri@@ ors &quot;
&quot; if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trends , then this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , which is dedicated to the delivery of the restaurant industry . as for example , with the sh@@ ore@@ line san@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
the following video shows how the Japanese Sculpt@@ ures are actually made .
a Mexican project tells the stories of the survi@@ v@@ ors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the struggle against drugs . &quot;

&quot; in reports in@@ - and foreign media about the inf@@ am@@ ous &quot; struggle against drugs &quot; in Mexico , the missing and transm@@ issions regularly show in statistics . however these are not reflected the extent of the human tragedy , that this struggle with themselves . &quot;
&quot; reporting on drug bos@@ ses like El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a @-@ Kart@@ ells , penet@@ rated the stories of the victims of the conflict entirely in the background . &quot;
&quot; on the day after a violent inc@@ ident , someone looks little on the grap@@ e or to the municipalities that have learned to live with pain . &quot;
&quot; behind every corp@@ se , behind every bone fund in the hundreds of secret tom@@ bs , the stories paying attention parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wo@@ unds might never heal . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the Mexican post @-@ portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ t@@ ico has called the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Viv@@ ir Con El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; with the drug trading live &quot; ) to give these victims a voice should give and stories of people who are in the struggle between the pro@@ secution and cart@@ els . &quot;
animal Pol@@ í@@ t@@ ico describes the project so :
organised crime cannot only be afraid to fear our lives .
the effects are much deeper .
&quot; for example , if shops close , because they are threatened by drug makers and all churches have to drive many kilometres to buy something like milk . &quot;
the pain of the victims
a video called &quot; vi@@ das que c@@ amb@@ ian p@@ or el m@@ ie@@ do &quot; ( German : &quot; as fear lives &quot; ) tells exactly these stories .
&quot; a main character is Gu@@ ad@@ alu@@ pe , a father that looks off every weekend tom@@ bs after his son . &quot;
&quot; or Emma Vel@@ eta Rodr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who lost in only one day of her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of their ne@@ phe@@ w . &quot;
&quot; priests : &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves back on the task we have asked ourselves to go , and to Grä@@ ff , according to the people we loved to seek . &quot;
Gu@@ ad@@ alu@@ pe Contr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Contr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
&quot; he was 28 , when he disappeared . &quot;
he has three children .
he worked in an electro@@ des in El N@@ aran@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
&quot; on 15 October he should be back again , but he never came back . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it is very difficult for me , because I am alone with three children who need a training . &quot;
there is also my mother that is here with me .
at the moment it has no income .
&quot; you stands for the insurance of my Father , but it does not get paid out , because it will require a mort@@ al assessment . &quot;
where should we get the ones ?
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vi@@ v@@ ir con el nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need not only show the faces of those who are afraid of fear . we need to show the international community the conflicts , the frag@@ ility and citiz@@ enship . &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports from journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
&quot; KY@@ HB , a reader of Animal Pol@@ í@@ t@@ ico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in Central mex@@ ico . &quot;
&quot; your contribution rem@@ inds us that you should never consider violence as normal , regardless of what forms it occurs : &quot;
disease and Sens@@ ation journ@@ alism I have now known for a few years now .
I come by date and see the title pages with pictures that can actually only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ation or from acts of specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
&quot; sometimes I feel the feeling as if I am the only one , which is un@@ broken or sad . it works like a lack of respect towards the person who once was one of this body . &quot;
I cannot be in@@ different at this or as normal .
she writes on :
&quot; no , it is not normal , that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old cous@@ in thinks that he is great . and it is also not normal that people listen to songs about the &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; &quot; of offen@@ ders when they go through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me this is , when they would have lost those who have lost someone and those who have fear that they are so something happening . &quot;
I see our weakness when stories to blo@@ oming figures in a stat@@ istic .
&quot; the de@@ pl@@ essness of the people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the dis@@ appearance of 43 students are justified in a neighboring town , that they were &quot; ce@@ ased . &quot;
I think they try to speak out that they are spar@@ ed by such tr@@ age@@ dies when they are not stir@@ ring and silent .
&quot; Mar@@ ibel L. from Mexico City , wrote the contribution &quot; four months Er@@ pressing &quot; in the Haupt@@ stad@@ t@@ dist@@ ri@@ kt : like a family associated with threats until they end up not only the store but also their family apart . &quot;
you think of everything you have lost and remember how many people can change your whole life in just a few days .
&quot; the pain of it never passes , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes back high when you are alone . &quot;
habits have changed , phone numbers too . &quot;
we just contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the further we are removed from each other , the better . &quot;
it included their report with the words :
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , because one does not know when they will guide you or kill you . &quot;
&quot; I asked myself in these terrible days , whether crying my deepest feelings would dis@@ solve , but the answers is no , because I have forgotten how to wee@@ p . I must learn to live with pain . &quot;
the journalist Mario Gut@@ i@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the contribution &quot; The Lost Children of Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a new generation of violence .
in the introduction he raises questions on how : who takes care of the child of a missing woman and a man who was mur@@ dered by organised crime ?
how is it in a settlement on the edge of the endanger@@ ing city of Mex@@ ik@@ os ?
&quot; he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents can take care of them . &quot;
&quot; br@@ yan is a f@@ ather@@ less , and he told that he had to be@@ acon , potatoes , tort@@ illas , tort@@ illas , tort@@ illas , tort@@ illas warm and &quot; Ch@@ ichi &quot; for the babies are who live with him . this is his name for preparing the fl@@ ashes with water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he tells of nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every one year .
but they are un@@ important compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for the whole life of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
&quot; when he was five years old , he said to him that his mother disappeared . &quot;
&quot; but this was not the day , at which his childhood ended . &quot;
&quot; his childhood has been past two years ago , when he saw only some blocks from his home , the blo@@ ody corp@@ se of his father saw , which was shot by armed men from a preventive car . &quot;
as Br@@ yan was born the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez was born :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 as force by organised crime and struggle against the existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
&quot; 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mor@@ ality according to the number of unity for public safety and government of the Government of the United States . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 , the pro@@ secut@@ or Bar 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to the cut 8,5 Mor@@ den per day . &quot;
these are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leaves organised crime in Mexico and penet@@ rate into the soul of the country .
only a few stories live in the face of always new head@@ lines . this project rem@@ inds us of those who we cannot forget .
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Viv@@ ir Con El Nar@@ co &quot; has launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , its aim in the complex information behind the drug trading in the past four decades has tor@@ tured in intellig@@ ible manner . &quot;
if a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Flick@@ r @-@ User Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ ström ( CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ NI@@ NG : this post and the pages , to which he linked images , on which violence is represented . &quot;
&quot; fact , the fact check is important in a moment in which it comes to lift a rum@@ or a fake . &quot;
&quot; but how is the years after the first time he emerged ? content in social media , no matter whether true or un@@ true , t@@ ends to exist . &quot;
let &apos;s take this photo of a terrible Un@@ if seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
&quot; since its first release it became mis@@ leading , tr@@ age@@ dies that have taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
this false coupling of image and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; fal@@ seh@@ ein &quot; in the termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - den@@ ies not the fact that there are abundant reporting on events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
it also raises questions about our desire for pictures to messages .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
&quot; in 2010 , a pet@@ rol station the place San@@ ge in the east of the DR Congo , k@@ ipp@@ te um and explo@@ ded . the 230 people came to live . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war in Africa the second largest country had been negle@@ cted , and thereby devast@@ ated . the streets in the region were turned into dangerous paths that were difficult to drive . &quot;
&quot; trag@@ ically , fell to the victim of the pet@@ rol station to the victim . &quot;
&quot; officials described a fire@@ ball , the d@@ utz@@ ing houses , including a cinema near , which was full of people who was full of the football world championship . &quot;
houses disp@@ ens@@ ed and short@@ ened corp@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to the ignor@@ ance .
&quot; a picture with the title &quot; &quot; This is Nigeria &quot; . &quot; from the Im@@ g@@ ur @-@ User Myst@@ ical Monkey , 12 January 2015 multi @-@ day photos of the inc@@ ident form the gray scenes of this day . &quot;
above is an example of this .
it shows bat@@ ter &apos;s body that are up on the ground while they have a look at them .
but here the story does not find their end .
&quot; over the years the same photo has been appro@@ ached several times on social media , blogs and other platforms , but not in connection with the related tr@@ age@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what was not happening in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 fighters of the B@@ oko Har@@ am die @-@ le@@ ver@@ ian villages B@@ aga and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
eye @-@ witnesses reported dra@@ st@@ ically of atro@@ cities before they had to fle@@ e .
houses and shops were burned down and corp@@ se items in streets and prayer .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people mass@@ ac@@ ered . &quot;
&quot; however , the numbers could not be confirmed yet . &quot; no one remained back to count corp@@ ses , &quot; &quot; said a citizen of Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; many have been crus@@ hed , shot or burnt . &quot;
only on the basis of satellite bil@@ it@@ ters could be depic@@ ted on the following .
&quot; the reason for the attack was also un@@ solved , but the armies in B@@ aga was a permanent conflict between the Military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt at the B@@ oko Har@@ am , country to gain ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot;
and here the picture from the DR Congo again came up when it was dist@@ ib@@ ly understood as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack :
this is Nigeria .
a mass@@ ac@@ re at 2.000 people took place two days to Paris .
you are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; in fact , this ab@@ rupt@@ ly use of the image from the DR Congo only has been documented in a series of mal@@ ign@@ ition ; Africa Check has documented refuge to Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
in all these cases the image was presented as a cover for mass@@ ages .
&quot; another step further bring personal comments like this example , the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to deliver arguments . &quot;
the picture from San@@ ge joined the deadly persecution of Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a light@@ ning message , published by the United Nations , those who could fle@@ e the bl@@ ows , r@@ ape and several t@@ ote , some through burning . &quot;
&quot; while others reported by the violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Post@@ s like the following that these descriptions are brought together with photos from the Democratic Republic of the Congo : &quot;
&quot; this picture comes from an ac@@ di @-@ Arab desc@@ ending page , which in 2012 was dist@@ orted , the President My@@ an@@ m@@ ars The@@ in being said , mon@@ ks and politicians would have been involved in the murder of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the picture from the Democratic Republic of Congo to take this information . &quot;
&quot; the original will be accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed at this time . &quot;
&quot; other post @-@ governmental organisations , the AF@@ P , as their source t@@ ense , also did not dist@@ orted theoret@@ ically being this statement , but did not have the image from the DR Congo in connection . &quot;
the global reach fal@@ ter information
traces of this false cone date back to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; by means of a &quot; &quot; revers@@ ed image &quot; &quot; you can see how far more borders can exceed . &quot;
a revers@@ ed picture search with the search@@ engine Tin@@ Eye has found under 18.0 billion pictures ( booth of 3 May 2017 ) 344 pictures found the discussed picture from the DR Congo very similar .
&quot; they come from a mi@@ xer of private pages , platforms , social media and community and national publications and are in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot;
&quot; some have passed false reports , others have tried to escape the for@@ ger@@ ies . &quot;
&quot; we have entered examples of the com@@ promising use and brought them into connection with the respective countries based on which side they have been published . thus , we want to display the reach more clearly than by the language alone . &quot;
from the listed below ( which were also associated with each other ) several examples can be used for mis@@ erable use .
here some cases which can now be completely un@@ divided ( on the map in orange ) :
map : News Fr@@ ames .
examples of false coupl@@ ings of the image from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the or@@ ative countries point out pages or servers across the examples of for@@ ger@@ ies or fal@@ cons are still available .
&quot; the countries in grey are examples , which are available according to the met@@ ad@@ ata and information that are available through Tin@@ Eye , probably also fr@@ aud examples . &quot;
&quot; as a memory , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( in blue ) . &quot;
&quot; Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the picture from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( set up in Alger@@ ian and interested Arabs ) as part of a Threads to the &quot; War of Budd@@ hist@@ s against Muslims . &quot;

&quot; one side , the rum@@ ors can be shaped , ordered in question that the animated photo Christians shows that were killed by Muslims . &quot;
&quot; Canada , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in this post a blo@@ gg@@ ers from Que@@ bec City is not only the fal@@ seh@@ ood , but also the abuse of the image from the DR Congo in connection with Nigeria as well as further questions after the in@@ versions of people and the intr@@ icate tr@@ age@@ dies ( in the DR Congo and beyond ) . &quot;
&quot; Ecuador , 2013 . &quot; en Nigeria est@@ án qu@@ em@@ ando a los Crist@@ ian@@ os &quot; ( In Nigeria they burn the Christians ) . &quot;
&quot; in this article on explos@@ ions in North @-@ Kan@@ i in Nigeria , published in the newspaper La Rep@@ ú@@ bl@@ ica , the district is identified as the Christian part of the place . &quot;
La Rep@@ ú@@ bl@@ ica quoted as his source the Spanish surname agency EF@@ E ( being not known whether the original report has the image included ) .
&quot; France , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; according to the mass@@ ac@@ re of the B@@ oko Har@@ am , as this here , who used the image from the DR Congo used to illustr@@ ate the &quot; &quot; atro@@ cities of Islam &quot; , &quot; clearly do not have any pages such as Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster that res@@ ist this . &quot;
Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster named the faul@@ ty usage of the image since 2011 in conjunction with Nigeria , then promoted by a post of US American , anti @-@ Islamic comment@@ ators Pam@@ ela G@@ eller . &quot;

&quot; even within Nigeria , the photo was shared from the DR Congo as evidence of bom@@ bers of the B@@ oko Har@@ am in K@@ ano in public discussion . &quot;
Malaysia to 2015 .
&quot; Malaysia provides two extreme example of an ab@@ rupt@@ ly use of the image from the DR Congo , with the one twe@@ et , the sympathy opposite the n@@ ig@@ ian mass@@ ac@@ re , and on the other hand the attempt to a blo@@ b , the asser@@ tions , the Roh@@ ing@@ ya is followed by del@@ ig@@ itim@@ ate , as the photos of this ab@@ normal@@ y were used . &quot;
&quot; Myanmar , 2017 . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the government of Myanmar released a guidel@@ ine to what they referred to as &quot; clearly f@@ ing@@ ed news and photos , international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings with regard to Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this guidel@@ ine that has been published exclusively in English , also includes references to counter@@ fe@@ it pictures of smells , who kill he@@ ate Spe@@ ech and distributed by extrem@@ ist groups ( which is often used by bur@@ ial nation@@ alists ) . &quot;

&quot; this post , who set itself to the members of the Russian @-@ orthodo@@ x community , represents clearly that the image of the DR Congo shows Muslims the Christians kill . &quot;
&quot; Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 &quot;
&quot; this post@@ al side claimed that the President of Myanmar The@@ in being said , that mon@@ ks and politicians have been involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story with the image of San@@ ge . &quot;
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the image is still included in it .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this article published by 2014 on students who have been introduced by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by now the cath@@ olic of An@@ á@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , expressly declar@@ es that the image is not written by the killing , but it claims that there is a &quot; similar d@@ schi@@ ha@@ dist@@ ic attack &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as the picture later in connection with the mass@@ ac@@ re of the B@@ oko Har@@ am , 2015 in re@@ sume , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there would be connections to Nigeria . &quot;

&quot; instead , the target was to focus attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of the media re@@ im@@ bur@@ s@@ ement in comparison of Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;

&quot; after a message that was sup@@ pos@@ edly written by a &quot; &quot; P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mart@@ os &quot; on the n@@ ig@@ ian mass@@ ac@@ re , in circulation , it continued discussions like this here on Vietnamese and explained it to the wrong message . &quot;
&quot; from the message , in which the image from the DR Congo was included , the organisation of Clar@@ et@@ ine mission@@ aries and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mart@@ os . &quot;
&quot; there are more confirmed examples of a faul@@ ty use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;

frames and images
there are two strong topics or frames ( inser@@ ts ) that can go through this post@@ al . the first frame is focused on religion .
the photo was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the murder of Christians through Muslims or - to defend Muslims - the ass@@ ass@@ ination of the Roh@@ ing@@ yas by Budd@@ hist@@ s .
a second fr@@ aming uses the image to discuss how a African life is evaluated compared to a European or French life .
religion to understand and the value of human life is both important . therefore it is worth to investigate how pictures in connection with these efforts are used .
&quot; however , a deep @-@ depth question is what happens when reading these images can no longer be able to give faith . &quot;
&quot; with social media there are tens of people who have un@@ intent@@ ional to share the water around a tragedy . &quot;
sug@@ ars this mood of mis@@ ery and fal@@ seh@@ ood that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and decor@@ ate it the actual Gre@@ ys of what actually happened in the DR Congo , in Nigeria and in Myanmar ? &quot;
the spread r@@ ape images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( here for example ) .
&quot; an argument is that the rejection of pictures of a past@@ ure is equivalent to recognize the tragedy , and sometimes these images are even required by the victims themselves . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the concern that violent images and vie@@ wers also consists of the ability to emp@@ athy emp@@ athy ( such as this study , the sub@@ sought to act like violent media on how to help others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there is a lot to talk about violent represent@@ ations in the news media , is fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news . &quot;
&quot; Techn@@ ologists experiment , because with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; . you will thoroughly have to think about situation in which a picture can be considered something but actually dis@@ solved by the context or completely ab@@ normal type can be used . &quot;
&quot; however , a every study false subsi@@ dies should also be taken into consideration how internationally they can be . &quot;

the &quot; Un@@ transl@@ atable &quot; Blog is un@@ ve@@ iled the uniqueness of smaller languages

a blog with the name Un@@ transl@@ ators ( f@@ t. un@@ pract@@ ic@@ able ) stri@@ ves to offer language enthusiastic a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to translate at all .
such words are in every language : they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific .
some of these un@@ transl@@ atable words are already well known ( like the famous Portuguese acid ) and others who are deeply ro@@ oted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish So@@ brake ) .
but all res@@ ists st@@ ub@@ born every attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; a word or expression is not sufficient , why a complete statement and sometimes some context is required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word . &quot;
these unique words were collected already for a full time in a online list .
&quot; most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; &quot; Un@@ transl@@ ators &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages . &quot;
&quot; in the blog , one can find for example words from the VAT of Vanuatu , such as : &quot;
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Bem@@ ush you for your parents in recognition of it , as has committed to you in your younger years . &quot;
&quot; words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language , which are spoken in parts of Brazil , as : &quot;
k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The convenience or la@@ z@@ iness that you feel after you have left in cold days in the sun .
in Birds &apos;s own words from his blog About :
they escap@@ ed other cultures , un@@ ve@@ il other thought @-@ places and wake up our curiosity . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you influence how we analyse the world around us and classif@@ y the lingu@@ ists on this site would like to publish more of this &quot; &quot; un@@ transl@@ atable &quot; words and show how different , valuable , and impressive these small languages are . &quot;
&quot; speakers of the &quot; Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages &quot; , &quot; which are highly appreciated by Un@@ transl@@ ators , are invited to have their favorite areas here . &quot;

how Sri Lanka enters the worst fl@@ ut@@ disaster of the decade
the State @-@ State of Sri Lanka sees itself as the worst high water @-@ water and v@@ ascular disaster in this decade .
&quot; trig@@ ger@@ ed by the Mon@@ sun , which usually ends at the end of May , are due to strong rain accidents , rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , N@@ il@@ wal@@ a and Att@@ an@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya in 15 districts in the south and west of the country . &quot;
after a position of the cat@@ astroph@@ ic city of Sri Lanka from 28 May 2017 126 people were killed and barely hundreds of people are missing because of the flo@@ ods and mud .
over 400 000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and approximately 100 000 people were brought to 304 safe stays .
&quot; the rainy falls on Saturday ( 27 May ) , and the waterfalls in some areas went slowly back . &quot;
health and hygienic di@@ spro@@ port@@ ations of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected area and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following images and videos give an impression of the extent of the fl@@ ut@@ disaster .
high water in Ta@@ wal@@ ama town with water stands from up to 7,5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am Ame@@ en and Sri Lanka twe@@ et provide regular updates to the high @-@ water situation .
many use the h@@ as@@ ht@@ ag # Flo@@ od@@ SL to monitor the extent of disaster .
&quot; Sri Lan@@ kas deadly Fl@@ utes tagged the Den@@ gu@@ ef@@ ie@@ ber@@ crisis , the Save the Children , after more rain are already on the way . &quot;
&quot; today , the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus stood in the high water , water level up to 6 meters . village of Mor@@ ago@@ da at G@@ alle also flo@@ od@@ ed due to the yesterday over@@ coming water@@ peg@@ els of Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a . &quot;
the air @-@ weapon has provided five planes for b@@ ail@@ ers and another five are made available for the transport of emergen@@ cies for those in their over@@ flowing villages .
also various organizations and start@@ ups have chosen to help .
Facebook @-@ pages such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Rel@@ ief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on water situation and humanitarian aid .
&quot; if any search and life@@ jacket for their operations need , please call the number 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 . &quot;
&quot; for all , dry food and life @-@ necessary goods for high @-@ water offering - &quot;
today we are in the area around Kel@@ en@@ iya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call the number 07@@ 77@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 07@@ 7@@ 78@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if animals need in this field help .
&quot; the Tax@@ ir@@ uf @-@ App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app , so that the cat@@ ast@@ eries centre will be informed . &quot;
&quot; last year after the cat@@ astrophe of the Tro@@ pen@@ di@@ ms Ro@@ anu , Pick@@ Me led a &quot; &quot; high @-@ water service &quot; &quot; key which allows users allowed to call a vehicle for pick@@ up of assistance and donations . these were then sent free to the sr@@ il@@ an@@ gu@@ ish cross . &quot;
&quot; likewise , they introduced a &quot; SO@@ S &quot; key , which had more than thousands of requests and 150 successful bo@@ re@@ board interactions . &quot;
&quot; the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lan@@ kas , where several social media platforms will be fully exploited , bringing residents in need in need of security and to help the Help . &quot;
&quot; this has prevented the loss of further human life , whereby the population of Sri Lan@@ kas is now the long way to restore norm@@ ality . &quot;

the Women &apos;s March on 21 January 2017 in San Francisco .
photo of Sah@@ ar Hab@@ ib G@@ ha@@ zi .
&quot; in January , I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neigh@@ bor and love girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; I trust her my four year old daughter , they familiar with me their children ; she is my rock in the industry . &quot;
in one minute we call still s@@ lo@@ gans for the rights of women .
in the next sk@@ immer we are rights for transition .
&quot; we are in a sea of rain @-@ umbre@@ llas and people , some keep the ic@@ onic image of a woman with head@@ rest high , bound from a American flag , others sk@@ ating par@@ ols against Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; my girlfriend look at me and says : &quot; &quot; these things do not affect you , or ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslim ? &quot; , &quot; I ask . &quot;
I have already led this conversation .
&quot; people with whom I work or people who have known me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar which they know - from the wid@@ ened concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built themselves in their vision . &quot;
they ent@@ mus@@ cular me .
there are around 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all the same .
we practice our religion different .
we identify to be Muslim to be Muslim to different kind of art . but somehow we will put all in the same Muslim drawer .
&quot; this drawer is well designed in our collective idea such as Muslims , which as I do not fit there , re@@ cl@@ as@@ ized . &quot;
will be re@@ mi@@ red
I do not stand alone .
&quot; this is even the poet , whose poetry in America is best selling in America : Rum@@ i . &quot;
which pictures are coming in the sense when you think of it ?
love ?
peace ?
&quot; as Bl@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an orthodo@@ xer Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; Islam , the Koran and the Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the center of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; but in the western conception , religion was deleted from Rum@@ is , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry . &quot;
this delet@@ ion makes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
&quot; another consists in the reduction of the reduction images of Muslim , the western books have been colon@@ ized for centuries . &quot;
&quot; this tempt@@ ing language is determined by the dark man that one should fear and the exotic woman , which one should save . &quot;
the pione@@ ering Palestinian @-@ American scientists Edward Sa@@ id crus@@ hed in the 19@@ 70s the story behind these pictures .
but these images continue to grow today .
&quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to hide . &quot;
I have worked thir@@ teen years in the news industry and I have seen how this powerful , faul@@ ty Nar@@ rative our News@@ fe@@ eds . &quot;
&quot; this nar@@ rat@@ ively over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed the reality that have led nine Muslim women in the past three decades , while the USA was not even able to choose their first female pres@@ idential election . &quot;
&quot; this nar@@ rat@@ ively affects that when French , Muslim women are temper@@ ed to wear their head tow@@ el in public buildings and acid @-@ Arab , Muslim women through their government to cover their entire body , which these are both sides of the same coin . &quot;
&quot; a powerful group pract@@ ised its &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; to the &quot; &quot; other &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this strong Nar@@ rat@@ ively weak@@ est Muslim women , the movements for change . &quot;
&quot; it is beyond that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American ground from Afri@@ kan@@ ers , which were brought to the slave . &quot;
it Del@@ etes the existence of Que@@ er @-@ Muslim .
this nar@@ rat@@ ively has occupied our collective imagination of the art deep and faul@@ ty that often S@@ ikh men and children will become an@@ tim@@ us@@ lim@@ ical attacks and weaknesses .
&quot; because of these stories we tell and due to the type , in which we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; another . &quot; &quot;
belong to the 1.7 billion
in the news industry we do more than just stories to tell the facts are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
&quot; we also create nar@@ rative , which help us to understand the world . &quot;
&quot; and my industry has failed to capture , the nar@@ rat@@ ively of the 1.7 billion . &quot;
&quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims do the highest degree of &quot; religious &quot; religious group in America . &quot;
more than one third of the whole Muslim population are African American people .
six of ten American Muslims are among the immig@@ rants of the first generation that come from 77 countries .

use approved .
four decades ago my parents came to live in New York to live their American dream .
&quot; my mother put her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scrap@@ ers of New York ; sky@@ scrap@@ ers were made possible by the Muslim , American stat@@ ics of Bangladesh with the name of the Faz@@ man Rah@@ man Khan . &quot;
&quot; back then , when Khan was new to the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were in@@ um@@ bled Muslims and Americans . &quot;
but now I am in@@ um@@ wo@@ unded Muslim a and American ?
&quot; sometimes people ask me why I am not a por@@ k food , I say - instead of my Muslim recipes , or my hand@@ ful flash@@ y , who carry out all Muslims in themselves - &quot; &quot; out of respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
I Scher@@ ze we do not carry all flash@@ cards with us .
&quot; we also need to be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; or to be almost always chosen for additional security levels at the airport . &quot;
&quot; there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim schol@@ ars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists , who ende@@ av@@ our to fight far spread lies about Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies are produced at the ongoing band from a well @-@ used Islam@@ opho@@ bia , thin @-@ tanks and experts for Fal@@ sch@@ information which is already faul@@ ty image of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and due to the type , in which we tell you there is Islam@@ opho@@ bia in more than just a stran@@ ger , who will ro@@ ast@@ ed the head of a woman . &quot;

I want to explain that .
&quot; I was born as Muslims , but a Muslim was born only when I was four years old , in a provis@@ ional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York . &quot;
&quot; if soci@@ ologist &apos;s religious life desc@@ rib@@ ing them to the following terms : faith , behavior and affili@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim belief and behavior are perhaps not always visible , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; maybe my girlfriend would see my neigh@@ bor , my rock in the industry that I am Muslim when they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air to separate our houses . &quot;
&quot; she would see the sole ritual with my daughter when I saw her in my arms , and ye die @-@ Arab verses to protect the Koran , and the Q@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
every of them I repeat three times .
&quot; I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim belief is possibly not always visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my sheep . &quot;

affili@@ ation is the image of my grandmother matern@@ al turn with their sisters ; as they won a competition of the art of fl@@ esh@@ ips in Kar@@ achi .
&quot; it is the picture of her that I close to this moment , when I close my eyes : Nano , surrounded by their full@@ filled and un@@ finished painting , a book with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and twenty @-@ four chapters , which can almost im@@ ag@@ ile . &quot;
&quot; Muslim means to be that prayers speak , which they said to me when I have a bad day . &quot;
&quot; Muslims is in it , how it taught me to relate to God : Allah M@@ ian , what God means , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a people that was founded over centuries - by a &quot; Empire &quot; col@@ oni@@ alized , which has founded a company with the name Honor@@ ary British East @-@ Kom@@ pan@@ ie , has a profound meaning to call , God , my only Lord . &quot;
the author in 1987 with her grandfather .
use approved .
&quot; affili@@ ation means to grow and hear that men do not cry , but at the same time you see that my acc@@ used grandfather wee@@ p . &quot;
&quot; mes@@ end@@ rin , while he writes books on modern Islam and about independence K@@ asch@@ mir@@ s , we@@ pt N@@ ana Ja@@ an in@@ um@@ wo@@ unds of his family in India ruled K@@ ash@@ mir , family that he could not close into his arms in a half century . &quot;
&quot; affili@@ ation is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians to deal with their families , as with my grandfather , of col@@ oni@@ alists , which have shared the Muslim world as the play risk . &quot;
&quot; Muslim means to be aware that in the last two centuries Europeans all have been col@@ oni@@ alized up to four Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means to know that the first plane bom@@ b was rejected in history before a century on a Muslim land .
&quot; it means to know that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an indi@@ sch , k@@ ash@@ ic sub@@ tan of the British empire , led by the newspapers of his time as &quot; dangerous , &quot; since he led the first mosque in England . &quot;
&quot; even before air@@ crafts , he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever was and pre@@ ached the radical word of love , peace and social justice . &quot;

to my Muslim tribe of the 1.7 billion are deeply moved into our unforgettable trunk @-@ trees ; our un@@ classified history .
&quot; it means to remember that four@@ teen years ago the mighty military in the world , with troops , which were distributed over every continent apart from the Antar@@ ctic , which were passed across Iraq to prevent mass destruction of weapons , which did not exist . &quot;
it means to know that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried among the ruins of the war .
an American Muslim to be meant to know that the su@@ icide rate has increased in veter@@ ans since 2001 to have increased more than 32 percent .
&quot; it means to know that when a tragedy is looking for the US and the suspe@@ cts one of the Muslim &apos;s name , the history of four times is reported more than a story with a white attack . &quot;
&quot; it means to know that four@@ teen years of the first prayer call , was called Az@@ aan , by a liber@@ ated black slaves with the name Bil@@ al . &quot;
it means to know that two hundred years ago a African Islam@@ ist named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was acc@@ used and brought into this country .
&quot; it means , Mal@@ col@@ m X will call an American hero . &quot;
it is the warmth that I split than people over the airports strug@@ gling to fight against the Muslim be@@ an .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand for our dreams and if we are saying black life .
&quot; a Americ@@ anism to be a p@@ ist , a p@@ ah@@ ari , a p@@ ah@@ ari , a p@@ ah@@ ari , a Muslim and a journalist which means in@@ har@@ dened inter@@ se@@ ctional ident@@ ities , but to fail to others . &quot;
&quot; the Nar@@ rat@@ ively of the 1.7 billion has more possibilities than a sp@@ ells , but is represented in the reduced cement &quot; we &quot; against it . &quot;
&quot; a mother to be his child , to worry about my child and all Muslim children , well @-@ knowing that powerful and privileged people on this tin , structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia consists of Muslim regist@@ r@@ arity with President Bush began and joined President Obama under President Obama .
it is in constant monitoring of mos@@ ques .
&quot; it is composed in the immig@@ rant , which takes five years old child in hand @-@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
&quot; it is in a country that sp@@ ends its borders towards people from just the countries , which b@@ ombar@@ ded it . &quot;
it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; no @-@ fly @-@ list &quot; which is largely Arab and Muslims into the vis@@ ier .
&quot; there are the wars that we lead and the bom@@ bs , which we cast on Muslim countries . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and due to those that we do not tell , we are now here . &quot;
&quot; in a study with the title Asc@@ ent of Man , scientists from North@@ western University participants showed a scient@@ if@@ ically clear picture and ask them to assess groups on a scale from 1 to 100 in terms of evolution . &quot;
Muslims got the lowest score .
the Con@@ vers@@ ations we have to lead
&quot; we are too deep dar@@ ing , Muslim or the &quot; &quot; other &quot; . &quot; &quot;
we have decades back to recognize the roots of our fears and the faul@@ ty and dangerous imaging , which we har@@ dened in our offspring . &quot;
&quot; at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry that tries to capture our multiple with bin@@ es ident@@ ities and forgotten history . &quot;
&quot; the Pod@@ cast Lake Some@@ thing , S@@ ay Some@@ thing from Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the vir@@ al Vide@@ os@@ erie Secret L@@ ives of Muslims ; Sap@@ elo Square about black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Sch@@ ust@@ ers Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative , multi @-@ Muslim authors , Muslim Super@@ hero@@ ine - all this makes me hope . &quot;

&quot; but I am concerned because of this difficult global time point , in which we are located . &quot;
and this moment has consequences that go beyond 1.7 billion .
&quot; there is one reason that conspiracy the@@ or@@ ist , which existed in the dark corners of the Internet , now the White House . &quot;
they are exp@@ on@@ entially since they have made Muslims at &quot; others . &quot;
&quot; there is another group that has grown exp@@ on@@ entially by making the &quot; &quot; other &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a few years ago , it had not been given them ; now they domin@@ ate great areas in Syria and Iraq . &quot;
&quot; I am concerned about the real@@ ities and the story , which I was not aware of what I was as old as it is now my daughter , but that is now my daughter to become an in@@ um@@ erable Muslim . &quot;
things I left here like a bread@@ cru@@ m@@ ur in my speech .
&quot; things which might aw@@ aken memories , because in all the inter@@ sections which our humanity may be au@@ sm@@ acht , may have a story l@@ ou@@ der , where someone is done to a &quot; &quot; other &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , you will find con@@ greg@@ ations in the framework of the 8th annual conference in Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; more than a hundred Academ@@ ics talk about our problems with the &quot; &quot; other &quot; , &quot; structural rac@@ ism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; but these are not terms , with which we usually throw in our schools around us or which we read in our newspapers . &quot;

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
&quot; why do I tell this here at this TE@@ D@@ x talk in Stan@@ ford , where Edward Sa@@ id , the man who has led us how wars are led and people affected by the creation of the &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; in the public presentation , four decades of scientist . &quot;
&quot; we have to ask ourselves un@@ comfortable questions after the role of that , consc@@ iously and un@@ aware the &quot; other &quot; to consolid@@ ate , in which we have no president who had no president who had already broken lands and &quot; to other gem@@ s &quot; people &quot; goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1,7 billion . &quot;
it begins here with all of us .
initiative for En@@ col@@ art aims to preserve the urban variety of diversity
&quot; history , by Flick@@ r @-@ User Daniele Rossi , using the license CC BY @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 . &quot;
can there be a possibility to enter here and now in spite of a language barrier with someone ?
&quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Initiative Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) is the count of stories in their original language a possible answer to that . &quot;
&quot; global Vo@@ ices reported briefly about another initiative of Steven Bird , the un@@ read@@ able blog . &quot;
&quot; however , the focus of T@@ LS is not written on the written word , but on the given word . it is an attempt to get the language variety of large cities and to assess . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has been carried out for 2015 events , the risk that small and not quite as small languages do not be passed to the firstborn children . &quot;
for the creators of the project :
&quot; the mass die of the languages of the world can be avoided , when we do cities create , diversity - secure spaces where residents are not forgotten who they are to be . &quot;
&quot; listen to this is often associated to understand &quot; conf@@ us@@ ive these events instead , &quot; &quot; the list@@ eners to appreciate to feel . &quot;
in this format you put its history first in their own language and translate or explain it to English .
&quot; even if the participants are not a professional stor@@ yt@@ eller , they perform their dev@@ otion and their representation that the list@@ eners can be achieved upon it . &quot;
they call lau@@ gh and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier .
&quot; the following video shows for example a traditional story of Burkina Faso , which is told in the language of D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller of R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou is also the opportunity to explain the opportunity for their country &apos;s typical customs . &quot;
in another event John Ny@@ amus@@ ara tells the F@@ abel from the Has@@ en and the P@@ avian in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
&quot; after having declared the meaning of his F@@ abel , John Ny@@ amus@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is it to a audience that your language does not understand ? &quot; with a wide gr@@ in@@ ety it shares his feeling of inclusion : &quot;
you have related !
they were attentive ...
you were all with me !
&quot; so far , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling have taken place in three cities , and the organizers hope to expand this . all those who are inspired by the project , can contact T@@ LS in order to organize their own events . &quot;

&quot; the Syrian @-@ Palestinian Web@@ developer Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bas@@ sel Saf@@ adi , is missing since more than one year . &quot;
but he is not forgotten .
&quot; more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives continued the campaign for his freedom and remember the contributions that he has made for an open net . &quot;
&quot; at this year &apos;s re : publ@@ ica , the annual conference on digital culture , which is oriented in Berlin , devoted to an event of the # Free@@ Bas@@ sel campaign . &quot;
&quot; Mé@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , Managing Director of Book Spr@@ ints , a publisher of the book Cost of Freedom : a Colle@@ ctive In@@ quiry ( The cost of freedom : a collective @-@ research ) . &quot;
&quot; the book which has been published last year and is licensed under licence , contains a number of papers that deal with the free culture in the face of the op@@ pression . &quot;
it is a hom@@ age to Bas@@ sel and his work .
in the introduction it is :
&quot; this book would like to learn how movements are built for free knowledge and what the real costs are , with which this is connected . &quot;
&quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who have participated in the movements for fre@@ ies knowledge , have side to side over the fo@@ g and to create some sense of our different experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to liber@@ ated bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet @-@ volunteers , who has been in@@ im@@ pris@@ oned in Syria since 15 March 2012 . &quot;
&quot; his name was painted out of the directory of the Ad@@ ra vessel , which he sat on 3 October 2015 . &quot;
since then we have no information about its current condition or where@@ ab@@ outs .
&quot; the introdu@@ ctory of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice which p@@ ushing for his release and want to know him back in his normal life and liberty . &quot;
&quot; to see how bas@@ sel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , has many of us begin to think about their own dest@@ iny , actions and decisions . &quot;
why are we today here ?
why did we decide ?
what have we abandoned in this process from time @-@ time extreme beliefs ?
the web@@ developer for Open Source and digital activ@@ ist has been launched in the cust@@ ody Syrian government authorities since March 2012 .
&quot; in October 2015 Bas@@ sel was transferred from the Ad@@ ra prison , a non @-@ military institution , to an unknown place . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer in N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi , told that the &quot; military police bases on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; of the armed command from his cell in Ad@@ ra . &quot;
G@@ ha@@ zi reported it was contacted by us on 12 November 2015 by people who set himself as in@@ sider of Assad &apos;s government and put them in knowledge of an in@@ con@@ scient@@ ious obje@@ ction against their husband .
its location and condition remain unknown .
&quot; a pioneer Creative Commons in Syria and actively participating in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bas@@ sel played a crucial role to expand access to the Internet and knowledge of the public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a Designer , technology and currently under clear the lad@@ der of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bas@@ sel , writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
perhaps none of the bases of cultural prot@@ otypes predi@@ cted as the work which he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Palm@@ yr@@ as .
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important arche@@ ological sites in the world , was the junction of numerous civil@@ izations and here are mel@@ ted Greek @-@ Roman architecture with local traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; at that time , he was not able to know that ten years after having started working with this work , the IS everything would put on it , this architecture that not only em@@ bodies the cultural heritage , but the world em@@ bodies . &quot;
&quot; this stri@@ ving to the digital archae@@ ology and the conservation has created a period of age , which will be in@@ valuable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future . &quot;
&quot; trag@@ ically , Bas@@ sel could not yet close this project until now . &quot;
&quot; N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband , his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison : &quot;
&quot; I have spent my overall life so spent , of freedom to dream and bas@@ sel taught me to embrace her . &quot;
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
&quot; Bas@@ sel brought me English , even when he was in cust@@ ody . &quot;
I learned to read English well and speak .
&quot; he always has his knowledge with each shared which has asked . he has taught other in@@ im@@ pris@@ oned , English to read and speak . &quot;
Bas@@ sel gave me the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet at .
&quot; he also contributed to other adher@@ ents as they use computers , at least theoret@@ ically , without being able to hold one in their hands . &quot;
G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( War@@ ning ) in the years 2012 until 2015 her husband wrote when he was in prison .
Bas@@ sel and N@@ oura have worked together a year on the book .
she tasted the lyrics to him when she visited him and he transferred them out of the Arabic to the English .

Bas@@ sels &apos;s story is not unique in Syria .
&quot; since the beginning of the protests 2011 against the regime Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad are gone according to the &quot; &quot; Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) , more than 6@@ 5,000 people . &quot;
those who were arrested or suffered under violence through the regime have been tor@@ tured or even executed .
until 2016 the international human rights organization Am@@ nest@@ y International at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Sy@@ rer has died in cust@@ ody since 2011 .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices @-@ Community has been calling for the release of Bas@@ sel since 2012 .
today we repeat our demand in hope that we have to do this for the last time .
Mozambique : due to corruption condemned Director after dis@@ appearance again on preced@@ ing item
&quot; Mozambique re@@ acted with wrath on a cor@@ rupt , in which a government member was returned to the workplace in the state apparatus , in which the corruption was committed . &quot;
&quot; Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , arrested and arrested in 2008 together with four other def@@ endants because of the amount of 54 million Met@@ ik@@ al ( around 800 000 Euro ) at 22 years im@@ prison@@ ment . &quot;
the money came from public funds from Mozambique and the Council of Cam@@ b@@ aza between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ b@@ aza has been released in 2016 because of good guidance and immediately called his re@@ integration into the company what happened on 19 April then .
&quot; in accordance with a statement of the Secretary @-@ General Assembly of the Republic , which would be the application , there would be no obstacles to refer to Cam@@ b@@ aza , as the company was not accomplished again after his cust@@ ody . &quot;
&quot; however , many inhabitants are not good . &quot;
&quot; the Centre for public integrity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ bl@@ ica , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution dedicated to public transparency , condemned into an interview with the Deutsche Welle the decision of the company , to set the director again : &quot;
&quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and clearly the absence of transparency and is even a retreat in terms of efforts of our legal system , so the C@@ IP . &quot;
what we have to take note is that the company would have to have a discipl@@ in@@ corporation against the def@@ ending tri@@ bute .
&quot; however , the company reveals apparently and illustr@@ ate no appropriate legal steps for the application of the respective functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Muslim social media , reject this behavior as well as in the case as a &quot; res@@ ist &quot; : &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ b@@ aza would be a competent type , it would be advis@@ er after he was sent@@ enced to one sentence . &quot;
&quot; he could keep lectures and motiv@@ ating spe@@ e@@ ches , he could be advised and to put his image . &quot;
&quot; but because he is in@@ competent , he has rolled to be re@@ integrated into the company that he helped damage . &quot;
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza is gladly paid for his silence .
contra@@ dict@@ ory !
&quot; bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mos@@ ambique and student of political science in Brazil says , the director had no mor@@ ality : &quot;
Cam@@ b@@ aza is re@@ warded by the state because he is not able to re@@ warded him that man re@@ warded someone in such way that the state has already been so massive .
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza is missing the mor@@ ality to return and serve to the state , * he had already served a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead it only served by the state . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza used the state , as a hand@@ ele of an in@@ exhaust@@ ible money source and the state itself is tired , the pre@@ loaded and finally condemned to a long prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; honest@@ ly , I do not know why this man was re@@ warded . &quot;
&quot; Fran@@ ce@@ y Ze@@ ú@@ te pre@@ fers to remind the prime minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el to remind you that a th@@ ief in prison belongs : &quot;
th@@ ie@@ ves belong to the prison Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el will not only be remembered as a first independent president in memory but also as a sharp , snow@@ y and - next to this - proph@@ et@@ ischer Red@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; one of his most famous oral represent@@ ations was to be energetic , that &quot; an ambitious person is capable of being able to sell the f@@ ather@@ land for his ambit@@ ions , its own individual interest , for sale . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ora said , &quot; I don &apos;t know whether a ambitious person changes , my experience indicates that this is not so . he changes the tactics but he does not change from his ambit@@ ions . &quot;
a ambitious man is at the same time criminal . &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also dist@@ ric :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was sent@@ enced to 22 years in prison he sat 10 years and came free .

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and z@@ ens@@ ored many users to in@@ justice
the Bur@@ m@@ ian word &quot; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &quot; means K@@ alis@@ erb@@ se or spher@@ ic .
&quot; photo by San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Wikipedia Commons , Creative Commons Attribution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ ported &quot;
&quot; according to the information of Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network of their post@@ al from the net , because they played the word &apos; kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; although over the origin of the word still will be discussed , it is normally used to refer to people ost@@ inde@@ scher origin , or generally used as an ad@@ je@@ ctive &quot; Indian &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Facebook z@@ ens@@ ored the word &quot; kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; Re@@ ar &quot; &quot; ( in bur@@ ial Script@@ ure ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate language in Burma into the social network . &quot;
in recent years the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given an extremely dism@@ iss@@ ant con@@ notation .
&quot; in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by Ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as a hate speech against Muslims , which represent a minority of population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in the effort , hate speech in Myanmar , the company has under@@ gone a lot of meaningful content on its platform . &quot;
&quot; Kal@@ ar &apos; may usually be associated with rac@@ ism , but the word itself is not automatically spoken . &quot;
&quot; the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that even Post@@ s , where they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts about the expression of his hand . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , there are several bur@@ ial words with fundamentally different mean@@ ings that have the same book@@ case as &quot; kal@@ ar &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for example , chair is written on Bur@@ mes@@ isch also &apos; kal@@ ar ht@@ a@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letter as well as other words like &apos; kal@@ ar PA@@ E &apos; ( spher@@ ical ) , &apos; kal@@ ar o@@ at &apos; ( ve@@ il ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ kn@@ utz@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ at declared the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; kal@@ ar &apos; so :
&quot; a post of one of my friends has been deleted today , because he included the word kal@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; however , he had asked his friends on the spiritual way , whether it might be used to relie@@ ve his back pain , when he made a voc@@ abulary . &quot;
&quot; the sentence ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the Fr@@ age@@ word ( la ) on Bur@@ mes@@ isch - resem@@ bles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were several reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
&quot; in Win , the opinion that it is to reduce the statement of radical nation@@ alists , but also emphas@@ ized that Facebook analytical measures , before it all post@@ ing to spread rac@@ ism in sus@@ pic@@ ion that rac@@ ism . &quot;
Facebook Del@@ etes the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it fil@@ tered the word automatically .
&quot; autom@@ ism will not understand what you write on Fac@@ be@@ ook . &quot;
&quot; what it should do instead , the post is carefully to analyse and control it by checking the following words . &quot;
for example &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &quot; ( cle@@ aring ) .
&quot; the good is that this dirty nation@@ alist , the hate language spread , a fairly good lesson . &quot;
&quot; now it is time to record their nation@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; while the action may send a strong signal to all , the hate language may spread , may not hold the efficiency of this strategy for a long time . &quot;
&quot; the experience of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Fem@@ o and We@@ Chat have proven that the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of keywords are often a cat and mouse game , whereby users are easy to use social networks , a new word or alternative sp@@ elling of the c@@ ens@@ ored word to express their views . &quot;
&quot; the author of Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to delete his post@@ al , when he only wanted to share his friends that the word &quot; kal@@ ar &quot; from the social network is : &quot;
&quot; when I was aware of this new directive on Facebook , I made a post to share my Facebook friends that the word is blocked . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically , my post office was removed from Facebook and I was prohibited that L@@ iken , post and parts of contents for 24 hours , because the post &quot; Facebook Community Standards are not cont@@ ended . &quot;
Facebook has a variety of post@@ al from people who have no negative intentions or simply try to show off their opinions against the hate talk radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed from which nothing has to do with hate language :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post the author divided its opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism are bad in the country .
Chan My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook in front of the initiative would have more to do more than the Bur@@ mes@@ an Internet community to ask advice :
&quot; Facebook might have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma through their platform , but it does not work . &quot;
such words to z@@ ens@@ ate will only bring more hate within the various communities .
&quot; in addition , it appears as if they started with no local context or technical support and have just b@@ anned as words as &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; Pe@@ sen@@ cur@@ ry &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even when they found out that they have made mistakes , they did not make them dist@@ ort@@ ing post@@ ing post@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; if they would only have something more respect for the 15 million benefits , which would like to give them a great turnover , it would be great . &quot;
fac@@ ebook automatic c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship has taken care of a lot of mo@@ ck@@ ery under the users .
&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users are now using Facebook funny and write the word &quot; kal@@ ar &quot; not in the context of Hass@@ on@@ eness , to see whether their post@@ s are taken from the grid . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook @-@ Post@@ s which have no mis@@ concept@@ ions , but still removed : &quot;

the Bur@@ m@@ ian text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair and see a pe@@ el cur@@ ry and look at an Indian film .
only to try whether Facebook contains the post office that contains the word kal@@ ar .

&quot; over the last five years , extreme nation@@ alistic ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have used social networks to expand their voices and their influence . &quot;
&quot; among other things , hate speech is to provide violence in the communities in Myanmar in addition , especially in the field of R@@ akh@@ ins , where conflicts between Muslims and Budd@@ hist@@ s were forced to escape . &quot;
&quot; Facebook was intended for his failure , who hate him to bring on his bur@@ ial sides under control . &quot;
&quot; but instead of simply use the word &quot; kal@@ ar &quot; , it would have better ongoing , more in context than on code focused initiatives and learned from them . &quot;
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tobago is the end with the children .
a wedding ring in the sand .

the children &apos;s before is in Trinidad and Tobago now illegal .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament of the country has agreed to be a law which should offer this practice , so that the married age now is at 18 . &quot;
&quot; before this change of spouse , some members of the du@@ istic and Muslim religious communities held in practice , and in May 2016 it came to a great public cry . then said brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mahar@@ aja , the leader of the various religious groups of the country gathered , that the state does not inter@@ ming@@ le as that , age does not determine the matur@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; this happened regardless of the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contractual partner of the UN @-@ Children &apos;s rights , the minority of age , and every man under 18 years . &quot;
&quot; statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of the children who were married to 15 in Trinidad and Tobago 2,@@ 8 percent , and with 18 there were 8,@@ 1 per cent . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the stat@@ istic Central Office of the country confirmed that from 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 . &quot;
&quot; online pet@@ itions and social media movements , which were not@@ ified , laws to nur@@ ser@@ ver@@ ed , followed by the fo@@ e and pleas@@ ing themselves big support . undoubtedly , they helped them to bring this result . &quot;
nevertheless not everything went smoothly .
&quot; a Hindu @-@ leader such as had no concerns , the critics of the children to say , they should take care of their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition caring for tensions in this actually un@@ complicated matter , and some point came in doubt whether the opposition would agree to the leg@@ islat@@ ure at all . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of 2017 the leg@@ islat@@ ure was decided against the children of 2017 - despite 4 Sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent who could have been discussed , so that he could make a simple majority for the law . &quot;
&quot; now , only the President of the country must agree with the law and to pro@@ claim the law . &quot;
&quot; one of the Sen@@ ators of the country gave on Facebook a Status Update , which is called Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ ag@@ ram again : &quot;
Mr. Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence R@@ amb@@ har@@ at : the bill of law against the nur@@ se was decided in the representation of the children with 35 voices and no one against it .
&quot; after having decided before in the Senate , the draft can now be applied to the law . &quot;
the majority of Social @-@ Media User was thrilled because the laws were finally changed to the children .
&quot; Facebook @-@ member Lov@@ ell Francis , which was d@@ ressed in the Ministry of Education Ministry , said : &quot;
&quot; it has too much time and un@@ necessary talk about the core of the thing , but do you know what ? the children &apos;s before is in Trinidad and Tobago now illegal , and this is almost any rate . &quot;
&quot; during Abel Jackson of opinion , it was definitely long enough to pick up the practice was Lara Qu@@ entr@@ al Thomas survived that the day was finally come : &quot;
&quot; public Status Update on Facebook by Lara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which said , &quot;
the sp@@ ouses has been decided .
&quot; minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , which belong@@ ed to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WIN@@ AD ) , a civil society that spoke quite openly about how important the adoption of the law is , noted : &quot;
the married age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of the freedom of religion in 18 years .
&quot; the draft to change the spouse was today , on 9 June 2017 , decided . &quot;
in the Represent@@ ative house there are 41 members and of them were present at the vote .
&quot; all members , who were against them have agreed to the law . &quot;
the nur@@ se is no longer allowed in Trinidad and Tobago .
it was a long battle ( ... ) # child@@ r@@ ri@@ age@@ isch@@ ild@@ a .
many thanks to all activists who have challeng@@ ed him .
congratulations .
a thanks to our MEPs .
&quot; however , a possible hook occurs in the form of Sat Mahar@@ aja , the Secretary General of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hindu @-@ organization of the country . &quot;
&quot; months ago Mahar@@ aja announced his intention to take a court steps , the law should be adopted , and he seems to have a promise to take his promises . &quot;
&quot; during the General @-@ General Paris Al ra@@ wi , a nar@@ rative of the law , said it is quite timely , if Mahar@@ aja would like to go against the law , most social @-@ media users , you would like to see the debate on the subject differently . &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ rell sle@@ w :
&quot; dear Sat , if we , instead of discuss@@ ing the discussion so general , in a way we would like to talk instead of the problem that they might be suffering from the problem that they may be of big , hard @-@ grown men that may be used in our bedroom , be mis@@ used , would you then be ready to continue the discussion ? &quot;
or do you believe that this is not a problem ?
&quot; but whether it comes to a judi@@ cial action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places on the world where the children can be legal or still the norm , although there is laws which they say . &quot;

&quot; due to the mir@@ rors of web pages , Turkish users can see again Wikipedia @-@ content . &quot;
&quot; the Wikipedia @-@ page was presented on 18 January 2012 , compared to the SO@@ PA ( stop Online Privacy Act ) and PI@@ PA copyright laws in the USA , internationally . &quot;

since more than one month Turkey the popular and on the crow@@ ds@@ ourcing principle based enc@@ ycl@@ op@@ edia Wikipedia .
day for day is more clearly how important the platform for users is to find helpful and reliable information .
both students and re@@ porters and fans of TV series def@@ enses against the block@@ ing .
&quot; although many techn@@ icians , internet users are used to use envelop@@ ing tools for block websites ( a current article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ val@@ ence of the world ) , most of the usual Wikipedia users do not fall into this category . &quot;
&quot; although Turkey has been taken from Wikipedia since 2008 , as recently published in a published report by Berk@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society on Harvard University , will find regular block@@ ages of the internet since 2007 , after the internet law has been adopted ( No. 56@@ 51 ) . &quot;
&quot; after China , Turkey is the two most famous country in the world , when it comes to the massive c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; while the platform remains locked , there are now several mir@@ ror@@ pages ( pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and often updated ) . &quot;
&quot; a solution was supported by IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , as the platform all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centralized Peer @-@ to @-@ Peer @-@ network ( i.e. machine @-@ computer connections ) , which is not difficult on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship . &quot;
the content is available despite law prohib@@ ition but retri@@ ev@@ able .
in a blog@@ post IP@@ FS about his efforts :
&quot; after we have heard the messages ( about the block from Wikipedia ) , we put everything that snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . so there is the possibility to read the contents of de@@ centralized and distributed fashion . &quot;
&quot; this can help the users to see at least all Wikipedia content , even if you cannot reach the website www.@@ na@@ ive itself . &quot;
&quot; IP@@ FS also gave it that this step has been carried out independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and is only about screen@@ shots and no li@@ ve@@ - or dynamic versions of the website . &quot;
&quot; however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to deal with sperm . &quot;
&quot; Crist@@ ian Con@@ son@@ ni from Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ k@@ ian@@ si@@ zz@@ edi@@ .org , a Mir@@ ror@@ page from Wikipedia , as well as Wik@@ i@@ Mir@@ ror , an open @-@ source project that everyone can use to host similar Mir@@ ror@@ pages , if in the respective country Wikipedia is blocked . &quot;
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices Member and staff at Mozilla in Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; Pod@@ cast :
&quot; there is no complete copy of a pro@@ xy address , an Mir@@ ror . &quot;
one compreh@@ ends to another URL which is not the original is . that what one sees then is from Wikipedia .
&quot; essentially , the server leads the request to the right Wikipedia page , so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself when these are locked in Turkey . &quot;
&quot; for this is executed by a server , which is not in Turkey . &quot;

&quot; Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos , which he looked around around , never satisfied . they were bl@@ ur@@ ry with poor@@ ly positioning mot@@ ifs and balanced colors . &quot;
this motiv@@ ates him to carry out a camera with himself and try to gr@@ asp the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
&quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar attempts to bring about the international stage . &quot;
&quot; his home place right next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos which direct attention to ne@@ p@@ as animal world . &quot;
he described on Facebook how it helps him this first class situation in his work :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world heritage . what could there be better for a passionate wildlife photography ! ! &quot;
I rested just at home when suddenly Navar@@ aj ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan Ga@@ ida Lodge ) called a call from my father that on the banks of the Rap@@ ti river a leop@@ ard would be .
the river dam@@ m is just a few minutes away from the town of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran@@ ked with my camera and was in a few minutes there .
&quot; my father had observed him , and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the leop@@ ard was and I immediately began to cr@@ ack images ! ! &quot;
&quot; Sag@@ ar aims to acquire a collaboration with the authorities to acquire global recognition for Ne@@ p@@ as Nature and would like to dee@@ pen the understanding of this , wild animals are not as fur@@ ious as they look . &quot;
and he should know it because he stood tig@@ ers already from face to face :
a tiger can not be trou@@ bled from the opinion of the sheep at bed@@ time ! !
late evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
&quot; I was also because of the darkness on the way home , when suddenly the king of the bush appeared . he immediately sit down , we look at and he star@@ ved me through the Sal trees ! ! &quot;
&quot; to promote the protection of wild animals , the logo placed the logo &quot; I click for &quot; &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos . &quot;
but his passion for the promotion of ne@@ p@@ als nature and wildlife is not always easy .
&quot; he wa@@ ited 22 days long , and lived in a tent in order to make up in the Bar@@ dia National Park recordings of Ot@@ tern . up to 12 days , it was able to photograph a tiger and live six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live close to the tourist places . &quot;
see below some of these photos .

this article was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on Video Volunte@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community organization from India . &quot;
a revised version was published here as part of a Content @-@ sharing Convention .
&quot; in many parts of India there are women with greatest care , the name of their hus@@ bands or even of older men in the family . &quot;
instead they use a pron@@ oun or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hatt@@ is@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ as@@ ht@@ ra and Ut@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h giving women to respect her because of the social pressure from the husband , as well as the fear of the consequences they should dis@@ regard this practice on life . &quot;
&quot; last year Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was converted from the Indian state O@@ dish@@ a by a sc@@ ind@@ ented , sent@@ enced by their family and the village of community , after they had raised an elev@@ ated relatives with names . &quot;
&quot; the tradition of their wives also did not mention the name , is also common among men . however , they have much less ass@@ ign@@ ments to fear , if at all , they should not come to this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in the Pun@@ e district , in Mahar@@ as@@ ht@@ ra , nine women , including health care as well as house@@ wives , a unique club with and became quick to the main theme of the city . &quot;
it is a place only for them to discuss and discuss the subt@@ let@@ ies of the patri@@ archy .
&quot; as one of 56 clubs who gives it in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the Community Video Volunte@@ ers and is committed to the reduction of the patri@@ archy . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was works for seven years with the help of their vide@@ oc@@ amera at the un@@ covering of practices , such as children &apos;s mar@@ riages up to the bond of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ Inf@@ ations , and guides this clubs . &quot;
they reported how this cler@@ ks have made a safe place for these women and at the same time they have made it at the same time to amb@@ assador of the wall .
&quot; the first video , the Roh@@ ini showed in her discussion round , acted by women who could not name their hus@@ bands . &quot;
&quot; she chose this issue because they wanted to open the conversation about the patri@@ archy , with which the women can easily identify . &quot;
&quot; the name of their hus@@ bands did not speak according to the name of their hus@@ bands , it is a Br@@ otherhood that they all have to maintain and have never placed in question . &quot;
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition is witness that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who do not hold this is seen as a woman without mor@@ ality .
the tradition is so deeply ro@@ oted that we have never made us the discussion with this discussion .
&quot; at the beginning wanted Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband previously on behalf , at home , as it runs . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband we@@ igh for a long time after the video was at the end .
&quot; Pra@@ k@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said , I should call him from now on his name . &quot;
with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage launched Roh@@ ini started their first discussion .
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; . &quot; some believed that there was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the lap , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in Ut@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h . &quot;
&quot; according to the video projection , the women , the discussion with a exercise in motion . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked any participant to say the name of her husband with different feeling - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on . &quot;
&quot; then they asked all , &quot; If we cannot say the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us how they do , meaning that they do not respect us ? &quot;
should it not be equal ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day , which they brought the name of their hus@@ bands from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ as@@ ht@@ ra over the Bre@@ chen of a centuries @-@ old tradition , in the married women could never speak the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot;
Roh@@ ini tells :
&quot; a woman was so shy , that in all the exercise , only before him went away , and another decided to let the whole an@@ er@@ ent fru@@ stration against him and his family by making it curs@@ ed . &quot;
the expression on her faces was ek@@ stat@@ ically .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; even in adren@@ aline in@@ tox@@ ication about it , with an ancest@@ ral Br@@ otherhood , the women decided that they would actually try home to name their hus@@ bands in the name . &quot;
and they stopped their word .
in the next few days Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports .
&quot; the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas put them in the head , his wife could not cease to say his name . &quot;
another thing was decided to do it at dinner in front of the whole family .
&quot; when her mother @-@ in @-@ law she died , she got fear and said that there was a mistake . &quot;
&quot; another woman said , &quot; Roh@@ ini said , I should do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant in was less understanding and the situation art@@ ed in violence .
&quot; reported as women tried to stop any other practices , such as wearing the zin@@ ced red pun@@ ish on the forehead , which shows the spouse status : &quot;
why do women only have to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband that I would bear the zin@@ ced red point if he also dece@@ iving it .
he only lau@@ g@@ hed and I heard that to wear it .
&quot; the other women have not been heard completely with it , but mine , they are now in a better position , even to choose him in some days . &quot;
for many women the discussion is a secure place where they can exchange their opinions and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip with every discussion . &quot;
&quot; normally we pack lunch and water , and go out to the field . &quot;
&quot; I do not want to worry about women who could hear what could hear , &quot; says it . &quot;
during the last months she celebrated her own birth@@ days with cakes ; they d@@ anced and san@@ gen and talked about things about which they had never made thoughts before .
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have spoken about some things , for example how our ident@@ ities are kn@@ otted to our hus@@ bands . &quot;
&quot; it feels great to say certain things loud , no matter how small they occur . &quot;
in a discussion round we are talking about the concept of honor and how it is connected to your clothing .
some women in the group have carried only Sar@@ is since their marriage .
&quot; for most is the okay , but some wanted a sal@@ ine cur@@ ta , a wide shirt about a p@@ ants , bear ; they have not dre@@ amed . &quot;
&quot; after much argument and discussion about the advantages of their own clos@@ ets , the mor@@ ality associated with the Sar@@ is and much more , tastes bot@@ ini her own couple Kur@@ t@@ as ( Ober@@ hem@@ ath ) into a discussion , so that women could wear them . &quot;
&quot; next you have decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is sure to make it possible . &quot;
&quot; regarding the question , whether in the five months of the first discussion has already changed something , confirmed Roh@@ ini that things are slowly come to roles : &quot;
we have only made small steps so far .
&quot; some women tried it a few times , but then listened to the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot;
&quot; some , including me , do it still , but only when they are alone and no other family members are at present . &quot;
only one or two will continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women are now carrying out at any time Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on her forehead .
the women in the discussion will know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the fa@@ i@@ ries to find more freedom of movement or your own clos@@ eness - at the end of a hard to navigate river .
&quot; by giving each other confidence , they will be aware that they sit in the same boat . &quot;
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a victim of the patri@@ archy .
I am also .
&quot; however , this club gives each of us the confidence that will change something . &quot;
&quot; and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction , when every woman goes home to the home and other people of it , what we talk and what we do . &quot;
we are all sitting in the same boat .

&quot; a new system of de@@ duction of gl@@ atz@@ k@@ öpf@@ er persons for organ@@ ists , probably for super@@ stit@@ ious purposes , the police of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called a series of operations to stop the splend@@ or . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ estone , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi . &quot;
one of the victims has been rebuilt and a part of the organs have been taken .
&quot; two men have been arrested , and turned them to be used to use the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi . &quot;
&quot; it may give the local super@@ st@@ ition , that the head of a gl@@ posit@@ ional man &apos;s sake could bring gold as old or rich@@ es , the police of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia the BBC . &quot;
it is the first time that consecutive attacks on gl@@ atz@@ k@@ öpf@@ er men have been registered in Mozambique .
&quot; another group , the aim of ass@@ ass@@ ass@@ ination is for ob@@ sc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism . &quot;
this led to the UN 2016 in the South African country an mission led to investigate this Pra@@ ktik .
&quot; the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of Southern Africa , especially in the neighboring countries of Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to fight these st@@ ition and pre@@ judi@@ ces . &quot;
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the town of Map@@ uto .
he war@@ ned those who have pre @-@ travel to the country :
attention to k@@ ah@@ le men who travel to Mozambique are the aim of rit@@ u@@ eller attacks after the latest ass@@ ass@@ ination of three believing men based on their body parts .
&quot; two suspe@@ cts were arrested in the district of Mil@@ estone , where the ass@@ ass@@ ination were held . &quot;
&quot; H@@ uss@@ ene Al@@ gy Ad@@ amo , student and residents of the city In@@ h@@ amb@@ ane in the south of Mozambique , said that the local police are already in the case : &quot;
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the believing men .
&quot; persecution and ass@@ ass@@ ination of glaz@@ ed individuals for the extra@@ ction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ ru@@ mb@@ ala , for probably super@@ stit@@ ious rit@@ uals , has been taking into consideration the police of the Republic of Mozambique ( PR@@ M ) , which also calls that a faith , according to which the victims were in the head of power , the rich@@ es gener@@ als . &quot;
in the last few days three men were mur@@ dered with hair loss problems in this part of the country .
&quot; Angela Fer@@ re@@ ira Sam@@ an@@ tha divided on Facebook the chron@@ icle of the blog@@ gers arms Sn@@ a@@ ipp@@ a , which is evident that the problem is part of the larger social difficulty that Mozambique is facing : &quot;
&quot; I would like to call E@@ IN Mozambique , DA@@ S SI@@ CH , in which the people would have cried to make sex against good notes , work and other services , a nation in which the people would like to make their bread a nation in which neither the al@@ bin@@ os or gl@@ atz@@ k@@ öpf@@ chens are going to make their bread a nation in which neither the al@@ bin@@ os or gl@@ atz@@ k@@ öpf@@ chens are going to escape a country in which neither the Al@@ bin@@ os or gl@@ atz@@ k@@ öpf@@ er for super@@ stit@@ ious purposes or &quot; black magic . &quot; &quot;
&quot; despite the ser@@ iousness of the phenomenon , some of the opportunity for mac@@ ab@@ ren hum@@ our cannot be ent@@ rust@@ ed . &quot;

a photo by Li@@ u X@@ ia@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia that was probably only recently made .
this story was originally published on 8 July 2017 in Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partner agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
&quot; the case of the constit@@ uted Chinese dis@@ sident Li@@ u X@@ ia@@ ob@@ o has drawn attention in the international community after its lawyer at the end of June , that he has been delivered to hospital for liver cancer in the end of June . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 Li@@ u was sent@@ enced to eleven years in prison for &quot; &quot; Subversion &quot; &quot; ( state endanger@@ ing ) , after having been involved in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o that had promoted the democratic reforms in China . &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Prize for his work in 2010 with the Nobel Peace Prize .
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China has referred to as &quot; an internal matter &quot; and a speaker , he said it as &quot; not required to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot;
&quot; however , China continues to receive calls from the international community , the Nobel Prize and his wife , D@@ id in Li@@ u X@@ ia , fre@@ iz@@ ul@@ ators or give him a treatment abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of the pa@@ ares in Beijing , others are fully balanced . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ised a few reactions from abroad .
United Nations
&quot; Ze@@ id R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the High @-@ Com@@ miss@@ ar of the United Nations for Human Rights , met at the end of June Chinese officials to discuss the case of Li@@ u . &quot;
&quot; however , an speaker decl@@ ined to comment whether the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure in order to enable Li@@ u abroad . &quot;
Norway
Nor@@ we@@ gen &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende have ref@@ used to answer questions about L@@ ius &apos;s release .
&quot; the relationship between China and Norway ger@@ iet was awarded to Li@@ u , after the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 by Li@@ u , although the Norwegian government was told that this ultimately has nothing to do with the decision . &quot;
diplomatic relations were only continued in December last year . only in June signed an agreement to absor@@ b the salmon @-@ went to China as the ex@@ porters were largely blocked since 2010 .
&quot; after the message had spread that Li@@ u was seriously considered , the Nobel Committee brought his hope for unconditional release to an unconditional release of the expression and lu@@ d Li@@ u , to pick up his prize in Oslo . &quot;
&quot; due to its adher@@ ing , he was not able to receive its price . &quot;
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
&quot; on 6 July the European Parliament adopted a decision in which China was prompt@@ ed to free Li@@ u and his wife immediately to rid of the house of the house , and allow him to seek medical support where he wants . &quot;
&quot; the peak diplomatic in the EU , Federica Mog@@ her@@ ini , called China also for the release of L@@ ius as shown in an explanation on 30 June . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we expect all restrictions on the limitations of Mr. L@@ ius wife and family . &quot;
&quot; they shall meet all visits and welcome you to communicate , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world . &quot;
USA
us @-@ Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad shared that the Americans wish to give him that he has the opportunity to treat abroad so far as it would help him with his satisfaction .
&quot; a spokes@@ person of the U.S. Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , gave the message agency AF@@ P on 27 June , that the message has called Chinese authorities not only Li@@ u fre@@ iz@@ ul@@ assen , but also his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from her house rest . &quot;
&quot; the call of the U.S. Embassy went to an angry response from China to themselves , with the utter@@ ance of the Ministry of Finance , that &quot; no country have the right to ex@@ changing and un@@ answer@@ able remarks about Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley shared that China should offer the spouse couple :
&quot; protection and freedom such as travel and access to medical care of its choice , which they are entitled to the Chinese constitution and legal system , as well as international commitments . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz have also introduced a decision in Congress in order to push the Chinese government to p@@ ushing Li@@ u and his wife unconditional release . &quot;

Singapore : city or country ?

is Singapore a city or country ?
&quot; the question likes du@@ mm appear , as Singapore is recognized at an independent state as independent state . &quot;
but according to the Just@@ ic@@ minister K. Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am should be regarded as a city as a city .
this re@@ mark has trig@@ ger@@ ed a debate in the blog@@ osph@@ ere .
&quot; during the meeting at the meeting of a meeting of the international branch of the National Assembly of the State of New York , the Minister that many people saw the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore since it is compared with other countries . &quot;
he sup@@ por@@ tive that Singapore should be considered a city .
nobody has question@@ ed whether new York is a democracy ...
&quot; this is , where most people have a mistake . &quot;
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; the blog Caval@@ ier@@ io acc@@ used the Just@@ in minister , &quot; logic to rot@@ ate &quot; to defend the existing author@@ it@@ arian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot;
&quot; and then , according to all our efforts and sacrif@@ ices , this valuable land is to create , you can say that we will ultimately be no country . &quot;
&quot; it was so vul@@ gar , it had the sight of an escape from the responsibility of the responsibility . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , eat country it is then ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons led by Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am were not very no@@ bel , according to which one should measure the political system of Singapore not with other &quot; normal countries &quot; in the face of which he appeared un@@ obje@@ ction@@ able un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; however , he has def@@ ended the idea that Singapore had to be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities , which are permanently managed by a party . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; once one reaches the core point of the subject , the good old ly@@ re from the autor@@ it@@ arian Mach@@ th@@ ab@@ ern appears to be a democrat@@ s , leaving the def@@ ending logic since it fits better to their power . &quot;
&quot; in the final effect , the answers given in the last week of Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am gave answers to his American guests regarding our press , our ju@@ udi@@ cro@@ us , our political system truly non @-@ answers . &quot;
appropriate questions tar@@ ve@@ ers with non @-@ answers .
&quot; Rachel Z@@ eng calls for Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am , to illustr@@ ate his opinion , since it did not understand this conclusion . &quot;
I personally find it a bit difficult to s@@ wal@@ low .
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , but a city is to which country belongs to our city ... &quot;
&quot; short , I understand nothing . &quot;
&quot; I would be very grateful if our wer@@ ter K Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am would take to take up this point where he was paid high , to be part of the government of the city of Singapore . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on the blog its comment , he points regarding the reviews that you should begin to read the entire co @-@ ordin@@ ance of the conference , so that you can understand the context of statements by Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country . &quot;
read the wor@@ ding .
&quot; when he said that Singapore rather a &quot; city &quot; was as a country , &quot; he declared why the elections in Singapore are so un@@ equal , even if we are looking forward to free and just elections . &quot;
he served Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw decades of a party ? ) .
&quot; when he said , Singapore &quot; was not a country , &quot; he obviously has not meant in this sense ! &quot;
&quot; Cle@@ ment T@@ an shows his disappointment about Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am , who makes the leader of a her@@ an@@ growing generation , such as pol@@ em@@ ic statement . &quot;
&quot; I am talking about what the Just@@ in Minister of Singapore has said , very much ... &quot;
&quot; at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Ye@@ w , and the members of the old Gar@@ de , what I expected to do with them or not , but that is another thing . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am , a member of the new generation of political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes that he really def@@ ends . &quot;
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review dis@@ sets the weaknesses of Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ ams arguments :
did Mr. Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am &quot; ben@@ ign a mistake &quot; committed or was it a mis@@ erable failure ?
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , we will only be considered independent and sovereig@@ n state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , in which country is going back the sovereig@@ n rights of the city Singapore ? &quot;
&quot; Singapore is unique , it is equally country and city . &quot;
&quot; as he plays an important role within the government inet@@ d , the statements of Mr Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am is important to we@@ ighty importance . &quot;
&quot; why do the exp@@ ands of its military service , they only defend their city but not their country ? &quot;
who must pay our Prime Minister b@@ ills ?
what is the value of our pink work@@ force ?
are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; first , the magazine Journey of a decade of affir@@ mation , Singapore has been and has always been a city : &quot;
I have not told what I said ...
this set seems to have a lot of Lon@@ gest ...
nobody ever said that Singapore is a country .
we always were a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; the defense of the country mainly &quot; &quot; etc . &quot; &quot; but this is not quite correct . &quot;
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .

global Vo@@ ices asked before short@@ com@@ bo : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or home country ?
your answers will be published here as part of a ongoing series with rum@@ ors about certain parts of the world and to be shown a different fac@@ et .
&quot; the latest part of this series is written by Nev@@ in Thom@@ pson , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
&quot; the question I asked for me in Japan is : &quot; &quot; are you American ? &quot;
&quot; no , I am sorry , I answered . &quot; I am coming from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live and back to Japan . &quot;
&quot; according to what situation the conversation takes place , it is considered polite , interest in his conversation , by creating personal questions . &quot;
&quot; it usually follows the default answer : &quot; &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice @-@ h@@ ockey , nature . &quot;
&quot; for someone who does not know , there is little that distingu@@ ishes us Can@@ adi@@ ans from Americ@@ an@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this is one of the reasons why so many can@@ adi@@ ans make a Canadian flag , visible on their back@@ pack when they travel . &quot;
all love Can@@ adi@@ ans .
American however ... .
&quot; so it was already when I began to travel through the world - before Donald Tru@@ mp , before the invasion of Iraq and 11 September . &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans always have borne small A@@ hor@@ n@@ sheets at their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free healthcare !
with us there is no weapons !
same @-@ gender equality in Canada have been legal since 2005 !
&quot; all seem to think , Canada is so great . &quot;
we are polite .
we obviously say very often &quot; sorry . &quot;
Canada also holds true as the toler@@ ant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not as these types located south of the border .
we Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
&quot; first , I have many American friends , which I admire very ad@@ mi@@ red . &quot;
it would be nothing to do if one would change me for example with Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
but there are also some problems with the stamps &quot; nice . &quot;
&quot; first , as &quot; nice &quot; said to be , &quot; is basically , like the ben@@ me@@ ek , gentle , but trag@@ ically un@@ important figure N@@ ed Flanders from &quot; The Sim@@ p@@ sons &quot; ( who has its own Canadian Doppel@@ gänger ) . &quot;
if Canada is really a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flanders would be in fact a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
&quot; there is no corners and edges , nothing where you can encounter . &quot;
harmless to be harmless to be in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and not to earn any attention .
&quot; this may be something good if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , far away from the things that happen around one . &quot;
&quot; I would even go far as far as to say that the desire to be free and alone , a main ship of the Can@@ adi@@ ans . &quot;
we tend to care about our own affairs .
&quot; what out@@ lined as &quot; &quot; nice &quot; , &quot; perhaps just cool courtesy . &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans do not often talk about the fence with the neighb@@ ors .
&quot; we are missing the warm , open kindness , which I have now connect with my American friends . &quot;
fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) bet@@ rat then Just@@ in Tru@@ de@@ au the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our Prime Minister has lived Canada to sexy .
music @-@ video of a pop @-@ band par@@ odes Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
&quot; one in Thailand famous pop @-@ band has published a music video , which will re@@ produce the Jun@@ ta that 2014 and despite their understanding the civil government , continues to re@@ igns the country . &quot;
the new song &quot; DI@@ C@@ TA@@ TOR Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells about which regulations makes him his girlfriend .
&quot; although not expressly politically , the music @-@ video refers to the continued military rule of the j@@ unta . &quot;
the band was taught by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video about the song was a huge success .
only within the first three days this was divided on Facebook 3 1.@@ 254 times and received 8.@@ 800 sp@@ ikes .
last month the Charlie @-@ Chap@@ lin @-@ Video &quot; The Dict@@ ator was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists who invited this video to watch this video .
&quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to the Thai policy , in particular how it operates with the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s take a look at these recordings of the video , which relate to some of the political issues that Thailand over the past three years . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; possibly refer to the dra@@ in section 44 of the provis@@ ional Constitution , which was awarded to the Supreme Commander of the Army . &quot;
&quot; the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the inf@@ am@@ ous program for the &quot; &quot; imagination &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are regarded by the Jun@@ ta as critics . &quot;
&quot; the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crimin@@ ality , whose v@@ age and im@@ clear regulations are often used by the authorities to negoti@@ ate activists and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose there was also a new unit set up in the army , monitor online content and persons who was thrown into the monarchy the monarchy will per@@ sec@@ uted . &quot;
Thailand continues its stri@@ ving against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ est@@ et@@ s@@ aber ) .
on 20 May 2014 the war was right in Thailand .
two days later it came to a put@@ sch of the army .
&quot; one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta remains pro@@ sec@@ uted , their decision is expensive U @-@ boats to buy even though security sex@@ es they war@@ ned that the purchase un@@ necessary and a waste of tax . &quot;
&quot; in the video even shown , as individuals will be thrown into a black under@@ carriage before reaching them into an internship camp , another problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists are sitting in prison , because they have sup@@ pos@@ edly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and may be used by internet users , they should off@@ ended the monarchy . &quot;
&quot; he showed the te@@ aser of the song members of the band , which was used for the Sal@@ ut out of &quot; The Tri@@ bute &quot; &quot; Tri@@ bute &quot; , &quot; which was already used by cou@@ p @-@ opponents during the protests . &quot;

&quot; the following article , written by Dmit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , published first on the website of OC Media and appears here with friendly permission . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ war company recovered only very slowly in East @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ asia , especially in the T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al district . &quot;
&quot; now over 20 years have passed since the Georg@@ ian @-@ ab@@ ch@@ as@@ ian war has been officially ended , but his sc@@ ars are still greatly visible in this part of the Republic . &quot;
the abandoned villages of the North district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show distinctive images .
&quot; villages like D@@ zh@@ ant@@ uk@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sh@@ ak@@ ht@@ a , Poly@@ ana and Kh@@ arch@@ il@@ ava are located in the Kohl@@ enbe@@ ck of Ab@@ ch@@ asia . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups such as Russi@@ ans , Greeks , shut@@ ters , Georg@@ ian and Armen@@ ians lived and worked at the Soviet times in the area . &quot;
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
&quot; today , the largest part of Russi@@ ans and ch@@ ases are living in the area . &quot;
such settlements are also called cl@@ erg@@ y in Ab@@ ch@@ Asia .
&quot; in the pre @-@ war period there are more than 10,000 people , today there are only a few hundred people in this Spirit . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; since 2011 , the total population of the district of 16.@@ 000 people was barely increased over a decade . &quot;
&quot; 1989 , about 43,@@ 000 people lived in this district . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of the war &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the empty fif@@ ties of the Soviet Union from the early 60s , the Chr@@ us@@ ht@@ is@@ kow@@ kas are called symbol@@ ically for the low@@ lands and the devast@@ ation of the region . &quot;
the buildings are fall and rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village of D@@ zh@@ ant@@ uk@@ ha I met a native older man .
he begins a conversation and it is hard to end this .
&quot; all this is a consequence of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot;
it is still unique . &quot;
in front of war the village was full of life .
&quot; there were comm@@ issions , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens , which served all of the community . &quot;
now there are only paved road with f@@ aded glory .
&quot; people who once lived on this place and had their contribution to the central planning of the Soviet Union , have now left the district . &quot;
in the Ge@@ ister@@ stadt D@@ zh@@ ant@@ uk@@ ha live about fifty inhabitants .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a in the other villages it looks similar .
&quot; Chr@@ us@@ ht@@ ow@@ kas , which includes one or two families , one can see at the balconies where you are dried . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house . &quot;
&quot; when they discover me with the camera in the hand , they go immediately back . &quot;
&quot; our Mother has forbidden to let us photograph us , &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; she simply has just b@@ anned it , that &apos;s all . &quot;
the girl whis@@ per@@ ed her girlfriend slightly too and suddenly they left the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al@@ ug@@ ol .
families are also involved in the sub@@ market economy ( the cultivation of agricultural products for the peculi@@ arities ) such as li@@ vest@@ ock and vegetables .
it is difficult to get through the l@@ aps .
the district administration supplies in winter free candles and bread to the villages .

&quot; I do not know what is going to happen , but we will build zu@@ cch@@ ini &quot;
&quot; ten years ago , an older wife moved with the name Gal@@ ina ( or T@@ ante Gal@@ ya , as it is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Jen@@ h@@ ant@@ uk@@ ha . &quot;
&quot; despite their oldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina did not leave before Ab@@ ch@@ as@@ ies to live with her . &quot;
Gal@@ ina wishes to accept no financial assistance from her daughter and ra@@ vels that they instead supports their young grand@@ son .
Gal@@ inas monthly R@@ ente are just nine dollars .
&quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very hard to survive , &quot;
T@@ ante Gal@@ ya tells you that she and other vill@@ agers try to celebrate themselves regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; a 90 year old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building .
&quot; if holidays are , we visit us . &quot;
&quot; but we cannot constantly do this - everybody is busy with his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as she tells her story , a younger neigh@@ bor appears on the balcony . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; calls T@@ ante Gal@@ ya to her . &quot; &quot; they said , we could build Zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot;
I have already prepared the ground .
&quot; I do not know what is going to happen , but we will build zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
Gal@@ yas talk in Nat@@ ascha has lived together with her husband and the five common children in their house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she rem@@ inds of the thor@@ ns in front of the war .
&quot; despite the relatives , who lived in central , O@@ ss@@ et@@ ien and Georgia ( the country Ab@@ ch@@ asia broke away ) , they did not leave the opportunity to leave it . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; we have no fear of the dark road or the few people . &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
&quot; in fact , it is rather something to do with lo@@ oting . &quot;
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived as it was right .
I remember each day like the city and the war were once .
&quot; when our conversation came to the end , a small boy is running with us . &quot;
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hidden .
a ball flies from the window and another boy j@@ agt to him .
he plays with the ball then down the hill .
a group children now pursu@@ es the ball .
&quot; while they run , some of them throw in the falling buildings . &quot;
these ruins are a part of their childhood that worry for discomfort in their lives .

in Mexico now houses &quot; Mama Africa &quot; migrants on their long journey
&quot; Con@@ cep@@ ción Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez is a small hotel located in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border of Mexico to Guatemala . &quot;

this article by Amy Br@@ acken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and appears here with friendly permission .
&quot; on the way of migrants , the Europe or Latin America cross , some places are known for their hospitality . &quot;
I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tap@@ ach@@ ula he is located at the border with Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is led by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mex@@ ic@@ er led by a small woman with a cor@@ al @-@ pink Br@@ illi@@ en@@ gest@@ el and gold colored ear@@ rings in Ted@@ dy@@ bear .
&quot; Con@@ cep@@ ción Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name Mama Africa . &quot;
this nickname is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a goal for Afri@@ kaner and Ha@@ it@@ ans who are on the journey .
the hotel does not have any charm .
&quot; for about 2.50 dollars the night sleeping the guests in simple rooms , with cold , cru@@ m@@ bling walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
in the anter@@ o@@ om there is a par@@ rots in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - yet hundreds of African and ha@@ iti@@ ian migrants here .
&quot; sometimes , Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez , people tells in full min@@ ibus and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call : &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot;
where are you Mama Africa ? . &quot;
&quot; at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez already received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
there are only 24 rooms and some have already slept outside on cardboard boxes .
it does not want to reject anyone .
&quot; it also helps them and bring them to hospital when they are sick , they buy them medications that they cannot pay , they mass@@ aging them with a bal@@ m which were exhausted from the long journey . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ ch@@ ique Sebast@@ iao , originally from Angola , is a short time ago . &quot;
I asked him if Mama Africa is an appropriate nickname for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; Sebast@@ ien family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , which has a yo@@ gurt m@@ oust@@ ache ) pos@@ ented with Con@@ cep@@ ción Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez . &quot;
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Br@@ acken .
&quot; yes , yes , he answered with a smile . &quot; I really feel that it fits to her , as African women are very nice women . &quot;
very affect@@ ionate .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
&quot; Sebast@@ iao re@@ sum@@ ed with his sister , which hopes to go to Boston to find their husband and the three children . &quot;
&quot; you already lived in Brazil , however , it is for some Afric@@ ans who are on the way to the United States , normal to take a first stop in South America and then go to the north . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard from other cou@@ riers of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well known name on the track , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
he tells that the Ha@@ it@@ ans and the Afric@@ ans often travel the route and that the Afric@@ ans already speak on What@@ s@@ App from Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; as many of his companion , Michel@@ et has lived in Brazil before and worked as a building workers on the construction of the Olympic Games and the football world championship . &quot;
&quot; when the Brazilian economy has been we@@ aker , he began his trip to the United States . &quot;
&quot; he has been a guest at Mama Africa since months , he sold SI@@ M cards to save the necessary money to buy the Bust@@ icket . &quot;
I ask him if he will have in the future with Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let them go again , &quot; &quot; answers smiling . &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells you their guests often send text messages when they are gone to gr@@ iss@@ ing them or to tell you about the course of their journey .
it declar@@ es that their Christian faith in the drive of their work is .
&quot; do not know a lot about Africa , but their guests have contributed to prepare chicken as in Ghana . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps here very well known , but it is not the only fun@@ ken hope for migrants , who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula . &quot;
at the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter was recorded by Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family migrants in their little house .
he is polic@@ eman and has found that the Bust@@ ick@@ ets will be sold to many African migrants .
&quot; he began to help them to get a reasonable price , then he has offered them his house for a dollar off the night . &quot;
&quot; at the moment are 25 people there , mainly Ha@@ it@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; some sleep on blank@@ ets on the ground , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking outside . &quot;
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests do .
&quot; I lived in the United States , he tells . &quot; I experienced what they experience . &quot;
I crossed the border over the desert and we have suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . this is the reason why I give them my support .
&quot; after spending three years , he was transferred to a raid on his work place in the United States . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants , which is represented by Tap@@ ach@@ ula , comes from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their houses for them . &quot;
José Antonio Cord@@ ova Mel@@ én@@ dez tells me that he fled his wife with his wife and his three children from people who wanted to develop money without a plan .
&quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he has asked for a accommodation and a unknown , an all@@ ab@@ ian , has offered him to its roof . &quot;
&quot; some months later the family lives still there and she tries to decide where the next steps should go . &quot;
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is back full of guests .
in the courses consult the travelers calm their tele@@ phones .
a min@@ ibus today has arrived and brought 20 new guests to a large part of Somalia .
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems to be happy that their house is full , but it is also nost@@ alg@@ ically , because of those who have gone away . &quot;
like a stol@@ len grandmother fl@@ akes her in her album with numerous photos .

China : X@@ inj@@ iang inhabitants are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones .
a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang by Twitter @-@ users
&quot; the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ iang , an ethnic minorities region in the West China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; on 10 July the mobile users of Tian@@ shan district of the town of U@@ rum@@ qi is a mobile phone notification , in which she proves to install a surveillance app called Jing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web cleaning &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in the message , the app is said to get access to terror@@ ist information . &quot;
but k@@ ò@@ n@@ ets the authorities use the App for more than the fight against terrorism .
&quot; according to an exclusive report of Radio Free Asia were arrested 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h Women in the autonom@@ ous I@@ li Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ fecture , because they had already replaced the app , messages with a private language group . &quot;
&quot; in the communication of the police , the app will determine the sources and distribution of the terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; dam@@ aging information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ books and documents . &quot;
Jing@@ w@@ angs website describes the app as follows :
&quot; Jing@@ w@@ ang is a protective performance with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ ang@@ u Tel@@ ecom . &quot;
&quot; the main function is the block@@ ing porno@@ graphic websites , from online sc@@ am , Trojan and ph@@ ishing sites to make user attention on how much time they spend online , and to remote control our own home network . &quot;
this app with the filter@@ ing for te@@ ages to help children help the children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
a app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
&quot; for example , the &quot; &quot; remote control &quot; &quot; state actors or even h@@ ackers dict@@ able to man@@ ip@@ ulate the home network of a person or ste@@ al it . &quot;
this introduction is in accordance with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
&quot; while reports on digital c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in China usually focus on the experiences of users in the Middle East and south , the reality is very often dark for those who live in remote , covered ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ iang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; to limit un@@ rest and diss@@ atis@@ faction in conflict @-@ areas , the authorities often arrange extreme c@@ ens@@ ers and monitoring measures as well as rout@@ in@@ ely Internet switch . &quot;
&quot; the images published on Twitter @-@ based Media @-@ Out@@ let &quot; images from the China &quot; ( &quot; &quot; Wor@@ ds &quot; &quot; ) , the c@@ ens@@ ored news in China , showed photos of a Check@@ point where the polic@@ emen were installed on the inhabitants , whether they had installed the surveillance app . &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian ensure that people use the official Jing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile not@@ ifications required that people install the app within 10 days .
&quot; if you are interested in a check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be im@@ pris@@ oned up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a set@@ back for the technological development .
&quot; they have the people forced to use devices , which are meant for older people . &quot;
this is a form of im@@ prison@@ ment through the advis@@ ory technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from the China &quot; ( &quot; &quot; War@@ ran@@ tee &quot; &quot; ) also released a Jing@@ w@@ ang product description , from which the software can lift up a Windows operating system and thus provides unlimited access to the computer &apos;s hard drive . &quot;
after installing Jing@@ w@@ ang Computer and phones in X@@ inj@@ iang for electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the regulations in Jing@@ w@@ ang may be an reaction to the instructions of the city &apos;s party to minim@@ ize the spread of illegal content .
&quot; all government agencies , authorities and party institutions , including universities and research institutes are obliged to follow the instructions of Cyber@@ security Office when running their computer and communication devices . &quot;
&quot; a recent report about Freedom House , an US @-@ American human rights organization , mentioned also these new monitoring methods : &quot;
&quot; in X@@ inj@@ iang , the authorities published on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of U@@ rum@@ qi a regulation with the directive on all residents and entrepreneurs until the 1st of August their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards . &quot;
&quot; the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terror@@ ist videos &quot; and to destroy this action , however , the personality @-@ right of U@@ rum@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them punishment for quite a number of other possible outcomes , including those that relate to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot;
sleep or death ; part 1 : all scre@@ ams according to death
a plot in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo by : Cor@@ rie Bar@@ air@@ ore ( CC BY 2.0 ) .
&quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; sleep or death , &quot; where the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane is described his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot;
&quot; far from our blue , virtual world , you look at and remind you that you are completely alone at one place where everything has disappeared . &quot;
&quot; everything has moved to and after asc@@ ended and a truth , which is clearly recogn@@ izable from inside and outside . &quot;
one who make their name all glory .
one who made in a list of sensation and phrases that allow no metaph@@ ors .
&quot; but when you get the reality again and you get behind the scenes - beyond the actor , the beautiful scenes and the performers - turn the characters in essence of meat and blood , and all scre@@ ams according to death . &quot;
&quot; all doubts are aware of smoke and you will be aware of your existence , even if the Earth is on the axis of the un@@ he@@ ils . you &apos;ll see that you are caught here between the walls that your parents , and before them have established your grand@@ parents , stone around stone . &quot;
&quot; you have arrested me and arrested my father three times , but that did not judge my lesson , &quot; as the Chief of the Security Council - with the promise that the fourth time would become a pleasure . &quot;
he put his power over us by accept@@ ing even the simpl@@ est concepts destroyed which we knew .
five young people were ri@@ pped during a peaceful protests like we@@ eds from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
it rep@@ elled to make the city the darkness of the night with &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; .
&quot; all quarters of the districts , only my own not . &quot;
&quot; for the first time it was quiet , rainy , at the wrong time , even if I put no high demands on a city that is up to arter@@ ies with state security , and their accompl@@ ices . &quot;
in the third night things had a little cal@@ ms to work after the power supply in the quarter .
I passed the silence by taking several times &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house .
I heard my voice through the silence res@@ il@@ ted .
&quot; a few minutes later , some of my friends were cour@@ ageous enough to find together . &quot;
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , true friends closed to me ; we were talking to a glorious picture , which is my expectations full and fully filled . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment you are aware that you are free the spirit from the lamp , but it is not interested in the smell . &quot;
I received a call from my father : &quot; make you ready to meet us at the military security building .
he put up .
&quot; then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can go down - nothing can give you your voice , after you put it all the way up to the office of the Security Council . &quot;
I came there .
&quot; the Colon@@ el Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men , my father was already there , as I now also . &quot;
&quot; the Colon@@ el Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to speak : &quot; &quot; let me hear how you &apos;re &apos;@@ om@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &apos; , or you are only brave enough to cry if we are not nearby . &quot;
his h@@ asser@@ ted eyes were on me .
&quot; and you sad , genuine what to look into the eyes and not on the ground ! &quot;
what I did so has nothing to do with courage .
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I was in front of this building . &quot;
&quot; maybe it was on my fool@@ ish@@ ness , van@@ ity ; perhaps on the revolution . &quot;
I was my thing as secure as I answered , &quot; I did not think that you have already forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot;
&quot; and I think I have never heard before you look into the eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I have no word of what I said . &quot;
&quot; put him in individual and his father , right with them . &quot;
&quot; his father is equal to them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the st@@ ench of this curs@@ ed sentence lies to me until today in the nose .
&quot; he was exposed to a &quot; syndrome &quot; , &quot; an ep@@ ic torture , which I was exposed to mon@@ atel@@ ang . &quot;
I am ready to pass the farm .
in the first office I let everything I go with me .
&quot; afterwards again through the yard and into the second office , which leads through a gear to the single cells . &quot;
I talk to me all the details before I have the room .
differently than otherwise they probably have a larger cell .
&quot; I have to share it with only one another cap@@ ti@@ ves , and may immediately put me without waiting for her permission . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes , who felt like a whole life , the official left the cell , and I attacked on an old @-@ proven communication method : with the f@@ ist against the wall . &quot;
I learned that my ornam@@ entation has been a &quot; educ@@ ate &quot; .
after a long du@@ o@@ ers he repl@@ ied to me .
&quot; apparently , in none of the surrounding cells there was a prestigious man middle aged , who is similar to me and &quot; the doctor . &quot; &quot;
in the perfect darkness do not let me know a distinctive faces ; and doctors are not here ; we are all just numbers .
&quot; maybe someone , whose voice is similar to me ? &quot;
all answers connected to its existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the big cells .
maybe he will immediately hear .
&quot; investig@@ ators had assured me , they would certainly fre@@ ed if I ab@@ ide . &quot;
zack7.com / index.php ? ID _ lang = 1
&quot; I would like to have a scar@@ ec@@ row , in order to distribute all these cro@@ ws , which are lab@@ eled by the fruit in the garden of my head . &quot;
&quot; from the distance , I hear them still &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it must be about 10 am in the evening ; always around this time the cry , every day . &quot;
the door opens .
&quot; I was always convinced that black the color of destruction is , until I saw the yellow light that gave us the Gre@@ ys in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; &quot; Don@@ ner &quot; , &quot; An@@ tiv@@ ation on the 13th of the Koran ) . &quot;
they are here to listen to .
&quot; this was the secret to protect us and prevent the state security before us and prevent the terrorists in us , they speak in the Al@@ a@@ wit@@ ischen dialect - so they also played their denom@@ in@@ ational envelop@@ e and constit@@ uted the narrow focus of their world view . &quot;
&quot; this is not a house that is here is not a land ; it is a cur@@ se , which they call co@@ existence to turn the crimin@@ als of their sound into a hero . &quot;
&quot; I have been managing the audit@@ ed and re@@ efs to Abu I@@ mad , a slim and ash@@ amed man ; at least he is so before . &quot;
&quot; he begins a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , &quot; despite the face @-@ out , &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can join as much more important with your life as you can join this diary and will soon be an end soon . &quot;
I did not answer .
I used it to answer .
I can really no longer say when ins@@ ults and bl@@ ows had become a friendly conversation for me to an ordinary communication .
when and how it happened was un@@ important .
&quot; some voice in me said that I had to get married to me , although I had done nothing to make this punishment . &quot;
an punishment in all its diversity .
&quot; his command is to rip me as much meat as possible from the body . &quot;
he calls the loving &quot; confess@@ ions . &quot;
it begins with a plastic tube that probably comes out of the clo@@ ister .
your H@@ enk@@ er erg@@ ap@@ t at your cry .
&quot; give him the pleasure , you cannot measure you with him and you can not hold your fr@@ y . &quot;
&quot; my cry did not play enough , why they are inter@@ changeable by a cable through a cable . &quot;
&quot; with my first review I asked me whether the investig@@ ators had worked as a gar@@ bage , or if that belong@@ ed to the normal working equipment . &quot;
&quot; they had four cables to each other , in order to present us out of their vision , great invention of a huge cable . &quot;
within one hour you rarely move three of them while I was still in the series .
I had lost every feeling in my body - and also my voice which I have to cry .
&quot; the exec@@ ution@@ er sp@@ otted the cooling , and found no vessel , which is why he used as a neighbour to a electric@@ ally charged . &quot;
&quot; stream through my whole body , enough to store my whole quarter . &quot;
&quot; my semi @-@ tor@@ ious body , which lay stretched on the ground , was the perfect power conductor . &quot;
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for this night .
this must probably have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
some hours for@@ ks who came to me as minutes .
then the call to dawn .
the door opens and the dawn meets the room &quot; .@@ R@@ out with you , Ar@@ sch@@ f@@ icker . &quot;
I answered with the voice of a exhausted young people : &quot; my Lord , my Father has to worry about it . &quot;
&quot; be quiet and away , you will be moved . &quot;
this was new .
otherwise they always had me aw@@ ake .
where do they lead me ? !
&quot; the j@@ ord@@ anic Rap@@ per Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ ib talks about the rights of LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance &quot;
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ ib smo@@ kes a cigar@@ ette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ ib sp@@ ends the majority of his time , and sometimes he s@@ wal@@ low to his lin@@ nen , to his computer , and again to his couch . &quot;
&quot; but what one can rely on , is a cigar@@ ette between his fingers or his nic@@ otine lips . &quot;
&quot; he lives in the top floor of his family house , which ended them since 1967 ; the year , in which Israel had completed his occupation of the West@@ bank , and H@@ da@@ ib@@ s family , in which they had lived in Palestine in whom she lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ en ( e.g. : Far@@ mer ) . &quot;
&quot; for now six years , H@@ da@@ ib is a passionate part of the conservative majority and their alt@@ en@@ proven opinions about gender rolls , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression by art and rap@@ music . &quot;
&quot; with his music that often deal with issues such as Orient@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of the whole Arab world , but also demands the core of the entire Arab world . all these issues are not only in his home city Am@@ man Rel@@ ev@@ anz but also in cities , which is rich in Syria until San@@ aa in Yemen . &quot;
&quot; with his 25 years H@@ da@@ ib sees itself as someone who is restricted in his thinking by boundaries , and he can feel according to his own statement by people who suffer from the devast@@ ating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
even if he does not open it open up against the US @-@ American foreign policy is a special dedu@@ ct@@ ment .
H@@ da@@ ib considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded from the author .
&quot; H@@ da@@ ib does not believe that his sympathy for those who have to survive in war @-@ areas , something that was born with his identity as a &quot; Palestinian in@@ fle@@ eting of the second generation &quot; - so he himself was born in Jordan , and has never been in Palestine until now . &quot;
&quot; I am not thinking about my own life , &quot; says H@@ da@@ ib . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; I think that I am a person , while he is sol@@ dered in water , Nes@@ café in two cups . it is the holy month Ram@@ adan ; in this time it is for Muslims , from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the j@@ ord@@ anic law also noted that the public consumption of food during the Ram@@ adan is illegal .
&quot; obviously , H@@ da@@ ib has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand has a cup of coffee at a s@@ eng@@ aging hot Jun@@ it@@ ag little to do with protest against Islam . &quot;
basically the pres@@ sures are very hot coffee and the vibr@@ ates of the K@@ ent cigar@@ ette in the nose primarily of freedom .
&quot; sometimes Jordan is like a prison under the open sky , especially when you have a look into the neighboring countries . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it avo@@ ids it simply to do basic things - as in the public during the Ram@@ adan water - to drink not in prison . &quot;
&quot; recently , the Interior of Jordan is a appearance of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Le@@ ila , already for the second time . &quot;
&quot; some parliament@@ arians who support the Islamic A@@ erial front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Br@@ otherhood - argu@@ ed that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ osex@@ ual front@@ ants Ham@@ ed sensu@@ o , the cultural and traditional nor@@ ms of the country is contra@@ dict@@ ated and the main reason for the concert . &quot;
the members and former press review of the Islamic coalition DI@@ MA Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert was said &quot; just &quot; because of the sexual orientation of the S@@ ower .
&quot; many claim also , the commitment of the band in matters such as Arabic , human rights and free expression in the Arab world be more dangerous activ@@ ism , who represents the old approved legitim@@ acy in the entire region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Le@@ ila , the j@@ ord@@ anic people as &quot; &quot; progressive sup@@ porter of human rights &quot; , &quot; who continue to establish a intellectual and cultural plur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; this statement is probably not likely to be sil@@ ken rh@@ etor@@ ic , but actually reflected a clear out @-@ cryst@@ all@@ ine reality in Jordan , which occurs in H@@ da@@ ib@@ s work . &quot;
&quot; in the year 2016 , H@@ da@@ ib traditional sex men who cast his vision from the fate of Arab women the vo@@ re@@ hel@@ ds sex . &quot;
&quot; the picture shows the skel@@ eton of a clearly crus@@ hed un@@ familiar woman , whose arms and legs are stretch up to the corners of the canvas . &quot;
&quot; it is surrounded by a red lake , perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who actually trust them . &quot;
in the past few years the number of &apos; honor@@ ary mor@@ ality took place - the in@@ official outside left .
&quot; human Rights Watch , according to the number of honor@@ ary mor@@ als in the year 2016 their climax ; however , there is still hor@@ rif@@ ying that Jordan has become the institutional infrastructure to support the victims of murder and domestic violence in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; according to a law on the criminal off@@ ence from 1954 , women who are exposed in prison on in@@ definite period , and for their release is often a years of bureaucrat@@ ic effort as well as the guarantee of the family needed that the woman is nothing to happen . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ ib@@ s music enjoys great popularity and is known for this , even before themes , which in its country long as tab@@ oo . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ ib cont@@ ests that his work is politically , however , however , that he is his music , who is full of explicit sent@@ ences to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression , not from politics . &quot;
&quot; I come from Nah@@ ost , Mann . &quot;
&quot; I was standing in politics , &quot; &quot; says he . &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; takes the question of Palestinian identity in the attack .
&quot; in &quot; &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; &quot; and in &quot; &quot; gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; &quot; is the focus on poverty . &quot;
&quot; the list of songs , which are politically politically , can be continued . &quot;
in March 2016 H@@ da@@ ib published a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song you repeated a verse often :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot;
&quot; in the further course of the song H@@ da@@ ib describes the world as a kind of market in which one can get in his words , &quot; which one wants &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ faith , hetero@@ gene@@ ity or homosexu@@ ality . &quot;
he noticed that hardly any someone in Jordan on the rights of sw@@ amps and les@@ bi@@ ans speaks and that comments on equality of LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals were still strong in 2014 .
&quot; in 2014 H@@ da@@ ib was an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ anic Onlin@@ e@@ Program RO@@ Y@@ A to notice later that his comments had been taken from the context , betra@@ yed and his opinion . &quot;
&quot; on Youtube , it was upload without cuts , but it was only a processed version , &quot; says he . &quot;
today H@@ da@@ ib is open to Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that intoler@@ ance towards homosexu@@ als not speak to Islam .
&quot; he mentioned Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the eighth century , who has remained in memory today thanks to his hom@@ o@@ erotic poems in memory . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ ib ask himself : if Abu Nu@@ what was later to work on behalf of the cal@@ iph@@ ate , in the eighth century , we could write openly about homosexu@@ ality , why do the Jord@@ an@@ ians cannot write that ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , so H@@ da@@ ib , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Le@@ ila or the fact that the concert was cancelled . &quot;
in the H@@ ash@@ it@@ ic Kingdom there is nothing new that the government attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are brought to silence .
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the j@@ ord@@ anic message has several former government members and members of the Teacher association , with the reason they would have critic@@ ized on comments in social media related to the problems associated with the deeply in the country . &quot;
&quot; in view of what is the concert H@@ da@@ ib@@ s , according to the top of the ic@@ eberg - the real challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jordan . &quot;
&quot; for him , progress is a permanent and taking . Jordan has taught m@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Le@@ ila now for the second time in a row , but the way of progress - it looks out of slow , needs and internal changes . he is sure that these changes will take place in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society . &quot;
&quot; finally , H@@ da@@ ib , such as millions of other Arabs also , from an Arab world without interventions from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he dre@@ amed not only to bring his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to experience it . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region will help from music , art and literature from a real and fundamental openness - and not by bom@@ bs , streams and to artificial style led demo@@ cr@@ acies . at least hopes he hopes that . &quot;
&quot; as far as far as it is , H@@ da@@ ib , and therefore also resistance to the resistance . &quot;
&quot; this report was made by the Pul@@ se@@ ater Center on Crisis Re@@ porting , the A@@ man is a student Fel@@ low . &quot;
Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan .
these great , extra@@ vag@@ ant war@@ rior are so fantastic ! ! ! &quot;
there are numerous theories concerning the origin of the adren@@ uta festival .
&quot; we suspe@@ cted that there is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually over in August in many areas T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory arose , in the armies from the west of Japan in the north @-@ east , to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the E@@ mis@@ hi , into the knees . &quot;
we are at the Neb@@ uta festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we were able to grab some great seats , that is why we have a great view . &quot;
one can imagine how large these parts are ...
&quot; a joint center in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ day exhibition to W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally . &quot;
I &apos;m looking for a long time again the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en : two celebrations are just to be seen .
&quot; nonetheless , for many people who take the journey to A@@ om@@ ori , the adren@@ uta festival will take the only true way - and a breathtaking way to spend its summer : &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot;
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and gave me the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 meter high celebrations was incredible .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !

&quot; rarely , ou@@ tw@@ ard appearance and body care were so important as in this story , as they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth from the crime and to promote an legitim@@ ate profession like the hair@@ dres@@ ser . &quot;
&quot; El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us most important harbour , located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , in the vicinity of the historic center of the capital city of Lima - a region with a very high degree of crime rate , where street smoking and illegal drugs are daily . &quot;
&quot; in April 2017 , the survey published in April 2017 that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region is not sure . &quot;
at the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - a rising demand for aesthetic services for men .
&quot; the trend , the appearance and thus also the fallen hair@@ styles of famous sports artists such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or Ne@@ ym@@ ar ( Brazil ) , has led to the experienced hands of hair@@ dress@@ ers who can make these elab@@ orate hair@@ styles . &quot;
&quot; un@@ preced@@ ented demand for hair@@ styles that go to the extreme borders of imagination and creativity , even an annual event has inspired the competition of hair@@ dress@@ ers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , who has been held since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; there experts get together with each other , who can create from them the most ec@@ centric L@@ ooks , as you can see in the following video ( other videos to current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) . &quot;
&quot; educational institutions like the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , which is located in El Call@@ ao , here we found a chance to exchange young people against hair@@ dressing tools and instead of bad advice to get education in hair@@ dressing art , which allows them to find work . &quot;
motivated by this activity and the offering possibilities are do@@ z@@ ens of young people saw that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
the school offered before the school in March comm@@ ending training year special out@@ sourcing workshops and told about some of their achievements :
&quot; in 1995 we were the only technical school in the municipality and the district , what we are very proud of because of love for the children , we have built this educational community . &quot;
Colombia : love new@@ sletters on Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ak@@ ler

&quot; the following article is the modified version of the message &quot; &quot; Lov@@ bot@@ anic &quot; &quot; has published the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot;
the contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write lovemaking letters to people that we know ?
&quot; is it not yet much more important , people who feel out@@ stretched , affection . &quot;
exactly this question went to the two young kol@@ um@@ bi@@ anic activists from the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Crist@@ ian Pal@@ ac@@ ios of the Young Youth Foundation and inspired her to the campaign Cart@@ as p@@ or la Re@@ conc@@ ili@@ ación ( letters to reconciliation ) who have young people to write Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ak@@ ash@@ amed letters .
&quot; only before short , her country &apos;s place was a historical event , and they wanted to contribute to their part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace agreement with the gu@@ er@@ ill@@ a@@ movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary forces in Colombia ) , which forms the worst armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
international was considered to be the submission of the peace agreement as a significant that the Colom@@ bian President José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its to the Nobel Peace Prize .
&quot; however , in front of the Kolum@@ bi@@ an@@ ern , there is still a long way to speak of a real reconciliation and peace . &quot;
&quot; gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , who lived many years in illegal wareh@@ ouses , have been exposed to a war of war@@ fare , and around the clock their weapons have to integrate themselves into life as civilians . &quot;
the Colom@@ bian society in turn is acc@@ ustom@@ ed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hate to gu@@ err@@ illa tr@@ ench also has to support their ranks and support them in building a new life .
Leonardo and Crist@@ ian were convinced that the young Kolum@@ bi@@ ans would close together and help to help integration process .
&quot; and this is exactly what they did : until now , thousands of young people are written letters - love songs on former gu@@ er@@ ill@@ usion@@ ists to welcome them back in society again . &quot;
the aim of the campaign are 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ usion@@ ists - which should then be transferred to personally .
the Valent@@ ine &apos;s day as inspiration for the campaign
&quot; the idea for letters to reconciliation was born on the World Summit of the Nobel Peace Prize , which took place in February 2017 in Bog@@ ot@@ á . there was Leonardo and Crist@@ ian the opportunity to speak shortly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ ar@@ thi , which was awarded to the Nobel Peace Prize . &quot;
&quot; that explained that we love the people we love , am Valent@@ ine &apos;s thousands of lovemaking , but those who forget it much needed . &quot;
&quot; he plane , he continued to share his love with people this year , which needed at the p@@ end@@ ent tri@@ p@@ ru@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; so the plan , letters full of hope and support for former fighters of F@@ ARC to write their place in society and to build a new life . &quot; &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discour@@ se of a war history to a common history of peace . &quot;
&quot; so far , as part of the campaign have been collected more than 2000 letters . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ al , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Barran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á . &quot;
I have never thought that someone would forgive me ?
the first 500 letters were passed on 19 March in one of the UN @-@ camps in the region of Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca .
&quot; a group of 40 students at the University of J@@ aver@@ iana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art travel@@ ed to the camp to bring the letters personally . &quot;
the members of F@@ ARC presented itself as they had done earlier to make the commands of their leaders .
&quot; but this time they received no commands , but letters full of people from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a very moving moment for all involved . &quot; &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings you walk in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that lies between &quot; &quot; told the Polit@@ ic@@ s@@ student Manuela J@@ im@@ é@@ nez Av@@ ila later . &quot;
Sandra Par@@ ra , a employee of the Gover@@ nor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable experience as follows : &quot;
&quot; after we passed the letters , a former war@@ rior led me through the camp of the Gu@@ er@@ illa war@@ rior . &quot;
&quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the gu@@ er@@ ill@@ usion@@ ists live ) , I saw a gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ator who wrote a little bit . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid to go down , because beside him on the bed there was M@@ GL @-@ Gran@@ at@@ designer , a fatal weapon in the thorn @-@ tree @-@ sheep . &quot;
&quot; I still spoke to him and asked , &quot; &quot; Hello , what do they do ? &quot; &quot; I answered , &quot; &quot; I answered , I answered me . &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; never in my life , someone gave me something so nice , so I answered it . &quot; &quot; I suddenly heard the tears over the che@@ eks . &quot;
I h@@ ug@@ ged him very firm and set me next to the pom@@ lad@@ der .
&quot; maybe he was the war was sorry , all the years of faithful companion to be this struggles , and wanted to help him to write this letter . &quot;
&quot; the man told me more about his life . he never had something different from life than war , was the only way to keep him and his six brothers before the famine . &quot; I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes . &quot;
&quot; but now I know that there is a society out there , which is waiting for us with open arms . &quot;
&quot; until now I only learned how I have to deal with weapons . &quot;
&quot; but now where peace re@@ igns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
&quot; as a pre@@ lu@@ de , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC came to a discussion . &quot;
the students were all grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC already worked in secret .
&quot; therefore , the leaders of the F@@ ARC the history of the organization , their ide@@ als and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; many years we have experienced how the social in@@ justice on the part of the state to develop the whole Colom@@ bian people , we can help to create the society in this country . &quot;
&quot; for a purpose of this size , it is worth to overcome all obstacles , &quot; said one of them . &quot;
Manuela was impressed :
&quot; these people who have never found hearing and had no elect@@ oral law , and to recognize that people who have seen often seen as monsters and even hate people who were shot by their li@@ sum@@ ption and their environment , was very painful for me . &quot;
&quot; the reality , in which the country lives , does me hurt . &quot;
&quot; but it comfort@@ ed me that all men - even those who have killed and so much damage , can give us something be@@ ading , and a smile and a hug can give us . &quot;
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
&quot; Gust@@ av@@ o Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the com@@ mander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Archbishop of the City of Cal@@ i , the following letter : &quot;
the Kolum@@ bi@@ an@@ ers was made that after the development of peace would reign .
but this is not the case .
&quot; as long as it gives inequality , hunger and a lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are willing to rise up and to record their rights and that is also completely justified ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; we from the F@@ ARC now put peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; that is why we call all def@@ enders of peace - regardless of what race , religion or ideology they belong to themselves - to rise above all those who dream of a country in the war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word to make our contribution and bring victims , because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . one among us who defend life as the basis of existence , many difficulties will be forthcoming . &quot;
&quot; on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them . &quot;

&quot; homosexu@@ als and que@@ er people who live in the Cau@@ cas@@ ian region , are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail . &quot;
with fr@@ ight activists have experienced the reporting of the last months on the persecution of Schw@@ ul@@ er men in Che@@ chn@@ ya .
&quot; but the threat that is like an D@@ amo@@ kl@@ es@@ an over the dre@@ ary LGB@@ T@@ Q church , is not only done by night . &quot;
&quot; OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ sn@@ y , who spoke some of their experiences with us and spoke with us what is currently happening in the Republic . &quot;
LGB@@ T@@ Q @-@ legal situation in Che@@ chn@@ ya has published several months ago by the international head@@ lines after reports published by the den@@ ial , torture and killing of que@@ er men in the Republic . &quot;
&quot; the first report was published by the journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Now@@ aya Gas@@ eta ; she cast a light on the methods of t@@ ari@@ ous authorities , the sus@@ pic@@ ious que@@ er men ar@@ rests and they appear in secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun . &quot;
&quot; they have brought a mon@@ ster to the world &quot;
&quot; Sabrina , a trans@@ woman , was born in Gro@@ sn@@ y and grew there . &quot;
&quot; already since their childhood , she felt that she was in reality a woman . &quot;
&quot; when she became grown , it became aware that Che@@ chn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , why she moved to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after a group of Che@@ chens had experienced by the genital equ@@ ation of their Land@@ s@@ wife , the hunt was opened on Sabrina . &quot;
&quot; out of fear for her life , she moved to the USA last En@@ des to the USA . &quot;
Sabrina : I was active as volunteers in a human rights organization .
one day was told me that someone needed my help .
&quot; it was a friend of Dag@@ est@@ an , a trans@@ woman who fought into trouble . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took them without hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help her , did someone from which I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread them all over the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent them to his t@@ ari@@ ous friends , with the following message : &quot; then there is no men more in Che@@ chn@@ ya , which can eliminate these shame ? &quot;
then the photos of my documents made by the whole What@@ s@@ App the lap .
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
&quot; when I was just going to highlight a few tro@@ users from the back of my car , I heard a male voice to say : &quot; here is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot;
&quot; when I turned out , I felt something in my body , but me did nothing hur@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time on t@@ anned : &quot; &quot; how long do you want to honor the family , you sc@@ and@@ y ? &quot;
I did not know the person .
&quot; I just know that there was a young man , not 30 years old . &quot;
then I lost consciousness and wo@@ ke the end of the hospital in the hospital .
apparently some women had to get everything and started to cry .
the man was fled .
the women had called a nur@@ se .
in the hospital I learned that I had two p@@ endant in my right lung .
OC Media : in which nurs@@ es have been placed - in whom the men or women ?
&quot; Sabrina : my documents are out@@ dated , there is still my male name dr@@ aught ; but the doctor im@@ standing , and put me to the women . &quot;
&quot; therefore , I am very grateful to him . &quot;
&quot; when I read his name for the first time at his Bür@@ ot@@ door , I got it with fear ; it was a Muslim , a k@@ ak@@ ian name . &quot;
but he turned out to be a good man .
I am grateful to him that he was respect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than a month in hospital .
&quot; last February , I got threats . &quot;
&quot; they called me , wrote me - relatives , stran@@ gers , some completely unknown . &quot;
this was the beginning of a night@@ club .
my family was attended by neighb@@ ors and a couple of distant relatives .
the slow@@ ed me back to Che@@ chn@@ ya to prove that everything was a lie .
&quot; they asked as demands : some said to me , I must show it by going up without the streets of the streets . others wanted that I had not changed my family in Gro@@ sn@@ y , and I say that I had not changed my family that everything was only bad , and Photoshop . &quot;
I have Kör@@ b@@ chen@@ size C - what could I say in the TV ?
OC Media : how has your family tries to deal with this pressure ?
Sabrina : it is still hard for them .
some older people talked about my mother on the road .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; You have brought a mon@@ ster to the world , not only your family , but the whole Republic . &quot;
&quot; we cannot st@@ ir you because you are a p@@ ious woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot;
my mother was too much and she lay down a bar@@ ick around the neck .
luck@@ ily the neighb@@ ors came and saved them .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved into an apartment and a few hours later stood under the window a car with a dar@@ ken@@ ed window discs and a num@@ ber@@ n@@ schild with a 95 ft .
&quot; after the third time it was happened , I was clear that there was something la@@ zy . &quot;
my human rights @-@ friends over@@ check the num@@ ber@@ n@@ sch@@ ilder - it turned out that I was tr@@ acked .
OC Media : how did you fl@@ own ?
Sabrina : with the help of activists .
&quot; out of security , I will not give their names to them , but I will say that I remember them all ; they really have helped me . &quot;
&quot; with their help I left the country , but then it happened something un@@ belief . &quot;
I can still not understand how it could be .
just before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SI@@ M card to call my mother as soon as I had arrived .
&quot; I bought them , without regist@@ ering , without any ID , without anything . &quot;
I sh@@ aken my old SI@@ M card and cast them into the tr@@ ash .
arrived and check in the hotel .
the number was registered to a fore@@ igner .
I put the SI@@ M card into my mobile phone .
&quot; in the moment I wanted to call my mother per What@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you do not believe , you don &apos;t believe in security , just because you left the country ? &quot;
our people know what hotel you st@@ eck@@ ar . you even know your room number .
only to prove it to you : it is the number 115 .
can you imagine that ? !
this was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sabrina : only with my mother and sisters .
&quot; however , we do not talk about the sex equ@@ ation , but it is a tab@@ oo . &quot;
some traditional Cau@@ cas@@ ian elements I am still in me .
I also wish it to do this se@@ el@@ ic barrier can I do not overcome .
&quot; I always say that , as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt them . &quot;
&quot; when we ch@@ att@@ ing with camera , I really give me effort to look like the person from her past - so remember my male form . &quot;
but this is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Che@@ chn@@ ya ?
&quot; what do your friends , those who have stayed in ? &quot;
Sabrina : I submitted a report in Washington last week .
for the needed I need current information about the situation in Che@@ chn@@ ya .
I spoke to someone who took one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; he told that during the Ram@@ adan no people were arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could barely wait , and he made a new wave . &quot;
most likely they will be focused on family and relatives .
&quot; so I mean , they probably load the relatives before , they take care of the problem with the person concerned and at the end they demand a proof that the so @-@ called &apos; honor &quot; through blood recovery . &quot;
OC Media : are also still co@@ il men in these secrets ?
&quot; Sabrina : a friend of mine says , there would not be very many . &quot;
&quot; if , then , especially those who have no rich relatives or have been dropped from their relatives to put into the Kad@@ a@@ rows . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they will be arrested there so that one can present them later as terrorists . &quot;
&quot; say , should they be re@@ produced , you will show off their bodies on TV and claim them , they would have attacked any village or a military support point . &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; as if these people were not simply gone , but targeted , in order to be radic@@ ally . &quot;
OC Media : is this only a mut@@ ation or do you have a source for this information ?
Sabrina : I just quote someone who was in@@ im@@ pris@@ oned in the one and a half months .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard was grown .
there have been nothing new to them from them .
they have it simply taken .
&quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was even when these people were taken . &quot;
&quot; but until now , they were not presented as a band@@ its , there has been no reports . we suggest that such actions are quite possible . &quot;
why else could it not be allowed to shave these people ?
&quot; know if these per@@ sec@@ utions and du@@ ctions of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation , already in the past ? &quot;
Sabrina : I always carried my hair ever long .
in Che@@ chn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think so before 2003 I was already known in quite Gro@@ sn@@ y when I still lived there - and I never had problems .
in Ernst !
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 when the Sh@@ aria had been considered , I never had problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , then it was much safer than now . &quot;
&quot; Russia originally wanted to lead us to the &quot; &quot; civil@@ isation &quot; , &quot; finally sent us to the st@@ one@@ age . &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
&quot; Sabrina : my eyebrows were ge@@ ared , I had colored eyelashes , carried Tu@@ eb@@ je@@ ans and short Tops . &quot;
the security of the sh@@ aria has never happened to me only a hair .
&quot; in front of the Russian Theater in Gro@@ sn@@ y there was a place where every evening , especially at weekends , a whole group of people met me like me . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several ben@@ ches were standing , and the whole town knew that they knew why men , young people met there . &quot;
we have never been off@@ ended .
in the t@@ ari@@ ous language there is a re@@ charging : Khar@@ da ma Khar@@ da . that is called &quot; Sp@@ oon not about the mis@@ fortune of another .
you often says it often to children if people make themselves funny .
&quot; OC Media : so they just have their eyes closed before you , because they believed to be sick ? &quot;
Sabrina : yes .
&quot; they never dis@@ solved me , never pul@@ led and never be@@ aten . &quot;
OC Media : how long did these Gn@@ ome work ?
&quot; Sabrina : so long , to Kad@@ y@@ row entered the plan . &quot;
&quot; when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to speak on television about mor@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; he does not spoke about us by se , but pre@@ domin@@ antly about the behavior of women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , you could feel how people began to change in the city . &quot;
&quot; who was pra@@ ised , and taught you at once with Arg@@ w@@ ohn . &quot;
in the time I left Che@@ chn@@ ya .
&quot; but every time I came back home , I could feel how the situation in the Republic could be ste@@ arded . &quot;
OC Media : what activity do you now go to ?
Sabrina : I work as wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t forget much - 700 to 800 dollar per month in the USA are not much .
&quot; apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; currently , I am responsible for 15 Muslim women . &quot;
I commun@@ icates with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we organize te@@ e@@ ffs , mer@@ ging , I cou@@ ps them to hospital and help them to get dining cards . &quot;
I don &apos;t spend a long time .
I have discovered these people as I decre@@ ases .
I am Muslim and I want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a h@@ ij@@ ani ?
Sabrina : this is fool@@ ish@@ ly .
so the nature that has nothing to do with religion .
&quot; this is exactly the same as Ch@@ et@@ sch@@ enen , who want to rep@@ ent you with foam in front of the mouth , that there is no co@@ ils with them . &quot;
&quot; the Dag@@ est@@ ans have what the c@@ ardin@@ er have what , the Russi@@ ans have also what , in the whole planet there is it - but &quot; not in Che@@ chn@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; I come from there , so it is unpleasant to hear anyway . &quot;
I tre@@ ffe here as many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go into the mosque and during the Ram@@ adan - live with men together .
&quot; know many think about Tran@@ sid@@ ent@@ ity to men who love men , and they believe that you changes to sex , to make more intimate experiences . but this is a tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different types of sensation , to be exactly to be different kinds of life . &quot;
&quot; for me , it is the most important thing to feel myself in my own skin and not ash@@ amed for my body . &quot;
not if I have a partner or not .
I &apos;m sorry that I will be here personally but my last intimate relationship is now longer than one year ago .
and I am not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups war@@ n before an increase in self @-@ mor@@ den within the im@@ po@@ ver@@ ished Arab ancestors in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region is suffering from an un@@ usually high unemployment and poverty @-@ rate within the native Arab population .
since the last months there has been a strong increase from self @-@ mor@@ nings .
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
&quot; the self @-@ com@@ bust@@ ion of a man named J@@ ass@@ im Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August , the des@@ perate situation of Arab ancestors in Iran , which is characterised by poverty and unemployment . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had one child , he dwelt in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the south @-@ west of Iran . &quot;
&quot; he suffered under anxiety , depression , and he ash@@ amed for his own hel@@ pl@@ essness that can come up for his own family , as Ah@@ w@@ azi human rights groups , who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; one on YouTube shared video held the moments , after he had turned himself . &quot;
&quot; some people managed to clear the fl@@ ames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the valley of Tal@@ eg@@ h@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; according to local sources , the com@@ bust@@ ion were so strong that doctors could do nothing more . &quot;
he died short time later .
&quot; it was not the only su@@ icide that has been replaced in August within the Arab &quot; &quot; Ah@@ w@@ azi minority , and activists from place war@@ n that even more men could take life . &quot;
&quot; the Ah@@ w@@ azi Centre for Human Rights announces that this month some others - Ham@@ id Man@@ i@@ at , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - hang@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; their stories have one thing in common : there were all family @-@ do@@ ers who felt themselves because of the persecution of Iranian government , hel@@ pl@@ ess and in@@ able to feed their families and make a safe work . &quot;
&quot; Arabic Ah@@ w@@ azi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
&quot; the region , where most of those who live in Iran &apos;s Arab ancestors , was difficult by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult to engage in the native Arab population . &quot;
&quot; in front of a century the Arabic Ah@@ wa@@ z was a pre@@ domin@@ antly autonom@@ ous region in Iran , until the P@@ ahl@@ avi monarchy the power took over and 1925 large efforts to finish ethnic autonomy throughout Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the biggest in Iran &apos;s coming oil and gas fields , as well as some of the most productive and most valuable areas for the Iranian agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite this valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly and the native population does not get enough of this wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often victims of untreated diseases , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation . &quot;
the Iranian regime denied the Ah@@ w@@ azi Arabs systemat@@ ically jobs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry . &quot;
&quot; the government also built a wide variety of insulation , the waters of the Arab areas in the Persian areas where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and Gh@@ om lie . &quot;
these insulation have only led to mel@@ ted in the region through dr@@ y@@ ness and to destroy the local farming as well as the local food and palms @-@ industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ zi youth rose to 81 % .
&quot; NO@@ UR Moh@@ ammed P@@ ur , the Iranian General Manager for co@@ oper@@ atives , work and social welfare , that 5 % of the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is who finished a work that ended the primary school , 55 % an additional school and 45 % have a university degree . &quot;
systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit national resistance .
&quot; Kar@@ im Doh@@ imi , an Iranian Ah@@ w@@ azi human rights activ@@ ist with resident in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ial ethnic discrimination , &quot; to a &quot; high increase &quot; the number of self @-@ mor@@ als among the young Ah@@ w@@ azi men . &quot;
Doh@@ imi said that especially the unemployment has become worse . reason for this is a combination of a high number of in Ah@@ wa@@ z newly @-@ coming ethnic Persian and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the inclusion process :
&quot; since function@@ alities and institutions preferred not preferred Arab workers , the local Arab ancestors will have access to workers possibilities in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , which aims to destroy the spirit national resistance of young Arabs and force them to earn their lifestyle outside their homeland . &quot;
&quot; there are people who had to hide their pre@@ - and sur@@ names to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ w@@ azi , and thus shall not toler@@ ated the Arabic names in the workplace , because the inter@@ play of the Arab language or the Arabic clothes . &quot;
&quot; given the given circumstances that the Arab ancestors must carry , hit human rights activists alert , before the situation is explosive . &quot;
&quot; it remains to be seen , whether the world is aw@@ ake and aware of it . &quot;
the main reason for su@@ icide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and su@@ icide is avo@@ id@@ able .

&quot; why I do not identify with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ se@@ ctional doors . &quot;
detail of a photo . taken by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . published under CC@@ 0 Creative Commons License .
&quot; the following article is a revised version of the opinion , which was published by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the website Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as . the article was the subject of several discussions on which many different positions were expressed . &quot;
you can be read in the comments below the original text .
&quot; if I say that I am not a feminine , many women - especially white women who consider themselves as an inter@@ se@@ ctional femin@@ ists . &quot;
you wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put well thought scientific and social arguments against me why I should be femin@@ ist and why we all should be femin@@ ist * in general .
&quot; for example , women nowadays are still less money in spite of the same education as men . &quot;
&quot; that women still under strict observation stand , when it comes to what they can do with their body . &quot;
that violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
&quot; or that cultural and social standards are still ensuring that women sooner or later in various areas of life to a gl@@ owing ceiling , and that discrimination is still going through the many different countries and beliefs . &quot;
all of this is aware of me and well @-@ known .
I am convinced that I am double and thre@@ e@@ fold twice and thre@@ e@@ fold .
I am a black woman .
&quot; and yet , when I speak to skin colour , on rac@@ ism , on black and women , on black women from the Dias@@ pora , on black women in the LGB@@ TI@@ Q assembly or on black women from the Dias@@ pora ; when I have chosen , both in and outside the femin@@ ist movement , many white femin@@ ists settled and white inter@@ se@@ ctional femin@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; but they all agree that women - all women - together , &quot; to sing their voices and &apos; K@@ umb@@ aya , my lord &apos; to sing &apos; to achieve equality ( some ) of women . &quot;
&quot; but they do not want to talk about it , that in addition to sexual violence have an institutional form rac@@ ist motivated violence , which we are exposed to black women on two @-@ long way . &quot;
&quot; or , that black women and women of other eth@@ n@@ ies and future @-@ oriented less earn than white men and women . &quot;
&quot; that black girls and girls are often referred to as a white girl , due to obvious integration problems . &quot;
&quot; or that women in black spher@@ es and women with mig@@ r@@ ational background are exposed to a higher risk , domestic violence and violence in the partnership suffer from white women . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , I want to join all women , all the men and ever all people any skin color on the same rights ; on the other hand , I can not join me as a black woman , in whose center the white woman stands into consideration , in@@ just@@ ices in their mind that relate to the sex as well as the skin color of a person . &quot;
I am exhausted and I will no longer fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ oriented spher@@ es which has always rejected me and countless other black women .
&quot; So@@ jour@@ ner be@@ amed 18@@ 51 in their speech : &quot; &quot; I am not a woman ? &quot; and I also we@@ ig@@ ate myself to maintain an ideology , where the black woman is an out@@ patient and mar@@ gin@@ alized beings . &quot;
&quot; I we@@ ig@@ ate me group@@ ing me group@@ ings , which also absor@@ b for cultural ex@@ propri@@ ation of our customs and customs , to advance their eg@@ oc@@ ent@@ ric program . &quot;
&quot; I will no longer try to put white women the importance of excess of skin colour and gender . some of them will continue to face the importance of black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to ad@@ ore a better . &quot;
&quot; although the inter@@ se@@ ctional femin@@ ism was founded to give women different locations and can be seen from white femin@@ ism , is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in his name . &quot;
I draw it in front of me full and entirely of femin@@ ism that was launched for my dark skin and my status as a woman rather than me for a white @-@ femin@@ ist@@ ical para@@ dig@@ m which is so st@@ ub@@ born as a new phenomenon is celebrated .
now it is more important than ever before that we define black women to our own ideas and set us into the spher@@ es that are created by us for us .
&quot; Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afric@@ ana wom@@ anism : Re@@ claim@@ ing ourselves ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ oman@@ ism : how we can defend ourselves in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural , mental , physical , bodi@@ ly and even the spiritual elements can be wor@@ shipped . &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter@@ se@@ ctional femin@@ ists call immediately separ@@ at@@ ism and exclusion , after they have read these lines , please feel about the hyp@@ oc@@ ris@@ y and the contradictions of femin@@ ist movement which the black woman is affected . &quot;
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment I can stand black women and women from other cultures as I exist in this para@@ dig@@ m .
I will be recognized because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman as part of this para@@ dig@@ m .
&quot; I , a black woman , can inher@@ ited in an environment where my life has neither passed , nor ignored . &quot;
Pad@@ del@@ ing against pollution : the mission of a man to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations

&quot; the following article is the short@@ ened and processed version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; by Kur@@ tur@@ al . this article belongs to the series of # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # we@@ il@@ ich@@ ein@@ e@@ frau@@ ds ) , which reports about women in Paraguay . &quot;
most of the names have been changed to the protection of the affected people .
&quot; a polic@@ ik@@ om@@ ab@@ ar said Ada B@@ á@@ ez , that they had nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her Ex@@ partners who has become violent towards violent . &quot;
&quot; since the end of her relationship had a little time passed and the police said , their statement would be placed to the aspir@@ ations , but more could not be done . &quot;
&quot; as another wife Bal@@ bu@@ ena because of failure , we also used the akt@@ op@@ ener indication of Ada B@@ á@@ ez . &quot;
some days later the second woman passed their ad back .
to break the vic@@ ious circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; if women always refund a display , they generally do not receive support from the state . &quot;
&quot; in many cases the women are also financ@@ ially dependent on the men that they trem@@ bling . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who ad@@ mit to be victims of violence itself , at all in the pro@@ secution authorities . &quot;
&quot; In@@ sul@@ 1 bl@@ ows and extr@@ ic@@ en@@ 2 in@@ visibility , and a legal system that is not an imm@@ t@@ 3 Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , lack of conversion and statistics &quot;
&quot; it is hard to determine how many women are really mist@@ re@@ ated , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ lez , a social education institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various information and reports , but not even ans@@ at@@ ise the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
the figures available are however al@@ ar@@ ming .
&quot; in 2015 at the district of 2015 , 9@@ 600 indicators went to domestic violence through domestic violence . at 70 % of it , it was about violence against women . &quot;
86 % of the ads in the police came from women .
there were more than 5000 advertis@@ ements for domestic violence in peace @-@ layers . also here 86 % of the ads came from women .
&quot; in the ads said 40 % of women , that they were physically mist@@ aken , 55 % of women spoke of psych@@ ic failure . &quot;
but these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
&quot; according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen women &apos;s Minister Ana Ba@@ i@@ ardi are actually shown only a few of these crimes . &quot; &quot; on every woman who are re@@ im@@ bur@@ sed in Paraguay because of psych@@ ic failure , coming 9 women who do not do this . &quot;
&quot; for any woman who re@@ im@@ bur@@ sed because of physical failure , two women who do not do this , &quot; she explained at the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; since women &apos;s gen@@ ocide in Paraguay no own ray @-@ continu@@ ance , the pro@@ secution authorities cannot be adequ@@ ately documented , how many women are mur@@ dered every year from their current or former partners . &quot;
&quot; only until August 2016 , journalists have at least 12 cases of women &apos;s gen@@ ocide in the country . &quot;
the coordin@@ ator of Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were mur@@ dered by their current or former partners .
after their estimates dies in Paraguay every ten days a woman due to violence by men .

invisible failure and a legal system that takes nothing
&quot; before Mariana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z the fixed girlfriend of Carlos Vera was , he ins@@ isted that she called his name of all their former friends . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning she did not want this , but then after . this should always be rep@@ ent for ever . &quot;
&quot; today , Mariana 28 years old and no more with Carlos together . but two years ago she carried the mental violence on the one hand - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most serious recogn@@ izable : &quot;
I have never thought that I would once become victims of failure .
&quot; when I read about it earlier , I always thought that the only women happens to sub@@ mis@@ erable because they can f@@ ool from violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that never would happen that .
Mariana took social media in order to report on the failure of Carlos Vera .
&quot; without name , she wrote contributions on Facebook in which she described its ins@@ ults and different attacks during their two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated them . &quot;
&quot; many people answer@@ ing their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rh@@ etor@@ ic whether he ever raised the hand against it , and we@@ aken himself that his behaviour was also a form of failure . &quot;
&quot; other Facebook users asked Mariana , why they had fallen so long by Carlos and did not left him earlier . &quot;
it seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of failure at least had a certain blame for this .
&quot; Victoria Santos , which was not from Paraguay , fought for nearly eight years with the authorities in Paraguay , to prove that their former partners she was mist@@ re@@ acted . &quot;
&quot; Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o te Cre@@ o ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) , which consists of women who are all in any way victims of failure . &quot;
&quot; in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other . &quot;
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vic@@ tor@@ so case everything started with psych@@ ic failure .
&quot; finally , your prosper@@ ous partner took it even to per@@ su@@ ade them that she was worth@@ less . &quot;
then he began to beat them .
Vic@@ tor@@ ias ads in the authorities remained without a result and also of their relatives , she received no support . &quot;
&quot; she led a trial against their former partners who developed into a ground@@ able legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country , in which it mainly went around money , power and the influence of their former partner . &quot;
Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach to lack of conversion
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good , but not being applied . &quot;
&quot; the ad of failure is a way full of resist@@ ors , and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; says Victoria Santos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN Organization for Women in Paraguay , looks also great problems in the application of the laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , was discussed in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Parliament , who was discussed under the h@@ as@@ ht@@ ag # Por@@ mo@@ las ( # Für@@ th ) . &quot;
this h@@ as@@ ht@@ ag and movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # non @-@ entries ) are part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by Am@@ nest@@ y International .
&quot; the original design of the law sees before , Fem@@ icide to a peculi@@ ar off@@ ence to explain and t@@ oug@@ her to pun@@ ish as it is already in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia . &quot;
&quot; so the legislative text was changed in some points , in order to win the MP@@ s for the law who are fe@@ ared that the way for the de@@ crimin@@ alisation of ab@@ ortion , which is currently prohibited in Paraguay basically and can be pun@@ ished with up to five years o@@ ats . &quot;
&quot; the original bill was planned , most of the ( bureaucrat@@ ic and economic ) travel costs that have to carry out the victims of violence in the present themselves , if they just want to re@@ invest and provide a secure accommodation to place the state . &quot;
&quot; Ech@@ au@@ ri argu@@ ed that the law is not effective , if the bill is not sufficient financial means at your disposal : &quot;
in Paraguay there is mist@@ aken as part of the human relationships .
&quot; here , a circumst@@ ance must take place , so that violence is no longer considered to be normal . &quot;
&quot; if in light of these facts , he is in@@ no@@ cent , and contributes to that the perpet@@ rators come down . &quot;
we have to refund a long display until failure no longer apply as normal .
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ic Senate . previously , parts of the law have been changed . there was also a passage that caused the partners in cases of domestic violence against reconciliation . &quot;
the opinions on the changes are apart .
the section concerning reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for ag@@ gress@@ or his sacrifice again .
&quot; the string of words &quot; gender &quot; , &quot; political force &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law is considered a great set@@ back . &quot;

independent media in Oman a year to ban a newspaper continues to attack attacks
&quot; this website was blocked because of a resolution of the information of information , &quot; &quot; is located on the homepage of the forbidden newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
more than one year ago the om@@ anic authorities have joined the independent Arab newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of its coverage over corruption in the sult@@ ant .
&quot; You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the re@@ porters of the newspaper , is still in prison , where he is co @-@ year prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and submitted before judgment , but later they came back free . &quot;
&quot; Oman is ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us ib@@ n Sa@@ id , who came to power since he had brought his father , Sa@@ id ib@@ n T@@ aim@@ ur , by a state . &quot;
&quot; since then he d@@ ressed in addition to his role as the only Sultan , the most important minist@@ ries in the country : Prime Minister , Defence Minister , Foreign Affairs , Chairman of the Supreme Council for planning and President of the Central Bank . &quot;
&quot; the rule of the sult@@ ans is characterized by the per@@ sever@@ ance efforts of security forces , in particular of domestic violence , including freedom of freedom , including freedom of freedom , Blog@@ ger and other activists , r@@ ushing and other activists . &quot;
&quot; the authorities re@@ strict peaceful and legitim@@ ate activities in the field of human rights systemat@@ ically and hin@@ ders citizens , also activists , to express their views on public affairs of the country like corruption in authorities and institutions as well as offline freely . &quot;
the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure , and the im@@ prison@@ ment three of their speakers last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country . &quot;
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper which has been reported in Oman since its founding in 2007 about corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was forbidden by the authorities in August 2016 .
&quot; on 28 July 2016 Security Policy I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i , editor @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , feast , after in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 an article was published by the title &quot; high @-@ ranking parties to the hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary and the inter@@ ference of high @-@ level officials in judi@@ cial decisions . &quot;

&quot; on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i was arrested , member of the Executive Committee , from the ISS at the Special department and taken on its arrival by the security forces . &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2016 , the ISS participated in the dep@@ uty chief editor @-@ in @-@ chief You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who acts to Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is Fest@@ ass@@ ment as a editor @-@ in @-@ chief . &quot;
&quot; the newspaper was closed at in@@ definite period after the information given statement , that &quot; the publication and spread of the newspaper on any way , including online , starting from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 26 September 2016 the first trial in Mas@@ kat was the first negoti@@ ation in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i . &quot;
the court condemned the three journalists to pris@@ ons and furthermore the final closure of the newspaper .
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i and Al @-@ Ha@@ j , both among other things were condemned by inter@@ rupt the public order , &quot; abuse of the internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ taken of the state of the state . &quot; &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was found in addition to the infr@@ ing@@ ement of an audience and the promise of in@@ no@@ cent .
al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sent@@ enced to three year @-@ year prison quarters and fin@@ es in the amount of 3000 om@@ anic r@@ ial ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) .
al @-@ Abr@@ i was sent@@ enced to a year prison and a money penalty in the amount of 1000 R@@ ial ( 2600 US dollar ) after having the use of an information system for the spread of material that could be a threat to public order .
for Al @-@ Abr@@ i was arrested a deposit of 5000 om@@ anic r@@ ial ( 13 000 US dollars ) and he was already announced on 22 August 2016 before the jud@@ gement of the prison .
&quot; the Court Court said Al @-@ Abr@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , condemned Al @-@ Ha@@ j however to a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i to six months of prison . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i was released on 10 April 2017 by Verb@@ ier of his sixteen prison sentence in Mas@@ kat . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison where he is able to make his one year @-@ year sentence .
the Court Court also raised the decision of the information officer to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; despite the decision of the Court , Az@@ am@@ n , the newspaper sees itself as exposed to attacks by the Iranian government . &quot;
&quot; on 8 January the information of the information given a directive , with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the information on 8 May 2017 signed an additional statement in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , and with the Minister for the decision of the decision to make the publication of the newspaper again . &quot;
the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which in Oman re@@ juven@@ ated time the press freedom was viol@@ ated .
&quot; further violations may include the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country . &quot;
&quot; due to the permanent closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the im@@ prison@@ ment of the journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j arises , the impression that the om@@ anic authorities are still not ready to prepare the extensive injury to the press freedom . &quot;
&quot; the Golf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the Iranian authorities : &quot;
1 . You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and unconditional release .
2. a secure environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n to create their journalists in their work ;
3. to protect freedom of the press in the country and
&quot; 4 . in all circumstances to ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman their legal human rights work di@@ so@@ aked and without fear of re@@ pris@@ als , including judi@@ cial chic@@ ane . &quot;
&quot; the Golf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization , the human rights def@@ enders ( also independent journalists , Blog@@ ger , Law@@ yers etc . ) in the Golf region and in neighboring countries by promoting the opinion and associations and the right to gather peaceful , supported and provide them protection . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia
medical research in Africa is rarely used in the media or not even mentioned . this is an increasing area that is addressed by the most pressing needs of the continent .
&quot; for the need for the need for medical research there are two reasons : for a lack of global health care , many medicines and vaccines that cover the special medical need on the African continent . &quot;
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis and mal@@ aria have in the poo@@ rest countries of Africa far engra@@ ved effects than elsewhere , and lack of investment for the research of these diseases being a major problem . &quot;
&quot; secondly , research that is carried out by African scientists , when building its own research capacity in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be con@@ duc@@ ive to the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is director of the headquarters in the Centre for the research of infectious diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR@@ Z ) . &quot;
&quot; he grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epide@@ mic first engra@@ ved effects on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Zambia for a study in the United States , first in Louis@@ iana , later in Indiana . &quot;
&quot; as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania research@@ ed himself on HIV virus , before he decided to go back home to support the s@@ amb@@ ian healthcare system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media on these research . &quot;
Disclaimer : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work on the application of research results . I support the s@@ amb@@ ian national programme for anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy ( ART ) with laboratories .
&quot; furthermore , I just spent a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant pathogen@@ s . &quot;
GV : what do you think are the important current scientist in your country and generally in Africa ?
how do they distinguish themselves from those in Western countries ?
RW : there are no basic research . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
&quot; this must change , otherwise we will always remain rece@@ i@@ vers instead of being myself . &quot;
&quot; the solutions we get , are often used in our surroundings and sometimes it is even impossible to use it here . &quot;
GV : where is financing and support ?
is she adequate ?
how simple or difficult is to find appropriate scientists to the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are well supported .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who come back or want to draw here , for funding and developers are better in other countries . &quot;
GV : how is the research @-@ infrastructure ?
which obstacles are there in your routine research work which you did not have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not correspond to the standards in developed countries . it will cost a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet . &quot;
&quot; laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries . &quot;
GV : how is the opinion of the public of science and scientists in Africa ?
&quot; RW : there are already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods . &quot;
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; GV : how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus and how can we support development ? &quot;
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
&quot; there is need for special scientific training , starting at any age . &quot;
&quot; social sciences , computer science , big data , study of space , health care ( not transfer@@ able and cont@@ ag@@ ious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it . &quot;
&quot; GV : can you describe us the pro@@ s and cons of life as scientists in Africa over Western countries , based on your experience ? &quot;
&quot; RW : often it is the limited speed , things to do , and the final access to scientific expertise that represent here challenges . &quot;
&quot; the system that magazines can only be made accessible to payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limited the amount of availability information and speed of research . &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; Open Source &quot; -@@ Se@@ at@@ gut@@ ters change worldwide food production
&quot; this article published by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports on solutions for environmental issues worldwide . &quot;
Frank Mort@@ on bre@@ eders Frank Mort@@ on for the 1980s in the USA salad .
&quot; his company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ ding , the first plant that has grown by NASA @-@ A@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space . &quot;
&quot; for nearly 20 years , Mort@@ ons was conducted only through its own enclosure and the question of how many sal@@ ats@@ ink he can get limits . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he noted that more and more salads were pat@@ ented and that he could no longer use it for breeding . &quot;
&quot; the patents g@@ ars not only for single varieties , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , a special rot@@ ary or green leaves , or curved sheets . &quot;
&quot; over the last few years , more of these patents have been registered for more and more plants such as corn and cart@@ oons . because of this trends , plant @-@ care , environmental protection and experts in food security for the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; however , as a passionate representative of a mill@@ enn@@ ia ancient tradition bre@@ eders Mort@@ on still salad , he needs to last longer because his work is more and more and more and more . &quot;
it &apos;s as would lie in a river a b@@ oul@@ ders to which I have to her@@ nia .
&quot; so we have to do this now , but it is a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; says he . &quot; I think that these patents go to Sal@@ ads too far . &quot;
&quot; and when they hold court , no one can breed more a new sal@@ aries because all the features are pat@@ ented , so good as possible and tried to breed those characteristics that he wants . &quot;
&quot; however , it is very careful and stri@@ ving to use no material that is being protected as intellectual property . &quot;
he also joined a movement which is getting bigger in the US and everywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; Bre@@ eding ) . &quot;
&quot; ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts of the International craft ISS have bre@@ d red Romans in the &quot; &quot; greenhouse &quot; &quot; of the station and eaten . there is tested whether plants can be cultivated in space . &quot;

&quot; it is not a co@@ incidence that this name sounds rather than it would come from the IT area , and not from the field of plant breeding . &quot;
&quot; the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; Open @-@ Source &quot; &quot; Sa@@ at@@ gut ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software . &quot;
it has been called into life to ensure that some types of plant and genes is not being protected as intellectual property and so for plant@@ ations durable .
&quot; as part of the initiative , shortly O@@ ssi , U.S. bre@@ eders can commit themselves that others can use them by them . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed , and they can sell it . &quot; open source &quot; bre@@ eders allow only others to breed this own varieties , and it is not immediately b@@ anned - two aspects that are forbidden by many plant pat@@ ios or prescribed . &quot;
do@@ z@@ ens bre@@ eders and seed companies have already joined the initiative for their start in 2014 .
glo@@ omy prospects
&quot; for the emer@@ itus professor of the University of Wisconsin @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ ssi @-@ board member of Jack Kl@@ op@@ pen@@ burg are control over the seed , and the possibility to breed new plants , both important for food security and environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; Sa@@ at@@ gut also plays a role in larger contex@@ ts like bio@@ diversity , rights of farmers , control over the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eders would try to breed the latter not or only little by playing seed with natural resistance . &quot;
Kl@@ op@@ pen@@ burg emphas@@ ises that the &quot; Open @-@ Source &quot; movement is not busy with gen@@ etically modified plants .
&quot; all kinds of plants could be pat@@ ented whether vegetables , Kor@@ n , gent@@ e@@ chn@@ isch changes or not . &quot; to buy our goal in the global agricultural industry , it &apos;s good , locally and sustainable produ@@ ction@@ ions in the global agr@@ arian industry , it should also know that the way is bre@@ d for example , such as this vegetables are bre@@ d , threatened . &quot;
dietary sou@@ venirs without seed re@@ membran@@ ce is not possible . &quot;
&quot; the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed initiative committed to others their seeds . in contrast , her approach is to be pat@@ ented in contrast to seeds . &quot;

O@@ ssi @-@ Sup@@ porters ar@@ gues that the future of food supplies is at risk because the available gene pool due to the ever more numerous intellectual property rights on plant material which is thus always available and un@@ restricted .
&quot; Claire Lu@@ by , executive director of O@@ ssi , has dedicated himself in her doct@@ oral thesis with gen@@ et@@ ical variation of car@@ rots and their availability . it found that about one third of all Kart@@ ott@@ en@@ characteristics as intellectual property is protected , making it used for spra@@ yers either not or less . &quot;
&quot; for other plants there is no estimates not yet , but experts like Lu@@ by susp@@ ect that mass@@ aging plants such as wheat in still larger style are pat@@ ented as salad or car@@ rots . &quot;
a question of view
&quot; plants are so bre@@ d that they have targeted characteristics - from such , through which their taste or colour improved up to such , due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments or threats such as p@@ ests or diseases . &quot;
&quot; the opponents of Pat@@ ents on nuclear plants point out that the available plant material for bre@@ eders have decre@@ ases for bre@@ eders by more and more patents . genetic diversity is currently necessary than ever before , since the changed conditions due to climate change is much worse pre@@ dict@@ able . &quot;
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ spokes@@ person Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ uto an that genetic diversity is generally important and also critical for Mon@@ s@@ ant@@ os activities . with a total of four Gen@@ b@@ anks and cooperation with institutions such as the country estate . the United States has set itself the company for the preservation of genetic diversity . &quot;
&quot; however , it refers to that intellectual property other bre@@ eders to promote &quot; &quot; patents and the protection of plant var@@ iet@@ s innovations . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent is exp@@ ired . &quot;
often these instructions help others to come with another method to the same result .
&quot; such protection does not cause innovations not , but promotes it by giving the public more material and know @-@ how . &quot;
Mort@@ on looks different : 20 years to wait until a patent loop , surely do not have innovations . &quot;
&quot; and if you are waiting to wait for such a long time , to breed plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , one could have lost the battle . &quot;
&quot; however , the main argument for Mort@@ on is that genetic resources have always been a general good and would continue to remain : &quot; independent plant bre@@ eders have neither the time nor money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ et@@ ical incentives for us are not attractive to us . &quot;
we want farmers to make your work easier .
&quot; this is what keeps us going , and it will be impossible for us if we do not continue to use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot;
&quot; in total , Mort@@ on is meant to pat@@ ented on the concept to pat@@ tern@@ ess : &quot; we create the characteristics not really self . &quot;
the plants constitute it themselves and as a bre@@ eder we do not have any cl@@ ue as the plants do that .
a secret of nature . &quot;
&quot; for Carol Dep@@ pe , plant@@ ations in the US @-@ state Oregon and O@@ ssi @-@ board members , there is another important aspect of the plant breeding : &quot; who@@ ever breed a sor@@ rows , and also bre@@ d his own values into it . &quot;
&quot; who believes in industrial agriculture with great cour@@ ty@@ ards and mon@@ oc@@ ultur@@ as , for their cultivation of mass@@ aging her@@ bic@@ ide , bre@@ eds in its varieties of this concept of agriculture . &quot;
&quot; my concept is accurate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that are moving forward to international markets , but smaller than e.g. Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents have to survive the most smaller seeds - either reject the patent or keep it for too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both is the case . &quot;
the independent plant @-@ based Frank Mort@@ on is looking for salads in his breeding garden Sal@@ ads .

&quot; Mort@@ on is also the view that bre@@ eders due to the A@@ void of plant pat@@ rons of innovative would : &quot; it looks like I am with my efforts to produce new , stronger than companies that pat@@ ented . &quot;
&quot; I need to constantly sell new material for my catalog , since I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a few years ago , &quot; says he . &quot; &quot; with a patent is 20 years ahead of competition , with what you think it is very simple . &quot; worldwide reson@@ ance &quot;
&quot; although the US seem to be leader in the &quot; open source &quot; breeding , the concept is spreading , but quickly around the world . &quot;
&quot; in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , a &quot; open source program . &quot;
it also supports them to come to &quot; Open Source &quot; -@@ Sa@@ at@@ gut to sell and to sell their own .
&quot; the German Organisation Agre@@ co@@ l works on an &quot; open source &quot; license , which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of O@@ ssi @-@ obligation for bre@@ eders in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; ( regulations for bre@@ eders differ from country to country , one because of the O@@ ssi commitment is not easy to become one in Europe or other parts of the world . ) &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of November 2016 the Ex@@ ek@@ ut@@ ive of the European Union , the European Commission , declar@@ es that conventional plants would not be pat@@ ern@@ ible . thus , she speaks to the current practice of the European Patent At@@ tor@@ ch which is allowed to breed patents on conventional plants . &quot;
&quot; however , an explanation is not yet a law ; now it is in the governments of the Member States to bring the patent to the patent . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 the Dutch organisation H@@ iv@@ os organized a conference to &quot; Open Source &quot; -@@ Se@@ at@@ gut@@ ters and representatives from across East @-@ Africa to find something about the &quot; open source &quot; -@@ seed movement and the global trend towards the patent@@ ing of seeds . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for &quot; open source &quot; programme for &quot; open source &quot; -@@ seed systems explains that the organisation is currently an worldwide alliance for &quot; Open Source &quot; -@@ Sa@@ at@@ gut@@ ters , for the scheduled next year of official start@@ ups . &quot;
&quot; including H@@ iv@@ os , the international non@@ profit development organisation US@@ C Canada and the Action Group to er@@ osion , technology and concentration - Action Group on Ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database to seeds and biodiversity globally to publish a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global alliance for the Future of Food , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - a report published that farmers have to come to seed , to cope with them and to ensure a stable supply of food safety . &quot;
&quot; in the report also emphas@@ ises the importance of a diverse , local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection between the Lu@@ by of O@@ ssi hopes that soon see him more people . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological food is mainly respected , where and how something is grown , and Sa@@ at@@ gut@@ ters have hardly played a role , so Lu@@ by . &quot; we are trying to clear the people clear that even more behind their food . &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest objectives of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in Egypt
still un@@ lock the Egyptian authorities content on the Internet .
this time we met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ists .
&quot; on the weekend by the 05.@@ August the Egyptian Government has documented the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which is documented human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world . &quot;
&quot; August , the network published a statement on Facebook , in which the Egyptian authorities critic@@ ised this step shar@@ ply and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information aims - despite this attack and the constitution of the Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities who want to defend freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , so it has never been so important to overcome these objectives and not to ad@@ mit any voice in this part of the world . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first z@@ ens@@ ored website of a human rights organization in Egypt , after the authorities block the independent news page MA@@ DA Mas@@ r , Arabic @-@ language output of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , and the Qatar &apos;s network of Al Ja@@ ze@@ era due to alle@@ ged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of the wave of the web@@ pages . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language https : / / t@@ .c@@ o / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
&quot; besides AN@@ HR@@ I , there is no access to the blog of colum@@ n@@ ists and human rights research@@ es Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada , no access to Egypt . &quot;
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the spread of colum@@ n@@ ists and articles that he is not written for in Egypt and media .
&quot; now the blog , which he set up in order to deal with the fier@@ y apparatus of the Egyptian government , even the aim of an attack . &quot;
&quot; Blog@@ ger , the provider who is home to Zi@@ adas blog is native , but on the other hand is further accessible . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ - spent nearly 500 days in captivity , when he was arrested in December 2013 by Egyptian security vulner@@ abilities and a video recorded as the police of physical violence against two students . &quot;
his articles are mainly about politics and human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada expressed itself into the block@@ ing by the government and reflected what this means for him : &quot;
&quot; however , blogs to sper@@ ren is very old , however in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi priority ; and even if the block@@ age of blogs may not be significant for the world , it is for two reasons for me : &quot;
&quot; 1 ) It has succeeded to convey to me the feeling of a popularity ; an im@@ prison@@ ment , a ver@@ ified murder , un@@ loading of the national security Council , the block@@ ing blogs as well as any other website , for which I worked . &quot;
&quot; 2 ) You have proven that I have not written in vain . in other words , my words have influence , if only on a small audience . &quot;
I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it to post items in order to handle the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship .
&quot; however , after they have blocked him and that they have fear of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the mut@@ ations walk the way up to the end .
&quot; according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06 August 133 websites . this erg@@ ents technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provider ( ISP ) , including Orange , V@@ od@@ af@@ one and Et@@ is@@ al@@ at . &quot;
&quot; AF@@ TE documented the block@@ ing of vend@@ ors , which was possible by the envelop@@ e of room and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( VP@@ N@@ s ) &quot;
AF@@ TE reported in their research :
&quot; on Monday , 12 June we noticed how the block@@ ing of websites , the VP@@ N@@ s began . &quot;
&quot; such a practice indicates the intention of the government to block content and to filter , to have access to the Egyptian users . &quot;
&quot; the situation is in addition to the fact that the Cypri@@ ot conditions are made behind closed doors , making the Egyptian population does not have a legal basis , helping them to go to trial against these actions . &quot;
&quot; now , the question : how far is the Egyptian government willing to go with the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and who will attack them next ? &quot;
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants dispute .

&quot; day for day papers newspapers across Brazil with dark head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city of the country and home from numerous post@@ cards . &quot;
some of these lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old in schools &quot; &quot; E@@ ach second day is mur@@ dered by a police force in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; Die@@ be gr@@ ated Ph@@ armacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , Marine and Luf@@ tw@@ af@@ ee to Rio . &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in a t@@ ense financial situation achieved its weight @-@ in 2017 in Rio the highest level for 10 years .
&quot; Brazilian non @-@ governmental organization Global Justice called even the United Nations , single @-@ mature . &quot;
reports like these are all daily and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least the managers of a locom@@ otive newspaper .
&quot; for the detailed reporting of violence in Rio known newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; on 16 August the Editorial &quot; This is not normal &quot; in which they announced , a new section called &quot; War in Rio &quot; . &quot; &quot;
all reports on violence in the city will now be published there .
the mot@@ ives for their decision explained the newspaper as follows :
&quot; extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world like murder , smo@@ b , sex crimes , etc . everything that happens from civil@@ ized standard and what only happened in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call , this is not normal ! &quot;
&quot; this is the only alternative , so that we do not close our eyes before the cru@@ el@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; in a four @-@ minute video that was divided on Facebook , Oct@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper that this decision is no reason for pride , but rather a sign of failure : &quot;
extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war bri@@ bri@@ k in a country that not recogn@@ izes the war at all .
&quot; in the same video , a journalist of the newspaper explains that it provides details of the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 8@@ 43 areas that are controlled by crimin@@ als . &quot;
in the Editorial the newspaper writes on :
&quot; conscious that a war discre@@ p@@ urs if he is dist@@ orted , even in addition to the police , which only sho@@ ots and then ask questions . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose goal is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Maf@@ ia and its partners . &quot;
would the name &quot; war &quot; more than it be useful ?
&quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Bras@@ il argu@@ ed the Journ@@ alist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ ve@@ ira , the violence as &quot; war &quot; . &quot; &quot;
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and worse planning - like extra at the analysis of milit@@ ants in Rio itself - in combination with in@@ sufficient investment in personnel , education and a historical and self @-@ pleas@@ ing negle@@ ct of the public service . &quot;
to remember : the State of Rio de Janeiro is greater than its capital .

Rio de Janeiro as the &quot; violent place in Brazil &quot; is wrong : &quot; 22 of the 30 violent cities in Brazil are obvious to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country . these are the latest data available .
none of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; if we look at the mo@@ unts a state of state , Rio is on No. 16 , &quot; writes them . &quot;
&quot; extra belongs to the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company South America , which is st@@ resses such as Cec@@ í@@ lia , for years the security policy of the State . &quot;
&quot; among these vulner@@ able measures , the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Un@@ id@@ ade Pac@@ ific@@ ad@@ ora ) , is one of the federal state of Rio in the year 2003 @-@ created police unit , whose aim is to conquer a Fav@@ ela established by using a massive police authorities and an unit lasting there . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , this actually led to an extra@@ ction of violent deaths . for several years , the U@@ PP had actually protect against the poor communities who should protect the newly created police unit , increasingly under feeding . &quot;
&quot; on his Facebook page the journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Charle@@ aux out of one of his articles from the year 2010 , in which he explains why the violence in Rio cannot be determined by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war &quot; . &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; besides legal issues , the classification of the situation draws in Rio as a war too serious consequences for people . &quot;
&quot; for this calls upon the state to the means to use and ways that are typical of a war . in addition , the penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; where a civil is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and to the object for &quot; &quot; Kol@@ lat@@ er@@ al@@ damage &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; dist@@ orted balls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; war or her , F@@ act is that the inhabitants of Fav@@ our@@ as in Rio continues to suffer . &quot;
&quot; a week it is now that the police declared the mountain with Fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho , in order to lau@@ gh the death of a polic@@ eman . &quot;

&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war many Syrian cities suffer from brutal sie@@ ge and block@@ ades , mainly through the Assad regime towards loyal troops . &quot;
&quot; according to Victory Watch , a joint initiative of the Peace organisation PA@@ X and the Forschungs@@ inst@@ itut The Syria Institute , are located in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , De@@ ir E@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ lib currently around a million Syri@@ ans in a state of Bel@@ ag@@ ulation . &quot;
&quot; most heavily affected is the East Gh@@ out@@ a , where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition assume the basis of investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the mass@@ ac@@ re of Assad has been pract@@ ised . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 these are linked by reb@@ els controlled areas outside of Damascus , which led to the inhabitants of local frequently asked or dependent through tunn@@ els and check@@ points . &quot;
&quot; due to the years block@@ age , traditional foods such as meat can be un@@ att@@ ain@@ able for large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; as a counter@@ part of a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and academ@@ ics , the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , as they can create their own mushrooms as &quot; life @-@ saving food source &quot; . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ ad@@ da and perform the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms are not part of the conventional ones in Syria and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine . its food makes them at an attractive food source for many residents of the besie@@ ged East Gh@@ out@@ a .
&quot; the Direct project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P : &quot;
&quot; we chose the cultivation of fung@@ i , because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ahmed Le@@ ila , one of the organizers , reported Global Vo@@ ices that has been fought for three years , this project has been known and expressed its relief that it gains more and more &quot; &quot; famili@@ arity &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to collect money for the initiative , use in consultation with the NGO Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ as the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do . &quot;
&quot; it is planned to convey 125 families knowledge about plant@@ ing mushrooms , so Dr. Le@@ ila to Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the Constitution of this article they have reached over 100 % of their expected target from around 12.@@ 700 € , but until Monday , den 04 . September 2017 , continue to donations to Can@@ Do . &quot;
the initiative is dependent on generators that the temperature is stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
fuel consumption are used locally made of plastic materials to supply the generators with the necessary energy .
&quot; Dr. Le@@ ila said Global Vo@@ ices , that they started with the &quot; production from the regions of the Pil@@ z@@ seed , &quot; before they are taking their quality inspe@@ cted and whether they are suitable for eating . &quot;
then they set a small mushroom court in a tub . when this succeeded in which they used a greater tub . and so on .
&quot; now they have created a &quot; &quot; text@@ book for the region . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months they have been distributed mushrooms throughout the East Gh@@ out@@ a .
Dr. Le@@ ila explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want the people to embrace the mushroom @-@ breeding of various reasons &quot; &quot; fra@@ ction of Bel@@ ag@@ ulation . &quot;
providing a new food source on the market .
&quot; spread a culture of self @-@ suffic@@ iency by eating remains ( like paper , tea , coffee , cardboard , etc ) for the extra@@ ction of new foods . &quot;
&quot; creating new jobs , especially for women who work home . &quot;
creating new jobs for people with disabilities that are bound to their home .
&quot; he said , &quot; We hope to spread this idea in all over the world , so our success as well as our fight against hunger and the ventilation will be visible . &quot;
we want our experience to be inspired in crisis areas and we can help humanity .

Portugal &apos;s demand for the victims of bre@@ eders of 2017

bre@@ eders have also registered in the Gal@@ iz@@ ien region in Spain where there were 4 dead .
it is estimated that there was more than 500 fire@@ fighters to spread themselves in the northern and central regions of the country and around 250 million acres of forest and numerous villages .
&quot; in June , in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande a similar tragedy , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 verses . &quot;
&quot; according to the European form@@ ant surveillance system , which monitors the forest surfaces by satellite tracks , are burned alone 2017 in Portugal about 500,000 acres of forest burned - an area of the size of the district Lisbon . &quot;

in a night in autumn 1994 the conquest of Afghanistan started by the Tal@@ ib@@ an .
two years ago was a terrible civil war between the various Mu@@ ja@@ he@@ din group@@ ings had broken down the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . so Afghanistan had become a country of terror and desp@@ air .
&quot; at this time A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , which belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central Afgh@@ an , for the last time with his family at dinner . &quot;
&quot; even if his mother was not so said then , so she knew that she would not see her son a long time - maybe even more . &quot;
in the morning the boy was to break .
&quot; his un@@ cle would bring him off , and bring him to the ve@@ ils . &quot;

&quot; Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of Haz@@ ara domin@@ ate Party He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat was just killed by the Tal@@ ib@@ an and many Haz@@ ara felt a sud@@ den . &quot;
the talents for their hat@@ red on the Haz@@ ara famous Tal@@ ib@@ an came closer .
&quot; many Haz@@ ara have left the country toward Pakistan or Iran . &quot;
some days after his flight took place in Pakistan again .
a few years he worked in a coh@@ er@@ ru@@ b . the work was heavy and made him ill .
&quot; then he took what was left from his low wage , and went to Iran . once again he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and tow@@ ed sacks with mort@@ ar , which were severe than he himself , in order to earn his living . &quot;
at that time the life of af@@ gh@@ anic refugees in Iran was shaped by mis@@ ery and exploitation .
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; I remembered A@@ shar@@ af in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( af@@ gh@@ anic refugees ) lived in an empty building on the site , where we also worked . &quot;
there was no service provided there and no heating . we hanging n@@ ylon in front of the open windows that we could not refres@@ hed at night .
&quot; after four years , A@@ shar@@ per has left his life without papers in Iran , and made himself ready for the journey to Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the dangerous stop on the sea , he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and stran@@ ded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island . &quot;
&quot; after the Greek authorities had rejected its asylum , A@@ shar@@ af 2002 came to Italy . &quot;
&quot; some time was A@@ shar@@ af ob@@ hom@@ eless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed twice a day eating for need@@ y . &quot;
&quot; true that Italy is a kind of second chance for exp@@ elled asylum seek@@ ers . it is true also that the conditions , the asylum seek@@ ers in the country can be found , cat@@ astroph@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; the Human Rights Organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system &quot; suff@@ ers under a general lack of transparency . &quot;
the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers will be accommod@@ ated in the more than 3000 &quot; special elev@@ ating centres . &quot; they are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared staff . &quot;
&quot; according to Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be assigned to an entry center if they have officially put an application on asylum - which can go on after the registration of asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; until then , people who have no money for an accommodation , either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street . &quot;
so mer@@ ing it also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his ignor@@ ant lifestyle helped A@@ shar@@ af to get rid of them soon out of these conditions .
&quot; after spending several years of work in the construction sector , A@@ shar@@ f had its total savings in the establishment of a youth hostels in Venice . &quot;
this was so good that he opened a second hostel for a while .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ at@@ is &apos;s success story is now subject to the documentation &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - an Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director of the director of A@@ min . &quot;
&quot; the film was given in 2017 the Venice City Award , which has been awarded for the 24th time . &quot;

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Ital@@ ians - are very difficult .
&quot; much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just a few of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to un@@ official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
for many of them the country is a trans@@ it@@ ional solution on the way to other European countries .
&quot; during the last few years some of Afgh@@ ans work companies , including tail@@ oring , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some af@@ gh@@ an restaurants were even found in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice Ham@@ ed Ah@@ m@@ adi had the idea to his restaurant Orient Experience in which the wa@@ iter and the kitchen staff largely out of different parts of the world .
&quot; the carte menu is told by the various af@@ gh@@ an , Ira@@ qi , Turkish and Greek dishes the history of their journey to Italy . &quot;
the Afgh@@ an entre@@ pren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Padua the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Pizzeria Kab@@ ul@@ og@@ na in Bologna and a Sus@@ hi Restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
&quot; however , A@@ shar@@ af@@ s aims to be far beyond the Italian food industry and retail out and aims to leave back to the country which he had to for@@ sp@@ ind@@ ly de@@ generate as a teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; where a risk is , are also possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
I never forget my country and I cannot live happy if I know that my people suff@@ ers .
I plan a project for farmers from the poo@@ rest provinces of the country especially for women .
they represent half of society and have to get the same possibilities as all others . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af tasted also plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where the people of packaging and preserv@@ atives can learn . &quot; so they can sell their harvest@@ ing on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; says he . &quot;
&quot; the development of successful entrepreneurs was a journey through uncertainty and doubts , but at the end of stability and prosperity . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey itself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .

&quot; global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ ac@@ ys Net@@ izen Report is an international snapshot , the challenges , vict@@ ories and upcoming trends in global websites &quot;
&quot; the Egyptian Parliament ver@@ ify a bill , which sees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration during a government authority . &quot;
&quot; users would need to use to use the social networks within six months after the most successful law@@ suits , on the website of the authority with the specification of its full name as well as their payout number . &quot;
&quot; who have failed this step , could be condemned up to six months of sentence , or the indi@@ s@@ ighting of a Criminal Tribun@@ al . &quot;
&quot; the law , which was advert@@ ised by six@@ ty parliament@@ arians , lies at the moment of legislative and constit@@ utional Committee of the Parliament and shall be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; May was a further member of a proposal for a proposal , in which t@@ oug@@ her pen@@ al@@ ties for the ins@@ ult of the President or a high officials would be introduced . &quot;
&quot; however , under Egyptian law the ins@@ ult@@ ation of the President and state institutions have already been pun@@ ish@@ able . under the leg@@ islat@@ ure , such a fact would be pun@@ ished with pris@@ ons and mon@@ ac@@ coun@@ ties , such right @-@ right of Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot;
&quot; if the law should be adopted , this can mean up to three years of cust@@ ody for the condem@@ nation . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this would under@@ go a political climate that has the right to freedom of expression and freedom of expression for many years now . &quot;
&quot; an mark@@ an example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ id ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he demonstrated the Egyptian polic@@ emen , which led against the military cou@@ p , which led to the ministry of the elected president Moh@@ ammed Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan wa@@ ited as much more than 700 prot@@ agonist , which were arrested in the same inc@@ ident , four years in prison on a trial . &quot;
recently he was post@@ pon@@ ed to the 20th of May the pris@@ ons according to human rights groups , the acc@@ used to bring the acc@@ used by the prison in the cour@@ t@@ room . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to such a number of human rights groups , hyp@@ oc@@ op@@ pression of e.g. ce@@ ase@@ fire , illegal assembly , murder and tried . &quot;
&quot; in another case , a criminal court in G@@ iza talked to the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Barb@@ ary . they were charged for their coverage to pro @-@ Mor@@ si seating on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo . &quot;
&quot; the Court also reduced the pen@@ al@@ ties of the journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were previously arrested for 5 years . &quot;
Tun@@ es@@ ischer activ@@ ist to penet@@ rated documents
May we spent Tunis@@ ian authorities six hours with the Ver@@ hö@@ r of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , which is co @-@ founder of the independent media platform N@@ awa@@ at as well as the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy project . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia has mainly been hearing from the President of the Republic , which is specifically supported by the President of the Republic , according to the Plan , the business@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator zine el @-@ Ab@@ id@@ ine Ben Ali c@@ acc@@ entu@@ ated Am@@ nest@@ y , provided that all un@@ law@@ ful preserved funds will be returned . &quot;
&quot; this published on 21 April , on the website of N@@ awa@@ at published document , casts a light to look like the pres@@ idential plans to support the legislation . &quot;
Ben G@@ har@@ bia ref@@ used the nom@@ ination of his sources under specification of Article 11 of the Tunis@@ ian press co@@ de@@ xes which journalists have the right to protect their sources .
&quot; nevertheless , he entered the District Court in Tunis on 09 . May as Wit@@ ness in the case . &quot;
will China force the users of social media to put their reference ?
&quot; according to new rules of the information office of the State Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China need permission to write messages in social media or share . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the registration will also be given that the registration will be required with the full re@@ al name . &quot;
analy@@ st suggests that this by the elimination of anonymous comments in conversations within social networks . it is up to now un@@ clear how the authorities will apply to these regulations .
&quot; Chinese Pro@@ secut@@ ors have proposed in social media in the social media , these regulations are only sel@@ ective to protect the citizen journ@@ alism and its independence . &quot;
then we see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
May the state @-@ c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of Russia has access to the latest Chinese Mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
&quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or failed to register with the provin@@ cial government as the &quot; organis@@ er of information &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this name is part of a law from 2014 , thanks to which the Russian Government will organise a list of online services that will organise the &quot; publication of the information . &quot; the law allows for removing content responsible for removing content and to force them on request for the maintenance of user data . &quot;
&quot; these web pages currently belong to websites such as v@@ contacts and Od@@ no@@ class@@ n@@ iki ( Russian two most popular social networks ) , the image board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service Mail@@ .ru and used other services . &quot;
Turkish court has spar@@ se Wikipe@@ di@@ as
&quot; a Turkish court had to delete the block@@ ing Wikipe@@ di@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administ@@ rators , two English @-@ language articles , the information that Turkey support the ji@@ ha@@ dists in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , maritime Affairs and communication existed , the site was blocked because they have worked together with a information source which operates with groups to provide a political de@@ fam@@ ation campaign against Turkey . &quot;
&quot; it is the first time Turkey is completely blocked by Turkey . it is thus , in addition to China , one of the few countries worldwide in which access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot;
United Kingdom cannot stop any doubt
&quot; after this week , the Government of Great Britain is to force in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to the monitoring of the internet services , communications in real time to monitor and de@@ cryp@@ t the data files . &quot;
&quot; the government has consult@@ ed tele@@ communication companies and intelligence services regarding the adv@@ ent , however , has other technology companies and the civilian populations outside . &quot;
&quot; despite all , the consultation is still running until 19 May . reactions and suggestions from the members of the public can be commun@@ icated to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs . &quot;
