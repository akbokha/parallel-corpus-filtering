<seg id="1">"although I had visited the United States for 2012 at least once a year, I would now live there for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love of America is extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="4">"as many of my generation I grew up with American movies, I have read American music and operated by American authors."</seg>
<seg id="5">Indeed this country had such a very profound effect on me that I was mainly journalist for an American film journalist.</seg>
<seg id="6">"as a 14-year-year I played the great Denzel Washington as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a fearless reporter, who used with the help of Julia Roberts as a Jura student, who were the first Federal Court with judges that were his interest."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"free to Method Man," I was, as if the absolute truth is, discerning everything else, that is what I want to do with my life. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"and the year I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the US had only strengthened."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I always said," America is the only country where I ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting you are always the one that you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of equal people. "</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had a very sultry love of love about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump arrived.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me how he goes with his commitment.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never holds the mountain behind the mountain as you say so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">"he says exactly what he thinks about like a former colleague, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, AfroAmericanians and women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, the people in his statements are reacted and stopped for him."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the 13 million voices that he won by the republican predominate, was the highest number that was ever reached by the party of nominee candidate."</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">"who are the Americans who support these bigotte person, I asked me?"</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not get to meet Trump and his voters to meet people during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">"as for example my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, Director of Journalism, which takes people from all over the world, a deep believing man, with whom I could talk about Islam and his past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"also agreed with the author of Peter Bhatia, the current publisher of the" Cincinnati Inquirer "." "</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met us at our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the "Phoenix Suns." to play.</seg>
<seg id="25">"trumps intolerance is also in contrast to generosity I lived in Sandy Bahr who fought for her life for her life, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me as their son."</seg>
<seg id="26">"still fits them to the commitment of Kristi Kappes, who helped me with much patience and grace to me and my colleagues helped to get used to the complexity of the American life."</seg>
<seg id="27">"then Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise advice has helped me much with my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and those through them embodied values and deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"while Trump is his way to nominees republican presidential elections, they offered me a grip and the counterpart to his limited vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule."</seg>
<seg id="31">"on 8 November 2016 over 50 million Americans, mostly whites, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt towards non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the conflict with the idea that people saw for Trump, because they shared either its racism and fanaticism, or because they were ready to overlooked these things, broke me almost the heart."</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to describe the Trump electors as racist.</seg>
<seg id="34">"to arrange people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">"this is superficially and respectful and indicates an inability to understand those who act in another way and think."</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows the people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not considered.</seg>
<seg id="37">"could it be that these voters, of which most knows are, for Trump, because they would like to repeat control over a country that she has disappointed?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, they might want to say that they are still important in this America?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, you can hardly forget the words of David Remnick who commented the cruel decision to rise up a man who look different with contempt upon those who look different than he."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this" Whitelash "(Anm. d.: so much as" charging of the whites against all other ethnic and whiplash, which means that much means such as Schleudertrauma) as it did the big Van Jones, has exactly what America made so great. "</seg>
<seg id="42">"millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - which faith or background you may have always like, America is definitely welcome."</seg>
<seg id="43">"for this land chose as his president, twice the son of a Kenyman whose history, as he says himself, nowhere else in the world would be possible."</seg>
<seg id="44">"however, with choosing Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge part of the white Americanism of this promise and says: to hell with diversity, religious freedom and the whole concept of pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="45">"in the America after 9 / 11 the white man is back on the ruin, say it."</seg>
<seg id="46">"with all I have to think about Khizr Khan, the father of a soldiers who liked in Iraq, and what he said at the eve of the election."</seg>
<seg id="47">On a rally of Hillary Clinton Mr. Khan had a vocal change with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would have been my son, captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan. "</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd replied with a lautstrong 'no!</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?" ""</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" brittle the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?" ""</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" "answered them."</seg>
<seg id="54">Have Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" they called them and their voices were louder. "</seg>
<seg id="56">"if anyone who did not have as you, a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a unanimous and lautent "NEIN"!</seg>
<seg id="58">"Mr. Khan concluded with words:" "God is thanks, Mr. Trump, is that not your America." "36 hours later he was given."</seg>
<seg id="59">"the land, for which his son had fallen, sent him a message."</seg>
<seg id="60">"this is now Trumps land, said the message."</seg>
<seg id="61">"and all the people who look like Mr. Khan, could not find a place in this new America."</seg>

<seg id="73">"for several years now, La Banda de Música is now playing in the municipality: one of children and adults already exist with the symphony orchestra Orchestra, which has found an opportunity to overcome them the surrounding poverty."</seg>
<seg id="74">A musical school with 100 students is dedicated to the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca for central interest.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">"the community that is located in one of the poorest provinces Mexikos, is known for their drugs of abuse and the gangs of violence."</seg>

<seg id="86">"in an article of Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local ecologist and music instructor of the children of Cateura, to the beginning time:"</seg>
<seg id="87">"first, it was very difficult because we had no place to rehearsals and we had to teach at the same place where children did not know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live with their children."</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio has been shown something that he never had seen before: one out of waste-asked violin.</seg>

<seg id="100">"in West Africa, the ship had already been known that this ship had already operated in liberated waters and fishing fishing before it was the other coast of Africa."</seg>
<seg id="101">"the East African countries were accordingly accordingly, and little gendared to welcome a lawful of this kind at its chocolates."</seg>
<seg id="102">"Tanzania, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comoros, Mozambique and the Seychelles mobilized quickly against the ship. it denied him to share one of their ports and WEIGERTEN."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that you simply denied everything that Benedict Kiilu, a leading employee of the Kenyan fisheries. it is part of a team that was discovered and followed by the ship. "</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013 the ship was driven out of the waters of the region: it was not successful to catch the fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">"ultimately, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars in Liberia, due to pillage the fisheries of the country."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the core of this initiative, the criminal practices crossed by the ISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NRO stop Illegal Fishing (Illegale Fisheries)."</seg>
<seg id="107">Members of this network are next to Somalia and Madagascar the six countries that then had driven out the prime minister from their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" with this we have eight countries, the same-minded and work together. they exchange information and are each other where it comes to illegal fishing, "says Tony Long, Head of the Pew Charitable Trusts project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project provides FISH-i technical support."</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is by definition unregulated: what is imprisoned: what is hidden because it is extremely difficult to catch. that's the illegal fishing is a main cause of overfishing from regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">"by intentional missions of existing legislation, using which certain habitats and species are to be protected, the illegal fishing ecosystems may have a delusion balance."</seg>
<seg id="111">"but while actions against illegal fishing were used by bureaucratic hurdles, and also by the snails, with the information between individual countries, the actions are done in real time, with traceable on FISH-i's digital communication platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"here, the individual countries can exchange with each other for example lists, news about suspicious activities or details that can be noticed during a port inspections or experienced."</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very attentive when these are moving at the open sea by satellite.</seg>
<seg id="114">"this makes it possible to discover the authorities, ships which fish in the forbidden areas of fish. also, so suspicious objections - about such that points that a ship invites his fallen fish on other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"ideally, such tests can show whether the participating ships have a fishing licence where they were on the road and possibly also whether they have a crime."</seg>
<seg id="116">"countries that are against illegal fishing, can be denied based on these ships in their harbours. what does the ships cannot sell their charge, and that they can even be forced to numbers from penalties, as in the case of the Premier."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "it is then about significant financial losses for the owners, which means that illegal fishing can no longer be worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="118">"and that is what we want to achieve," "says Per Erik Bergh, conducting director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a adviser company dedicated to fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also called FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">"the already mentioned platform has been created to gain a estimated 20 million USD in lost sales, which awakens the eight members of the HISH-i each year because of the illegal fishermen, which penetrate into Eastern African waters."</seg>
<seg id="121">"East-Africa has one of the most productive thin-fish-fish-fish, one of the region's commercial fishing from around the world. among these also known these illegal fishermen."</seg>
<seg id="122">"among their practices include actions such as the sailing under falter flag, fake royalty, specification of Phantasienamas, the fish shielded species and the fish in nature-areas."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" they also use the lack of international cooperation and make yourself increasing the weaknesses of a non-seamlessly organized control system, "says Long." "formerly a ship could be illegal and a country could not say" You dared my port. "</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say 'Come to me'. 'and exactly this legale slew tries to close the ISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its foundation FISH-i was involved in more than 30 studies of suspects ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">There has been criminal networks uncovered the fake licences in Tanzania. it discovered ships who used several fraudulent identities and found volatile ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">"due to its collaboration with INTERPOL, the international authority to combat crime, FISH-i can share information on illegal fishing across great distances."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" some of our studies lead us quite far into the networks organised crime, "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that is intended to help the FISH-i to precise ships of precise ships.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo with friendly permission of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">"Fish-i's satellite system, which is always further developed, helps to hide the illegal vessels that are happy to hide."</seg>
<seg id="133">"" the illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and position. and that we try to cross, "" says Duncan Copeland, a NRO, which deals with fisheries and FISH-i technical support. "</seg>
<seg id="134">"some of the ships turn on the example of their automatic identifier systems, which can no longer be used by satellite."</seg>
<seg id="135">"Copeland helps to build a system that connects various information from each other. it should help FISH-i to help criminalize criminal ships with greater precision."</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team can actually affect an influence on the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of the NRO Skytruth, believes that."</seg>
<seg id="139">"recently, Skytruth has been opened together with Google and the marine organisation Oceana the platform Global Fishing Watch: a platform that offers satellite transmission and can be displayed by using the position of each traceable ship worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" join forces to get a better picture of what is doing - that is simply meaning, "" says he. "" here is a chance for countries to unite and to flush their resources. "</seg>
<seg id="141">"we should do this on a global level." "Pew charitable trusts has a similar project to run, when a global system leaves the persecution of ships."</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities not only feel criminals but they also abolished.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships which were used to count earlier without a license and hardly any consequences they know that they are observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the countries participated in FISH-i participating countries now have a 33% increase in fisheries revenue, since fishing boats."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after FISH-i Somalia had helped, Greko 1 opened, the inspectators found there on board towing networks, whose use is prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo with friendly permission of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"also other countries notice this success." "the effect is so strong that us now also copy other countries," "says Kiilu." "in West Africa there are several hundred million dollars by illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="148">"in addition, 2015 six countries have joined together, the West Africa Task Force. also they are now fighting the illegal fishing, according to exactly the same model like FISH-i." "the goal is to make more such initiatives and structures in other regions," "says Copeland."</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently, FISH-i's younger member states to report on his first big triumph: in October it was Greko 1, a ship that was under wrong flag. and not only was the ship with no licence on the road and were not only forbidden."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship was also covered in vain waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "with the Take of measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing," "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="151">"for FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time evidence that such particular, collaborative working method works to protect the oceans. Emma Bryce is freelance journalist and lives in London. there she writes the topic environment, technology and nutrition."</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translators are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">"to commit, one needs two important skills: passive knowledge to understand the output text and active language skills to transfer it into the target language."</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active domination of the goal - something that is the case in maternal linguistics. in general, the conviction is true that translators should be in the language language - not in the starting language - motherlanguage should be. "</seg>
<seg id="379">Thus a French mother tongue should translate for example from English to French - not from French to French.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr-User Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">"many Japanese companies employ no employee dealing with English as a mother tongue, the translations into English. this may be attributed to the lack of understanding of the transition, the reasons or the relatively small number of English speakers that can learn Japanese."</seg>
<seg id="382">"some companies who have no foreign employees to make translations nevertheless firing, nevertheless the Japanese staff, whose English knowledge is considered to be the best estimated to translators - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are."</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr-User Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machinery translations are also widespread - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">"the worrile and mysterious propositions which arise by machining translations, show that this technique can still replace no human translators. this applies to some languages."</seg>
<seg id="386">"some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, including the mysterious imprints, which often used T-shirts or bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood."</seg>

<seg id="388">"translating error may be acceptable as a jewelry or at least harmless. but by major companies or from the government, which have the means to ensure higher standards, you can expect careful translations."</seg>

<seg id="785">"no, it is not normal, that my 10-year-old cousin thinks that he is great. and it is also not normal that people listen to songs about the" "heroism" "of offenders when they go through the streets."</seg>
<seg id="786">"for me this is, when they would have lost those who have lost someone and those who have fear that they are so something happening."</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories to blooming figures in a statistic.</seg>

<seg id="799">The journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the contribution "The Lost Children of Ciudad Juárez: a new generation of violence.</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions on how: who takes care of the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it in a settlement on the edge of the endangering city of Mexikos?</seg>
<seg id="802">"he is not like other boys of his age, whose parents can take care of them."</seg>

<seg id="813">These are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leaves organised crime in Mexico and penetrate into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories live in the face of always new headlines. this project reminds us of those who we cannot forget.</seg>

<seg id="823">It also raises questions about our desire for pictures to messages.</seg>

<seg id="1480">They reported how this clerks have made a safe place for these women and at the same time they have made it at the same time to ambassador of the wall.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"the first video, the Rohini showed in her discussion round, acted by women who could not name their husbands."</seg>

<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day, which they brought the name of their husbands from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra over the Brechen of a centuries-old tradition, in the married women could never speak the name of their husbands."</seg>

<seg id="1517">"the other women have not been heard completely with it, but mine, they are now in a better position, even to choose him in some days."</seg>

<seg id="1522">During the last months she celebrated her own birthdays with cakes; they danced and sangen and talked about things about which they had never made thoughts before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">"I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have spoken about some things, for example how our identities are knotted to our husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels great to say certain things loud, no matter how small they occur."</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round we are talking about the concept of honor and how it is connected to your clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have carried only Saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for most is the okay, but some wanted a saline curta, a wide shirt about a pants, bear; they have not dreamed."</seg>

<seg id="1530">"next you have decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure to make it possible."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"regarding the question, whether in the five months of the first discussion has already changed something, confirmed Rohini that things are slowly come to roles:"</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have only made small steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"some women tried it a few times, but then listened to the name of their husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some, including me, do it still, but only when they are alone and no other family members are at present."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two will continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women are now carrying out at any time Zinnoberred on her forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion will know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the fairies to find more freedom of movement or your own closeness - at the end of a hard to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">"by giving each other confidence, they will be aware that they sit in the same boat."</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am also.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"however, this club gives each of us the confidence that will change something."</seg>
<seg id="1542">"and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction, when every woman goes home to the home and other people of it, what we talk and what we do."</seg>

<seg id="1898">"on the way of migrants, the Europe or Latin America cross, some places are known for their hospitality."</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tapachula he is located at the border with Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is led by a 59- year-old Mexicer led by a small woman with a coral-pink Brilliengestel and gold colored earrings in Teddybear.</seg>
<seg id="1902">"Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name Mama Africa."</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a goal for Afrikaner and Haitans who are on the journey.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel does not have any charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">"for about 2.50 dollars the night sleeping the guests in simple rooms, with cold, crumbling walls and beds made of metal."</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - yet hundreds of African and haitiian migrants here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">"sometimes, Mrs Ramírez, people tells in full minibus and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call:" Mama Africa! "</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">"at the moment it is rather quiet, but this year Ramírez already received 200 guests at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms and some have already slept outside on cardboard boxes.</seg>
<seg id="1912">It does not want to reject anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">"it also helps them and bring them to hospital when they are sick, they buy them medications that they cannot pay, they massaging them with a balm which were exhausted from the long journey."</seg>
<seg id="1914">"Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, is a short time ago."</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa is an appropriate nickname for Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">"Sebastien family (with her daughter Merrui, which has a yogurt moustache) posented with Concepción González Ramírez."</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Photo: Amy Bracken.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"yes, yes, he answered with a smile." I really feel that it fits to her, as African women are very nice women. "</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very affectionate.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">"Sebastiao resumed with his sister, which hopes to go to Boston to find their husband and the three children."</seg>
<seg id="1924">"you already lived in Brazil, however, it is for some Africans who are on the way to the United States, normal to take a first stop in South America and then go to the north."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"the family had heard from other couriers of Mama Africa." Mama Africa is a well known name on the track, "explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti."</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that the Haitans and the Africans often travel the route and that the Africans already speak on WhatsApp from Mrs Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">"as many of his companion, Michelet has lived in Brazil before and worked as a building workers on the construction of the Olympic Games and the football world championship."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"when the Brazilian economy has been weaker, he began his trip to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1929">"he has been a guest at Mama Africa since months, he sold SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the Busticket."</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will have in the future with Mrs Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our mother and we never let them go again," "answers smiling." "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Ms. Ramírez tells you their guests often send text messages when they are gone to grissing them or to tell you about the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">It declares that their Christian faith in the drive of their work is.</seg>
<seg id="1934">"do not know a lot about Africa, but their guests have contributed to prepare chicken as in Ghana."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"Ms. Ramírez is perhaps here very well known, but it is not the only funken hope for migrants, who travel through Tapachula."</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter was recorded by Valenzuela and his family migrants in their little house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is policeman and has found that the Bustickets will be sold to many African migrants.</seg>
<seg id="1939">"he began to help them to get a reasonable price, then he has offered them his house for a dollar off the night."</seg>
<seg id="1940">"at the moment are 25 people there, mainly Haitans."</seg>
<seg id="1941">"some sleep on blankets on the ground, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking outside."</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests do.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I lived in the United States, he tells." I experienced what they experience. "</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the desert and we have suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others do not help. this is the reason why I give them my support.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"after spending three years, he was transferred to a raid on his work place in the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"the majority of migrants, which is represented by Tapachula, comes from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their houses for them."</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he fled his wife with his wife and his three children from people who wanted to develop money without a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"in Tapachula he has asked for a accommodation and a unknown, an allabian, has offered him to its roof."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"some months later the family lives still there and she tries to decide where the next steps should go."</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is back full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the courses consult the travelers calm their telephones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus today has arrived and brought 20 new guests to a large part of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"Ms. Ramírez seems to be happy that their house is full, but it is also nostalgically, because of those who have gone away."</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a stollen grandmother flakes her in her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">"there is one of her daughter with African hair laced that you have made a Kundler, some photos of her grandchildren and many travellers more, boy and Old."</seg>

<seg id="2097">"with his music that often deal with issues such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of the whole Arab world, but also demands the core of the entire Arab world. all these issues are not only in his home city Amman Relevanz but also in cities, which is rich in Syria until Sanaa in Yemen."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"with his 25 years Hdaib sees itself as someone who is restricted in his thinking by boundaries, and he can feel according to his own statement by people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya."</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he does not open it open up against the US-American foreign policy is a special deductment.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded from the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"Hdaib does not believe that his sympathy for those who have to survive in war-areas, something that was born with his identity as a" Palestinian infleeting of the second generation "- so he himself was born in Jordan, and has never been in Palestine until now."</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I am not thinking about my own life," says Hdaib. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">"then he adds:" I think that I am a person, while he is soldered in water, Nescafé in two cups. it is the holy month Ramadan; in this time it is for Muslims, from sunrise to sunset. "</seg>
<seg id="2105">The jordanic law also noted that the public consumption of food during the Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">"obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand has a cup of coffee at a sengaging hot Junitag little to do with protest against Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically the pressures are very hot coffee and the vibrates of the Kent cigarette in the nose primarily of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">"sometimes Jordan is like a prison under the open sky, especially when you have a look into the neighboring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"therefore, it avoids it simply to do basic things - as in the public during the Ramadan water - to drink not in prison."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently, the Interior of Jordan is a appearance of the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"some parliamentarians who support the Islamic Aerial front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual frontants Hamed sensuo, the cultural and traditional norms of the country is contradictated and the main reason for the concert."</seg>
<seg id="2112">The members and former press review of the Islamic coalition DIMA Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert was said "just" because of the sexual orientation of the Sower.</seg>
<seg id="2113">"many claim also, the commitment of the band in matters such as Arabic, human rights and free expression in the Arab world be more dangerous activism, who represents the old approved legitimacy in the entire region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement Mashrou'Leila, the jordanic people as" "progressive supporter of human rights", "who continue to establish a intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement is probably not likely to be silken rhetoric, but actually reflected a clear out-crystalline reality in Jordan, which occurs in Hdaibs work."</seg>
<seg id="2116">"in the year 2016, Hdaib traditional sex men who cast his vision from the fate of Arab women the vorehelds sex."</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the picture shows the skeleton of a clearly crushed unfamiliar woman, whose arms and legs are stretch up to the corners of the canvas."</seg>
<seg id="2118">"it is surrounded by a red lake, perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who actually trust them."</seg>
<seg id="2119">In the past few years the number of 'honorary morality took place - the inofficial outside left.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"human Rights Watch, according to the number of honorary morals in the year 2016 their climax; however, there is still horrifying that Jordan has become the institutional infrastructure to support the victims of murder and domestic violence in 2016."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a law on the criminal offence from 1954, women who are exposed in prison on indefinite period, and for their release is often a years of bureaucratic effort as well as the guarantee of the family needed that the woman is nothing to happen."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"Hdaibs music enjoys great popularity and is known for this, even before themes, which in its country long as taboo."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib contests that his work is politically, however, however, that he is his music, who is full of explicit sentences to sexuality, freedom and expression, not from politics."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from Nahost, Mann."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"I was standing in politics," "says he."</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed" takes the question of Palestinian identity in the attack.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"in" "Lawla al 3aib" "and in" "ghareeb" "is the focus on poverty."</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the list of songs, which are politically politically, can be continued."</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib published a song with the title "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song you repeated a verse often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market in which one can get in his words," which one wants "- be it faith or non-faith, heterogeneity or homosexuality."</seg>
<seg id="2133">He noticed that hardly any someone in Jordan on the rights of swamps and lesbians speaks and that comments on equality of LGBTQ + individuals were still strong in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014 Hdaib was an interview for the popular jordanic OnlineProgram ROYA to notice later that his comments had been taken from the context, betrayed and his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube, it was upload without cuts, but it was only a processed version," says he. "</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today Hdaib is open to Arab LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance towards homosexuals not speak to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentioned Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, who has remained in memory today thanks to his homoerotic poems in memory."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib ask himself: if Abu Nuwhat was later to work on behalf of the caliphate, in the eighth century, we could write openly about homosexuality, why do the Jordanians cannot write that?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the Hashitic Kingdom there is nothing new that the government attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are brought to silence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, the jordanic message has several former government members and members of the Teacher association, with the reason they would have criticized on comments in social media related to the problems associated with the deeply in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"in view of what is the concert Hdaibs, according to the top of the iceberg - the real challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jordan."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"for him, progress is a permanent and taking. Jordan has taught mashrou'Leila now for the second time in a row, but the way of progress - it looks out of slow, needs and internal changes. he is sure that these changes will take place in the heart of the Jordanian society."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"finally, Hdaib, such as millions of other Arabs also, from an Arab world without interventions from abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he dreamed not only to bring his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to experience it."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"perhaps the region will help from music, art and literature from a real and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, streams and to artificial style led democracies. at least hopes he hopes that."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"as far as far as it is, Hdaib, and therefore also resistance to the resistance."</seg>

<seg id="2181">"the following article is the modified version of the message" "Lovbotanic" "has published the international online magazine Tea After Twelve."</seg>
<seg id="2182">The contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write lovemaking letters to people that we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">"is it not yet much more important, people who feel outstretched, affection."</seg>
<seg id="2185">Exactly this question went to the two young kolumbianic activists from the Foundation BogotArt and Cristian Palacios of the Young Youth Foundation and inspired her to the campaign Cartas por la Reconciliación (letters to reconciliation) who have young people to write Guerillakashamed letters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">"only before short, her country's place was a historical event, and they wanted to contribute to their part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had concluded a peace agreement with the guerillamovement FARC (German: revolutionary forces in Colombia), which forms the worst armed conflict in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="2187">International was considered to be the submission of the peace agreement as a significant that the Colombian President José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits to the Nobel Peace Prize.</seg>
<seg id="2188">"however, in front of the Kolumbianern, there is still a long way to speak of a real reconciliation and peace."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"guerrilla fighters, who lived many years in illegal warehouses, have been exposed to a war of warfare, and around the clock their weapons have to integrate themselves into life as civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society in turn is accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hate to guerrilla trench also has to support their ranks and support them in building a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Kolumbians would close together and help to help integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">"and this is exactly what they did: until now, thousands of young people are written letters - love songs on former guerillusionists to welcome them back in society again."</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign are 6900 letters - one for every former Guerillusionists - which should then be transferred to personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The Valentine's day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">"the idea for letters to reconciliation was born on the World Summit of the Nobel Peace Prize, which took place in February 2017 in Bogotá. there was Leonardo and Cristian the opportunity to speak shortly with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded to the Nobel Peace Prize."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"that explained that we love the people we love, am Valentine's thousands of lovemaking, but those who forget it much needed."</seg>
<seg id="2197">"he plane, he continued to share his love with people this year, which needed at the pendent tripruch."</seg>
<seg id="2198">"so the plan, letters full of hope and support for former fighters of FARC to write their place in society and to build a new life." "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history to a common history of peace."</seg>
<seg id="2199">"so far, as part of the campaign have been collected more than 2000 letters."</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cali, Manizal, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá."</seg>
<seg id="2201">I have never thought that someone would forgive me?</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were passed on 19 March in one of the UN-camps in the region of Caldono-Cauca.</seg>
<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students at the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city administration of Cali and Leonardo from the Foundation BogotArt traveled to the camp to bring the letters personally."</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of FARC presented itself as they had done earlier to make the commands of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">"but this time they received no commands, but letters full of people from all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it was a very moving moment for all involved." "it's incredible how many different feelings you walk in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that lies between" "told the Politicsstudent Manuela Jiménez Avila later."</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a employee of the Governor of the province of Valle del Cauca described this unforgettable experience as follows: "</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after we passed the letters, a former warrior led me through the camp of the Guerilla warrior."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I saw in one of the" "Cambuches" "(a kind of hut in which the guerillusionists live), I saw a guerillator who wrote a little bit."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I was afraid to go down, because beside him on the bed there was MGL-Granatdesigner, a fatal weapon in the thorn-tree-sheep."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"I still spoke to him and asked," "Hello, what do they do?" "I answered," "I answered, I answered me."</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"never in my life, someone gave me something so nice, so I answered it." "I suddenly heard the tears over the cheeks."</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him very firm and set me next to the pomladder.</seg>
<seg id="2215">"maybe he was the war was sorry, all the years of faithful companion to be this struggles, and wanted to help him to write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">"the man told me more about his life. he never had something different from life than war, was the only way to keep him and his six brothers before the famine." I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes. "</seg>
<seg id="2217">"but now I know that there is a society out there, which is waiting for us with open arms."</seg>
<seg id="2218">"until now I only learned how I have to deal with weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">"as a prelude, students and some leaders of the FARC came to a discussion."</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war and the FARC already worked in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"therefore, the leaders of the FARC the history of the organization, their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process:" many years we have experienced how the social injustice on the part of the state to develop the whole Colombian people, we can help to create the society in this country. "</seg>
<seg id="2224">"for a purpose of this size, it is worth to overcome all obstacles," said one of them. "</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"these people who have never found hearing and had no electoral law, and to recognize that people who have seen often seen as monsters and even hate people who were shot by their lisumption and their environment, was very painful for me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">"the reality, in which the country lives, does me hurt."</seg>
<seg id="2228">"but it comforted me that all men - even those who have killed and so much damage, can give us something beading, and a smile and a hug can give us."</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"Gustavo González, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Darío de Jesús Monsalve, the Archbishop of the City of Cali, the following letter:"</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Kolumbianers was made that after the development of peace would reign.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"as long as it gives inequality, hunger and a lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are willing to rise up and to record their rights and that is also completely justified (...)."</seg>
<seg id="2234">"we from the FARC now put peace, on a policy without weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"that is why we call all defenders of peace - regardless of what race, religion or ideology they belong to themselves - to rise above all those who dream of a country in the war."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"we give you our word to make our contribution and bring victims, because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. one among us who defend life as the basis of existence, many difficulties will be forthcoming."</seg>
<seg id="2237">"on our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them."</seg>

<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social standards are still ensuring that women sooner or later in various areas of life to a glowing ceiling, and that discrimination is still going through the many different countries and beliefs."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware of me and well-known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced that I am double and threefold twice and threefold.</seg>

<seg id="2452">"or that women in black spheres and women with migrational background are exposed to a higher risk, domestic violence and violence in the partnership suffer from white women."</seg>

<seg id="2630">"his company offers 114 varieties, such as Outredding, the first plant that has grown by NASA-Astronauts in space."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"for nearly 20 years, Mortons was conducted only through its own enclosure and the question of how many salatsink he can get limits."</seg>
<seg id="2632">"but at the beginning of the 2000s, he noted that more and more salads were patented and that he could no longer use it for breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2633">"the patents gars not only for single varieties, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, a special rotary or green leaves, or curved sheets."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"over the last few years, more of these patents have been registered for more and more plants such as corn and cartoons. because of this trends, plant-care, environmental protection and experts in food security for the future of food production."</seg>

<seg id="2636">It's as would lie in a river a boulders to which I have to hernia.</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we have to do this now, but it is a break with the breeding tradition," says he. "I think that these patents go to Salads too far."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and when they hold court, no one can breed more a new salaries because all the features are patented, so good as possible and tried to breed those characteristics that he wants."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, it is very careful and striving to use no material that is being protected as intellectual property."</seg>

<seg id="2643">"it is not a coincidence that this name sounds rather than it would come from the IT area, and not from the field of plant breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2644">"the Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for" Open-Source "" Saatgut) can be inspired by the movement for free "open source" software. "</seg>
<seg id="2645">It has been called into life to ensure that some types of plant and genes is not being protected as intellectual property and so for plantations durable.</seg>
<seg id="2646">"as part of the initiative, shortly Ossi, U.S. breeders can commit themselves that others can use them by them."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"however, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed, and they can sell it." open source "breeders allow only others to breed this own varieties, and it is not immediately banned - two aspects that are forbidden by many plant patios or prescribed."</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative for their start in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">"for the emeritus professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi-board member of Jack Kloppenburg are control over the seed, and the possibility to breed new plants, both important for food security and environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"Saatgut also plays a role in larger contexts like biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to breed the latter not or only little by playing seed with natural resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg emphasises that the "Open-Source" movement is not busy with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all kinds of plants could be patented whether vegetables, Korn, gentechnisch changes or not." to buy our goal in the global agricultural industry, it's good, locally and sustainable productionions in the global agrarian industry, it should also know that the way is bred for example, such as this vegetables are bred, threatened.

<seg id="2657">Ossi-Supporters argues that the future of food supplies is at risk because the available gene pool due to the ever more numerous intellectual property rights on plant material which is thus always available and unrestricted.</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, executive director of Ossi, has dedicated himself in her doctoral thesis with genetical variation of carrots and their availability. it found that about one third of all Kartottencharacteristics as intellectual property is protected, making it used for sprayers either not or less."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"for other plants there is no estimates not yet, but experts like Luby suspect that massaging plants such as wheat in still larger style are patented as salad or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">"plants are so bred that they have targeted characteristics - from such, through which their taste or colour improved up to such, due to which they thrive in certain environments or threats such as pests or diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2662">"the opponents of Patents on nuclear plants point out that the available plant material for breeders have decreases for breeders by more and more patents. genetic diversity is currently necessary than ever before, since the changed conditions due to climate change is much worse predictable."</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an e-mail, Monsanto-spokesperson Carly Scaduto an that genetic diversity is generally important and also critical for Monsantos activities. with a total of four Genbanks and cooperation with institutions such as the country estate. the United States has set itself the company for the preservation of genetic diversity."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"however, it refers to that intellectual property other breeders to promote" "patents and the protection of plant variets innovations." "a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent is expired."</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come with another method to the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"such protection does not cause innovations not, but promotes it by giving the public more material and know-how."</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton looks different: 20 years to wait until a patent loop, surely do not have innovations. "</seg>
<seg id="2668">"and if you are waiting to wait for such a long time, to breed plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, one could have lost the battle."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"however, the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a general good and would continue to remain:" independent plant breeders have neither the time nor money for such formalities, and monetical incentives for us are not attractive to us. "</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make your work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"this is what keeps us going, and it will be impossible for us if we do not continue to use the best and latest genetic resources."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"in total, Morton is meant to patented on the concept to patterness:" we create the characteristics not really self. "</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants constitute it themselves and as a breeder we do not have any clue as the plants do that.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol Deppe, plantations in the US-state Oregon and Ossi-board members, there is another important aspect of the plant breeding:" whoever breed a sorrows, and also bred his own values into it. "</seg>
<seg id="2676">"who believes in industrial agriculture with great courtyards and monoculturas, for their cultivation of massaging herbicide, breeds in its varieties of this concept of agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2677">"my concept is accurate." ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some medium-sized companies (such that are moving forward to international markets, but smaller than e.g. Monsanto are) patents have to survive the most smaller seeds - either reject the patent or keep it for too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case."</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant-based Frank Morton is looking for salads in his breeding garden Salads.</seg>

<seg id="2681">"Morton is also the view that breeders due to the Avoid of plant patrons of innovative would:" it looks like I am with my efforts to produce new, stronger than companies that patented. "</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I need to constantly sell new material for my catalog, since I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a few years ago," says he. "" with a patent is 20 years ahead of competition, with what you think it is very simple. "worldwide resonance"</seg>
<seg id="2683">"although the US seem to be leader in the" open source "breeding, the concept is spreading, but quickly around the world."</seg>

<seg id="2685">It also supports them to come to "Open Source" -Saatgut to sell and to sell their own.</seg>

<seg id="2688">"at the beginning of November 2016 the Exekutive of the European Union, the European Commission, declares that conventional plants would not be paternible. thus, she speaks to the current practice of the European Patent Attorch which is allowed to breed patents on conventional plants."</seg>
