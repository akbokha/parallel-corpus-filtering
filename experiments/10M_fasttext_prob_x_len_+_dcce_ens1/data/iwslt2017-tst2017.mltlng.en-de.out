this is James R@@ isen .
they might know him because he was won as New York Times re@@ porter the Pul@@ itzer Prize .
&quot; long before the one had heard of Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book in which he published spectacular that the N@@ SA was illegal Ph@@ ones of Americ@@ an@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; but it is another chapter , which should leave a lasting impression . &quot;
therein he describes a cat@@ astroph@@ ic US intelligence operation in which the CIA h@@ ides the CIA to a nuclear bom@@ b .
&quot; if the crazy sounds , read it . &quot;
it is an unbelievable story .
&quot; but do you know , who does not have the chapters even ? &quot;
the US government .
almost 10 years the government fought against R@@ isen and asked him to call his inn@@ ate sources .
in this turn it became the symbol for the pattern of the government , wh@@ ist@@ le@@ bl@@ owers to condemn and journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to the first constit@@ utional , the media have the right to publish secret information . &quot;
&quot; but it is impossible to apply this right if media cannot get this information , and if they cannot protect the identity of the mut@@ ations they do . &quot;
&quot; so as the government at R@@ isen kno@@ ck@@ ed , he did something that many cour@@ ageous re@@ porter already did before him : he ref@@ used and said that he would prefer to go in prison . &quot;
&quot; thus , from 2007 to 2015 R@@ isen lived with the risk to go in prison . &quot;
&quot; but then , only days before the process , something extraordinary . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , although they had been given for years , that it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government were dropped . &quot;
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring the re@@ porter and springs can always hide less .
&quot; instead of fail to fail , and to bring to the statements , that could do his digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; and thus have the investig@@ ator , without his consent , his phone @-@ wise , &quot;
&quot; just like his e @-@ mail data , financial and banking information , its credit card , and even trav@@ eller with the list of its flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Ster@@ ling , a CIA p@@ hist@@ le@@ bl@@ ower and ris@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is just one of many cases . &quot;
President Obama promised to protect W@@ hist@@ le@@ bl@@ owers . but instead the judi@@ ci@@ ary has sent@@ enced more than all the US governments before him .
&quot; now you can imagine how the one can be a problem , especially because the government too much of their work as secret . &quot;
since the 11th of September almost every article about national security was the result that a wh@@ ist@@ le@@ bl@@ ower went to a journalist .
&quot; so we set the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constit@@ utional detection , because the government has more and more possibilities to send all of them . &quot;
&quot; but just as technology of the government allows to handle the rights of re@@ porters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; though , they can contact the moment in which they contact , rather than in the after@@ ward , in the ced@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; today , there are communication software that had not yet been written than R@@ isen his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or call calls . &quot;
&quot; such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open @-@ source bank transfer system for wh@@ ist@@ le@@ bl@@ owers , which was originally developed by the Internet , and is now being developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation , which I have been further developed . &quot;
&quot; instead of an e @-@ mail , go to a news page , just like the Washington Post . &quot;
&quot; there you can upload documents up@@ loading or information , just as with any other contact form . &quot;
these will then be encrypted and stored on a server which only has access to the respective message agency .
&quot; so , the government cannot be secre@@ tive , and many of the information that would call them would not be available from the preced@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; but Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole , to protect freedom of the press in the 21st century . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , governments around the world develop new sp@@ ying technologies that all end@@ anger us . &quot;
&quot; it is to make sure that not only technology fac@@ ades , such as Edward Snow@@ den have a chance to bring in@@ iqu@@ ities . it is just as important that we protect the next wh@@ ist@@ le@@ bl@@ owers . &quot;
&quot; the above mis@@ ors in the supply of soldiers described are white and of crowded hospitals , the alarm is going to tell us . or the next environmental workers , the alarm to se@@ ize water from Fl@@ int . or a Wall@@ street @-@ Insider which war@@ ns us before the next financial crisis . &quot;
&quot; after all these technologies , these technologies have been made not only for those who want to cover crimes , but to protect our all constit@@ utional rights . &quot;
thanks .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 the largest dat@@ ashe@@ ets of the story was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; has been hidden in tax hav@@ ens . &#93; &#91; what does this week we have been hidden from news about a look@@ out of 11 million documents in Panama &apos;s law firms
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the mysterious world of tax hav@@ ens .
&quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers to go to companies such as Mos@@ sack Fon@@ se@@ ca and say : &quot; okay , we need an an@@ onym@@ ously company . &quot;
&quot; we actually see the e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages how the whole system works , how it works . &quot;
this has already resulted in the first very direct consequences .
Islands Prime Minister has returned .
&quot; also , there are reports that a allies of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad h@@ oses in tax hav@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; it is asser@@ ted that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russian president Vladimir Putin leads to a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cell@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; now there will be a lot of rich people and others , which are nervous to the next release , and to the next un@@ covered documents . &quot;
&quot; now , that sounds like the P@@ lot of an agent or John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham @-@ Nov@@ el . &quot;
&quot; it seems we@@ pt away from you , ordinary people . &quot;
why should we tell us what ?
&quot; but the truth is : when the rich and mighty are able to hide their property in tax hav@@ ens and not all their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads . &quot;
and this concerns us all .
&quot; for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these re@@ vel@@ ations are phenomen@@ al . &quot;
&quot; discuss@@ ing the world discuss the media and leading polit@@ ician , such as secret tax hav@@ ens of some few things to hide and har@@ dened -- something that we have been discuss@@ ing and un@@ ve@@ iled for ten years . &quot;
&quot; I think many people the whole world seems to be very confusing , and it is hard to understand how this tax hav@@ ens work . &quot;
I always imagine it as a mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ cap .
&quot; thus one has a company in another company , in another company that makes it almost impossible to truly understand who behind these prayers . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult for pro@@ secution and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society really understand what thing is . &quot;
I think it is also interesting that there are less reports on that matter in the US .
&quot; presum@@ ably , because so far there have been no prominent Americans who came in these re@@ vel@@ ations , this sc@@ and@@ al . &quot;
&quot; now , it is not that there is no rich Americans that their property is in tax hav@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; but through the principle , after which this tax hav@@ ens work , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ se@@ ca less American customers . &quot;
&quot; if we had a data piece from the Cayman Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would have much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it is so that in some U.S. states you need to receive less information to start a company as to get a library . &quot;
this type of in@@ transparency in the US has allowed its employees to reduce school@@ children .
it has been de@@ co@@ uns@@ elling to am@@ ok@@ ing particularly an@@ archy an@@ chor@@ age .
it is this kind of behavior that affects all of us .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does it work ?
&quot; so , we sent a conce@@ al investig@@ ators into the offices of 13 An@@ w@@ alts@@ firms in Manhattan . &quot;
&quot; our investig@@ ators were given as African ministers who wanted to bring back to the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot;
&quot; we really sh@@ ocked it really , that all up to one of the lawyer &apos;s proposals made suggestions , as he could transfer his money . &quot;
&quot; these were all prec@@ aution . none of these lawyers took us as a client , and of course nobody was handed over to anyone with this system . however , it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important to consider this not as individuals .
&quot; it is not about a single lawyer , who has under@@ take the proposals in our conce@@ al investig@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; it is not about a single peak polit@@ ician , involved in a sc@@ and@@ al . &quot;
&quot; it is about how the system works , through corruption , tax ev@@ as@@ ion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; and to cope with this , we must change the rules . &quot;
we must change the rules to create this kind of behaviour .
it may sound all very d@@ ow@@ ingly as if we could do nothing against it ; as if there is nothing to be changed ; as if it is always the rich and powerful .
&quot; but as secure optim@@ ist , I see that some things began to change . &quot;
&quot; in the past few years , we have seen adv@@ ices to more transparency , which affects the owners of companies . &quot;
the theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
&quot; since then , the EU recorded in central regist@@ ers on the national level , who really is behind companies in Europe and who is controlled them . &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US would like to leave .
&quot; representatives of both parties have brought a leg@@ islat@@ ure to both parliament@@ arians , but this does not make progress we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how this Panama Dis@@ closure , this huge insight into the world of tax hav@@ ens , as a means is used to ensure in the US and globally for greater transparency . &quot;
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
&quot; we need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; we need execut@@ ives in the economy that stand up and say , &quot; In@@ transparency is not good for the business . &quot;
&quot; we need leading politicians to recognize the problem and use it , by laws this kind of in@@ transparency . &quot;
&quot; together , we can finish the in@@ transparent that now makes this kind of tax ev@@ as@@ ion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing , finally qu@@ it . &quot;
this is the story as I once again kid@@ nap@@ ped and in the trunk of a red ma@@ ins .
&quot; a day after I had finished my design study , I made a back@@ stead . &quot;
a guy in the red Maz@@ da remained and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my art works .
he was alone in the city and just made a road@@ trip through all the country . afterwards he would go to the peace @-@ cor@@ ps .
I invited him on a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I got tired .
&quot; while we paid the invoice , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; where do you sleep , because today night ? &quot;
he made the whole thing worse : &quot; I do not know it yet . &quot;
&quot; and I thought : &quot; &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what m@@ Ah I now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
&quot; but I just got to know him just now ! he says he would go to the peace of peace , but I don &apos;t know if he really is planning . I will not kid@@ nap@@ ped in the trunk of a Maz@@ ow@@ land ! &quot;
this is a small trunk !
then I heard myself : &quot; I have a bubble . you can sleep in my living room .
&quot; a voice in my head said : &quot; &quot; h , how please ? &quot;
&quot; at night I was then in bed , I star@@ ed to the blank@@ et and thought : &quot; Oh man ! what did I get there ? &quot;
a wild@@ ly sleeping in my living room .
what if he is crazy ?
&quot; I got such a fear that I got out of the bed , pointed to the door of the door , and my sleeping room . &quot;
but he was not crazy .
we are still in contact .
&quot; the artwork , which he bought from me , depends today in his class@@ room . he is now teachers . &quot;
this was my first experience as hosts . it has completely changed my perspective .
&quot; maybe people who were sold to me in childhood as stran@@ gers , actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered ? &quot;
&quot; people on my air@@ mat@@ s to accommodate , was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air conditioning . &quot;
&quot; we make a time jump , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I am un@@ employed , almost ple@@ ite , my ro@@ omm@@ ates moves from and the rent is increased . &quot;
I learned that at that time there was a design @-@ conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can do it to turn fear into fun .
&quot; I wrote my best friend and new fellow inhabitants Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could earn something . our apartment will stay for a designer @-@ Bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , WLAN and a desk includes a mattress and every morning breakfast . &quot;
ha ! &quot;
we created a site and founded so &quot; bubble and breakfast &quot; &#91; AIR@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air@@ mat@@ s on wooden floor .
they found it super and we also .
&quot; I &apos;m sure our cheese @-@ ham @-@ O@@ mel@@ et tasted completely different , because we made them for our guests . &quot;
&quot; we tou@@ red with them through the whole city . when we adopted our last guest , and the door to the castle was star@@ ed , Brian and me . &quot;
we just had discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and we could pay our rent at the same time ?
the things came into roles .
&quot; my former ro@@ omm@@ ate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czyk , concluded us as a developer . &quot;
we wanted to find out if you could make it a business concept .
&quot; we presented the investors : &quot; &quot; we want to create a web site on the people publicly pictures of their private rooms po@@ sten , their bedrooms , their baths -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when visiting . &quot;
over the Internet they can then invite other foreign people to stay with them .
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we wa@@ ited that the rock@@ et would be z@@ ap .
indeed they are not .
&quot; no one who is still completely with tro@@ st , would invest in a business , the fore@@ igner allowed to sleep in apartments of other people . &quot;
why ?
because we have learned to have children all that stran@@ gers are dangerous .
&quot; when one has a problem , one can feel on the things that you can do well . we could des@@ ig@@ ate . &quot;
at the Kunst@@ akademie we learned that design much more is than just looks and hap@@ tics -- it is the overall experience .
&quot; we learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create confidence by design imm@@ enses , between people who never met before . &quot;
can design such a thing ?
is it possible to create with design confidence ?
&quot; I would like to give you a tasting , what degree of trust we call . &quot;
it is a 30 @-@ seconds experiment . it will force you out of your coming one .
th@@ um@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I would like to un@@ lock your mobile phone .
give your mobile phone to your left seat .
&quot; this quiet flight from Pan@@ ik you can feel -- -- is exactly what hosts , when they open the door to the door . &quot;
&quot; because the only thing is more personal than your mobile phone , your home . &quot;
&quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , you will see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel about to hold the mobile phone of a fore@@ igner in the hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
&quot; so , most guests feel when they can sleep elsewhere . &quot;
only for this reason our company can exist .
&quot; just so , who now has Al Go@@ res &apos;s mobile ? &quot;
could you be announced on Twitter that he was transferred to the President of the President ?
you can now return the phones .
you now have experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I would like to tell you of some discoveries .
what if we have changed a small detail in this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neigh@@ bor would have been presented once again with his name ; if he would have told where he comes , how his dog or his children are called ? &quot;
&quot; imagine you would have 150 ap@@ ass@@ ess@@ ments , which all say , &quot; &quot; he can really make a very well wr@@ apped tow@@ el ! &quot;
how would you feel when you would have to cancel your mobile phone ?
because a well @-@ conceived feedback system strength@@ ens confidence .
in the beginning we still have some things wrong .
&quot; it was difficult for people , negative ass@@ ess@@ ments . &quot;
finally we decided to wait until both hosts and guest their ass@@ ess@@ ments . before we put them online .
last week we have discovered something new .
&quot; we were conducted using Stan@@ ford a study . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how much they are related to age and residence . &quot;
&quot; little surprising , we trust the people most that are most like . &quot;
&quot; the more differences we find , the less trust we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social pre@@ ingen@@ ious .
&quot; it is exciting when you add the call of a person -- in our case through ass@@ ess@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; if you have less than three ass@@ ess@@ ments , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; but one has more than ten , it changes everything . &quot;
a good call is simil@@ arities .
the right design can thus help us to overcome some of our deeply ro@@ oted preferences .
&quot; furthermore , we learned that trust is dependent on how much you get there . &quot;
here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; if you tell too little about how for example , &quot; Hi ! &quot; &quot; you do not get any answer . &quot;
&quot; told you too much , as for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother , -- -- the request will also be rather accepted . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , for example &quot; Tol@@ le art works in your home ! I do with my family vacation . &quot;
how can it create it with design to restore this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text in order to recommend the correct amount of text . we also provide tips on which themes you should write something .
&quot; our entire company builds on hope that the right design can help to overcome our pre@@ judi@@ ces against stran@@ gers . &quot;
&quot; with which we did not reck@@ oned , the great amount of people who were more than ready to place these pre@@ judi@@ ces . &quot;
here you can see how many people take our offer .
you can recognize three things .
&quot; first , incredibly good luck . &quot;
&quot; second , the ti@@ reless work of our team . &quot;
&quot; third , third , which was not covered before . &quot;
for us the shop runs very well .
&quot; of course , there are also times when not everything is smooth . &quot;
there were guests who celebrated unauthorized parties are celebrated or rented apartments .
hosts have guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked with customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood on the front front when trust was broken .
there is nothing more sm@@ arter than this calls . it is already hur@@ ts if I only think about it .
&quot; the disappointment that you hear in the voice of the lawyer , and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , I had only a fra@@ ction per problem each of the 123 million . &quot;
for people trust each other .
when trust works , it may arise mar@@ vel . &quot;
one of our guests made holiday in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host went to hospital .
he even don@@ ated blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his assessment :
perfect house for travelers who tend to be due to se@@ ated activities to heart attack .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
Javier and Alej@@ andra are real guardi@@ an that can save one life even though they do not know at all .
&quot; you drive in your own car into the hospital , when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ yp@@ ass . &quot;
&quot; because they do not want that one feels lonely , they bring books passed . &quot;
they can even stay longer without the extra @-@ night charge .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
this is of course not going to run every stay .
but these relations behind the pure money trans@@ action are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share economy .
&quot; when I look for the first time about this term , I asked me : &quot;
how does the thought of sharing with money transaction ?
it is here about an economic trade .
&quot; but it is now just to call &quot; &quot; ten@@ ancy &apos; , the thing will not do justice . &quot;
&quot; share Economy describes a trade , human relationships promises . &quot;
&quot; people put a part of itself , and that changes everything . &quot;
&quot; when one is confused , this is easy to compare with Fast Food . it is efficient and reliable , but for this is less authentic . &quot;
but what would be if traveling a rich buffet from local impressions would be ?
&quot; what would be , if at each place you visited , a group there will be resident that would have to be filled with a thoroughly and one in a Kne@@ ip@@ ent@@ our neighborhood , of which one has never heard before ; &quot;
or if you could learn C@@ ooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
today apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would like to shape apartments of the ground up to the members ?
how would this look like ?
what if cities would accept the thoughts of common ?
&quot; I imagine cities , which allow us to society and relationships , instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and de@@ preci@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in South Korean capital Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking that belong@@ ed to the government , &quot;
were now residents offered . students who were looking for a stay .
&quot; have been convey@@ ed to people whose children were fed , inc@@ ub@@ ator programs have been started , &quot;
&quot; to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . about our platform alone , night 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be a guest at a stran@@ ger or even hosts . &quot;
the idea does not seem to be so crazy as it was taught us .
we did not re@@ invent@@ ed the wheel .
hospitality there was also before .
there were already similar websites before us .
why so does our work work ?
&quot; apart from luck and timing , we realize that you can find the right design with the components of trust . &quot;
design can help us to overcome deeper pre@@ judi@@ ces .
&quot; I find the ast@@ o@@ unding , &quot;
straight to overwhelming .
I have to think about it if a red Maz@@ da is over to me over .
we of course know that design cannot solve any problem .
&quot; but if it could help us if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can be able to use design soon . &quot;
thanks .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a believers ? a expert ?
maybe even a sister .
&quot; sup@@ presses , a bra@@ in@@ washing , a terror@@ ist ? &quot;
or simply a delay in the safety at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I do not give you blame for your negative impressions .
thus the media people represent the same thing as me .
a study revealed that 80 % of the reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show : the Americans think most would no Muslims know .
&quot; probably , people do not talk to their U@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; for all those who have never met a Muslim , It is great to get to know you know . &quot;
I tell you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee @-@ lover -- double es@@ presso , with cream extra . &quot;
I am intro@@ vert@@ ed
a car@@ eg@@ rower @-@ Fitness @-@ Fan@@ at@@ ik@@ or
&quot; and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslims in . &quot;
&quot; but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , for , Baby , I was not so born . &quot;
I decided to do this .
&quot; when I was 17 years old , I met the decision to ou@@ tw@@ ard me . &quot;
&quot; no , not as a hom@@ osex@@ ual person , like some of my friends , but as Muslims in . I chose H@@ ij@@ ab , my head @-@ discovery . &quot;
my femin@@ ist girl@@ friends were hor@@ ri@@ fied : &quot; why do you oppressed you yourself ? &quot;
&quot; the l@@ ust@@ ige was : then it was for me a femin@@ ist independence , and in front of the pressure I felt as a 17 @-@ year @-@ old , I felt a perfect and un@@ reachable beauty deal . &quot;
I have not only accepted the faith of my parents .
I have the Quran .
&quot; I read it , thought , asked in question , doub@@ ted and believed . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
she was trust and slow dev@@ otion that dee@@ pen@@ ed with every reading of the cor@@ ans .
the beauty of rhyth@@ m@@ ics brings me sometimes to crying .
I know myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
&quot; had you ever feel that someone takes you , you fully understand , and yet somehow love ? &quot;
this is how it feels like .
&quot; later I married and started like all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineer . &quot;
&quot; I had later , after my marriage , a child , and lived basically the &quot; &quot; Egyptian @-@ American dream . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then came that terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; I sat in my kitchen , had an early stage , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; rush &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; smoke , air@@ planes flew in building , people sp@@ ran@@ ged from the buildings . &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
&quot; my shock , turned quickly in rebellion . &quot;
why should you do something ?
&quot; I changed the television channel and heard : &quot; &quot; Muslim terrorists , ... &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; bom@@ bs Me@@ kka ! &quot;
&quot; Oh , my God . &quot;
&quot; it has not only been attacked my country but in the N@@ u , the actions of others were transformed into a suspe@@ cts . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , we had to drive through the Middle West of the US to move into a new city and start building up . &quot;
&quot; I remember how I went -- when we went -- as we went in my seat , and I was afraid to be recognized as Muslim . &quot;
&quot; we moved to our apartment in our apartment , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world . &quot;
&quot; and then I heard , I saw and read the warnings of national Islamic organisations , the def@@ endants : &quot; be vig@@ il@@ ant , &quot; &quot; Se@@ ide cau@@ ti@@ ous , &quot; &quot; s@@ ells in good lighted areas , &quot; &quot; vers@@ ing you not . &quot;
I stayed the whole week indo@@ ors .
then it was Friday that week -- the day when Muslims gather to prayer .
&quot; and again the warnings : &quot; &quot; does not go on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
&quot; the feelings were understand@@ ably about , and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or by people who held man for Muslims in the free war and sle@@ w . &quot;
there was really bran@@ ded suggestions on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
&quot; however , something felt not right . &quot;
&quot; because people who had attacked this country , our country had attacked . &quot;
I got the anger of the people on the terrorists .
imagine it ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to continue to explain themselves .
I have nothing against questions . I love questions .
they are the alleg@@ ations that are hard .
nowadays we can actually say people : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims .
when are we going on ? &quot;
some people want to close Muslims and mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tum@@ or in the body of the USA .
it is only the question : are we vic@@ ious or ben@@ ign ?
you know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tum@@ or can be found as a whole and a ben@@ ign tum@@ or only under observation .
the alternatives are meaning@@ less because the question is wrong .
&quot; Muslims are , like any other Americans , no tum@@ or in the body of the US , but a vital organ . &quot;
thank you !
&quot; Muslims are inventor and teachers , educ@@ ators and Olymp@@ ics . &quot;
will the closing of mos@@ ques America safer ?
&quot; there may be a few parking fre@@ el@@ ance , but do not stop the terror . &quot;
regular visit to a mosque leads to view people other faith toler@@ ant and show larger citizen .
&quot; and as I told me a leader of the police in the region of Washington , DC recently told : people are actually not radic@@ alized in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they are radic@@ alised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer .
&quot; in the case of the radi@@ cal@@ ization process , one has found that he does not start online . as the first one that the person believes that the person believes the terrorists are the true Muslims , and everyone who desp@@ ised their behavior and its ideology is a tra@@ itor or by faith . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent radi@@ cal@@ ization , we need to stop the people to go to the mosque . &quot;
some are still saying that Islam is an enormous religion .
&quot; finally , a group like the IS has its brut@@ ality with the Koran . &quot;
&quot; as Muslim in , as a mother , as a man , I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot;
yet we would add to their imagination , if you recognize them as representatives of 1,6 billion believers . &quot;
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Kl@@ ux @-@ Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology reasons on their &quot; Holy book . &quot;
&quot; but if you cast a look at them , they do not drive them to what they are in their &quot; Holy Script@@ ure . &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that makes it possible to read these things into the script@@ ures .
an outstanding Im@@ am told me a amazing story :
&quot; a girl came to him , because she could have imag@@ ined the IS . &quot;
I was really surprised and asked him if they have been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; he said , the problem was exactly the opposite . every spiritual one spoke to the silence , and told her that her wrath would bring their sense of in@@ justice in the world , they only bring into trouble . &quot;
&quot; from nothing inspired and something that had given its anger , it was a main goal for the instrument@@ alization by extrem@@ ists that you speak a solution . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this Im@@ am set the connection to God and their church again . &quot;
&quot; instead of embarrass@@ ed her for her anger , he showed her constructive way for a real change in the world . &quot;
&quot; what they learned in the mosque , it protected from it to complete the IS . &quot;
this was an insight of how the Islam@@ opho@@ bia and my family concerns .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect every other ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear every day affect our democracy on our minds ?
one study -- actually refer to several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : when we fear that at least three things .
&quot; we do not accept an author@@ itative government system , con@@ formity and pre@@ judi@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; a study shows : if you have reported testing messages in which negative about Muslims was reported , it was rather a military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circum@@ cision of the rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not just an academic problem .
&quot; if you look , when the mood against Muslims moved to the top -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terror@@ ist attacks . &quot;
it happened in the field of Ira@@ q@@ war and during two election periods .
&quot; so , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural response to Mos@@ lem terror as I expected it . &quot;
it can actually be a tool to man@@ ipulation the public in order to den@@ oun@@ ced the foundation of a free society which has r@@ ational and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning @-@ sign .
we might feel it as the first but the toxic air of fear hurt us all .
&quot; when assignment of collective school , it is not only about to explain themselves . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was a athl@@ ete .
&quot; he was on the dental medical fac@@ ulty , talented , much promising ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , generous man that she knew . &quot;
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was stun@@ ned and said :
&quot; when is from my fr@@ atern@@ ity , such a yo@@ ung@@ ed young man become ? &quot;
&quot; just a few weeks after visiting Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and his wife , her neighbour , Cra@@ ig Stephen H@@ icks , who was mur@@ dered , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an who was killed in their apartment , as with a execution , after spending the statements against Muslims on his Facebook page . &quot;
he p@@ oured eight times on De@@ ah .
fan@@ at@@ icism can not only be imm@@ oral but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
are we gone to the mosque or stayed for sure at home ?
&quot; we have been doing it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was why America we want to leave our children : one that would like us to control our children , or one in which we can freely exercise our religion . &quot;
we decided to meet the mosque .
&quot; with our son in the children &apos;s house , we went silent , with high pressure on the mosque . &quot;
&quot; I took him out , moved my shoes , went into the prayer hall , and what I saw , let me hold . &quot;
the hall was rest@@ less filled .
&quot; then the Im@@ am made an announcement , deliber@@ ate themselves and was meant to welcome our guests , because half of the gathered were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hist@@ s , credit@@ ors and non @-@ credit@@ ors who had come to us not about us . &quot;
in that moment I am collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had courage and compassion for panic and pre@@ judi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ at@@ icism ?
will you be sure to be sure ?
or will you join those who are mine : we are better than that .
&amp; nbsp ;
thank you nice !
&quot; Helen Wal@@ ters : so , D@@ alia , you seem to hit a min@@ v . &quot;
&quot; but I ask myself , what do you say those who are perhaps say that you are going to work a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thought @-@ in with dr@@ aught , so an exception and not the rule . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say dece@@ ive you . I am completely normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am so usually how it is allowed .
&quot; when one sees to Muslims around the world , and I did that with the largest study carried out by Muslims around the world , people want normal things . &quot;
&quot; they want prosperity for the family , they want to work and they want to live in peace . &quot;
&quot; so , I am in no way an exception . &quot;
&quot; if people like an exception to the rule , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to the rule . &quot;
H@@ W : thanks . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
&quot; what began as a platform for craft@@ ler , is shortly before , one billion business . &quot;
&quot; monitoring , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial drug . possible , this is made in research institutions worldwide . &quot;
&quot; before air pollution , a autonom@@ ous fleet of aircraft in the Fra@@ c Centre in France live in front of a six meters high tower from 1 500 br@@ icks . several years ago they started to fly with rop@@ es . &quot;
&quot; connected air@@ ers , high speed and speed up to eng@@ aging space . &quot;
they can also build self @-@ confident structures .
they have learned to wear loads with tur@@ mo@@ il and generally react to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
&quot; our goal is to exceed the limits of possible in the autonom@@ ous flight . &quot;
&quot; to make a system aut@@ on@@ om , it has to know collect@@ ib@@ id , where in the room you find the mobile objects . &quot;
in our laboratory at the ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects . this allows us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic Tas@@ ks .
&quot; for today &apos;s demo@@ s we use a new locom@@ otive technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , a se@@ ed@@ ling of our lab@@ ors . &quot;
there is no external cameras .
each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in space to determine calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; external commands can be found at the highest eb@@ e . e.g. &quot; &quot; launch &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; land . &quot;
this is a so @-@ called H@@ eck@@ starter
&quot; a flight , that tries to beat two flies with a fl@@ ap . &quot;
&quot; like other Star@@ r@@ flü@@ gler is efficient , much more efficient than hel@@ icopter in all its variations . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to most of the star@@ ters , it can flo@@ at , and it has a large benefits at start and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
however there is always a down@@ side .
a restriction of tail@@ oring is that they react sensitive to tur@@ mo@@ il such as wind@@ mills .
we develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the air conditioning in which position can restore the optimal position and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
&quot; during our research we often introduce some basic abstract questions , which lead to the core of the matter . &quot;
such a question would be for example : what is the petty @-@ possible number of movable parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons to know the answer to such a question .
hel@@ icopter are known about as machines with a thousand movable parts that joined forces to hurt you .
&quot; in front of decades the pilots could fly remote @-@ controlled air devices , which only had two movable parts : a Prop@@ eller and a H@@ eck@@ ru@@ der . &quot;
&quot; recently , we discovered that flies with only one works . &quot;
&quot; this is the moon , the mechan@@ ic simpl@@ er flight . it was recently re@@ invent@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; only one movable part , a Prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; hing@@ es , hing@@ es and cross@@ ings , no further charges or controllers , only a prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechan@@ ically simple , happens in the inner life very much , so that it can fly stable , and move into space . &quot;
&quot; however , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the tail@@ gate . to get it to fly , I have to right it right . &quot;
&quot; the prob@@ ability to take it right correctly when all look , is low , therefore I &apos;ll show you a video that was fil@@ med yesterday evening . &quot;
&quot; if the moon is a exercise in ind@@ ul@@ sion , this machine is here , the Om@@ nik@@ opter with its eight prop@@ ellers , a exercise in abundance . &quot;
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that he is not symmet@@ rical .
that is why he is amb@@ ivalent in his direction .
&quot; thus , he receives the occas@@ ional ability , &quot;
&quot; move into space in all directions , no matter what he is fil@@ med or even as he rot@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers . &quot;
&quot; some is conce@@ iv@@ able in models , the rest will learn directly at the fly . &quot;
let &apos;s see that .
&quot; if air@@ ers should be part of our daily life , they must be extremely safe and reliable . &quot;
this machine here consists of two separate two @-@ prop@@ ellers machines .
this turns on cl@@ ock@@ wise
and the others against the cl@@ ock@@ wise .
&quot; if you build them , they beh@@ ave like a high @-@ performance @-@ Quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; however , something wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller comes out , the electronics or a battery can fly on , if limited . &quot;
we will now demonstrate that we make a half air@@ plane .
the last demonstration exam@@ ines synth@@ etic weak@@ ening .
the large number of autonom@@ ous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression . &quot;
we took the usual Micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each individual weighs less than one disc bread -- and im@@ bur@@ sts them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
&quot; every unit is white , where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit . &quot;
hopefully you will motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the especially secure machine da dr@@ practice would like to get a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
naturally it is difficult to predi@@ ct the influence of this technology .
for types such as us is the reward in development and creation .
&quot; it serves as a memory , how wonderful and magical our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever creatures allowed to form them in so spectacular way . &quot;
&quot; the fact that this technology has such massive and economic potential , the bag is on the i . &quot;
&amp; nbsp ;
&quot; in a very far distant galax@@ y two black holes in a very far distant galax@@ y , two black holes are always faster , you walked so the mass dre@@ aming prob@@ es in a t@@ apping of pure energy . &quot;
this short moment they were bright@@ er than all the stars in all galax@@ ies of the whole of us known .
it was a very big knee .
but your energy put them not in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into the space @-@ time tissue itself and the universe explo@@ ded in Gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we arrange the events first time .
1.3 billion years ago there was a considerable life on the earth just several years ago .
&quot; since then the earth has a lot to emphas@@ ized : cor@@ als , fish , plants , SA@@ U@@ RI@@ ER , people and -- God stand up with -- even the internet . &quot;
&quot; about 25 years ago , a group especially cour@@ ageous -- R@@ ai Weiss from MIT , K@@ ip Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver from the Cal@@ tech -- to build a huge laser det@@ ector to arise after gra@@ vit@@ ational black holes . &quot;
most they thought it for crazy .
&quot; but enough people recognized it as crazy gen@@ ies , so that the US National Science Foundation is financing its idea . &quot;
&quot; after decades of development , design , conception and extremely much hard work they built the det@@ ector LI@@ GO : the laser inter@@ fer@@ omet@@ er- gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ observ@@ atory . &quot;
in the following time the precision of LI@@ GO could be considerably increased from LI@@ GO what the recogn@@ izing performance enorm@@ ously improved .
therefore it is called Advanced LI@@ GO .
&quot; at the beginning of September 2015 , LI@@ GO was started to clear some smaller , hard @-@ st@@ ub@@ born problems . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the commissioning of the det@@ ector , smo@@ ked the gra@@ vit@@ ational black holes through the ground . &quot;
you went through you and me
and also through the det@@ ector .
Scott Hug@@ hes : just two moments in my life were emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the fare@@ well from my to@@ d@@ kran@@ e father .
basically they were the fruits of my life .
&quot; all that which I had worked , is no longer science @-@ fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hug@@ hes , theoretical phys@@ ic@@ ists at MIT . he has been investigated for 23 years of gravity as LI@@ GO meas@@ urable signals . but what are Gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves ? &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a mar@@ vel@@ ing in the space of space and time .
&quot; when temporarily the wave , the space and its overall content is stretched into one direction and put into the other . &quot;
to illustr@@ ating do@@ z@@ ents lead to cur@@ ative theory often a really al@@ ber@@ ish dance .
&quot; stretching and shr@@ ink , stretch and shr@@ ubs . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that Gra@@ vit@@ ational sw@@ elling is extremely weak , even ridicul@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September , for example , each of us was stretched out of the waves of the waves and is stretched . the stretching of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; this is called 20 Nul@@ ing after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . Dar@@ um explained the LI@@ GO staff for crazy . &quot;
&quot; with a five kilometres long laser det@@ ector , and this is absurd , this length should be measured on less than a thousand of radius of an atomic nucle@@ us . this is gray . &quot;
at the end of his classic text about gra@@ v@@ itation
&quot; described K@@ ip Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder LI@@ GO@@ s , the hunt for the waves : &quot; &quot; the technical difficulties in the construction of such det@@ ectors are enormous . &quot;
&quot; but phys@@ ic@@ ists are invent@@ ory , and with the support of the public will certainly be overcome all obstacles . &quot;
&quot; Thor@@ ne released this 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot;
&quot; back to LI@@ GO . Scott says , LI@@ GO was more than an eye . &quot;
I want to explain what this means .
&quot; visible light has a wav@@ el@@ ength , which is much smaller than the things around us : facial hair , the size of your mobile phones . &quot;
this is quite convenient . for so you can produce a picture or a map of things by taking one of several points coming light around you .
when killing is that different .
audi@@ ble tones have a wav@@ el@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
&quot; therefore it is very difficult , actually impossible to manufacture a picture of things that do not mean you much more : &quot;
the face of your child approximately .
&quot; instead , we listen to certain properties like ton@@ ic and height , rhythm and volume to close the history behind it . &quot;
&quot; now , Alice speaks Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob inter@@ rup@@ ts them . &quot;
&quot; du@@ mmer Bob . &quot;
the same applies to Gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we can do not produce a simple image of objects in all objects .
&quot; but by changes in the ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can hear their stories . &quot;
at least lie for LI@@ GO the measured frequencies in the audi@@ ble area .
&quot; so , when we convert wav@@ e@@ pattern in sch@@ all , we can hear the All literally . &quot;
&quot; the gra@@ v@@ itation to listen , can give us a lot about the coll@@ ision of two black holes , which my colleague Scott has already been very long busy . &quot;
&quot; SH : two black , not rotating holes , circul@@ ates simply : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
turning the two bodies very quickly , you can hear the same sc@@ ru@@ ps with an additional key change . that sounds like this : Wu @-@ Wu @-@ Wu @-@ Wu @-@ Wu ! &quot;
it is a sort of movement used in the wav@@ e@@ form .
&quot; AA : on 14 September 2015 -- a date that is at least I never forget -- heard LI@@ GO Fol@@ der : &#91; Sur@@ ren@@ des sound &#93; Jem@@ and , who knows how to hear this as the noise of -- SH : ... two black holes with a 30 @-@ fold solar mass that can turn around as fast as the sticks of your mi@@ xer . &quot;
AA : superior to us briefly what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the dense body in all , one with a mass of 29 probe , the other with a mass of 36 probe , sur@@ rounds the one hundred times a second , before they col@@ li@@ de . &quot;
imagine these forces before .
fantastic .
and we know that because we heard it .
therein lies the permanent importance of LI@@ GO .
&quot; LI@@ GO has a completely new path for the study of the cosmos , as it has never been possible before . &quot;
on this way we can hear the All @-@ listen and the invisible .
much in all we can -- practical or basically -- not see .
&quot; a Super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ e@@ iche stars in Super@@ nov@@ ae explo@@ de . &quot;
they are very useful . of them we learned much about the Universe .
&quot; but the thr@@ illing physical processes are happening in the core , which is behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and sil@@ icon . &quot;
we will never pass through because these op@@ ak are .
&quot; Gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves penet@@ rate iron , as if it would be transparent glass . the Ur@@ kn@@ all : I would never see the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see them since the urine was covered by its own offspring . &quot;
&quot; using Gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , it should be possible until the beginning back to the beginning . &quot;
&quot; and that probably the most important thing : I am optim@@ istic that in all things we have never seen , which we never have never seen and of which we have no idea to discover . things we want to discover . &quot;
&quot; in fact , LI@@ GO found equal in the first sight of things that we did not expect . &quot;
&quot; my colleague at MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the LI@@ GO project , says to this topic : me : the kind of stars , the black holes , as LI@@ GO they watch , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe . &quot;
they are enormous , ancient body of prehistoric times . the black holes are so to speak for our arche@@ ological work . &quot;
&quot; LI@@ GO gives us a completely different angle of view to the events of the Universe , on the emergence of the stars and ultimately on how we went out of this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge is now to be as cour@@ ageous as possible .
&quot; thanks to LI@@ GO , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the rust@@ ling and circles of the cosmos . &quot;
we need ideas for new observ@@ atory -- a brand new generation of observ@@ atory on Earth and in all .
because what could be more beautiful than the urine itself ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thanks .
some time I tried an experiment .
&quot; one year long I would say to all &quot; yes ! &quot; &quot; before I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; no matter if it made me nervous , brought me in unpleasant situations , I forced me to say &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
did I want to speak in the public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
I wanted to be live on TV ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to start playing with the spect@@ acle ?
&quot; no , no , no , but yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a crazy thing happened : exactly that do , w@@ ov@@ or I fe@@ ared , removed my fear . &quot;
&quot; to keep my fear , spe@@ e@@ ches , my social fear -- pu@@ ff . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , my life changed . &quot;
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
&quot; but there was a particular Yes , which my life was deeply changed , on an un@@ expect@@ edly . it started with a question of my youngest . &quot;
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the youngest , is of in@@ explic@@ able reasons all &quot; &quot; kitt@@ ens , &quot;
as if they were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; kitt@@ ens , I need milk for my beak . &quot;
&quot; she asked me once , if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; yes . &quot; &quot;
this yes was the beginning
&quot; in my family . from there I took me to play with them , as soon as you are asking me to do . no matter what I just do , or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time . &quot;
almost . I am not perfect but I am trying .
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , to my children , to our family . &quot;
&quot; but it also has an ast@@ o@@ unding side @-@ effect : only before short I was actually completely , that the &quot; Yes &quot; sent@@ iment for playing with my children my career saved . &quot;
I have a real dream job .
I am author . I think of things I guess you to live .

no .
I am a tit@@ anium .
zack7.com / index.php ? ID _ lang = 1
I create television . I have produced television .
&quot; I do television , in great style . &quot;
in this TV season I am responsible for it to get out 70 hours of program into the world .
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours TV . three to four shows are simultaneously in production . &quot;
each shipment offers hundreds of jobs that have not existed before .
the budget for a episode of a TV set can be between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
&quot; a new episode every nine days of four shows , so all nine days 20 million dollar television , four television programs , 3 hours TV , three programmes that simultaneously in production are , times four , 16 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours TV , &quot;
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my TV shows on Thursday evening .
&quot; throughout the world , my series are running in 256 regions for 30 million spect@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are ship@@ ments which I create themselves , and not only produced , so still ob@@ s@@ able . I must find time , really silent , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four television series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fire that burn around the world . &quot;
do you know who this is still doing ?
&quot; no one , therefore I am a tit@@ anium . &quot;

I would not like to impress you with it .
&quot; I say it , because I know what you think if the word &quot; author . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I say to you , so all of you who work as hard as if I speak to a company , a country or a household to take me seriously if I say not only on the computer ro@@ uting and fant@@ as@@ iere , and it is true when I say , I understand that it is not about dreams about dreams . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s all a job , all work , all the reality , all the blood , all swe@@ at -- no tears . &quot;
I work much too hard and I love it .
&quot; if I am deeply dee@@ pen@@ ed into the work , there is no other feeling . &quot;
my work always creates a country out of nowhere .
&quot; it is , when I set troops up , when did I put on a canvas . &quot;
&quot; as a portrait you have a high note , a mar@@ athon . &quot;
you feel like Be@@ yon@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
&quot; it is creative , mechan@@ ic , exhau@@ sting , and in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ating , clin@@ ically and mother@@ ly , cruel and reasonable . and the best thing about it is the su@@ ms . &quot;
there is such a change in me when working works well .
&quot; a sum@@ ms begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the su@@ ms hear like a lively street , I could always drive on it . &quot;
&quot; many people take part , when I speak to them the su@@ ms that I speak over@@ s , that I am writing a pleasure for writing . &quot;
do not understand me wrong that does it .
&quot; but the Sum@@ ms -- when I began to work with the TV @-@ production , when I began to work and work , to create and collabor@@ ate , I discovered this thing , this su@@ ms , this energy . the su@@ ms ! &quot;
the Sum@@ ms is more than writing .
the su@@ ms is action and activity . the su@@ ms is a drug .
the su@@ ms is music . the su@@ ms is light and air .
the su@@ ms is the voice of God in my ear .
&quot; and if you have such a sw@@ amp , then you can not strive other than after size . &quot;
&quot; the feeling not to be able to strive , than after size , no matter what price . &quot;
this is what is called the su@@ ms .
or perhaps it also means a work@@ ah@@ olic .
perhaps it is called Genius .
perhaps it is ego .
maybe it is the fear of fear .
I do not know it .
&quot; I know only that I am not made for failure , and I know only that I love the su@@ ms . &quot;
&quot; I will only say to you , I am a Titan , and I know that I will not ask it into question . &quot;
&quot; in order to make a clear question : the more successful I will , the more episodes , the more work , the more things there , the more things more , the more things , the more I write history , the more expectations . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to be successful , the more you have to work . &quot;
and what did I say about work ?
&quot; I love work , not true ? &quot;
&quot; the land , which I create , the mar@@ athon , the mar@@ athon , the army , the canvas , the high sound , the su@@ ms , the su@@ ms , the su@@ ms . &quot;
I like this su@@ ms . I love the su@@ ms .
I need the su@@ ms . I am the su@@ ms .
am I just this su@@ ms ?
and then st@@ opp@@ ed the su@@ ms .
&quot; revised , ex@@ agger@@ ated , ex@@ agger@@ ated , ex@@ agger@@ ated . &quot;
the su@@ ms st@@ ub@@ te .
now my three daughters are acc@@ ustom@@ ed to the truth that their mom@@ my is a single working title .
&quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my m@@ om will not be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; and Emer@@ son said , &quot; Sh@@ aring , I would like to go to Sh@@ onda country . &quot;
there are the children of a Tit@@ ans .
you are Baby @-@ Tit@@ ans .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the Sum@@ mer@@ men heard . &quot;
the su@@ ms of the engine Ver@@ st@@ um@@ m@@ te .
I did not loved my work anymore . the engine was out .
the su@@ ms came not back .
my Sum@@ ms was broken .
&quot; I made the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ day , crossed weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , no re@@ mor@@ se , no re@@ mor@@ se , does not exist , with full heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no su@@ ms .
in me was silence .
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , at times four . &quot;
&quot; TV @-@ TV , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ... &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a pre@@ show @-@ tit@@ anium
&quot; everything was grey , I just had no fun anymore . &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the Sum@@ ms and the su@@ ms I was .
&quot; so what do you do if what you do , the work that you love , suddenly f@@ aded ? &quot;
&quot; I know , some may think : &quot; He@@ ul you out , thanks to the author &apos;s tit@@ anium . &quot;
&quot; but you know how to do it , one does one , you love to be a teacher , a painter , Bill Gates , you just love one another and that gives a painter , a painter , Bill Gates , and knows how to stop the Sum@@ ms , when the Sum@@ ms stop , who is one then ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; when the song of my heart ce@@ ases , I can survive in silence ? &quot;
and then my &quot; southern states @-@ wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; is a question .
&quot; I am on the way out there , late off and she says : &quot; &quot; m@@ om , do you play ? &quot;
and I want to say No things when I are aware of two things :
&quot; first , I have to say yes to everything and secondly , they called me not &quot; . &quot; &quot;
it does not call anyone more &quot; kitt@@ ens . &quot;
when is this happens ?
&quot; I promise it , when I am Titan bin and my sum@@ mers , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says : &quot; &quot; m@@ om , do you play ? &quot;
&quot; and I say , &quot; yes . &quot;
there is nothing special .
&quot; we play and meet her sisters , we lau@@ gh a lot and I read completely dramatically from the book &quot; &quot; Su@@ po@@ ops &quot; . &quot; &quot;
nothing exceptional .
&quot; but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic , in the lon@@ el@@ iness and absence of the Sum@@ mary , I can do nothing but to fit . &quot;
I am foc@@ uss@@ ed .
I am quiet .
&quot; the country I create , the mar@@ athon , the mar@@ athon , the army , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they do not exist anymore . &quot;
&quot; everything that exists are st@@ icky fingers and wet k@@ isses , delicate voices , wax pins , and the song , in which it comes to Los@@ ers , or whatever the girl in &quot; Die Eis@@ royal &quot; . &quot; &quot;
peace and simplicity .
the air at this place is so little that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
play is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something in me solve .
a mental door goes to and an energy ch@@ ub comes in .
&quot; and that not immediately , but it happens . &quot;
I feel it .
the su@@ ms comes slowly back .
&quot; no full volume , hardly there , it is quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there . &quot;
&quot; not the su@@ ms , but a su@@ ms . &quot;
&quot; and now I feel myself , as I would know a magic secret . &quot;
but let us remain in the matter .
it is love . this is all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
&quot; Sum@@ ms , the work@@ men , the fix@@ ture , which is only the replacement . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , when I do I describe my brain , and how functioning my brain , then I forgot what the real su@@ ms . &quot;
the su@@ ms is not a force and it is not work @-@ specific .
it is from joy dependent .
the real su@@ ms is dependent on love .
the su@@ ms is the current that comes from the life .
the real su@@ ms is self @-@ confidence and peace .
&quot; the real su@@ ms igno@@ res the pressure of the story , the expect@@ ation and pressure . &quot;
the real su@@ ms is simple and original .
&quot; the real su@@ ms is the voice of my ear , but perhaps whis@@ per@@ ed me the wrong words , for which God said to me , that I am a Titan bin ? &quot;
it is just love .
&quot; we all need a bit more love , a lot more love . &quot;
&quot; as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will tell you yes . &quot;
I usually do this as a rule that I can free myself as a work@@ ah@@ olic of any debt .
&quot; it is law , I have no other choice . I have no other choice when I want to hear the su@@ ms . &quot;
&quot; I wish , it would be so easy . I am not good in games , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
&quot; play it is not resident , such as work . &quot;
&quot; the truth does hurt , &quot;
but I do not like to play it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer to work at the workplace than in home .
&quot; this con@@ cession is painful , because what a person does better work than to be home ? &quot;
&quot; yes , I . &quot;
&quot; honest@@ ly , I call myself &quot; &quot; Titan &quot; &quot; -- &quot;
I have to have problems .
&quot; that I am too relaxed , is none of them . &quot;
&quot; we sw@@ en in the garden around , and back , and forth . &quot;
we make small dance parties ;
we sing and play ball .
we bur@@ sting soap bub@@ bles .
&quot; thereby , I feel mostly st@@ iff , ab@@ sent and confused . &quot;
I always gre@@ ase in my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
&quot; my children show me how to live , and the su@@ ms of the universe met me . &quot;
I play and play until I ask myself : why did we hear about playing ?
you can also ! say it more and then Yes if your child wants to play with you .
perhaps keep me for na@@ ï@@ ve for a day@@ dre@@ amer .
&quot; right now , you have probably right , but you can do it ! &quot;
you have time !
and you also know why ? you are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a M@@ up@@ pet show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
&quot; my little ones want to play at most 15 minutes with me , until they ev@@ ap@@ ed that they want something different . &quot;
&quot; it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
after 15 minutes there will be a lad@@ le be@@ et@@ le or Ke@@ ks .
&quot; and speak my Teen@@ ie @-@ daughter for all 15 minutes long with me , I am mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; there are only 15 minutes , more needs it not . &quot;
&quot; everyone can bring 15 minutes a piece , even at a ve@@ il @-@ wh@@ ale @-@ day ! &quot;
15 minutes on the piece !
&quot; no mobile , no laundry , no dist@@ ortion . &quot;
the day is short : dinner , the kids will be ready . &quot;
but 15 minutes are inside !
&quot; my children are my wellbeing , my world . it does not need to be the children . it applies to feel the su@@ ms to have a place for his soul peace . &quot;
it does not go to play with their own children . it is about joy , &quot;
about the &quot; Games &quot; in general .
get the 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
find out and keep it out .
&quot; I am not perfect in it . I sche@@ it@@ ere and I &apos;ll see . friends meet , books read , enjoy the day -- &quot;
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; is short for everything I got up when I got my first TV show , when I wanted to make a Titan in the training when I wanted to meet myself more and more . &quot;
15 minutes on the piece of why not full 15 minutes walk ?
what can it be wrong ? nothing !
the su@@ ms came back in my spare time . the su@@ ms seems to return if I do not work .
working does not work without games .
&quot; it needs time , but after a few months opens a door , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office . I listen to new ideas . I se@@ du@@ ce me to new ideas . I se@@ ize it in full journeys and love my work again . &quot;
&quot; I like the su@@ ms , but I do not love it . &quot;
I do not need it .
&quot; I am not the su@@ ms , the su@@ ms , is not me ... not anymore . &quot;
soap bub@@ bles and st@@ icky fingers , dinner with friends . &quot;
this is now my su@@ ms .
the su@@ ms of life .
the su@@ ms of Love .
&quot; the Sum@@ ms of the work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so grateful . &quot;
it is sn@@ up@@ pe to me that I am a tit@@ anium . I have never seen a Titan Poker trip to Jerusalem .
I said Yes to less work and to more games .
and nevertheless I have everything under control . my brain is still functional . my camp@@ fire burn .
&quot; the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel as good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more clear is my head . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the su@@ ms . the land which I sh@@ ake , the mar@@ vel , the can@@ did , the su@@ ms , the su@@ ms , the su@@ ms , the other , the right su@@ ms , the su@@ ms of life . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this sum@@ men , the more makes this unusual , griev@@ ing , naked and new life feeling in me wide . less Titan -- More I ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel exactly this sum@@ men , the more I know who I am . &quot;
I am author . I think of things I guess you to live .
&quot; this belongs to the job , which means to live his dream . &quot;
&quot; this is the dream of this jobs , &quot;
for a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
I said &quot; Yes &quot; to less work and to more games .
Tit@@ ans have no chance .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you nice .
I am Neuro@@ surgery .
how most of my colleagues have to do every day with human tr@@ age@@ dies .
&quot; I know how to change your life from one second to the other , after a serious stroke , or after an car accident . &quot;
&quot; for us neuro@@ surgeon , it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other bodi@@ ly organs , a very low capacity for self @-@ healing . &quot;
&quot; after a severe violation of the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , heavy disability . &quot;
this is probably the reason why I work functional neuro@@ surgery .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the ner@@ ve functions by different surgical measures .
&quot; surely they have heard from one of the most famous , the &quot; &quot; dr@@ enh@@ ir@@ n@@ aires &quot; . &quot; there is a electro@@ de deep inside the brain , to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons so that the neuro@@ logical function is improved . &quot;
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Park@@ in@@ son who suffered severe trem@@ bling and severe pain .
&quot; however , Neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ healing . &quot;
the dream of functional neuro@@ surgeon is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to you .
with something help the brain can help herself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was condu@@ ctive su@@ perf@@ icial and worked day and night in the emergency .
often I used patients with sk@@ ull @-@ Hir@@ n trau@@ ma .
you need to imagine that at Schä@@ del @-@ Hir@@ n @-@ Trau@@ mat@@ a the brain an@@ cho@@ red and the cran@@ ial pressure asc@@ ending .
&quot; to save life , one must decrease the cran@@ ial pressure . &quot;
it is sometimes necessary to remove some of a s@@ wollen deer .
&quot; instead , instead , we decided to cast us with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist , the brain &apos;s mass . &quot;
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
&quot; cells grow from a tissue , comparable to all small children who are taken out of your families . &quot;
&quot; you have to find the right diet , temperature , moisture and environments to let them thri@@ ve . &quot;
that is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many re@@ locate it Jean @-@ François .
this he looked under his micro@@ scope .
it was a great surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked like a tri@@ but@@ ary culture . with big green cells , which are surrounded by small , un@@ mature cells . &quot;
perhaps you still know from the Biolog@@ ie@@ tu@@ ition that stem cells are un@@ ri@@ pe cells that can transform itself in any cell type of the organism .
&quot; the adult brain has tri@@ but@@ t cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small n@@ iches of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising to get this kind of tri@@ bal cells from the surface tissue in the surgery .
we made a further captiv@@ ating observation : normal tri@@ bal cells are very active -- they are very fast .
they never die ; they are immort@@ al .
but these cells negle@@ cted differently .
they are slowly and after a couple of weeks they died even .
&quot; so we saw a new , strange cell population that looked like tri@@ bal cells but was different . &quot;
we needed a long time to understand where they came .
they come from these cells .
this blue and red cells are called Dou@@ ble@@ cort@@ ine @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our grand@@ hir@@ och@@ ial cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the fet@@ us they ensure the folding of the brain .
but why are they left us ?
we do not know that .
&quot; we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentr@@ ations close to brain inj@@ uries . &quot;
but this is not so safe .
one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells .
we stand in front of a potential cell source which allows bra@@ in@@ healing .
this we had to prove .
&quot; so we decided to develop an experiment . &quot;
we wanted to take a piece of brain mass out of the non @-@ speaking area and then the cells exactly so cultiv@@ ate as it did Jean @-@ François .
then they will highlight them in the brain in order to follow them in the brain .
in the last step we moved them to the det@@ ri@@ al of the same individuality .
we call the aut@@ ologist tran@@ splant@@ ation -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splant@@ ation .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we stimul@@ ate these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we re@@ inde@@ struct@@ ing the same cells in busy brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we were able to work with monkey .
&quot; in the first scenario we re@@ directed the cells into a whol@@ esome brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they had disappeared again , they go back home . the room is already occupied , they will not be used there , so they disappear . &quot;
in the second scenario we added a injury to and re@@ directed exactly the same cells and now the cells have retain@@ ed to mature neur@@ ons .
here you can see what we could watch under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were re@@ directed .
the proof that they show are these small points . these are the cells that we are in vit@@ ro in the culture .
here we were not able to stop .
help these cells to recover from a stroke ?
&quot; so , we trained monkeys with a manual skill . &quot;
you had to take food pell@@ ets from a tray .
this made them very good .
&quot; when she had achieved a stable skill level , we owe it to the motor@@ ic Cor@@ tex the hand@@ motor@@ ic field . &quot;
&quot; then , the monkeys were par@@ alys@@ ed , they could no longer move their hand . &quot;
&quot; just as it would happen to people , they recovered spont@@ aneously up to a certain degree , just like after a stroke . &quot;
patients are par@@ alys@@ ed and then try to relax with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . you can relax at a certain extent just as the monkey .
&quot; when we were sure that the monkey had achieved its degree of spontaneous recovery , we implant his own cells . &quot;
on the left side they see the monkeys that spont@@ aneously recovered .
it can be around 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from before injury .
he is not as precise and not so fast .
&quot; now let us now see the cells re@@ directed : the same monkey , two months after the implant . &quot;
I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can use it free@@ zing and later .
we can use them in other neuro@@ path@@ ological models for example at Park@@ in@@ son .
&quot; but our dream is still to implant , and to implant . &quot;
&quot; I really hope to show you soon , as we can see the human brain the means to heal themselves . &quot;
&amp; nbsp ;
&quot; Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ yne that is wonderful , I am sure that just several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who need that need . &quot;
I definitely .
&quot; of course , the question of what are the greatest obstacles before you can begin clinical trials at people . &quot;
J@@ oc@@ el@@ yne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results you have to fill about two kil@@ ograms of papers and forms to run these kinds of studies .
BG : this is understand@@ able that the brain is very delicate , etc . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team . &quot;
&quot; BG : look into the future -- you have completed the research and try to get the permission to start the clinical trials . if you continue to get into the future , how many years will take it to hospital and this therapy will be available . &quot;
J@@ B : this is difficult to say .
&quot; first , it depends on the approval of clinical trial . &quot;
will it allow us to start the authority to start it soon ?
then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients .
&quot; it has a long time to choose the patients to perform and evaluate treatments , whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment . &quot;
then you have to apply this to a multi@@ centric study .
&quot; you have to truly prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone . &quot;
&quot; BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course . &quot;
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ yne thank you for your visit at TED and that you tell us about it .
BG : thanks .
democracy .
we in the west make a big mistake to consider it as a matter of course .
&quot; we do not see democracy as the break@@ able plant that is in reality , but as invent@@ ory of our society . &quot;
we tend to consider them as un@@ altered war@@ dness .
we believe that capitalism leads to democracy .
this is true not .
Lee Ku@@ an Ye@@ w from Singapore and his great im@@ ah@@ mer in Beijing have dou@@ bt@@ less proven that it is quite possible to have a blo@@ oming capitalism and impressive growth while politics is completely in@@ democratic .
&quot; indeed , democracy against us , in Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- became clear to me as a finance minister in the Euro@@ group -- our elections -- not influence the austerity @-@ programs , which have been realized in Greece . &quot;
&quot; in this moment I thought that there might be no better just@@ ification for Lee Ku@@ an Ye@@ v , or the Communist Party , who would be repeated that democracy would be abol@@ ished when they change anything . &quot;
at this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy .
&quot; I ask you , together with me , back to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Ye@@ w , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of a mistake , we could save the democracy , but that we need a truly stronger and awesome democracy . &quot;
&quot; for without democracy our societies will be wast@@ ed our societies , our future glo@@ omy and our great , new technologies . &quot;
&quot; on the subject of waste , I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction that is currently threatened with our economies . &quot;
I call it the &quot; T@@ ings@@ gi@@ Summit @-@ Parad@@ ox . &quot;
&quot; a summit is known to you . you know and recognize it as the Schul@@ the@@ berg , who raises its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we all recognise the Schul@@ the@@ berg , &quot;
but only a few recogn@@ izing his toes .
&quot; a mountain of in@@ sufficient cash , which belongs to the contamin@@ ated as@@ parag@@ us and corporations , who could get there to invest where it would be productive and in@@ comes to produce all things that humanity is urgently needed , for example &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; in the past 3 months in the United States , in England and in the euro@@ zone , five tr@@ illion dollars are invested in all the prosperity produced goods , such as industrial facilities , machines , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , tracks , and so on and so on . &quot;
&quot; 3,4 bill@@ ions U.S. dollar sounds like a lot of money , until you do it with the 5,@@ 1 tr@@ illion US dollars , which were at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing to do except the cap@@ ers and the real estate prices . &quot;
&quot; thus , debt and un@@ productive capital has not formed the tw@@ ings@@ gi@@ ates , which is not equal to the usual market mechanisms by the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result are st@@ agn@@ ant wages , more than one quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ old in the U.S. , Japan and Europe are increasingly difficult to promote this itself . &quot;
ins@@ ol@@ ated the circumstances will cause that o@@ iled him k@@ ills him .
this is my ha@@ dern with capitalism --
&quot; all of the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , human talents , and especially all the technologies to finance , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the rescue of the earth . &quot;
so is democracy the solution ?
I think so . but before we proceed : what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ eles defined democracy as the corporate form , in the open and poor as a majority to control the government . &quot;
the Ath@@ en@@ ian Democracy closed from course too many --
&quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , it would be a mistake , the importance of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy due to this trigger . &quot;
&quot; the decision @-@ making at the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that they gave up the working arms , and not only the right to freedom of expression , but more important and more important that they were the right to political co @-@ determination with the same pro@@ xy in questions of citiz@@ enship . &quot;
the Ath@@ en@@ ian Democracy has not been held for a long time --
&quot; like a candle , which is very lumin@@ ous , it is also fast burned . &quot;
&quot; however , our current liberal democrat@@ s have not their roots in the ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American Constitution . &quot;
&quot; while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy focused on the free citizens , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for the ruling class . &quot;
&quot; for the liberal democracy came only up , as a complete separation of politics and business is possible and the democratic process was confin@@ ed to politics , while the economy -- thus the world of corporations -- a democrat@@ ically @-@ free zone . &quot;
&quot; in our present demo@@ cr@@ acies has been held in our present demo@@ cr@@ acies since the time , in which this separation of politics and economy began to inter@@ play an un@@ inher@@ ent struggle between the two , taking the economy gradually to the policy . &quot;
wonders why the politicians are no longer such as before ?
it is not in a de@@ generation of their DNA .
&quot; it is that one can be in the government nowadays and still not in power , because the power of politics is in the economy , and the areas are separated . &quot;
I mentioned my ha@@ ste with capitalism .
&quot; if you think about it , it is about like a her@@ d of carn@@ iv@@ ores , so sustain@@ ing the animals , of which they nour@@ ished , dec@@ im@@ ated them at the end . &quot;
&quot; similarly , it is similar to the economy that has known politics as far as far as it increases . the power of corporations increases , political goods will be st@@ amped , the im@@ balance increases , the overall economic demand falls and the managing directors of the corporations are to be displac@@ ed to invest the cash of their company . &quot;
&quot; the more successful capitalism the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; &#91; the people &#93; from democracy s@@ ells , the higher the tw@@ ins of human labour @-@ power and the greater the waste of human labour @-@ power and the prosperity of humanity . &quot;
&quot; if that is true , it is obvious that we must bring together the policy and the economy , and it would be better , if the &apos; Dem@@ os &apos; control reserves , just like in the ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot;
this is by the way no new idea .
the Marxist Left had this idea already 100 years ago and it was@@ n &apos;t really good .
&quot; the teaching from the deb@@ acle of the Soviet Union should be that the working arms only re@@ produce a position like in the ancient Athens , without creating new types of brut@@ ality and wast@@ age . &quot;
but there is a solution : the working arms desc@@ ending !
capitalism is doing it by being re@@ warding due to automation and robots .
&quot; the problem is , so long economy and politics separate areas are higher , the automation summit can be higher , the wast@@ age , and social conflicts deeper , just as I think -- in countries such as China will come . &quot;
&quot; so we have to shape the economy and re@@ unite the economy and politics , and make sure that we call the re@@ united area democrat@@ isation , otherwise we end the film &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; as a documentation . &quot;
&quot; so the question is not , whether capitalism has brought the technical achievements , which he has produced , will survive -- &quot;
&quot; the more interesting question is whether capitalism is similar to capitalism by a d@@ yst@@ opia , similar to the people in &quot; &quot; Star Trek &quot; , &quot; in the machines to serve the people and people put their energy into the research of the universe , or into a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ ener &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long talks to the sense of life fr@@ y . &quot;
I believe we may be optim@@ istic .
&quot; so what would it be , how could it look like this &quot; Star Trek &quot; -@@ like Ut@@ opia rather than the &quot; &quot; Matrix &quot; &quot; similar D@@ yst@@ opia ? &quot;
&quot; in practical implementation I want to tell you , in all soon , some examples call . &quot;
&quot; in the field of companies : please enter a capital market in which you deserve money while you work and in which your capital follows you from one working point to the next , and the company -- no matter what one is currently working -- is property of those who currently working in the company . &quot;
then all income from capital and deliver@@ ance and the concept of wage work is completely over@@ hau@@ led .
&quot; no distinction between those who belong to the companies , but do not work in it , and employees who work there , but no major g@@ aps between investment and labour , and ultimately no em@@ ble@@ rag@@ ing tw@@ ings@@ gi@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; in the field of global political economy , please imagine that our national currencies should have a free flo@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency that will be issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interest of all humanity . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , you continue to negoti@@ ated the entire world trade in this currency -- we call it &quot; the cosmos &quot; , &quot; in units of &quot; &quot; cosmos &quot; &quot; -- and any government pays the sum that corresponds to the commercial def@@ icit or trade over@@ lap of the respective country into a common fund . &quot;
&quot; also imagine that these funds are invested in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world , in which investment funds are rare . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically that what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes was proposed in the Bret@@ ton Woods Conference from 1944 .
the problem was that at that time one had not had the technical means to implement it .
&quot; today , we have it , especially in front of the background of a re@@ united politics and business . &quot;
&quot; the world that I describe you , is at the same time liberal , in which it is privileged , and Marxist because they buried the separation of capital and work in the dust@@ bin of history , and key@@ nes@@ ian , globally key@@ nes@@ ian . &quot;
but above all others it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy .
we will aw@@ aken in such a world
or will we merge into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar D@@ yst@@ opia ?
the answer depends on how we decide in political .
&quot; it is in our hands , and we do it better democratic . &quot;
thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Y@@ anis ...
you do descri@@ p@@ tive yourself in your biography itself as liberal Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
&quot; Y@@ anis Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something from what I just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant . &quot;
&quot; the reason for re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... doing this not , the technological development will produce such a massive decline in the overall economic demand that Larry Sum@@ mers as &quot; long term st@@ agn@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; through the transfer of this crisis on the next , as we will experience it , it will not only be our demo@@ cr@@ acies but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is true , Marx is quite relevant , &quot;
&quot; as well as Hay@@ ek , this is why I am a liber@@ t@@ ful Marxist , and how Key@@ nes , and that is why I am also perfect . &quot;
&quot; BG : actually , and now we are probably also . &quot;
Y@@ V : if you are not wir@@ r you don &apos;t think enough .
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosoph@@ ical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein that said . BG : in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of speakers you have very clearly what you think of the view of the West on China . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hyp@@ oc@@ ris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cr@@ acies we have the assum@@ ing of a democracy .
&quot; as I said in my talk , we have limited democracy on politics during the area where the most of the economy -- which is the area of the economy -- a completely democratic @-@ free zone . &quot;
&quot; in a certain sense , if I may say so pro@@ voc@@ ative , China today is similar to the England of the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; for -- remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- that is a mistake , historically considered . &quot;
&quot; Liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill -- &quot;
he was particularly skept@@ ical of what the democratic development concerns .
&quot; what can be seen in China now , resem@@ bles the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
&quot; to blame China now , what the West has done in the 19th century itself , smell to hyp@@ oc@@ ris@@ y . &quot;
BG : I am sure that many list@@ eners are curious about your experiences as a finance minister in the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I did that that comes .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later on the first half @-@ year ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal view , and very disappoint@@ ing , because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone . &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the euro zone , &quot;
&quot; namely us of the compl@@ ac@@ ency to adopt , and the digest@@ ed den@@ ial that ran through the euro@@ zone and continues to continue the development of the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity , on the basis of Greek proposal -- the way , the first proposal was that these den@@ ial revealed -- &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the Euro group , continues to den@@ ial the den@@ ial . &quot;
&quot; but you know , what is coming . &quot;
this is the experience from the Soviet Union --
&quot; if one tries to get an economic system that is not transfer@@ able , through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism in life , you might take a while , but if then change happens , he happens ab@@ rupt@@ ly and destru@@ ctive . &quot;
BG : what changes do you see ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure .
BG : do you have any errors in your time as a finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- seriously ...
&quot; if there is a finance minister , or any minister who made after 6 months in office , especially in such a t@@ ense situation , he made no mistakes , then this is a dangerous person . &quot;
&quot; of course , I made mistakes . &quot;
the greatest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on the sides of the don@@ ors to find a common solution .
but that was not .
&quot; they just wanted to bring our government only because they did not want to deal with the promises , they went through the euro@@ zone . &quot;
they did not want to address a cat@@ astroph@@ ic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
there is worse than during the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; neither from the Troika of the don@@ ors who has imposed on this policy , and a : &quot; that was a col@@ oss@@ al mistake . &quot;
&quot; BG : despite all the , and despite the aggressive de@@ ons of talks , you seem to be quite per @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone is from someone who lives and love . &quot;
my biggest fear is that the Eurozone is not survived .
&quot; for if she does not survive , the release of the demon@@ ic forces will be destroyed and destroy the European Union . &quot;
this will not be dis@@ astro@@ us alone for Europe but for the entire world economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; when we put ourselves off the path of a post@@ modern 1930 , what it appears to me , it will be as advent@@ urous for the future of Europeans as well as non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope that you are wrong in this point .
&quot; Y@@ anis , thank you so much that you were at TED . &quot;
Y@@ V : thanks .
&quot; Roy Price have never heard this , although he probably is responsible for 22 @-@ moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013 . &quot;
&quot; probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for many of you . &quot;
&quot; that goes back to the decision , the Roy met three years ago . &quot;
Roy Price is accompan@@ ying employee at Amazon Studios
the TV @-@ production company of Amazon .
&quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has a I@@ gel@@ fr@@ is@@ ur and describes on Twitter as &quot; &quot; Mo@@ vies , TV , Technology , Tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job because it is responsible for it to produce the shows and the content of the Amazon .
&quot; of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought industry . &quot;
there are already so many TV series that Roy cannot choose any one .
&quot; he must find shows , which are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he must find shows that are right on this curve . &quot;
this curve is the rating distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this review .
&quot; will your show be evaluated with nine and higher , this is a winner . &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; such shows how &quot; Bre@@ aking Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows , the addi@@ ctive where one has failed to ask your brain : &quot; &quot; where are there any more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left hand side , here at this end , shows how &quot; Tod@@ dl@@ ers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what at this end of the curve . &quot;
&quot; Roy Price does not worry about the left side of the curve , because I think you need a special intelligence in order to accommodate &quot; Tod@@ dl@@ ers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he makes more thoughts on the mean explo@@ ding , the average TV -- the shows that are neither good nor bad they do not delight . &quot;
so he must ensure that he really is on the right side .
&quot; the print is present , and of course it is the first time that Amazon so something makes , therefore Roy Price no risk . &quot;
he wants to create success .
&quot; he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition . &quot;
&quot; he takes many ideas for TV shows and cho@@ oses by an evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online , where everyone can watch any free of charge . &quot;
&quot; and if Amazon is out there , it is possible to get right ? &quot;
millions of spect@@ ators look at these episodes .
&quot; however , they do not know that they will be observed when watching this shows . &quot;
they are observed by Roy and his team who make everything up .
&quot; you capture , when you start the show when you p@@ aus@@ ed , which parts can be over@@ jum@@ ps or again . &quot;
collect millions of data to decide with these data then what show they should produce .
&quot; in fact , they collect the data , process this and this is the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com about four re@@ publ@@ ican U.S. Sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many of these show may remember because they were not so good . &quot;
&quot; it is just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve 7,@@ 4 is and Alpha House lan@@ det at 7.5 -- so do not just talk about the average , but not just what it was wor@@ e and his team worked . &quot;
&quot; about at the same time at another company has created another Manager a top show through data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it , but he does something different . &quot;
&quot; rather than to host a contest , he and his team st@@ owed the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x viewer , so the reviews that they show the shows , their course , which shows them etc . &quot;
&quot; then use these data to find these little details about the spect@@ ators : which shows them , which producers , which actors . &quot;
&quot; when they had all the parts together , they went a car and decided not to make a Sit@@ com about four Sen@@ ators but a drama series about a must@@ ard . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has a hit , at least for the first two rel@@ ays . &quot;
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9,@@ 1 review on this curve . so exactly where they wanted .
of course is the question : what happened here ?
&quot; it has two very competent , data supplied companies . &quot;
&quot; they combine these many data with each other and it works super for one of them , but not for the other company . &quot;
why is this ?
because logic somehow got that this should work with everything .
&quot; if you accumul@@ ate millions of data , for a decision which one meets , then one should make a good decision . &quot;
it has 200 years of statistics as Back @-@ Up .
it is optimized for very powerful computer .
&quot; the min@@ de@@ ste , what you can expect is good television , or ? &quot;
&quot; if data analysis is so not working , it is something fr@@ ight@@ ening because we live in a time in which we had more and more to meet statistics to get serious decisions about television . &quot;
does anybody know here the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
&quot; OK , this is even good . &quot;
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one comes in this room ever in touch with this software . come in touch with this software you are in prison .
&quot; if anyone is here in the USA in the prison , and in order to ask for dism@@ iss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dism@@ iss@@ al takes place or not . &quot;
&quot; just as with Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of decide whether a show will be good or bad , whether a person will be good or bad . &quot;
&quot; moderate TV , 22 minutes , which can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , in spite of the many data , &quot;
&quot; not always the best results created . this is not that a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data . &quot;
also the data wi@@ red companies are sometimes wrong .
&quot; yes , even Google makes mistakes . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Google announced that it can predi@@ ct through data analysis bur@@ sts of fl@@ u , the worst kind , predi@@ ct -- by data analysis of Google research . &quot;
it worked wonderful and was a great news . the success gi@@ pf@@ amil@@ y in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked fl@@ aw@@ less , year round year , until there was no longer working , &quot;
and no one could say why .
&quot; it &apos;s just not working , this was once again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
even the data supplied items such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
&quot; despite all these errors currents , in decisions of life is a -- at the workplace , in the legal en@@ forcement , in medicine . &quot;
so we would prefer to ensure that data are helpful .
&quot; I also know many difficulties with data . I work in the computer @-@ assisted gen@@ etics -- an area where some very clever people use un@@ imagin@@ able many data to make serious decisions about how the decision for a cancer therapy &quot;
or the development of a medication . over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions using data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
&quot; you have to solve a complex problem , do mainly two things : &quot;
&quot; as a first time you sh@@ aken this problem in its parts , so that you can analyse and analyze the items ; as a wide range of items you put the items again to create a closure . &quot;
sometimes you have to do this several times but there are always two things : apart and restore it again .
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help create a problem and understand its parts . &quot;
they are not suitable to match the parts again and then come to a exclusion .
&quot; for this , there is another tool and we have it all : our brain . &quot;
&quot; if there is something that is good at which the brain is good , it is parts and pieces to reset , even if the information is un@@ complete , then when the information is in@@ complete , especially if it is the brain of a expert . &quot;
&quot; that is why I think was Net@@ fli@@ x so successful because they have used data and mind , where they also go in the process . &quot;
&quot; you use data to better understand what else would not have been able to do . but the decision , how to put all these parts , and make it a show like &quot; House of Cards , &quot; that was not in the data . &quot;
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show which meant that they entered a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon however did this in the wrong way .
&quot; they used data to control all of their decisions , first when they chose TV @-@ ideas when they chose &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; &quot; as a show . &quot;
&quot; it was a safe decision , because they could always say , &quot; We tell us the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; data are helpful for better decisions , but I believe things go wrong when data start our decisions to control . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool and not forget that this device is quite useful . &quot;
many of you will ...
&quot; before there was data , this was the device for decisions . &quot;
many know it .
it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; . it is amazing . for decisions using an Ja@@ w or no . you just have to sh@@ ake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- right here at this moment .
I will later fe@@ ared it later with a techn@@ icians .
I have met some decisions in my life so I should have heard in retro@@ spect on the ball .
&quot; but as you know of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace this through something much cle@@ ver@@ t , such as data analysis to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not change the basic building .
&quot; so perhaps the ball is clever and clever and clever , and ultimately it is about us to make decisions if we want to achieve something exceptional at the end of the right turn . &quot;
&quot; and I feel this as a very encouraging message , that despite the great amount of data still pays off to make decisions to be an expert in what you do , and risks . &quot;
&quot; because at the end there are not the data , but the risks to which you end at the end of the curve . &quot;
thank you nice .
