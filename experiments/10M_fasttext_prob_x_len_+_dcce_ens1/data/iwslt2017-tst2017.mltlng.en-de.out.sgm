<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">They might know him because he was won as New York Times reporter the Pulitzer Prize.</seg>
<seg id="3">"long before the one had heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacular that the NSA was illegal Phones of Americaners."</seg>
<seg id="4">"but it is another chapter, which should leave a lasting impression."</seg>
<seg id="5">Therein he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation in which the CIA hides the CIA to a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">"if the crazy sounds, read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an unbelievable story.</seg>
<seg id="8">"but do you know, who does not have the chapters even?"</seg>
<seg id="9">The US government.</seg>
<seg id="10">Almost 10 years the government fought against Risen and asked him to call his innate sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this turn it became the symbol for the pattern of the government, whistleblowers to condemn and journalists. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to the first constitutional, the media have the right to publish secret information."</seg>
<seg id="13">"but it is impossible to apply this right if media cannot get this information, and if they cannot protect the identity of the mutations they do."</seg>
<seg id="14">"so as the government at Risen knocked, he did something that many courageous reporter already did before him: he refused and said that he would prefer to go in prison."</seg>
<seg id="15">"thus, from 2007 to 2015 Risen lived with the risk to go in prison."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, only days before the process, something extraordinary."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, although they had been given for years, that it would be essential for their case, the demands of the government were dropped."</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring the reporter and springs can always hide less.</seg>
<seg id="19">"instead of fail to fail, and to bring to the statements, that could do his digital footprints for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"and thus have the investigator, without his consent, his phone-wise,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"just like his e-mail data, financial and banking information, its credit card, and even traveller with the list of its flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA phistleblower and risens."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, this is just one of many cases."</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect Whistleblowers. but instead the judiciary has sentenced more than all the US governments before him.</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how the one can be a problem, especially because the government too much of their work as secret."</seg>
<seg id="26">Since the 11th of September almost every article about national security was the result that a whistleblower went to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">"so we set the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional detection, because the government has more and more possibilities to send all of them."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but just as technology of the government allows to handle the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="29">"though, they can contact the moment in which they contact, rather than in the afterward, in the cedar."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today, there are communication software that had not yet been written than Risen his book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or call calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"such technology is SecureDrop, an open-source bank transfer system for whistleblowers, which was originally developed by the Internet, and is now being developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation, which I have been further developed."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of an e-mail, go to a news page, just like the Washington Post."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there you can upload documents uploading or information, just as with any other contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">These will then be encrypted and stored on a server which only has access to the respective message agency.</seg>
<seg id="35">"so, the government cannot be secretive, and many of the information that would call them would not be available from the preceding."</seg>
<seg id="36">"but SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole, to protect freedom of the press in the 21st century."</seg>
<seg id="37">"unfortunately, governments around the world develop new spying technologies that all endanger us."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it is to make sure that not only technology facades, such as Edward Snowden have a chance to bring iniquities. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblowers."</seg>
<seg id="39">"the above misors in the supply of soldiers described are white and of crowded hospitals, the alarm is going to tell us. or the next environmental workers, the alarm to seize water from Flint. or a Wallstreet-Insider which warns us before the next financial crisis."</seg>
<seg id="40">"after all these technologies, these technologies have been made not only for those who want to cover crimes, but to protect our all constitutional rights."</seg>
<seg id="41">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on 3 April 2016 the largest datasheets of the story was published.] [the "Panama Papers" has been hidden in tax havens.] [what does this week we have been hidden from news about a lookout of 11 million documents in Panama's law firms</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the mysterious world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers to go to companies such as Mossack Fonseca and say:" okay, we need an anonymously company. "</seg>
<seg id="45">"we actually see the e-mails, the exchange of messages how the whole system works, how it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already resulted in the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Islands Prime Minister has returned.</seg>
<seg id="48">"also, there are reports that a allies of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad hoses in tax havens."</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is asserted that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russian president Vladimir Putin leads to a close friend of children's days, a famous cellists."</seg>
<seg id="50">"now there will be a lot of rich people and others, which are nervous to the next release, and to the next uncovered documents."</seg>
<seg id="51">"now, that sounds like the Plot of an agent or John-Grisham-Novel."</seg>
<seg id="52">"it seems wept away from you, ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we tell us what?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is: when the rich and mighty are able to hide their property in tax havens and not all their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads."</seg>
<seg id="55">And this concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"discussing the world discuss the media and leading politician, such as secret tax havens of some few things to hide and hardened -- something that we have been discussing and unveiled for ten years."</seg>
<seg id="58">"I think many people the whole world seems to be very confusing, and it is hard to understand how this tax havens work."</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it as a matrjoschcap.</seg>
<seg id="60">"thus one has a company in another company, in another company that makes it almost impossible to truly understand who behind these prayers."</seg>
<seg id="61">"it can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society really understand what thing is."</seg>
<seg id="62">I think it is also interesting that there are less reports on that matter in the US.</seg>
<seg id="63">"presumably, because so far there have been no prominent Americans who came in these revelations, this scandal."</seg>
<seg id="64">"now, it is not that there is no rich Americans that their property is in tax havens."</seg>
<seg id="65">"but through the principle, after which this tax havens work, Mossack Fonseca less American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"if we had a data piece from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would have much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, it is so that in some U.S. states you need to receive less information to start a company as to get a library."</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of intransparency in the US has allowed its employees to reduce schoolchildren.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has been decounselling to amoking particularly anarchy anchorage.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">"so, we sent a conceal investigators into the offices of 13 Anwaltsfirms in Manhattan."</seg>
<seg id="74">"our investigators were given as African ministers who wanted to bring back to the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet."</seg>
<seg id="75">"we really shocked it really, that all up to one of the lawyer's proposals made suggestions, as he could transfer his money."</seg>
<seg id="76">"these were all precaution. none of these lawyers took us as a client, and of course nobody was handed over to anyone with this system. however, it shows the problem with this system."</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as individuals.</seg>
<seg id="78">"it is not about a single lawyer, who has undertake the proposals in our conceal investigators."</seg>
<seg id="79">"it is not about a single peak politician, involved in a scandal."</seg>
<seg id="80">"it is about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"and to cope with this, we must change the rules."</seg>
<seg id="82">We must change the rules to create this kind of behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="83">It may sound all very dowingly as if we could do nothing against it; as if there is nothing to be changed; as if it is always the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">"but as secure optimist, I see that some things began to change."</seg>
<seg id="85">"in the past few years, we have seen advices to more transparency, which affects the owners of companies."</seg>
<seg id="86">The theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">"since then, the EU recorded in central registers on the national level, who really is behind companies in Europe and who is controlled them."</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US would like to leave.</seg>
<seg id="89">"representatives of both parties have brought a legislature to both parliamentarians, but this does not make progress we would like to see."</seg>
<seg id="90">"we would really like to see how this Panama Disclosure, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, as a means is used to ensure in the US and globally for greater transparency."</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">"we need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind headaches."</seg>
<seg id="93">"we need executives in the economy that stand up and say," Intransparency is not good for the business. "</seg>
<seg id="94">"we need leading politicians to recognize the problem and use it, by laws this kind of intransparency."</seg>
<seg id="95">"together, we can finish the intransparent that now makes this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering, finally quit."</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story as I once again kidnapped and in the trunk of a red mains.</seg>
<seg id="97">"a day after I had finished my design study, I made a backstead."</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda remained and looked at my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my art works.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a roadtrip through all the country. afterwards he would go to the peace-corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him on a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I got tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"while we paid the invoice, I made the mistake to ask him:" "where do you sleep, because today night?"</seg>
<seg id="104">He made the whole thing worse: "I do not know it yet."</seg>
<seg id="105">"and I thought:" "Oh, man!"</seg>
<seg id="106">What mAh I now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">"but I just got to know him just now! he says he would go to the peace of peace, but I don't know if he really is planning. I will not kidnapped in the trunk of a Mazowland!"</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard myself: "I have a bubble. you can sleep in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="112">"a voice in my head said:" "h, how please?"</seg>
<seg id="113">"at night I was then in bed, I stared to the blanket and thought:" Oh man! what did I get there? "</seg>
<seg id="114">A wildly sleeping in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I got such a fear that I got out of the bed, pointed to the door of the door, and my sleeping room."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">"the artwork, which he bought from me, depends today in his classroom. he is now teachers."</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as hosts. it has completely changed my perspective.</seg>
<seg id="121">"maybe people who were sold to me in childhood as strangers, actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered?"</seg>
<seg id="122">"people on my airmats to accommodate, was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air conditioning."</seg>
<seg id="123">"we make a time jump, two years later..."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I am unemployed, almost pleite, my roommates moves from and the rent is increased."</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design-conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can do it to turn fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote my best friend and new fellow inhabitants Brian Chesky:" "Brian, I thought about how we could earn something. our apartment will stay for a designer-Bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, WLAN and a desk includes a mattress and every morning breakfast."</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a site and founded so "bubble and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the airmats on wooden floor.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super and we also.</seg>
<seg id="132">"I'm sure our cheese-ham-Omelet tasted completely different, because we made them for our guests."</seg>
<seg id="133">"we toured with them through the whole city. when we adopted our last guest, and the door to the castle was stared, Brian and me."</seg>
<seg id="134">We just had discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and we could pay our rent at the same time?</seg>
<seg id="135">The things came into roles.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, concluded us as a developer."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if you could make it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">"we presented the investors:" "we want to create a web site on the people publicly pictures of their private rooms posten, their bedrooms, their baths -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when visiting."</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the Internet they can then invite other foreign people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the rocket would be zap.</seg>
<seg id="142">Indeed they are not.</seg>
<seg id="143">"no one who is still completely with trost, would invest in a business, the foreigner allowed to sleep in apartments of other people."</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we have learned to have children all that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">"when one has a problem, one can feel on the things that you can do well. we could desigate."</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie we learned that design much more is than just looks and haptics -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">"we learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create confidence by design immenses, between people who never met before."</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create with design confidence?</seg>
<seg id="151">"I would like to give you a tasting, what degree of trust we call."</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-seconds experiment. it will force you out of your coming one.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Give your mobile phone to your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">"this quiet flight from Panik you can feel -- -- is exactly what hosts, when they open the door to the door."</seg>
<seg id="158">"because the only thing is more personal than your mobile phone, your home."</seg>
<seg id="159">"visitors can not only read your SMS, you will see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet."</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel about to hold the mobile phone of a foreigner in the hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most sense the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">"so, most guests feel when they can sleep elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">"just so, who now has Al Gores's mobile?"</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you be announced on Twitter that he was transferred to the President of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the phones.</seg>
<seg id="167">You now have experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I would like to tell you of some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we have changed a small detail in this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">"what if your neighbor would have been presented once again with his name; if he would have told where he comes, how his dog or his children are called?"</seg>
<seg id="170">"imagine you would have 150 apassessments, which all say," "he can really make a very well wrapped towel!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you would have to cancel your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-conceived feedback system strengthens confidence.</seg>
<seg id="173">In the beginning we still have some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">"it was difficult for people, negative assessments."</seg>
<seg id="175">Finally we decided to wait until both hosts and guest their assessments. before we put them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we have discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">"we were conducted using Stanford a study. we examined how likely it is that people trust each other, depending on how much they are related to age and residence."</seg>
<seg id="178">"little surprising, we trust the people most that are most like."</seg>
<seg id="179">"the more differences we find, the less trust we trust."</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social preingenious.</seg>
<seg id="181">"it is exciting when you add the call of a person -- in our case through assessments."</seg>
<seg id="182">"if you have less than three assessments, nothing changes."</seg>
<seg id="183">"but one has more than ten, it changes everything."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good call is similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can thus help us to overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">"furthermore, we learned that trust is dependent on how much you get there."</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"if you tell too little about how for example," Hi! "" you do not get any answer. "</seg>
<seg id="189">"told you too much, as for example:" I have problems with my mother, -- -- the request will also be rather accepted. "</seg>
<seg id="190">"so there is an optimal degree of openness, for example" Tolle art works in your home! I do with my family vacation. "</seg>
<seg id="191">How can it create it with design to restore this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text in order to recommend the correct amount of text. we also provide tips on which themes you should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">"our entire company builds on hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices against strangers."</seg>
<seg id="194">"with which we did not reckoned, the great amount of people who were more than ready to place these prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you can see how many people take our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">"first, incredibly good luck."</seg>
<seg id="198">"second, the tireless work of our team."</seg>
<seg id="199">"third, third, which was not covered before."</seg>
<seg id="200">For us the shop runs very well.</seg>
<seg id="201">"of course, there are also times when not everything is smooth."</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who celebrated unauthorized parties are celebrated or rented apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked with customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood on the front front when trust was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing more smarter than this calls. it is already hurts if I only think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">"the disappointment that you hear in the voice of the lawyer, and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve."</seg>
<seg id="208">"fortunately, I had only a fraction per problem each of the 123 million."</seg>
<seg id="209">For people trust each other.</seg>
<seg id="210">When trust works, it may arise marvel. "</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holiday in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host went to hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary surgery!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">Perfect house for travelers who tend to be due to seated activities to heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian that can save one life even though they do not know at all.</seg>
<seg id="218">"you drive in your own car into the hospital, when you die, and wait while you get a bypass."</seg>
<seg id="219">"because they do not want that one feels lonely, they bring books passed."</seg>
<seg id="220">They can even stay longer without the extra-night charge.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">This is of course not going to run every stay.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">"when I look for the first time about this term, I asked me:"</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the thought of sharing with money transaction?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is here about an economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"but it is now just to call" "tenancy ', the thing will not do justice."</seg>
<seg id="228">"share Economy describes a trade, human relationships promises."</seg>
<seg id="229">"people put a part of itself, and that changes everything."</seg>
<seg id="230">"when one is confused, this is easy to compare with Fast Food. it is efficient and reliable, but for this is less authentic."</seg>
<seg id="231">But what would be if traveling a rich buffet from local impressions would be?</seg>
<seg id="232">"what would be, if at each place you visited, a group there will be resident that would have to be filled with a thoroughly and one in a Kneipentour neighborhood, of which one has never heard before;"</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn Cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Today apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to shape apartments of the ground up to the members?</seg>
<seg id="236">How would this look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the thoughts of common?</seg>
<seg id="238">"I imagine cities, which allow us to society and relationships, instead of loneliness and depreciation."</seg>
<seg id="239">"in South Korean capital Seoul, this project has already begun. many parking that belonged to the government,"</seg>
<seg id="240">Were now residents offered. students who were looking for a stay.</seg>
<seg id="241">"have been conveyed to people whose children were fed, incubator programs have been started,"</seg>
<seg id="242">"to finance new start-ups in the Share Economy. about our platform alone, night 785 000 people in 191 countries will be a guest at a stranger or even hosts."</seg>
<seg id="243">The idea does not seem to be so crazy as it was taught us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality there was also before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were already similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">Why so does our work work?</seg>
<seg id="248">"apart from luck and timing, we realize that you can find the right design with the components of trust."</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us to overcome deeper prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">"I find the astounding,"</seg>
<seg id="251">Straight to overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it if a red Mazda is over to me over.</seg>
<seg id="253">We of course know that design cannot solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">"but if it could help us if it had this great influence, I wonder what we can be able to use design soon."</seg>
<seg id="255">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believers? a expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">"suppresses, a brainwashing, a terrorist?"</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in the safety at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I do not give you blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">Thus the media people represent the same thing as me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of the reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans think most would no Muslims know.</seg>
<seg id="266">"probably, people do not talk to their Uber."</seg>
<seg id="267">"for all those who have never met a Muslim, It is great to get to know you know."</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">"I am a mother, a coffee-lover -- double espresso, with cream extra."</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted</seg>

<seg id="274">I decided to do this.</seg>
<seg id="275">"when I was 17 years old, I met the decision to outward me."</seg>
<seg id="276">"no, not as a homosexual person, like some of my friends, but as Muslims in. I chose Hijab, my head-discovery."</seg>
<seg id="277">My feminist girlfriends were horrified: "why do you oppressed you yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">"the lustige was: then it was for me a feminist independence, and in front of the pressure I felt as a 17-year-old, I felt a perfect and unreachable beauty deal."</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only accepted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have the Quran.</seg>

<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">She was trust and slow devotion that deepened with every reading of the corans.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of rhythmics brings me sometimes to crying.</seg>
<seg id="285">I know myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>

<seg id="288">"later I married and started like all the good Egyptians, my career as an engineer."</seg>
<seg id="289">"I had later, after my marriage, a child, and lived basically the" "Egyptian-American dream." ""</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came that terrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"I sat in my kitchen, had an early stage, looked at the screen and saw the word" "rush". ""</seg>
<seg id="293">"smoke, airplanes flew in building, people spranged from the buildings."</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disorder?</seg>
<seg id="297">"my shock, turned quickly in rebellion."</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should you do something?</seg>
<seg id="299">"I changed the television channel and heard:" "Muslim terrorists,..."... "in the name of Islam..." "..." "..." "..." "bombs Mekka!"</seg>
<seg id="300">"Oh, my God."</seg>
<seg id="301">"it has not only been attacked my country but in the Nu, the actions of others were transformed into a suspects."</seg>
<seg id="302">"on the same day, we had to drive through the Middle West of the US to move into a new city and start building up."</seg>
<seg id="303">"I remember how I went -- when we went -- as we went in my seat, and I was afraid to be recognized as Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="304">"we moved to our apartment in our apartment, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world."</seg>
<seg id="305">"and then I heard, I saw and read the warnings of national Islamic organisations, the defendants:" be vigilant, "" Seide cautious, "" sells in good lighted areas, "" versing you not. "</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week indoors.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday that week -- the day when Muslims gather to prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">"and again the warnings:" "does not go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">"the feelings were understandably about, and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or by people who held man for Muslims in the free war and slew."</seg>
<seg id="311">There was really branded suggestions on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">"however, something felt not right."</seg>
<seg id="314">"because people who had attacked this country, our country had attacked."</seg>
<seg id="315">I got the anger of the people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine it! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to continue to explain themselves.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing against questions. I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">They are the allegations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Nowadays we can actually say people: "there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When are we going on? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to close Muslims and mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">It is only the question: are we vicious or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malignant tumor can be found as a whole and a benign tumor only under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are meaningless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">"Muslims are, like any other Americans, no tumor in the body of the US, but a vital organ."</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">"Muslims are inventor and teachers, educators and Olympics."</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closing of mosques America safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">"there may be a few parking freelance, but do not stop the terror."</seg>
<seg id="332">Regular visit to a mosque leads to view people other faith tolerant and show larger citizen.</seg>
<seg id="333">"and as I told me a leader of the police in the region of Washington, DC recently told: people are actually not radicalized in mosques."</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">"in the case of the radicalization process, one has found that he does not start online. as the first one that the person believes that the person believes the terrorists are the true Muslims, and everyone who despised their behavior and its ideology is a traitor or by faith."</seg>
<seg id="336">"if we want to prevent radicalization, we need to stop the people to go to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="337">Some are still saying that Islam is an enormous religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">"finally, a group like the IS has its brutality with the Koran."</seg>
<seg id="339">"as Muslim in, as a mother, as a man, I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS."</seg>
<seg id="340">Yet we would add to their imagination, if you recognize them as representatives of 1,6 billion believers. "</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux-Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology reasons on their "Holy book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"but if you cast a look at them, they do not drive them to what they are in their" Holy Scripture. ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that makes it possible to read these things into the scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam told me a amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">"a girl came to him, because she could have imagined the IS."</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if they have been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">"he said, the problem was exactly the opposite. every spiritual one spoke to the silence, and told her that her wrath would bring their sense of injustice in the world, they only bring into trouble."</seg>
<seg id="350">"from nothing inspired and something that had given its anger, it was a main goal for the instrumentalization by extremists that you speak a solution."</seg>
<seg id="351">"" "this Imam set the connection to God and their church again."</seg>
<seg id="352">"instead of embarrassed her for her anger, he showed her constructive way for a real change in the world."</seg>
<seg id="353">"what they learned in the mosque, it protected from it to complete the IS."</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight of how the Islamophobia and my family concerns.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect every other?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear every day affect our democracy on our minds?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually refer to several neuroscientific studies -- show: when we fear that at least three things.</seg>
<seg id="359">"we do not accept an authoritative government system, conformity and prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="360">"a study shows: if you have reported testing messages in which negative about Muslims was reported, it was rather a military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">"if you look, when the mood against Muslims moved to the top -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks."</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the field of Iraqwar and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">"so, Islamophobia is not simply the natural response to Moslem terror as I expected it."</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool to manipulation the public in order to denounced the foundation of a free society which has rational and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning-sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We might feel it as the first but the toxic air of fear hurt us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">"when assignment of collective school, it is not only about to explain themselves."</seg>

<seg id="381">"we have been doing it and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was why America we want to leave our children: one that would like us to control our children, or one in which we can freely exercise our religion."</seg>

<seg id="410">"connected airers, high speed and speed up to engaging space."</seg>
<seg id="411">They can also build self-confident structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to wear loads with turmoil and generally react to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">"our goal is to exceed the limits of possible in the autonomous flight."</seg>
<seg id="415">"to make a system autonom, it has to know collectibid, where in the room you find the mobile objects."</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at the ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects. this allows us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic Tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">"for today's demos we use a new locomotive technology of Verity Studios, a seedling of our labors."</seg>
<seg id="418">There is no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in space to determine calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"external commands can be found at the highest ebe. e.g." "launch" "and" "land."</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called Heckstarter</seg>
<seg id="422">"a flight, that tries to beat two flies with a flap."</seg>
<seg id="423">"like other Starrflügler is efficient, much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations."</seg>
<seg id="424">"in contrast to most of the starters, it can float, and it has a large benefits at start and landing, and is very versatile."</seg>
<seg id="425">However there is always a downside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A restriction of tailoring is that they react sensitive to turmoil such as windmills.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the air conditioning in which position can restore the optimal position and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">"during our research we often introduce some basic abstract questions, which lead to the core of the matter."</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be for example: what is the petty-possible number of movable parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopter are known about as machines with a thousand movable parts that joined forces to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">"in front of decades the pilots could fly remote-controlled air devices, which only had two movable parts: a Propeller and a Heckruder."</seg>
<seg id="435">"recently, we discovered that flies with only one works."</seg>
<seg id="436">"this is the moon, the mechanic simpler flight. it was recently reinvented."</seg>
<seg id="437">"only one movable part, a Propeller,"</seg>
<seg id="438">"hinges, hinges and crossings, no further charges or controllers, only a propeller."</seg>
<seg id="439">"although it is mechanically simple, happens in the inner life very much, so that it can fly stable, and move into space."</seg>
<seg id="440">"however, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the tailgate. to get it to fly, I have to right it right."</seg>
<seg id="441">"the probability to take it right correctly when all look, is low, therefore I'll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening."</seg>
<seg id="442">"if the moon is a exercise in indulsion, this machine is here, the Omnikopter with its eight propellers, a exercise in abundance."</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that he is not symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why he is ambivalent in his direction.</seg>
<seg id="446">"thus, he receives the occasional ability,"</seg>
<seg id="447">"move into space in all directions, no matter what he is filmed or even as he rotated."</seg>
<seg id="448">"of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight propellers."</seg>
<seg id="449">"some is conceivable in models, the rest will learn directly at the fly."</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's see that.</seg>
<seg id="451">"if airers should be part of our daily life, they must be extremely safe and reliable."</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine here consists of two separate two-propellers machines.</seg>
<seg id="453">This turns on clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the others against the clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">"if you build them, they behave like a high-performance-Quadrocopter."</seg>
<seg id="456">"however, something wrong -- a motor or propeller comes out, the electronics or a battery can fly on, if limited."</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate that we make a half airplane.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration examines synthetic weakening.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression. "</seg>
<seg id="460">We took the usual Micro-Quadcopter -- each individual weighs less than one disc bread -- and imbursts them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">"every unit is white, where in the room it is and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no upper limit."</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully you will motivate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The especially secure machine da drpractice would like to get a flying lampshade on Broadway.</seg>

<seg id="482">In the following time the precision of LIGO could be considerably increased from LIGO what the recognizing performance enormously improved.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is called Advanced LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="484">"at the beginning of September 2015, LIGO was started to clear some smaller, hard-stubborn problems."</seg>
<seg id="485">"on 14 September 2015, only a few days after the commissioning of the detector, smoked the gravitational black holes through the ground."</seg>

<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell from my todkrane father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically they were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">"all that which I had worked, is no longer science-fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicists at MIT. he has been investigated for 23 years of gravity as LIGO measurable signals. but what are Gravitational-waves?"</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a marveling in the space of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">"when temporarily the wave, the space and its overall content is stretched into one direction and put into the other."</seg>
<seg id="495">To illustrating dozents lead to curative theory often a really alberish dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and shrink, stretch and shrubs."</seg>
<seg id="497">"the problem is that Gravitational swelling is extremely weak, even ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="498">"on 14 September, for example, each of us was stretched out of the waves of the waves and is stretched. the stretching of an average man was 10 high -21."</seg>
<seg id="499">"this is called 20 Nuling after the comma, followed by a 1. Darum explained the LIGO staff for crazy."</seg>
<seg id="500">"with a five kilometres long laser detector, and this is absurd, this length should be measured on less than a thousand of radius of an atomic nucleus. this is gray."</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text about gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">"described Kip Thorne, a co-founder LIGOs, the hunt for the waves:" "the technical difficulties in the construction of such detectors are enormous."</seg>
<seg id="503">"but physicists are inventory, and with the support of the public will certainly be overcome all obstacles."</seg>
<seg id="504">"Thorne released this 1973, 42 years before his success."</seg>
<seg id="505">"back to LIGO. Scott says, LIGO was more than an eye."</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">"visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than the things around us: facial hair, the size of your mobile phones."</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite convenient. for so you can produce a picture or a map of things by taking one of several points coming light around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">When killing is that different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible tones have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">"therefore it is very difficult, actually impossible to manufacture a picture of things that do not mean you much more:"</seg>
<seg id="512">The face of your child approximately.</seg>
<seg id="513">"instead, we listen to certain properties like tonic and height, rhythm and volume to close the history behind it."</seg>
<seg id="514">"now, Alice speaks Alice."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"dummer Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to Gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We can do not produce a simple image of objects in all objects.</seg>
<seg id="519">"but by changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can hear their stories."</seg>
<seg id="520">At least lie for LIGO the measured frequencies in the audible area.</seg>
<seg id="521">"so, when we convert wavepattern in schall, we can hear the All literally."</seg>
<seg id="522">"the gravitation to listen, can give us a lot about the collision of two black holes, which my colleague Scott has already been very long busy."</seg>
<seg id="523">"SH: two black, not rotating holes, circulates simply: wupp!"</seg>
<seg id="524">Turning the two bodies very quickly, you can hear the same scrups with an additional key change. that sounds like this: Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu! "</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a sort of movement used in the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">"AA: on 14 September 2015 -- a date that is at least I never forget -- heard LIGO Folder: [Surrendes sound] Jemand, who knows how to hear this as the noise of -- SH:... two black holes with a 30-fold solar mass that can turn around as fast as the sticks of your mixer."</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: superior to us briefly what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">"two black holes, the dense body in all, one with a mass of 29 probe, the other with a mass of 36 probe, surrounds the one hundred times a second, before they collide."</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces before.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know that because we heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the permanent importance of LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="533">"LIGO has a completely new path for the study of the cosmos, as it has never been possible before."</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can hear the All-listen and the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in all we can -- practical or basically -- not see.</seg>
<seg id="536">"a Supernova, for example. I would like to know why massereiche stars in Supernovae explode."</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. of them we learned much about the Universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">"but the thrilling physical processes are happening in the core, which is behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon."</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never pass through because these opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">"Gravitational-waves penetrate iron, as if it would be transparent glass. the Urknall: I would never see the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see them since the urine was covered by its own offspring."</seg>
<seg id="541">"using Gravitational-waves, it should be possible until the beginning back to the beginning."</seg>
<seg id="542">"and that probably the most important thing: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen, which we never have never seen and of which we have no idea to discover. things we want to discover."</seg>
<seg id="543">"in fact, LIGO found equal in the first sight of things that we did not expect."</seg>
<seg id="544">"my colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO project, says to this topic: me: the kind of stars, the black holes, as LIGO they watch, are the dinosaurs of the universe."</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient body of prehistoric times. the black holes are so to speak for our archeological work. "</seg>
<seg id="546">"LIGO gives us a completely different angle of view to the events of the Universe, on the emergence of the stars and ultimately on how we went out of this chaos."</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is now to be as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">"thanks to LIGO, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the rustling and circles of the cosmos."</seg>

<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you nice.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am Neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="797">How most of my colleagues have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">"I know how to change your life from one second to the other, after a serious stroke, or after an car accident."</seg>
<seg id="799">"for us neurosurgeon, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other bodily organs, a very low capacity for self-healing."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after a severe violation of the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, heavy disability."</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I work functional neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by different surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">"surely they have heard from one of the most famous, the" "drenhirnaires". "there is a electrode deep inside the brain, to influence the circuits of neurons so that the neurological function is improved."</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson who suffered severe trembling and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">"however, Neuromodulation does not mean Neuro-healing."</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeon is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to you.</seg>
<seg id="810">With something help the brain can help herself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was conductive superficial and worked day and night in the emergency.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I used patients with skull-Hirn trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">You need to imagine that at Schädel-Hirn-Traumata the brain anchored and the cranial pressure ascending.</seg>
<seg id="815">"to save life, one must decrease the cranial pressure."</seg>
<seg id="816">It is sometimes necessary to remove some of a swollen deer.</seg>
<seg id="817">"instead, instead, we decided to cast us with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, the brain's mass."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">"cells grow from a tissue, comparable to all small children who are taken out of your families."</seg>
<seg id="822">"you have to find the right diet, temperature, moisture and environments to let them thrive."</seg>
<seg id="823">That is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many relocate it Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">This he looked under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">It was a great surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked like a tributary culture. with big green cells, which are surrounded by small, unmature cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you still know from the Biologietuition that stem cells are unripe cells that can transform itself in any cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain has tributt cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to get this kind of tribal cells from the surface tissue in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made a further captivating observation: normal tribal cells are very active -- they are very fast.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die; they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells neglected differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They are slowly and after a couple of weeks they died even.</seg>
<seg id="836">"so we saw a new, strange cell population that looked like tribal cells but was different."</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand where they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">This blue and red cells are called Doublecortine-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our grandhirochial cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of the fetus they ensure the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why are they left us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">"we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries."</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so safe.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We stand in front of a potential cell source which allows brainhealing.</seg>
<seg id="850">This we had to prove.</seg>
<seg id="851">"so we decided to develop an experiment."</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to take a piece of brain mass out of the non-speaking area and then the cells exactly so cultivate as it did Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="853">Then they will highlight them in the brain in order to follow them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step we moved them to the detrial of the same individuality.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologist transplantation -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we stimulate these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we reindestructing the same cells in busy brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we were able to work with monkey.</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario we redirected the cells into a wholesome brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they had disappeared again, they go back home. the room is already occupied, they will not be used there, so they disappear."</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we added a injury to and redirected exactly the same cells and now the cells have retained to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you can see what we could watch under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were redirected.</seg>
<seg id="862">The proof that they show are these small points. these are the cells that we are in vitro in the culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Here we were not able to stop.</seg>
<seg id="864">Help these cells to recover from a stroke?</seg>
<seg id="865">"so, we trained monkeys with a manual skill."</seg>
<seg id="866">You had to take food pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">This made them very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">"when she had achieved a stable skill level, we owe it to the motoric Cortex the handmotoric field."</seg>
<seg id="869">"then, the monkeys were paralysed, they could no longer move their hand."</seg>
<seg id="870">"just as it would happen to people, they recovered spontaneously up to a certain degree, just like after a stroke."</seg>
<seg id="871">Patients are paralysed and then try to relax with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. you can relax at a certain extent just as the monkey.</seg>
<seg id="872">"when we were sure that the monkey had achieved its degree of spontaneous recovery, we implant his own cells."</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left side they see the monkeys that spontaneously recovered.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can be around 40% to 50% of its original performance from before injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">He is not as precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">"now let us now see the cells redirected: the same monkey, two months after the implant."</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can use it freezing and later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neuropathological models for example at Parkinson.</seg>
<seg id="881">"but our dream is still to implant, and to implant."</seg>
<seg id="882">"I really hope to show you soon, as we can see the human brain the means to heal themselves."</seg>

<seg id="884">"Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne that is wonderful, I am sure that just several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think:" I know someone who need that need. "</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">"of course, the question of what are the greatest obstacles before you can begin clinical trials at people."</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results you have to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to run these kinds of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable that the brain is very delicate, etc. "</seg>
<seg id="889">"JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team."</seg>
<seg id="890">"BG: look into the future -- you have completed the research and try to get the permission to start the clinical trials. if you continue to get into the future, how many years will take it to hospital and this therapy will be available."</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: this is difficult to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">"first, it depends on the approval of clinical trial."</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it allow us to start the authority to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">"it has a long time to choose the patients to perform and evaluate treatments, whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment."</seg>
<seg id="896">Then you have to apply this to a multicentric study.</seg>

<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne thank you for your visit at TED and that you tell us about it.</seg>

<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the west make a big mistake to consider it as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">"we do not see democracy as the breakable plant that is in reality, but as inventory of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as unaltered wardness.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is true not.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great imahmer in Beijing have doubtless proven that it is quite possible to have a blooming capitalism and impressive growth while politics is completely indemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">"indeed, democracy against us, in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">"at the beginning of the year, when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- became clear to me as a finance minister in the Eurogroup -- our elections -- not influence the austerity-programs, which have been realized in Greece."</seg>
<seg id="910">"in this moment I thought that there might be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yev, or the Communist Party, who would be repeated that democracy would be abolished when they change anything."</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">"I ask you, together with me, back to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup of a mistake, we could save the democracy, but that we need a truly stronger and awesome democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"for without democracy our societies will be wasted our societies, our future gloomy and our great, new technologies."</seg>
<seg id="914">"on the subject of waste, I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction that is currently threatened with our economies."</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "TingsgiSummit-Paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">"a summit is known to you. you know and recognize it as the Schultheberg, who raises its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="917">"we all recognise the Schultheberg,"</seg>
<seg id="918">But only a few recognizing his toes.</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of insufficient cash, which belongs to the contaminated asparagus and corporations, who could get there to invest where it would be productive and incomes to produce all things that humanity is urgently needed, for example" green "energy."</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"in the past 3 months in the United States, in England and in the eurozone, five trillion dollars are invested in all the prosperity produced goods, such as industrial facilities, machines, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, tracks, and so on and so on."</seg>
<seg id="922">"3,4 billions U.S. dollar sounds like a lot of money, until you do it with the 5,1 trillion US dollars, which were at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing to do except the capers and the real estate prices."</seg>
<seg id="923">"thus, debt and unproductive capital has not formed the twingsgiates, which is not equal to the usual market mechanisms by the usual market mechanisms."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the result are stagnant wages, more than one quarter of the 25-54-year-old in the U.S., Japan and Europe are increasingly difficult to promote this itself."</seg>
<seg id="925">Insolated the circumstances will cause that oiled him kills him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my hadern with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"all of the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, human talents, and especially all the technologies to finance," green "technologies that are decisive for the rescue of the earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">So is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I think so. but before we proceed: what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristoteles defined democracy as the corporate form, in the open and poor as a majority to control the government. "</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian Democracy closed from course too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, foreigners, and of course slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">"however, it would be a mistake, the importance of the Athenian democracy due to this trigger."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the decision-making at the Athenian democracy was and is that they gave up the working arms, and not only the right to freedom of expression, but more important and more important that they were the right to political co-determination with the same proxy in questions of citizenship."</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian Democracy has not been held for a long time --</seg>
<seg id="936">"like a candle, which is very luminous, it is also fast burned."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, our current liberal democrats have not their roots in the ancient Athens,"</seg>
<seg id="938">"but in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American Constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while the Athenian democracy focused on the free citizens, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for the ruling class."</seg>
<seg id="940">"for the liberal democracy came only up, as a complete separation of politics and business is possible and the democratic process was confined to politics, while the economy -- thus the world of corporations -- a democratically-free zone."</seg>
<seg id="941">"in our present democracies has been held in our present democracies since the time, in which this separation of politics and economy began to interplay an uninherent struggle between the two, taking the economy gradually to the policy."</seg>
<seg id="942">Wonders why the politicians are no longer such as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not in a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"it is that one can be in the government nowadays and still not in power, because the power of politics is in the economy, and the areas are separated."</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my haste with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"if you think about it, it is about like a herd of carnivores, so sustaining the animals, of which they nourished, decimated them at the end."</seg>
<seg id="947">"similarly, it is similar to the economy that has known politics as far as far as it increases. the power of corporations increases, political goods will be stamped, the imbalance increases, the overall economic demand falls and the managing directors of the corporations are to be displaced to invest the cash of their company."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the more successful capitalism the" Demos "[the people] from democracy sells, the higher the twins of human labour-power and the greater the waste of human labour-power and the prosperity of humanity."</seg>
<seg id="949">"if that is true, it is obvious that we must bring together the policy and the economy, and it would be better, if the 'Demos' control reserves, just like in the ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="950">This is by the way no new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist Left had this idea already 100 years ago and it wasn't really good.</seg>
<seg id="952">"the teaching from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working arms only reproduce a position like in the ancient Athens, without creating new types of brutality and wastage."</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: the working arms descending!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism is doing it by being rewarding due to automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem is, so long economy and politics separate areas are higher, the automation summit can be higher, the wastage, and social conflicts deeper, just as I think -- in countries such as China will come."</seg>
<seg id="956">"so we have to shape the economy and reunite the economy and politics, and make sure that we call the reunited area democratisation, otherwise we end the film" "matrix" "as a documentation."</seg>
<seg id="957">"so the question is not, whether capitalism has brought the technical achievements, which he has produced, will survive --"</seg>
<seg id="958">"the more interesting question is whether capitalism is similar to capitalism by a dystopia, similar to the people in" "Star Trek", "in the machines to serve the people and people put their energy into the research of the universe, or into a high-tech version of the ancient Athener" Agora, "in long talks to the sense of life fry."</seg>
<seg id="959">I believe we may be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">"so what would it be, how could it look like this" Star Trek "-like Utopia rather than the" "Matrix" "similar Dystopia?"</seg>
<seg id="961">"in practical implementation I want to tell you, in all soon, some examples call."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the field of companies: please enter a capital market in which you deserve money while you work and in which your capital follows you from one working point to the next, and the company -- no matter what one is currently working -- is property of those who currently working in the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income from capital and deliverance and the concept of wage work is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">"no distinction between those who belong to the companies, but do not work in it, and employees who work there, but no major gaps between investment and labour, and ultimately no embleraging twingsgiates."</seg>
<seg id="965">"in the field of global political economy, please imagine that our national currencies should have a free floating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency that will be issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [group of the 20 largest emerging countries], in the interest of all humanity."</seg>
<seg id="966">"furthermore, you continue to negotiated the entire world trade in this currency -- we call it" the cosmos "," in units of "" cosmos "" -- and any government pays the sum that corresponds to the commercial deficit or trade overlap of the respective country into a common fund. "</seg>
<seg id="967">"also imagine that these funds are invested in" green "technologies, especially in parts of the world, in which investment funds are rare."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically that what John Maynard Keynes was proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference from 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time one had not had the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"today, we have it, especially in front of the background of a reunited politics and business."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world that I describe you, is at the same time liberal, in which it is privileged, and Marxist because they buried the separation of capital and work in the dustbin of history, and keynesian, globally keynesian."</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all others it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">We will awaken in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we merge into a "matrix" - similar Dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide in political.</seg>
<seg id="977">"it is in our hands, and we do it better democratic."</seg>
<seg id="978">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You do descriptive yourself in your biography itself as liberal Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">"Yanis Varoufakis: if something from what I just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant."</seg>
<seg id="983">"the reason for reunification of politics and economy is... doing this not, the technological development will produce such a massive decline in the overall economic demand that Larry Summers as" long term stagnation. ""</seg>
<seg id="984">"through the transfer of this crisis on the next, as we will experience it, it will not only be our democracies but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low."</seg>
<seg id="985">"if this analysis is true, Marx is quite relevant,"</seg>
<seg id="986">"as well as Hayek, this is why I am a libertful Marxist, and how Keynes, and that is why I am also perfect."</seg>
<seg id="987">"BG: actually, and now we are probably also."</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you are not wirr you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">"BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein that said. BG: in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of speakers you have very clearly what you think of the view of the West on China."</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the assuming of a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">"as I said in my talk, we have limited democracy on politics during the area where the most of the economy -- which is the area of the economy -- a completely democratic-free zone."</seg>
<seg id="994">"in a certain sense, if I may say so provocative, China today is similar to the England of the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="995">"for -- remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- that is a mistake, historically considered."</seg>
<seg id="996">"Liberalism, Liberals, like John Stuart Mill --"</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly skeptical of what the democratic development concerns.</seg>
<seg id="998">"what can be seen in China now, resembles the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second."</seg>
<seg id="999">"to blame China now, what the West has done in the 19th century itself, smell to hypocrisy."</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as a finance minister in the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I did that that comes.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later on the first half-year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">"YV: very exciting, from personal view, and very disappointing, because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone."</seg>
<seg id="1005">"not only Greece, but the euro zone,"</seg>
<seg id="1006">"namely us of the complacency to adopt, and the digested denial that ran through the eurozone and continues to continue the development of the whole European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1007">"we had the opportunity, on the basis of Greek proposal -- the way, the first proposal was that these denial revealed --"</seg>
<seg id="1008">"unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the Euro group, continues to denial the denial."</seg>
<seg id="1009">"but you know, what is coming."</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience from the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">"if one tries to get an economic system that is not transferable, through political will and authoritarianism in life, you might take a while, but if then change happens, he happens abruptly and destructive."</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you see ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: do you have any errors in your time as a finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- seriously...</seg>
<seg id="1017">"if there is a finance minister, or any minister who made after 6 months in office, especially in such a tense situation, he made no mistakes, then this is a dangerous person."</seg>
<seg id="1018">"of course, I made mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1019">The greatest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest on the sides of the donors to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not.</seg>
<seg id="1022">"they just wanted to bring our government only because they did not want to deal with the promises, they went through the eurozone."</seg>
<seg id="1023">They did not want to address a catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost a third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">There is worse than during the "Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="1026">"neither from the Troika of the donors who has imposed on this policy, and a:" that was a colossal mistake. "</seg>
<seg id="1027">"BG: despite all the, and despite the aggressive deons of talks, you seem to be quite per-European."</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">"my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone is from someone who lives and love."</seg>
<seg id="1030">My biggest fear is that the Eurozone is not survived.</seg>
<seg id="1031">"for if she does not survive, the release of the demonic forces will be destroyed and destroy the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1032">This will not be disastrous alone for Europe but for the entire world economy.</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">"when we put ourselves off the path of a postmodern 1930, what it appears to me, it will be as adventurous for the future of Europeans as well as non-Europeans."</seg>

<seg id="1038">"Roy Price have never heard this, although he probably is responsible for 22-moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013."</seg>
<seg id="1039">"probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for many of you."</seg>
<seg id="1040">"that goes back to the decision, the Roy met three years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is accompanying employee at Amazon Studios</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV-production company of Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"he is 47 years old, slim, has a Igelfrisur and describes on Twitter as" "Movies, TV, Technology, Tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because it is responsible for it to produce the shows and the content of the Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">"of course, this is a very hard-fought industry."</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are already so many TV series that Roy cannot choose any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">"he must find shows, which are very, very good."</seg>
<seg id="1048">"in other words, he must find shows that are right on this curve."</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the rating distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this review.</seg>
<seg id="1050">"will your show be evaluated with nine and higher, this is a winner."</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"such shows how" Breaking Bad, "" Game of Thrones, "" The Wire "-- all the shows, the addictive where one has failed to ask your brain:" "where are there any more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"on the left hand side, here at this end, shows how" Toddlers and Tiaras "-- -- that should tell you enough what at this end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1055">"Roy Price does not worry about the left side of the curve, because I think you need a special intelligence in order to accommodate" Toddlers and Tiaras. ""</seg>
<seg id="1056">"he makes more thoughts on the mean exploding, the average TV -- the shows that are neither good nor bad they do not delight."</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must ensure that he really is on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">"the print is present, and of course it is the first time that Amazon so something makes, therefore Roy Price no risk."</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create success.</seg>
<seg id="1060">"he needs guaranteed success, so he holds a competition."</seg>
<seg id="1061">"he takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses by an evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online, where everyone can watch any free of charge."</seg>
<seg id="1062">"and if Amazon is out there, it is possible to get right?"</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of spectators look at these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">"however, they do not know that they will be observed when watching this shows."</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are observed by Roy and his team who make everything up.</seg>
<seg id="1066">"you capture, when you start the show when you paused, which parts can be overjumps or again."</seg>
<seg id="1067">Collect millions of data to decide with these data then what show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"in fact, they collect the data, process this and this is the answer, and this is:" Amazon should make a Sitcom about four republican U.S. Senators. "</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anybody know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"yes," Alpha House, "but it seems that not many of these show may remember because they were not so good."</seg>
<seg id="1072">"it is just an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of this curve 7,4 is and Alpha House landet at 7.5 -- so do not just talk about the average, but not just what it was wore and his team worked."</seg>
<seg id="1073">"about at the same time at another company has created another Manager a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming design of Netflix. just like Roy he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it, but he does something different."</seg>
<seg id="1074">"rather than to host a contest, he and his team stowed the existing data on the Netflix viewer, so the reviews that they show the shows, their course, which shows them etc."</seg>
<seg id="1075">"then use these data to find these little details about the spectators: which shows them, which producers, which actors."</seg>
<seg id="1076">"when they had all the parts together, they went a car and decided not to make a Sitcom about four Senators but a drama series about a mustard."</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"yes," House of Cards. "Netflix has a hit, at least for the first two relays."</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9,1 review on this curve. so exactly where they wanted.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course is the question: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">"it has two very competent, data supplied companies."</seg>
<seg id="1082">"they combine these many data with each other and it works super for one of them, but not for the other company."</seg>
<seg id="1083">Why is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow got that this should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">"if you accumulate millions of data, for a decision which one meets, then one should make a good decision."</seg>
<seg id="1086">It has 200 years of statistics as Back-Up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized for very powerful computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">"the mindeste, what you can expect is good television, or?"</seg>
<seg id="1089">"if data analysis is so not working, it is something frightening because we live in a time in which we had more and more to meet statistics to get serious decisions about television."</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anybody know here the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">"OK, this is even good."</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one comes in this room ever in touch with this software. come in touch with this software you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">"if anyone is here in the USA in the prison, and in order to ask for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dismissal takes place or not."</seg>
<seg id="1094">"just as with Amazon and Netflix. but instead of decide whether a show will be good or bad, whether a person will be good or bad."</seg>
<seg id="1095">"moderate TV, 22 minutes, which can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse."</seg>
<seg id="1096">"unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, in spite of the many data,"</seg>
<seg id="1097">"not always the best results created. this is not that a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data."</seg>
<seg id="1098">Also the data wired companies are sometimes wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">"yes, even Google makes mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1100">"in 2009, Google announced that it can predict through data analysis bursts of flu, the worst kind, predict -- by data analysis of Google research."</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderful and was a great news. the success gipfamily in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">"it worked flawless, year round year, until there was no longer working,"</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"it's just not working, this was once again a sensation, including the revocation of publication in the magazine" Nature. ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data supplied items such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">"despite all these errors currents, in decisions of life is a -- at the workplace, in the legal enforcement, in medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we would prefer to ensure that data are helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">"I also know many difficulties with data. I work in the computer-assisted genetics -- an area where some very clever people use unimaginable many data to make serious decisions about how the decision for a cancer therapy"</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a medication. over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions using data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">"you have to solve a complex problem, do mainly two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">"as a first time you shaken this problem in its parts, so that you can analyse and analyze the items; as a wide range of items you put the items again to create a closure."</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times but there are always two things: apart and restore it again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help create a problem and understand its parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to match the parts again and then come to a exclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1116">"for this, there is another tool and we have it all: our brain."</seg>
<seg id="1117">"if there is something that is good at which the brain is good, it is parts and pieces to reset, even if the information is uncomplete, then when the information is incomplete, especially if it is the brain of a expert."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"that is why I think was Netflix so successful because they have used data and mind, where they also go in the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"you use data to better understand what else would not have been able to do. but the decision, how to put all these parts, and make it a show like" House of Cards, "that was not in the data."</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show which meant that they entered a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon however did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they used data to control all of their decisions, first when they chose TV-ideas when they chose" "Alpha House" "as a show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">"it was a safe decision, because they could always say," We tell us the data. "</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data are helpful for better decisions, but I believe things go wrong when data start our decisions to control."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool and not forget that this device is quite useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">"before there was data, this was the device for decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is also called "Magic 8 Ball". it is amazing. for decisions using an Jaw or no. you just have to shake the ball to get an answer. "most likely" -- right here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will later feared it later with a technicians.</seg>
<seg id="1132">I have met some decisions in my life so I should have heard in retrospect on the ball.</seg>
<seg id="1133">"but as you know of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace this through something much clevert, such as data analysis to make better decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic building.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"so perhaps the ball is clever and clever and clever, and ultimately it is about us to make decisions if we want to achieve something exceptional at the end of the right turn."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I feel this as a very encouraging message, that despite the great amount of data still pays off to make decisions to be an expert in what you do, and risks."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"because at the end there are not the data, but the risks to which you end at the end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you nice.</seg>
