Munich 1856 : four cards that change your view to the city
a Ir@@ ren @-@ An@@ st@@ alt where young people are supposed to meet young people .
a pit capac@@ itor where now for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel will be excav@@ ated .
Klein@@ g@@ ärt@@ ner manage the most important reason for farmers .
the oldest official map of Mün@@ ch promotes exciting stories to days .
there are N@@ ER@@ VT if they are not currently up @-@ to @-@ date map .
&quot; that knows each , who had to maintain itself , because the Auto @-@ Nav@@ i took place a green meadow . &quot;
&quot; the historical maps of the digital Bavaria At@@ l@@ ases , a quot@@ ation of the ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als of Bavaria of the government , are anything but currently very enlight@@ ened . &quot;
especially if you compare it with current online maps .
then the cities and communities in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Merk@@ ur has changed since the 19th century .
&quot; the digital Bavaria @-@ Atlas is an Flick@@ r , which is not seen as such . &quot;
&quot; in the big over@@ sized card have been incorporated for cities and communities for more detail , so @-@ called urine leaves . &quot;
this resulted in accordance with the Bay@@ erische Staats@@ mess@@ engers between 18@@ 10 and 1864 and released the first measurement of Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army @-@ leader Bayern since the spring of 1800 during the Second World War II with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographic recording of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
&quot; even if the French troops with the peace of L@@ UN@@ É@@ VILLE from 9 February 18@@ 01 finally passed : there were the present neighbours , which created the idea of a nation@@ wide Bavaria map . &quot;
&quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV . Joseph was pro@@ gres@@ sing the project , founded the &quot; Top@@ ograph@@ ical Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bay@@ erische Staats@@ oper administration . &quot;
the WP sheet for Munich dates back to the year 1856 and can be found like any other on the website of the Bay@@ erische Staats@@ bibli@@ othek .
the comparison of Early / Today is most impressive in the example of the country &apos;s capital .
the city has spread itself in all directions and has grown up .
an example of this is sub@@ sen@@ dling that appears in the map of 1856 still relatively isolated .
&quot; Sen@@ dling was set up for 21 years after creation of the map , so 1877 , as Mün@@ chner district . &quot;
today Unter@@ sen@@ dling is located in the middle of the city .
&quot; the homes of Unter@@ sen@@ dl@@ ings focus in 1856 along the present pl@@ ing@@ shot road that was only named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ ans@@ er , a leader of the insur@@ rection of the Bav@@ arian peasants against Austria 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where today is the West@@ park is , one sees nothing more than fields - at first glance : when Hin@@ dem@@ o@@ oms appears a smaller @-@ piece card with t@@ utz@@ ing lines and numbers : handmade Fl@@ ur@@ ings made of the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; document &quot; , &quot; which was derived from the basic tax . &quot;
small pitches have no farmers on this day - but Klein@@ g@@ ärt@@ ner of the plant &quot; country in sun .
a large fo@@ unders stands north of Unter@@ sen@@ dling .
&quot; Ther@@ es@@ ien@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 locations of the Okt@@ ober@@ f@@ ests , in the 19th century there was a meadow - and no concrete . &quot;
on the other side of the Is@@ ar gives the historical map showing an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
&quot; in the sphere of the present district Au @-@ Ha@@ id@@ hausen , one is not only the street &quot; &quot; Gast@@ e@@ ig &quot; &quot; or from the ascent &quot; &quot; On the ventilation &quot; &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ fel@@ d@@ straße , people used to be with mad@@ ness . &quot;
there was 18@@ 58 / 59 the Mün@@ chner circle @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anst@@ alt &quot; on the Au@@ er Lü@@ ch .
&quot; from 1872 the Dr. Bernhard of G@@ ud@@ den , the establishment of the psychiat@@ rist , which is brought in connection with the death of King Lud@@ w@@ igs . &quot;
&quot; he was advanced for his time and ended , for example the Ank@@ le of the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot;
&quot; in addition , he is forbidden to apply violence against the ins@@ ets , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , Head of the Museum Ha@@ id@@ hausen , who has worked for an exhibition with the An@@ st@@ alt . &quot;
&quot; for 280 patients had first place , later on 500 places it was expanded . &quot;
somet@@ ime also this capacity is no longer considered - the reason for the construction of the roundabout in hair 1905 .
&quot; there have been the Is@@ ar @-@ Am@@ per @-@ Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ East , one of the largest psychiat@@ ries in Germany . &quot;
on the A@@ real of the former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt now meet young people in Munich Sal@@ es@@ ian@@ um .
the Order &apos;s war@@ b the buildings in 1920 and walked it into a youth with training .
&quot; west is the football pitch of the TS@@ V Munich East , east residential houses from the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bosco &quot; - &quot; in architectural approach to the origins of Ir@@ ren@@ anst@@ alt that had been destroyed during the Second World War in the Second World War . &quot;
&quot; the Marien@@ platz was at 1856 as &quot; &quot; Head Square &quot; &quot; the department called &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot; &quot;
a crucial change brought the Second World War also in the heart of Munich .
the Bom@@ bs of the Al@@ lies in December 1944 many holes in the city center .
a big stayed until today - at Marien@@ hof .
&quot; the German Institute , small business buildings and a pit chapel from the Middle Ages once stood on Marien@@ hof , where these days were the pre @-@ work and on 5 April 2017 the Sp@@ at@@ enst@@ ich are made for the second S @-@ Bahn line . &quot;
&quot; with the sli@@ der , the old Munich map can be compared with the a@@ erial view of today - and the hole on Marien@@ hof . &quot;
civil rights group before travel war@@ der for Miss@@ ouri
the National Association for the Promotion of coloured has issued a warning for colour@@ ful people who are travelling on the discrimin@@ ating politics and the rac@@ ist attacks of the state to Miss@@ ouri .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the federal state Miss@@ ouri which should enter into force up to 28 August 2017 , as a series of question@@ able , rac@@ en@@ based inc@@ idents shall occur in recent times throughout the whole state and be noted here in the opinion of the group . &quot;
&quot; a recently adopted law of Miss@@ ouri , which makes people more difficult to gain discrimination , as well as the pro@@ secution authorities of the state , the di@@ spro@@ port@@ ionate force of minorities , the di@@ spro@@ port@@ ionate group , said the NA@@ AC@@ P . &quot;
they have violations of the citizen &apos;s rights to happen .
&quot; they are stopped for their skin color , they will be mer@@ ged or killed , &quot; &quot; said the President of the Miss@@ ouri NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , the K@@ ansas City Star . &quot;
&quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not yet heard . &quot;
it is the first such warning that has issued the organisation for a state in the USA .
&quot; the group quoted inc@@ idents like rac@@ ist Ver@@ ses against black students at the University of Miss@@ ouri and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee . &quot;
&quot; S@@ anders died under question@@ n@@ worthy circumstances at the beginning of the year , when he had taken no gas@@ oline during the journey through the State of Miss@@ ouri in cust@@ ody , without a crime of crimin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; the Council also points to a recently published report by the Office of the Secretary General of Miss@@ ouri in which it is shown that black driving force in the state 75 percent are more common than circum@@ cis@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and their families , friends and staff informed about what could happen in Miss@@ ouri &quot; , &quot; said Chapel . &quot;
people need to be willing to bring it to Kaut@@ sky or relatives that they travel through the state .
&quot; Miss@@ ouri back in 2015 100 Hass@@ crimes , according to the latest figures from the Hass@@ le @-@ report of the F@@ BI , which is the state in relation to the number of such injury to the 16th rank of the country . &quot;
&quot; the travel warning is also an answer to a new Miss@@ ouri &apos;s law , which would make it harder to compl@@ ain a company because of residential or employment discrimination . &quot;
&quot; previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ LU ) travel war@@ ned for Texas and Arizona , after the states of immig@@ rants have passed , the local law en@@ forcement authorities committed to relie@@ ve people because of immigration to further rac@@ ial pro@@ filed . &quot;
&quot; travel openings are usually issued by the Foreign Ministry for other countries , but in recent times have stakeholders the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the USA . &quot;
We@@ ide@@ z@@ aun@@ project is elementary @-@ related
the her@@ ed@@ itary We@@ ide@@ z@@ aun project is a success @-@ project and will continue in the coming year .
the CD@@ U @-@ Bun@@ dest@@ ag@@ sab@@ p Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac have sent a picture on site .
&quot; at the Arch@@ enn@@ en@@ hof family Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann met representatives of the Fisch@@ erb@@ acher CD@@ U @-@ village , together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MEPs . &quot;
&quot; Markus Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann granted first insights into his farm , in which he is 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest sw@@ ans , 40 dairy cows , and also houses many kitt@@ ens and houses in five apartments holiday guests . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Schwar@@ zw@@ al@@ d@@ mil@@ ch &quot; &quot; is for him the ag@@ ull @-@ free product line for the milk of his cows , so Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
on the table of the Ferien@@ ga@@ este is exclusively regional .
&quot; as he is also called B@@ LH@@ V President of Fisch@@ bach , he called the We@@ ide@@ z@@ aun@@ project as an &quot; elementary project . &quot; &quot;
I can carry on such steep areas not profitable economies .
&quot; the green environment care for a lot of work , much m@@ ates with the motor@@ sense are processed . &quot;
&quot; we have to fight here with the terms and conditions with the Top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; stressed Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 he took over the elev@@ ated operation and enter@@ tains these without chemical plant@@ ing protection and fertil@@ izers , even if he is not a bio@@ enterprise . &quot;
&quot; for Mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear : &quot; &quot; the Commun@@ e has recognized the meaning of the We@@ ide@@ z@@ ren project , and is happy to know about the leader . &quot;
&quot; at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are , the farmers would have to be supported . &quot;
hope that the for@@ ce@@ asing of the areas could be gone even quite a while .
&quot; the biggest treasure we have , are the people who work in agriculture and make thoughts about how they continue their operation , &quot; stressed the Mayor . &quot;
farmers stand by promoting many times in criticism
over the We@@ ide@@ z@@ aun@@ ts were fenced in 2013 a total of 25 plots from eleven participants .
&quot; the disclosure surface is thus 40 hectares , which can not be raised until at least 2023 . &quot;
&quot; from the total cost of 71 500 euro , half over Leader was promoted , a quarter carried the municipality of fishing . &quot;
&quot; thus , the farmers remained 12 610 Euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometres We@@ ide@@ z@@ aun . &quot;
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; said Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; you do not make a really good job , without farmers and land . &quot;
also for Peter white stood firm : &quot; here are the best food produced . &quot;
the Land@@ sc@@ rut@@ iny line ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg allows the state promotion of past@@ ures .
the goal is the disclosure of the Schwar@@ zw@@ al@@ ds .
condition is the presence of one of the L@@ PR @-@ named convey@@ ors .
&quot; in addition , the ins@@ ign@@ ific@@ ant surface must not be bad ( h@@ ang@@ ing over 35 percent ) and must be threatened by the for@@ tif@@ ication . &quot;
&quot; for 2018 , We@@ ide@@ z@@ aun@@ project 2018 currently runs the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build a little 16 kilometers fence . &quot;
&quot; the disclosure surface corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros . &quot;
is nothing more holy ?
&quot; now , the White House of Tru@@ mp takes the Statue of Liberty &quot;
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is it when they begin to att@@ empt@@ ing the statues .
the Americans estimate this as well as any other - hence the pain@@ st@@ aged Stur@@ z S@@ add@@ am H@@ uss@@ one at the Fir@@ dos square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tru@@ mp regime , certainly knew what he did when he did a symb@@ olic ax@@ e into a bright argument with Jim A@@ cost@@ a from CN@@ N on the proposals of the dra@@ st@@ ic limitation of legal migration with the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to stay fair , Miller does not handle the statue itself . &quot;
a hor@@ de of jet@@ ties and Liberty @-@ Im@@ it@@ ators would have had it pun@@ ched if he had done it .
&quot; but he took their meaning , and in particular the meaning that you have written , when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the memorial , was added to his base . &quot;
&quot; as Miller A@@ cost@@ a , I will not enter into a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... an symbol of American freedom , which illuminated the world . &quot;
&quot; the poem , which you relate to which later was added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; Miller is obvious , but how he formed it himself , it is not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is about the contemporary reson@@ ance on the asc@@ ending words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state does not only charge any old immig@@ rants , but the poo@@ rest of the poor : &quot; &quot; your wo@@ unds , your arms , to breathe out , free to breathe , to the mis@@ erable waste of your rich coastal . &quot;
&quot; there was never a time , in which the &quot; &quot; apost@@ asy waste &quot; &quot; was better seen on our screens . &quot;
Miller dedicated himself in liter@@ ary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Tru@@ m@@ ps USA .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural struggle : it is indeed a conflict around the importance of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who sat down to place their words after their death at the base - knew very good that they had a high @-@ political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American Re@@ public@@ ans by putting the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem is the female figure out no longer abstract - it has received a voice .
and she herself gives herself a very different name : mother of the ex@@ il@@ ants .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist Cou@@ p and a devast@@ ating attack on American Nat@@ iv@@ ism .
&quot; and exactly how Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , the people of the right wing wanted to change it for a long time . &quot;
&quot; the great cry as Rush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tru@@ mp , argu@@ ed 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is argu@@ ed , but rather an early ne@@ ok@@ on@@ serv@@ o be that the American flame is moving into the world . &quot; Lady Liberty goes forward . &quot;
it is supposed to carry the tor@@ ches of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch should not shine the way to the United States . &quot;
quite unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh here on something st@@ amped .
the meaning of the statue is quite and certainly a question of the perception of perception .
&quot; the great imagin@@ ative fact of Lazarus was to see it as they were seen by the exhausted , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible journeys on the deck@@ s of ships have been viewed . &quot;
&quot; it is in the tru@@ est sense to see the world from the perspective of men , the refuge and a chance to improve their lives . &quot;
her statue speaks to them the words of hope and will of the will they have to hear .
&quot; and of course , this is not the perspective that Miller and Tru@@ mp will ever be able to acknowledge . &quot;
&quot; your tor@@ ch should not shine the path , but the hate which is the only source of power to ign@@ ite . &quot;
world championship 2017 : Ne@@ il Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the team of Great Britain
&quot; Eil@@ id@@ h Do@@ yle rem@@ inds of a time , when only two Sch@@ otten belong@@ ed to the team of Great Britain . &quot;
&quot; the director of the Athlet@@ ics of the United Kingdom , Ne@@ il Black , says that the 16 @-@ headed Scottish cont@@ ing@@ ent in the world championship will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athl@@ ete was selected for London 2017 which starts on Friday .
black believes that &quot; in Scotland has developed something special , and the athlet@@ ics of the United Kingdom has something to learn from it . &quot;
&quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it , and we will continue to find it until we find it , &quot; said Black . &quot;
I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think that it has something to do with what they did .
the Scottish Ath@@ l@@ ets think that it has something to do with what they did .
British Athlet@@ ics : it has something to do with what they did .
and also with the type at the road .
&quot; whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
&quot; several of the Scottish Ath@@ l@@ eten are med@@ als @-@ candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - which was elected against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m Route , while Eil@@ id@@ h Do@@ yle was elected to the team at the team captain . &quot;
&quot; Eil@@ id@@ h is quite modest .
&quot; their captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; says Black . &quot;
&quot; a series of athletes , no matter whether they were sc@@ ott@@ ish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very motiv@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; the passion and the real feeling , the Eil@@ id@@ h brought quite naturally , were great . &quot;
&quot; the Common@@ wealth of silver med@@ al , who will compete with their fifth world champion@@ ships at the 400 @-@ m hur@@ dles , says that it is &quot; &quot; incredible &quot; &quot; that 16 C@@ aves are in the British team . &quot;
&quot; Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , who were achieved in 1983 and 2015 . &quot;
the mid@@ w@@ iper Mu@@ ir runs on this path and has placed two European re@@ cor@@ ds last year .
&quot; it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m run@@ ners . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , the 1.500 m is another one , which one should be included in a great season which should observe the victory at the British team tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games . &quot;
Do@@ yle rem@@ inds of their first world championship as the only other car@@ rot in the team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ nell .
&quot; the scientists of the capit@@ ulate says that they are &quot; &quot; enorm@@ ously &quot; &quot; of the fact that many of their land sle@@ eves not only belong to the team , but in some cases also among the med@@ als and at the fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; the special thing about this team is to be chosen that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so that it was a great honour for me , but knowing that my team @-@ mate for me and have chosen to make it something very special for me , &quot; she added . &quot;
obviously I am very proud of all the vill@@ i that belong to the team .
it just shows how far we come .
&quot; and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to rise on Po@@ di@@ ums . &quot;
what my speech affects the chapters ?
&quot; yes , I think it went well . &quot;
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation since we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to set up this home support and benefit from it that we are back at the Olympi@@ ast@@ adion .
&quot; I get a second chance to go there and compete , and there will be just such a great atmosphere out there . &quot;
block of critics on Facebook : do not take care of a public office if you do not wear the arrangements of voters .
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
&quot; the Americans loved George Washington , but it took not long until the newspapers took him because of all that , from the inner policy up to its political principles . &quot;
&quot; he p@@ im@@ ed in criticism , sure . &quot;
but he has not brought his critics to silence .
&quot; for in 17@@ 83 Washington : &quot; &quot; the freedom of expression can be taken away - and , stup@@ id and st@@ um@@ m we will run as the sheep on the slau@@ ghter . &quot;
this brings me to Maryland to govern@@ or Larry H@@ og@@ an who needs to work on it to be more like Washington .
H@@ og@@ ans employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 persons and deleted that their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union put him in the beginning of this week .
&quot; the rod of the Gover@@ nor did the complaint as fri@@ v@@ ol , and the online comment was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot;
&quot; it is only Facebook , &quot; said many people . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is particularly important if it is a type like H@@ og@@ an .
&quot; this is a re@@ publ@@ ican Gover@@ nor in an overwhelming democratic state , which is amaz@@ ingly popular . &quot;
he has the second @-@ second agreement of the 50 Gover@@ nor of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a reactionary Hit@@ z@@ head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict compliance with the principles .
he was also very sent to use Facebook as a pri@@ ma@@ iden funds to connect with its voters and play his hairy head according to chemotherapy in his side .
&quot; therefore , the block@@ ing of people who come to the side of the Govern@@ ors - the public Forum is , which is officially referred to as officially and by staff who are paid with public tax dollars - un@@ necessary and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with The Washington Post , H@@ og@@ ans Spe@@ aker Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse the actions of the govern@@ or and ar@@ gues that block@@ ing the comments is nothing more than a moder@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; but it is too simple to use the image of tro@@ ug@@ es or sp@@ amm@@ ers , or h@@ asser@@ ted people , which sp@@ ong@@ es online the wh@@ ip . &quot;
the mail spoke with some of the real people who were blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
&quot; and these are only real people who talk to their chosen leaders : a teacher , an entre@@ pren@@ eur and a pastor , no tro@@ ll@@ s . &quot;
they all said that their comments were respect@@ ful , thought@@ ful and not prof@@ ane . &quot;
the pastor quoted the Bible in his post and app@@ ell@@ ed at H@@ og@@ ans Catholic faith .
&quot; attor@@ ney in Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani from Bow@@ ie , M@@ d . , was not h@@ asser@@ ted , but she asked about hate crimes . &quot;
&quot; I commented polite that I was disappointed , that there was no reaction to all @-@ hate crimes and other current news , &quot; she wrote in the commentary box of the post@@ ing &quot; &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea if a number of people at the same subject takes place , then they are more likely to be mist@@ aken by some of them as a so @-@ called collective employment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; what the employees of the govern@@ or as &quot; focused Spam attack , others would probably call &quot; inter@@ cession . &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply setting a crit@@ ic or a negative comment deleted .
it is much imm@@ er than in former time when you have done the same thing to collect newspapers to gather newspapers with critical lad@@ ders and to burn prot@@ esters or prot@@ esters .
but exactly this is exactly digital .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public officials who has critic@@ ised the Facebook and other social media .
President Tru@@ mp is charged by Twitter @-@ users who were blocked from his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question fell last week in Virginia .
&quot; the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County dece@@ ived the First Am@@ end@@ ment , according to the U.S. district of James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when she pre@@ aching a voters by her fac@@ ebook site . &quot;
and in K@@ entu@@ cky received Gover@@ nor Matt Be@@ vin ( R ) also a visit from the AC@@ LU because of its use of Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so hard .
&quot; at the moment of Wash@@ ing@@ tons , the time of affordable port@@ os had a similar effect as the Internet . &quot;
the number of newspapers noted between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous envelop@@ e clever on its leadership . &quot;
and even at that time Washington anonymous tro@@ ll@@ s .
&quot; the people , the pseud@@ ony@@ ms like &quot; &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola &quot; , &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ ti@@ us &quot; , &quot; wrote all the letters to newspapers , the Wash@@ ing@@ tons decisions made . &quot;
&quot; pet@@ itions , which have collected its position on the contract of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Great Britain , according to the historical documents that were collected by the online Pap@@ ers of George Washington Project . &quot;
but he has not brought them to silence .
freedom of expression and dis@@ agreements are the basis of our nation .
and true leadership means to accept that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort at the Renaissance Club
&quot; the former European No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for the next three days on domestic comfort , since the Renaissance Club in East L@@ oth@@ ian became the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open . &quot;
&quot; Nor@@ di@@ re , who led to the end last year at Arch@@ er@@ field &apos;s links to the end , before he joined Paul E@@ ales , is bound up with the new location and serves as a tournament owner on behalf of the association and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot;
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he achieved with this event his glory , &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; players will see this course from its best site , he is in a great condition . &quot;
Jerry has made a great job than he placed this place .
he is a noble supporters of this game and is proud of his achievement here .
this is a great show@@ case for this course . &quot;
the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defend a championship for the first time in his 32 @-@ year career both at the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour .
&quot; this really feels especially interested , &quot; &quot; said the player in South@@ port . &quot;
&quot; I have not able to defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open , since it was last year after I had gained them out of the program . &quot;
back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play .
&quot; the memories come back from the last year , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on , last year here . &quot;
it was a really special time and one we will always appreciate .
Gary Or@@ r who came to the European Senior Tour earlier this year after his 50@@ th birthday .
this event will be the first sham@@ eful performance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want to make it well , but you can feel this additional pressure . &quot;
I really enjoyed it again and I played a sol@@ o@@ ides golf .
I am happy about how it has been gone .
&quot; with the trio on the field the former Masters of Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam , and the Senior Major Champions Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ ato . &quot;
&quot; Or@@ r and the former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ rance belong to the six sho@@ ots in the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ All@@ ister , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dru@@ m@@ mond . &quot;
the entrance is free , the parking lot costs £ 5 per car with a regular and £ 10 per car with two or more passengers . &quot;
all proce@@ eds go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less lung cancer by p@@ assi@@ v@@ age
over the past two decades less people died because of p@@ assi@@ vity of lung cancer .
&quot; to this result , scientists from the University of Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ ke ) come in a study . &quot;
&quot; according to our estimates are attributed per year 167 lung cancer of p@@ assi@@ vity , &quot; &quot; said He@@ iko He@@ iko Be@@ cher . &quot;

home@@ work prove to be very complex
&quot; construction works in the Vill@@ inger street are in full swing and &quot; &quot; lie in the time &quot; , &quot; so the director of the building Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; in the field of house@@ wives , the situation is more complicated than suspe@@ cted as there is much disc@@ ern@@ ing in the underground . &quot;
&quot; the traffic , which over and over again the construction works disabled , represents a big problem for the b@@ aut@@ op@@ p of the company St@@ ump@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the ignor@@ ance of the driving in front of red lights and sc@@ ep@@ it@@ ters is enormous , &quot; reported Hein@@ ze . &quot;
the road is locked and only the line @-@ bus are eligible for passage .
Angelo Car@@ uso , Marvin Kost@@ or@@ z and Tim Kost@@ or@@ z from the company St@@ ump@@ p has been employed for weeks with working on the bridge . &quot;
&quot; the hot days were quite exhau@@ sting .
&quot; but fortunately we were supplied by our friend Fritz Matt with cooler mineral water , &quot; tells Marvin Kost@@ or@@ z . &quot;
poverty and death in the Indonesian Gol@@ dland
&quot; when B@@ ard@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i c@@ ooks the dinner cook , she does not use a stove . &quot;
it even uses rarely a pot .
&quot; in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai government in the un@@ quiet Indonesian province , the house@@ wife usually lined with a Sweet pot@@ ato - locally as &quot; not@@ a &quot; &quot; - directly in the fireplace . &quot;
after half an hour the disgu@@ ised tu@@ ber will be taken up with e@@ if@@ r@@ igen , un@@ washed hands . &quot;
De@@ ge@@ i s@@ its on the loft - she has no furniture - where they also performs their daily work - e.g. d@@ resses with tr@@ ü@@ bem water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a buck@@ et in a hom@@ eless room serves as lat@@ rine .
&quot; as a recent one of the four wives of her husband , you have not been assigned any fields . &quot;
Poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
&quot; of course , late to work is dangerous : most vill@@ ers are un@@ employed , and many drink heavy , and there are the soldiers here . &quot;
&quot; no one knew , after 17 o &apos;clock in the village around the village , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into the daily life in the highlands of Papua , a former dut@@ ch colony , which was recorded in 1969 after a contro@@ ver@@ si@@ al referendum in Indonesia as only 1.0@@ 26 El@@ ders before occup@@ ying the occup@@ ying forces . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement that fought for independence against the Dutch rule , turned quickly against the government of Jak@@ arta , which holds control over the region and ex@@ clude foreign journalists or legal representatives . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , the province officially launched in Papua and West Papua , with the independent part of Papua New Guinea @-@ Neu@@ gu@@ ine@@ as on the eastern part of the island . &quot;
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as secluded as it is . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provin@@ cial capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning drive away by car rental .
there is no public transport .
&quot; the town with about 19.@@ 000 inhabitants is made of wooden houses , which are surrounded by bam@@ boo fenced , and made of cor@@ rug@@ ged roofs , which were converted through R@@ ost in various gel@@ b@@ bra@@ une sounds . &quot;
&quot; very few Indonesian have made their journey here , more journalists and practically no foreigners . &quot;
&quot; before Christian mission@@ aries came , hon@@ ored Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans a God called U@@ GA Tam@@ ee . &quot;
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wear this clothes , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points to their lively , hand@@ craft@@ ed tur@@ ban , her dar@@ ker shirt , and their bright rock . &quot;
&quot; earlier , we only had leaves of our bodies . &quot;
Papua is the poo@@ rest province where 28 % of the people under the poverty @-@ border live and some of the worst inf@@ ants and alphabet@@ isation rates in Asia have .
but it is also Indonesian Gol@@ dland .
&quot; the largest and profitable gold mine from the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a plateau near New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , Free@@ port was built in the value of 3,@@ 1 billion US dollars in gold and copper . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Papua is in value of estimated 78 billion US dollars . &quot;
&quot; however , these rich@@ es are however a source of mis@@ ery for Papua who make sure that Indones@@ ias emp@@ ower@@ ing military an initial presence preserved . &quot;
&quot; an examination from 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port was local dairy and units of between 1998 and 2004 nearly 20 million US dollars , including up to 150,000 US dollars to a single officer . &quot;
Pap@@ u@@ anic demands for larger autonomy re@@ threat@@ ening this golden g@@ ans and are treated mer@@ c@@ il@@ ess .
&quot; according to the data of activists , more than 500,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been tor@@ mented since 1969 from the Indonesian military , tor@@ tured and adher@@ ed . &quot;
mass@@ ages in Pap@@ u@@ as stem cell @-@ land in 1970 @-@ 10 years became part of the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission in the gen@@ ocide .
in the region the Indonesian police last year more than 3.@@ 900 peaceful prot@@ esters .
&quot; we value all &quot; &quot; Every@@ thing &quot; &quot; is called in a report from the arch@@ dioc@@ ese Brisbane in the year 2016 , in which reports of atro@@ cities and torture - r@@ ape and electric attacks are particularly popular according to another report - and the brutal decline of peaceful demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims as any week , says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia @-@ researchers for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
bol@@ ts have strengthened since Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring a state of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demo@@ graphic development changes from the popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ aw@@ esi . &quot;

&quot; the migrants have begun to sell chickens and vegetables at the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua , &quot; explains A@@ beth You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai native , which moved to the provin@@ cial capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot;
&quot; it has the native Papua Mama , the Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the Women &#93; from Papua - their market costs . &quot;
&quot; the Indonesian President Jok@@ o Wid@@ o@@ do , known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , and spoke to the equ@@ alities and the legal violations in Papua . &quot;
&quot; the former carp@@ enter was secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the pres@@ idential Palace in Jak@@ arta . &quot;
&quot; but in Papua has changed little , and today the nat@@ ives feel che@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; our hearts are broken because we have stopped for Jok@@ ow@@ i , with the expect@@ ation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice is restored , &quot; says You . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is inaugur@@ ation in October a draft . &quot;
on 7 December 2014 a group of 11 children out and sang Christ@@ mas@@ lie@@ der before a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali as two ind@@ on@@ esian soldiers in a motorcycle by the darkness .
the sh@@ atter@@ y children said to them that they should turn their spot@@ light .
&quot; one of the soldiers participated in their sound and later came back with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers , who had dr@@ unk , j@@ aw@@ ed , and smote the group with their conscience , said victims and witnesses . &quot;
then one of the soldiers cut into the group of children .
&quot; a child , the 16 @-@ year old Y@@ ul@@ ian@@ us Ye@@ imo , was so hard to be@@ aten that he fell into coma . &quot;
a few hours later the building was set to the nearby governmental commission in brand and the things escal@@ ated the next day .
&quot; about 1,000 young Papua men , women and children gathered together on a football field in front of the local police station and the military com@@ o@@ ward center to demand justice . &quot;
they bore di@@ em@@ on@@ ous Jag@@ db@@ aires and led the Wa@@ ita dance - in the circle and take a bird @-@ s@@ ighted - of Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe .
some prot@@ esters began in polic@@ i@@ - and military @-@ po@@ res .
&quot; when the atmosphere was heated , the soldiers was sent a command on an internal funk : &quot; if the masses did more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; is it not released in an official document of TIME that the local media has not been released . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the dro@@ pping danger and called for rest and invited the crowd to return home . &quot;
nobody was listen to the mood in the mood .
&quot; when I turned into my left hand , I was shot in my left hand wr@@ ist , he said TIME on the veranda of his colorful wood . &quot;
&quot; k@@ ay@@ ame knows still not , who is fi@@ red , but says that the bul@@ let from the ranks of the soldiers gathered together . &quot;
&quot; it was over@@ crowded , many shots were fi@@ red , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his cous@@ in , the witness of the proce@@ eding was . &quot;
&quot; I ran@@ ked to him and sup@@ sought his body to be sure that he was , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who like many Indones@@ ians only bear a name , the TIME in glo@@ omy atmosphere . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I used him .
&quot; the chiefs of the Papua Police , Y@@ ot@@ je M@@ ende , said Re@@ porter , that his officers wanted to ensure their station only &quot; &quot; secure , because it will be attacked . &quot;
&quot; we have to defend ourselves when people threat@@ ening to kill us , &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Papua Police , Commissioner Pud@@ jo Sul@@ ist@@ i@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch five young prot@@ esters were killed and many more in@@ ju@@ red .
the news about the killing were only available on the following day &apos; fil@@ tered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
&quot; three weeks held Jok@@ ow@@ i in Jay@@ uya a passionate speech , in which he vo@@ iced sympath@@ ies for the families of the victims and fluctu@@ ate the historical mis@@ ors in Papua . &quot;
&quot; I would like that this case is immediately resolved , so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
security sm@@ iles Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 that he has a extra @-@ court mechanism to resolve historical human rights violations .
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; most inj@@ uries have occurred a long time ago .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and beginning of the 2000 @-@ year .
&quot; the point is that we have committed to address these violations , but there are processes that have to pass through . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; then ret@@ anto made a retreat , when he spoke on 5 June in Jak@@ arta with TIME and said , he have no plans to set up a complaint . &quot;
&quot; instead , everything is governed by law , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; he has indi@@ cted the UN because of &quot; crimes against humanity , that said more than 1,000 deaths in Ost@@ tim@@ ors , In@@ ig@@ ke@@ its @-@ coordination of 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Papua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai inc@@ ident . &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims took such claims with gri@@ pping unbelie@@ v@@ ability .
&quot; I have been inter@@ viewed in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that he was still living in fear years later .
&quot; I am afraid , &quot; says he . &quot;
&quot; I am afraid to be arrested by the military , I am afraid to be shot . &quot;
&quot; his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repet@@ itive the view that people have fear in Pan@@ i@@ ai , to discuss the inc@@ ident . &quot;
&quot; he says that he was struck by the military , after he helped to bury four of the victims . &quot;
&quot; after I buried the corp@@ ses , the military sought after me , &quot; says he . &quot;
the sho@@ ots have not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police on vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood De@@ iy@@ ai .
&quot; during a confrontation between village inhabited and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma , who ref@@ used to bring an unconscious man to hospital died a person and 17 others have been viol@@ ated , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ra@@ viol@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was tr@@ apped in a nearby river fishing , died on the way to hospital . &quot;
covered vill@@ agers prot@@ ested in front of the office of the company .
&quot; the police said that the vill@@ agers were on officers , who re@@ acted out of them war@@ med . &quot;
but locals say that the mobile Brig@@ ade ( ind@@ on@@ esian par@@ amil@@ itary police ) began to shoot and a t@@ öt@@ ete .
&quot; we were so in panic , we have afraid that it is re@@ venge will be re@@ venge &quot; , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Badi@@ i , who lived near the hospital and witness how the last one has been delivered here quickly , the TIME . &quot;
&quot; I have hidden two days in my house . &quot;
the De@@ iy@@ ai Parliament called to withdraw the participating officers and withdraw the mobile Brig@@ ade of the police from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a mis@@ bra@@ d for the Indonesian government .
&quot; the lack of sensu@@ al development strength@@ ens the diss@@ atis@@ faction of the tri@@ bal Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and Dam@@ al , who live in the green highlands of Papua . &quot;
&quot; many adher@@ es to the &quot; Free Papua movement &quot; ( OP@@ M ) to defend the rebellion , the claims to defend the rights of Papua , by spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and ab@@ outs of ind@@ on@@ esian soldiers . &quot;
&quot; some of the top @-@ OP@@ M guide come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ o@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; in response to the years thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were arrested and arbit@@ rary in prison , under the pre@@ text of the &quot; backup of national sovereignty . &quot;
some appear never again .
&quot; among the people in Papua Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as a trag@@ ic , established place . &quot;
poverty strength@@ ens the diss@@ atis@@ faction .
&quot; rice , which is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , is too expensive for locals . &quot;
bread is just as a range .
the people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y .
&quot; agriculture is the task of women , which can process each four or five fields of the Sweet pot@@ ato . &quot;
keep most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces Not@@ a cost only 10.000 ind@@ on@@ esian Rup@@ ies ( 75 C@@ ents ) .
in the course of time economic inequality between the native Papua and the new migrants has grown since the opening of new air@@ ways at the Nab@@ ire in larger number .
&quot; the few jobs , which is in the region , usually go to the better trained and prosper@@ ous migrants . &quot;
&quot; in Papua , capital , or the necessary skills to lead their own company competitive . &quot;
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John G@@ ob@@ ai , the Chairman of the Chief Council of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot;
isolation holds the eyes of the world far from Papua .
&quot; in addition , restrictions on international media remain t@@ ense . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , the French journalist Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Bas@@ ille Long@@ ch@@ amp were caused by lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua , although they were given the rare permission to the movies . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the Vice @-@ Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is &apos;s election campaigns , the limitations of reporting , to promote transparency and development . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists who are trying to report from Indonesia on the tranquil provinces of Papua and West@@ paper : Visa @-@ Ver@@ we@@ ig@@ ar and a black list , &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot;
lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely restricted to the immediate neighb@@ ors Pap@@ u@@ as .
&quot; in March six Pacific States - Tong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Mar@@ sh@@ all@@ in@@ seln as well as the Sal@@ om@@ one Islands - the UN Human Rights Council to examine the &quot; different and widely used inj@@ uries &quot; in Papua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting . &quot;
the same countries have historically been seen the OP@@ M .
&quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Foreign Minister Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha Nas@@ ir pointed the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia still holds a democratic system , and there is free media so it is difficult to keep the evidence of human rights accidents . &quot;
people on site want to take more foreign governments to know this .
&quot; as an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of the human right @-@ mess@@ enger , Ke@@ es Van B@@ aar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura on 4 May , removed from her silence and displac@@ ed him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; in accordance with a source which also would remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia has a further pres@@ idential election , but considering that they will probably not be right again for Jok@@ ow@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai treasures , &quot; says G@@ ob@@ ai the chairman of the trunk . &quot;
&quot; he wants that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from that it is under the constant threat of a r@@ äu@@ ble military , lives in arm@@ our@@ y educ@@ ators and health services . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like others Papua , their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; gu@@ ilt &quot; which he has to pay . &quot;
&quot; they do not need money , they just want justice , &quot; &quot; says he . &quot;
&quot; despite the threats and intim@@ id@@ ations of the families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ Sch@@ uss@@ ed offering a last symb@@ olic act of sl@@ ite , the corp@@ se of a O@@ pf@@ ers was buried on a terrain exactly opposite the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they know that they might never come to justice , but at least they will not forget those responsible for their crimes . &quot;
&quot; one member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with a separate head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scrap@@ er of Dubai for the second time
&quot; a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest residential towers in the world in Dubai , its thoroug@@ h@@ ers and zw@@ ang hundreds of residents , from the 337 meters high , 79 @-@ sto@@ rey building . &quot;
it is the second brand that is used in just two years through the sky@@ scrap@@ er which one is acc@@ idental to the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) .
&quot; the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , inj@@ uries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of flame . &quot;
&quot; we slept and we are stopped at the fire@@ works , and at the cry of the people . &quot;
&quot; we ran@@ ked the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to get from the 50@@ th floor to get down , &quot; told a resident that was named as George ang@@ ab , Reu@@ ters . &quot;
Dub@@ ais civilians said that the units of fire fighting against 4.00 p.m. local time ( 0@@ 0.00 GMT ) the fire ext@@ ingu@@ ished and the building cool@@ ed .
the government said they work on the provision of accommodation for those concerned .
&quot; the inc@@ ident can be used for security of materials , which are used in outside buildings around the world . &quot;
&quot; an examination by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its brand in 2015 revealed that the largest part of the damage from the disgu@@ ise , the outdoor cl@@ adding to the decoration or insulation . &quot;
&quot; in Great Britain , the police , they believe that the system of plates to isolation and cl@@ adding to the London Gren@@ chen tower could have contributed to the rapid expansion of a Bran@@ des , in which approximately 80 people died . &quot;
no Davis Cup reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the president of the International tennis association ( IT@@ F ) is through his great Davis Cup Cou@@ p at the Annual General Meeting .
&quot; at the meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h city , the award was supported for this sport revolutionary proposal , Davis Cup single still only on two pay@@ ers , th@@ in@@ ly not supported by the required two @-@ third majority . &quot;
&quot; while often very long , but even so very cher@@ ished five @-@ sentence classics remain the traditional competition . &quot;
&quot; 6@@ 3,@@ 54 percent of member states voted for reform , the aim of the IT@@ F @-@ president David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only wrong . &quot;
&quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members are not accepted the entire reform@@ ists for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot;
&quot; we need a change to secure the long term future of these ik@@ onic and historic cont@@ ests , &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot;
you will continue to work to improve the application .
&quot; not only to vote has come before the proposal after many in@@ comes before the proposal , the finale to a neutral place . &quot;
new from 2018 are just compar@@ atively smaller details : so the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will be in the first round the host &apos;s right .
&quot; to reduce costs to the organis@@ er , the requirements are facilit@@ ated in terms of training sessions etc , and players will have to be taken in front of the Davis Cup less official media dates . &quot;
&quot; more than 1 out of 5 US travellers brings to the plane , finds a survey . &quot;
&quot; a survey conducted by air@@ pass@@ ions that more than 20 per cent are aware or un@@ consc@@ iously made items to the check@@ points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent that the plane betra@@ yed , while they acc@@ identally betra@@ yed kn@@ ives or other items with blades . &quot;
&quot; less than 1 per cent claimed , they would have been bel@@ ated , that they would have been mist@@ aken with fl@@ ashes , amm@@ un@@ ition or spr@@ inkl@@ es . &quot;
&quot; the survey with more than 1,000 persons - that was conducted by a Jet @-@ Char@@ ter@@ service , the Strat@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , has been carried out - also established that younger travellers rather dis@@ regard the rules . &quot;
&quot; respond@@ ents to respond@@ ents that they have been kn@@ ow@@ ingly have tried to fly with something that was forbidden by the T@@ SA , were compared with less than 15 percent , members of the generation X were prohibited . &quot;
&quot; the most common items which were visible on T@@ SA agents , were foods and liquids . &quot;
&quot; more than 3 per cent gave to kn@@ owled@@ geable items with blades through the safety control , while 2,@@ 2 percent of the female respond@@ ents and 3,@@ 7 percent of the male respond@@ ents also confirmed that they could clearly put drugs into the plane . &quot;
&quot; the company said , I have asked travelers in the whole country to figure out how many acc@@ identally had brought about sm@@ ug@@ gel@@ ware by the airport safety and how many things are clearly done . &quot;
&quot; it is not a surprise that people who are connected to sm@@ ug@@ gel@@ ware - kn@@ ow@@ ingly or un@@ kn@@ ow@@ ingly - by safety , those who were most often fly . &quot;
&quot; however , the company points out that the T@@ SA rules are a little complicated and confusing . &quot;
people are often un@@ certain that liquids may take them or how much of them .
there is therefore no surprise that the largest amount of the T@@ SA se@@ ized items are bot@@ her@@ ed flu@@ ids .
&quot; a time long thought the people , the T@@ SA could view books as sm@@ ug@@ y@@ ware . &quot;
&quot; flu@@ ids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights . &quot;
El@@ on Mus@@ k is no matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la @-@ Custom@@ ers Order
&quot; e @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k , with the huge number of pre@@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; yet , he has hi@@ ther@@ to propose that a part of the customer has drawn their non @-@ binding reservation again . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the always tri@@ umph@@ al figures to wag@@ ering increases and still gig@@ antic @-@ growth , Tes@@ la @-@ Chef El@@ on Mus@@ k has for the first time another , less high @-@ gloss numbers : the canc@@ ell@@ ations of the new mass market model 3 . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ k was often used in recent months with the more than 500,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose delivery is just beginning . &quot;
&quot; now , Mus@@ k is a : from the total 5@@ 18.@@ 000 pre@@ orders have been with@@ drawn 6@@ 3,000 . &quot;
critics had always noted that it is only about non @-@ binding reservations .
&quot; at cancellation , Tes@@ la pays the 1000 euro ( in the US 1000 U.S. dollar and the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot;
&quot; at present , 45@@ 5.000 of such non @-@ binding reservations before , spac@@ ed mus@@ k in a telephone conference with an@@ alysts . &quot;
&quot; that the cancellation of far around twelve per cent of all orders may be made to the problem , the Tes@@ la Chef does not believe . &quot;
&quot; its argument : the challenge to ambitious growth aim is not on demand , but on the production side . &quot;
Tes@@ la 8@@ 4.000 cars spent last year .
&quot; 2018 should be assembled - all models have been assembled - 50@@ 0.000 , 2020 a million . &quot;
the demand for this is obviously there .
&quot; according to Mus@@ k , there are currently per day 1800 reservations . &quot;
&quot; who today ordered a &quot; &quot; Model 3 &quot; &quot; at the ear@@ liest in the second half of 2018 , with the delivery - if Tes@@ la creates , its brand new , never in practice tested production facilities with maximum util@@ ization . &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
&quot; but it comes to greater del@@ ays , then the im@@ age@@ ability of the reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la . &quot;
&quot; for then , the company can not go on to the satisfied customers in Sch@@ aren . &quot;
EPA leader P@@ ru@@ itt moves back to reduce emissions by the rules of Obama &apos;s Era to reduce emissions
&quot; after spending a day after he was charged by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the chief of the Environmental Protection Authority , giving his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of Obama era to reduce emissions smo@@ g . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change , when its agency proved to be the needs of state environmental authorities over time faster than previous administ@@ rations . &quot;
he did not mention the law@@ suit was collected against his previous place in a state of jurisdiction .
&quot; it is a deadline , which went on 1 October for states to comply with the standards of 2015 for ground @-@ floor zone . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June , that he will delay compliance with a year to study the plan to study the plan and to avoid the economic growth in local decisions . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by president Donald Tru@@ mp Pro@@ secut@@ or of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , was a long time a reliable opponent of demanding environmental regulations . &quot;
&quot; since its arrival in Washington is P@@ ru@@ itt , repe@@ ating to block regul@@ ating or delay , the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels res@@ ist . &quot;
the sud@@ den conversion from Wednesday is the recent legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ it@@ ts regulatory escal@@ ating agenda .
&quot; last month has decided on a federal court in Washington that the EPA administrator has exceeded its authority , when he tried to commit to the implementation of a rule of Obama administration , oil and gas companies to monitor and reduction of meth@@ an@@ le@@ cks . &quot;
&quot; in a st@@ och@@ ial evening opinion , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that his revers@@ als at Oz@@ on@@ us is simply the willingness of EPA in cooperation with the states to just@@ ify the new standards of timely implementation of the new standards . &quot;
&quot; under earlier administ@@ rations , the EPA often used the dead@@ lines for carrying out and then acc@@ used to set up from activists and other people , and in an agreement the appointment for carrying out , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who passed the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in a regulation by jurisdiction , and we take time seriously . &quot;
&quot; we also take the law and authority , which gives us seriously . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the opinion of EPA that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually use its &quot; powers to the delay and all the other legally available to ensure that the regulations are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
the Re@@ public@@ ans in Congress on a comprehensive en@@ forcement of the o@@ zone rules .
one of the last month of author@@ itative legislation should delay the implementation of the rules of 2015 at least eight years .
the measure was not yet provided in the Senate .
&quot; the New York @-@ General Adv@@ oc@@ ate Eric Sch@@ nei@@ der@@ man who had indi@@ cted the coalition of the States who had negoti@@ ated the EPA in this week , said the group intend to maintain the legal pressure . &quot;
&quot; the conversion of EPA - after our cl@@ uster - is an important gain for health and safety of these 6.8 million New York , which are directly affected by the smo@@ g who flows directly from the smo@@ g , &quot; said Sch@@ nei@@ der@@ man . &quot;
&quot; new York is located in California , Connecticut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , Iowa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Pennsylvania Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia . &quot;
&quot; zone o@@ zone is created when poll@@ ut@@ ants arises from cars , power plants , oil , oil , chemistry and other sources in the atmosphere in sunlight . &quot;
the resulting Smo@@ g can cause serious respiratory problems with sensitive groups of people and to help each year to thousands of premature death .
representatives of the public health of healthcare and the environ@@ ment@@ alists over P@@ ru@@ it@@ ts surprising course change .
&quot; it is wor@@ rying as much pressure it needs to get this reasonable step by those responsible for the protection of air we inhal@@ e , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from Center for Bi@@ ological Diversity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue fighting against the ide@@ ological Crus@@ ade of the Tru@@ mp government to bend pollution and their particular interests . &quot;

Association wants to test permission of wind wheels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim w@@ ip@@ her &quot; &quot; is not a legal prerequisite for the construction and has therefore turned out to the landing point . &quot;
&quot; the Association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim w@@ hon@@ ed &quot; &quot; Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) has prompt@@ ed his permission for the establishment of planned wind turbin@@ es in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette . &quot;
it is illegal .
the association argu@@ ed that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette no wind turbin@@ es could not have been approved at the time in Vier@@ sen just at the border to Schwal@@ m@@ tal .
&quot; within this concentration area , construction and operation of wind turbin@@ es are possible , at the same time the concentration of wind costs for the rest of the city . &quot;
such zones are to prevent a &quot; re@@ cess &quot; of the landscape .
&quot; the city of Vier@@ sen had a second wind power @-@ concentration area in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette , but the district government Düsseldorf was not approved because of a form@@ ulation . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of plan@@ ing legal requirements , the author@@ ised author@@ ization is to be rejected , and therefore also return , &quot; said Christopher Er@@ kens , Chairman of &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot;
current state of affairs : the Stad@@ ler took once again the wind@@ surf zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette ; a approval of the district government is still standing .
&quot; Er@@ kens , &quot; &quot; thus , the issu@@ ance of a permit for the establishment of wind turbin@@ es are excluded legally . &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the call .
&quot; the corresponding writing have been received since last week in the circle of Vier@@ sen , &quot; explained a spokes@@ man . &quot;
&quot; the circle takes her to the occasion , the affair again to consider . &quot;
but they are not likely to run that the procedure is stopped .
&quot; with a look at the ongoing proceedings of the Board Court , the circle did not want to go on the contrary to the argum@@ entation of the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot;
&quot; the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , is planning on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette building the construction of four each 200 meters high wind wheels . &quot;
&quot; already in the last year the company had also involved in which the city of Vier@@ sen medi@@ ator is , p@@ acht@@ ing agreements with the owner of about 65 hectares of great money . &quot;
&quot; with the establishment of the four wind turbin@@ es , the power requirement is to be covered from around 11 400 households , which corresponds to round a five @-@ fifth of all four households . &quot;
the NEW Re wants to invest around 20 million euros .
in the last summer Vier@@ sens town became green light for the purchase of three wind turbin@@ es in the wind park L@@ inn@@ ich at Aachen and a stake in a wind turbin@@ es in U@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district Hein@@ sberg .
car and tractor trucks : woman dies in hor@@ rif@@ y accident
one aw@@ ful traffic accident has opened on Fri@@ day@@ morning at 10 am on the L 333 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhine @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was not viol@@ ated fatal .
two more persons were easily viol@@ ated .
the provin@@ cial road remained locked over hours .
&quot; after police , a 17 year old young woman came from Born@@ with her car in the framework of the accompanied by accompanied by her 53 @-@ year mother as a companion to the L 333 in the direction of Bo@@ gel . &quot;
city and dealer plan &quot; home @-@ Sh@@ oppen &quot; weekend
bad Langen@@ sal@@ za@@ ers and people from the region should be re@@ discovered in the city centre in September .
the workshops and the city management wish to use the weekend at the 8th and 9th of September to lo@@ osen the inhabitants of shopping in the city center .
&quot; as the Chairman of the commercial bever@@ age , Christian King , announced , the &quot; homeland &quot; weekend will be sen@@ sibil@@ ising which offers the own city away from the usual supermarket @-@ commodity . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is planned for a market with regional suppliers , similar to the weekly market . &quot;
&quot; in addition , local companies are to present themselves together with their apprent@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the shops of the city center should be loaded into &quot; &quot; Mid@@ achts &quot; . &quot; &quot;
but the action is not only on inhabitants of the city and the surrounding area .
&quot; in preparation of commerci@@ als in the radio , an internet video and printed bag , which point to the share @-@ weekend as Christian King . &quot;
city administration and workshops have an co @-@ operation with the industrial and Chamber of Commerce .
&quot; to go to the commercial bever@@ age and the city into another stage of the project &quot; &quot; Attra@@ ctive downtown &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; these include new offers such as the first &quot; active @-@ day &quot; to the well @-@ day Sunday , conversation with all the workshops and hosts , to move them to active participation . &quot;
also attractive offers on Saturday and aband@@ on@@ ment on parking charges on that day are part of the concept .
&quot; additionally , customer @-@ potential will also be re@@ produced or closed again . &quot;
these include courses and tourists .
&quot; however , many locals would have lost the city centre while shopping . &quot;
&quot; in the end everyone would have to contribute to bel@@ low the city centre - up to land@@ lords , the factories of the whole city and verses . &quot;
&quot; it came to overcome with a network the Le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy , who made himself partly wider , had king in spring . &quot;
&quot; Birgit Stre@@ ich , Director of the I@@ HK @-@ Center in Mühl@@ hausen shared with the first third &quot; &quot; homeland &quot; &quot; day , for the first time in five Thuring@@ ian Cities . &quot;
&quot; besides Bad Langen@@ sal@@ za , this Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heil@@ igen@@ stadt and Ble@@ eders . &quot;
&quot; the day sol@@ le &quot; for appreci@@ ating local trade advert@@ ise and its significance for the common of our cities stronger , &quot; as Stre@@ ich . &quot;
the action under the spring of the I@@ HK and with many partners do also make clear that every citizen could influence its mer@@ ged environment .
two T@@ ote and several dev@@ ils to explos@@ ion to US @-@ School

new other people have been viol@@ ated .
&quot; in a gas explos@@ ion in the US @-@ city Minneapolis , two people killed and nine more viol@@ ated , some of them heavy . &quot;
according to the fire fighting on Wednesday ( local time ) is still a vulner@@ able in critical condition .
a man died as part of a school building with the explos@@ ion cycle .
a first missing later was later born dead .
&quot; with the dead , it turned to the school . &quot;
&quot; as the un@@ fortunate , the authorities work on a gas line . &quot;
at the holiday time only a few people were held in the building of the Minn@@ eh@@ aha Academy .
Tru@@ mp was transferred to Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scription by phone call between US @-@ president Donald Tru@@ mp and leaders from Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
&quot; on 27 January called Tru@@ mp in a phon@@ ate with the Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena Nie@@ to , to say that he would not pay for a planned border wall . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. President compl@@ ained him because he had publicly proclaimed the wall of public . according to him , he said to him , &quot; &quot; this can not say the press . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp launched its pres@@ idential election with the promise to set up a wall , and schw@@ or , Mexico for the project . &quot;
tran@@ scription of his first pine@@ apple with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and exposed a t@@ ense exchange .
&quot; Mr. Tru@@ mp said Mr. Turn@@ bull , that a trade for the USA refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia to take &quot; ridicul@@ ous &quot; , &quot; m@@ ies &quot; and &quot; stup@@ id , &quot; &quot; &quot; m@@ ies &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; du@@ p &quot; &quot; would let him look like a &quot; dep@@ p &quot; , &quot; after which he was proposed a ban on the overthrow of refugees in the United States . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Tru@@ mp ended the call , after he had said Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; this is the most pleas@@ ant@@ est call for the whole day . &quot;
Moo@@ res Ford @-@ Mass@@ aker : activists lead rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice
&quot; 1948 @-@ er Ford Mercury was driven by a group of spect@@ ators in rural Mon@@ roe , Georgia , and ru@@ mp to the Ford @-@ Bridge of Mo@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; before the car , the four black passengers and a white driver had to reach the bridge , a group of white men joined together to block its way . &quot;
the leader of the mo@@ bs - a man middle aged in a needle bu@@ oy@@ ant - took a long train at his cigar@@ ette and cl@@ icked by the wind@@ shield .
indo@@ ors the ins@@ ets in fear .
&quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; breaks the man .
&quot; H@@ ol it from the car ! &quot;
&quot; scre@@ aming the silence , as a young black man of a co @-@ seat . &quot;
&quot; luck@@ ily , this hor@@ rible scene that was played on 22 July , only a position . &quot;
&quot; but if then a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; , &quot; almost everyone in the audience is very real sparkling wine . &quot;
&quot; since 2005 Citiz@@ enship coming to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge back to im@@ itate the night , in the two black pairs - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com as well as George and Ma@@ e Murray Dor@@ sey - from K@@ u Kl@@ ux Kl@@ an in 1946 . &quot;
nobody has ever been charged with Mor@@ de .
&quot; it truly is in@@ conce@@ iv@@ able that in all these years ago - although we see them in our churches although we know who they are , &quot; said Tyr@@ one Brooks , who helps in the organization of re@@ position . &quot;
&quot; it is a dirt road on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Brooks is a 71 @-@ year former member of the State of Georgia and a lifetime of the citizen .
&quot; for him , it serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual remin@@ der of the Mon@@ roe community that has never been corre@@ cted . &quot;
&quot; we want to pro@@ secution , we want to end , we want healing , we want Re@@ conc@@ iliation , but first we must receive justice , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; we cannot get to healing and reconciliation , until we shall receive justice . &quot;
a Court of occupational health sets a du@@ el on the corp@@ se of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on 27 July 1946 .
&quot; according to F@@ BI , which were obtained from the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men were suspe@@ cted from Mon@@ roe and the surrounding county in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process . &quot;
but none has ever been charged .
&quot; although the suspe@@ cts for decades remain on the open foot , citiz@@ enship , that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions in the whole city was always known : politics and sex . &quot;
in April 1946 a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice made the black citizens in Georgia for the first time in the summer campaign in the summer .
&quot; about at the same time as choosing the F@@ BI , the black Far@@ mp@@ ner Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owners , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a struggle - sup@@ pos@@ edly because of a woman . &quot;
&quot; Brooks , the rum@@ ors in the city was that H@@ ester with Mal@@ com@@ s Mrs. Dor@@ othy slept and that the baby , which she carried , not by her husband . &quot;
&quot; on 25 July 1946 Lo@@ y Harrison , a prominent white land@@ owner , 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , so the F@@ BI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her cous@@ ins Ma@@ e Murray and George Dor@@ sey to the prison .
&quot; but when they went away from the prison , and the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge appro@@ ached , around a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b the car . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , there was Harrison that has prepared the murder and arranged . &quot;
&quot; it is also obvious that there was a compl@@ oon between state and local pro@@ secution , which was not only involved in the mor@@ ality , evidence and the identity of witnesses . &quot;
Brooks formulated it even more exciting .
&quot; it was an elect@@ oral mass@@ ac@@ re , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community , &quot; if you register and when you agree , then you will happen here . &quot;
almost a decade has been running Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene the annual after@@ position of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
&quot; your account is clear , att@@ acking and is based in a kind of deep rac@@ ism , from which many believe that he is no longer exists in America . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to cut , and even more difficult to look , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point . &quot;
&quot; we do not want to talk about the Lyn@@ ne , because we are confronted with its ugly in all of us , &quot; &quot; said them . &quot;
&quot; but I cannot build a relationship with you , if you do not want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have done . &quot;
&quot; the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen White and the rest Schwar@@ ze - in a room and loud , as well as a well maintained overview of the piece started . &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Green@@ es co @-@ director .
&quot; he has played the role of the chef &apos;s role for years , but he said , the role will never become easier . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty , because I am not so &quot; , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; but I think it is very important to get this story in life , because we would not return to these times . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the room the actor D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , the Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester play their lines . &quot;
&quot; the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester cry , and pushed him to angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy . &quot;
&quot; I said , n --- he , dis@@ bur@@ sed by my property ! &quot;
Ras@@ cona refu@@ te the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone breaks everyone ( at least all black actors ) in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at loud .
&quot; what ? ! &quot; , &quot; asked Ras@@ cona . &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still k@@ ich@@ ern@@ d . &quot;
I just think that white people back then &apos;@@ n --- he said .
&quot; Oh , funny one of the other black actors . &quot;
&quot; you only have to meet the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
&quot; and that is exactly as shif@@ ts the energy in the room , a feeling of compan@@ ion@@ ship is replaced the discomfort . &quot;
&quot; everybody is busy this is true , not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people . &quot;
the scene starts again .
&quot; this time , when Ras@@ cona the N word says , he says it sharp and with repl@@ ication . &quot;
absolutely no one laughs .
this repet@@ ition ends violent and fast .
&quot; there is horror , shots and then silence . &quot;
&quot; a woman with an ob@@ gar@@ ment suff@@ ers , stands over the corp@@ ses of the actor and performs Bill@@ ie Holidays trau@@ ern@@ de Lo@@ bre@@ de &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot;
your voice breaks in every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it there is a group of about four dozen spect@@ ators swe@@ at and tears out of the eyes .
the audience is almost ev@@ enly divided between black and white .
&quot; a couple is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , travelled to see the performance , many come only the road down . &quot;
they all witness@@ ed almost eight hours of Georg@@ ias cul@@ p@@ ness when Brooks she leads on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
&quot; until this point , the mor@@ se have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now when you place at the same country where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de takes place , the air feels s@@ alt@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; when the last notes of the song sounds , Gre@@ ene the amount to get closer and to insp@@ ire the corp@@ se . &quot;
&quot; children hate to their heads , register the fake blood and the breastfeeding body and sle@@ ev@@ ed each other . &quot;
&quot; they are not really dead , mur@@ m@@ elt a little boy , as it would remember . &quot;
after a few minutes he thanks Gre@@ ene the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw the Lyn@@ ch@@ se@@ il away and w@@ ipe her tears .
&quot; Brad@@ sha@@ w h@@ ug@@ t Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit that has played the cl@@ a member . &quot;
Nick Ras@@ cona embr@@ aces two of his fellow players and then breaks into their arms we@@ pt together , the emotional burden of the performance is finally with him . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; Whis@@ per@@ ed one of women . &quot;
we know that this is not in your heart .
you have done this for a reason . &quot;
&quot; later , the audience puts together with the actors for dinner together . &quot;
&quot; chat at a table , a white couple from Atlanta stimul@@ ates about the position with a black pair that they have just met . &quot;
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski are strug@@ gling to find words which feeling the performance .
&quot; it is difficult to hear these terrible words and deeds ... of people who look like yourself and what they do , because they look like you , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what that really does with me , makes me believe that the Lyn@@ ne still goes on , &quot; she added , &quot; today she will be called the police @-@ shooting . &quot;
&quot; in the same room , Tyr@@ one Brooks Hof holds on his table , he e@@ ats and rem@@ inds of the civil rights . &quot;
he said he started to plan the performance in the next year .
&quot; the position is in a way of inspir@@ ational , because it describes the fr@@ ight of what we have to bear , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it is so , if we learn nothing of it , then it can happen again . &quot;
&quot; who@@ ever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history is condemned to be repeated . &quot;

Stephen Mill@@ ing sings the wonder@@ fully fi@@ red wh@@ ales that gives the au@@ ra of a heavy @-@ party box@@ ers .
&quot; brutal the scene , when he propos@@ es Sieg@@ fried . &quot;
&quot; later , I have to believe Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) . &quot;
the audience thanks to the ensemble with vig@@ orous appl@@ ause .
&quot; stor@@ my , Foster , Mill@@ ing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski , who is modest and hands to Merkel @-@ smoking . &quot;
big appl@@ ause there is for the Fest@@ spiel@@ haus that shows itself on stage - in view of the great heat back in quiet@@ er leisure .
with tension was expected by Frank Cast@@ orf and his Reg@@ iet@@ eam .
&quot; in 2013 he had to leave behind for the being , there were five years later , there were five years later in which the &quot; &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; &quot; went down . &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to be happy about this .
&quot; you notice that the audience has grown in a certain way , she had said before the performance of d@@ pa . &quot;
&quot; the audience did not only have a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it is also an understanding of its view . &quot;
I draw a positive res@@ ale .
max is working as volunteers .
they work in their volunteers at the same time in several places .
where everywhere ?
&quot; quantity : usually in stone @-@ furt in the envelop@@ e , once a week I help here in gre@@ ven in the furniture . &quot;
and I have already worked in the open full day at school .
what are your experiences with it ?
&quot; quantity : it is a nice , wide spectrum I see here . &quot;
&quot; I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults . &quot;
&quot; now they are 26 years , so a bel@@ ated volunteer . &quot;
how does this come ?
quantity : I made Ab@@ it@@ ur .
&quot; and then a building engineer , we say , successfully cancelled . &quot;
I know for me that it is for me the fal@@ ter and I want to do something else to work with people .
and then I asked me what do you do .
&quot; take a social year , since there is an insight , as you can see how it is on site , in the fire@@ point perhaps also , really . &quot;
and was it so ?
quantity : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the gradu@@ ation .
&quot; I will study dual , probably in the Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne , a social job creation and study in Ham@@ m at the Fach@@ hoch@@ schule . &quot;
is it not something unusual while volunte@@ ering there are several different approaches to have ?
&quot; quantity : yes , it is very variable . &quot;
it is always looking at that where you are going to FS@@ J .
it is possible to make it from Al@@ ter@@ sheim to Youth work - in all possible fac@@ ets of social labour .
with me it was very varied .
&quot; I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care . &quot;
for me this was the right thing that which has mat@@ ured to me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really runs .
different than in the construction engineer ?
&quot; quantity : well , here it is not possible to calculate statues . &quot;
&quot; one has over again other people pre@@ face head , which each have a very different story behind them . &quot;
&quot; whether a refuge@@ e , whether a youth , who has been caught up from the family - you must always enter into individual . &quot;
very interesting .
and you had no tou@@ ching ?
quantity : I do not have the guy .
there is an area that gives us a lot .
&quot; great love , lots of kindness . &quot;
&quot; there is also negative moments , but so life is just . &quot;

EPA returns decision to delay the Smo@@ g rule after Kl@@ agen
&quot; the US @-@ American Environmental Protection Authority has a decision to delay a regulation of the government of Obama to delay , what the states are obliged to enter the smo@@ g @-@ caused emissions . this was carried out a day after 15 states the Agency because of the stri@@ de def@@ endants . &quot;
&quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance , and said , she will show the commitment of the agency , together with states . &quot;
&quot; we believe in dialogue with and in mind that we respond to our state partners , &quot; said EPA leader Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt had been announced in June the intention of EPA , which should be measured in a part of the country &apos;s poll@@ ut@@ ant emissions , to consolid@@ ate where in@@ cis@@ ions are to be made to be more str@@ ing@@ ent air quality standards - to delay a year until October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , weights on Tuesday Kl@@ age and said that the effort was illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tru@@ mp has tried a wide range of environmental impact , which has imposed by the former President Barack Obama , as part of a wider agenda , to boost economic growth , according to Tru@@ mp &apos;s economic growth . &quot;
&quot; however , the efforts have trig@@ ger@@ ed the set@@ back of democrat@@ s and protected groups that worry about the effects of greater emissions on public health . &quot;
&quot; the website of EPA says that the inhal@@ e of air , the o@@ zone could reduce &quot; the lung function and rein@@ force the respiratory function &quot; such as as@@ thma . &quot;
Shar@@ der@@ at wants a common area
&quot; in the end , the decision was clear : with two oppos@@ ing the communities of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ z@@ eln , the establishment of a common area in the future sen@@ iors . &quot;
in front of the discussion there is an important information : the sale of sale for the missing principles is signed , reports Mayor Bernhard Tj@@ ades . &quot;
&quot; although the surface area is still not yet , until the date of the church area belonging to the municipal area , but there is no planning of planning for the project of a private invest@@ or to st@@ em@@ y project . &quot;
there is a discussion with respect to a common area .
&quot; one of the two investors who are still in the boat , has offered the congregation . &quot;
on the ground floor he would provide a living area - approximately 55 square meters - and an ad@@ joining terrace with at least 70 square meters .
&quot; the administration and majority of the municipalities are facing , such a common room not just as a meeting point for the inhabitants of the sen@@ i@@ or@@ derly residential building , but openly in the church . &quot;
&quot; as an example , the word made of &quot; &quot; Str@@ ick@@ café &quot; &quot; lap . &quot;
&quot; version is the decision that has been decided by providing funds for the ongoing household already in the last autumn , through convey@@ ors . &quot;
the building is located in the sanitary area .
&quot; the establishment of a common area would be , so reports Tj@@ ades , with 60 percent of 30 percent con@@ duc@@ able . &quot;
&quot; the decision @-@ proposal can be seen to sign@@ alling the invest@@ or that one wants to cast him in this regard , that both s@@ addle - what is reduced to the ambient weight - as well as P@@ ult@@ d@@ ach - which makes the cutting height and the construction of economic makes it possible . &quot;
&quot; need@@ less , not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer , be this addition . &quot;
when it helps : un@@ anim@@ ously happens to the body .
this is not as easy as the common area .
&quot; Daniela Ruf refers to the many of their own buildings , with which one can not come true for it now with the commun@@ al room from the window , says : &quot; I do not do so with it . &quot;
Y@@ vonne Sta@@ iger speaks for the common room - but absolutely against a commun@@ al involvement .
it looks behind it a sub@@ cover@@ t sub@@ missions to be used or even foreign investors .
&quot; this is not so , because with the acquisition of the area you will not give an audience , but I come to a real , in the branch @-@ market@@ able counter@@ part , the counter @-@ speaking . &quot;
&quot; stadium request , the decision @-@ proposal according to advance , takes three advoc@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; thus it remains at two oppos@@ ites at the original program , Stefan H@@ aller : &quot; &quot; if we believe the decision , we make a giant step to close into our infrastructure . &quot;

hiking in the resin of star to star
in the resin the nation@@ wide first &quot; star ad &quot; arise .
this is planning the association Observ@@ atory St. Andre@@ as@@ berg .
the planet is in Gött@@ ingen - since 2003 .
a &quot; star@@ pf@@ ad &quot; comes to the information needs of many hard@@ visitors .
&quot; he connect nature , science , movement and sporty performance . &quot;
the members want to set up the planned route tables and inform you about stars and stars .
&quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association is planning &quot; well reaching installations at five to six locations &quot; in the Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot;
&quot; Deutsche Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Ho@@ he@@ ge@@ i@@ ß and Sie@@ ber . &quot;
the information on the boards should be added via the Internet .
&quot; therefore , when the location @-@ site plays a good mobile network welcome . &quot;
also Acc@@ es@@ sibility is a crit@@ er@@ ion .
later the star@@ pf@@ ad train should be extended by train .
&quot; on the star@@ pf@@ ad the vie@@ wers find out a lot of knowledge , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; explained the association . &quot;
&quot; in addition , they learned why stars would have different colors or why a star lamp stronger than another , although he was much further away . &quot;
he will also be convey@@ ed in which constellation is a selected star and when he is best to see .
the association has been operating since 2014 in the Berg@@ städ@@ t St. Andre@@ as@@ berg which was at the highest located observ@@ atory north of Germany .
the location in the heart of the Harz National Park is one of the Bundes@@ minist@@ ered for conservation protection for the six dar@@ k@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there the Mil@@ ky way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a @-@ galax@@ y are clearly seen with blo@@ ody eye .
in the university city there are since 2003 on the initiative of the Con@@ feder@@ ate planet@@ arium Gött@@ ingen has something similar to the planned observ@@ atory - the planet .
&quot; starting in front of Geb@@ h@@ ards Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the Plan@@ etary way leads up to Hain@@ berg and to the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; extra @-@ terre@@ strial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( municipality track ) with the planet Sed@@ na . &quot;
the ri@@ mp with the individual planets - including the d@@ warf @-@ planned Pl@@ uto on the end@@ point - are exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
&quot; the earth shr@@ inking so on a sphere of 6.5 mill@@ imet@@ res diameter , while the exact 75 meters away standing in the sun at least 70 cent@@ imeters . &quot;
the entire distance of the planet road is about four kilometers .
&quot; while the light of sun until Pl@@ uto takes about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour to St@@ ele with Pl@@ uto . &quot;
pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the cosmos .
the march to the next fixed star would still take half a year .
MI@@ KE@@ Y Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time to discuss a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and MI@@ KE@@ Y Gar@@ cia which should stand in a coll@@ is@@ ion@@ sk@@ urs to st@@ aged the most thr@@ illing box@@ ing fight in the near future under 147 pounds , for the first time on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; they were in separate rooms at ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ trained world Box@@ ing Council lightweight , the hall@@ way to Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Box@@ ing Organisation Super @-@ Feder@@ Weight Champion . &quot;
after Gar@@ ci@@ as victory by one @-@ part resolution on the former four @-@ divisions Adri@@ en Br@@ oner on Saturday on Showtime are both fighters members of the top @-@ Five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ List .
&quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out the right hand and said , &quot; How do you think Champion ? &quot;
I wish you good luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Marri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 pm on ES@@ PN .
&quot; as the couple for photos pos@@ ited , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Klim@@ as , that a possible show@@ down would be the &quot; perfect size order &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am an old fe@@ ather @-@ weight , &quot; rec@@ alled Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; I have asc@@ ended for Br@@ oner &#91; on 140 pounds &#93; , but I am not so big . &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I would like to run at the lightweight .
and he must move on lightweight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then fight for it .
these require the fans .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko has agreed .
&quot; boxes needs this battle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Klim@@ as asked if it was supposed to be in pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy to arrange Lom@@ ach@@ enko to arrange a date ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) which is also interested in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Campbell in the Forum on 23 September . &quot;
&quot; this battle could take place in the pay @-@ per @-@ view mode because all fans have asked for him , &quot; said Gar@@ cia and oppressed himself later on the network that offers the best financial package . &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can cause this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ...
&quot; Gar@@ cia said he p@@ ies Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; &quot; a huge f@@ ighter , &quot; and he may be part in his Saturday struggle . &quot;
&quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ enko held at the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he will see the Dre@@ ik@@ amp@@ f Champion of River@@ side &quot; &quot; very slowly , sorry , I &apos;m sorry MI@@ KE@@ Y ... you were able to do the Ko @-@ off . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said , the focus is to show stroke , then boxes . &quot;
&quot; both said they could feel the Mom@@ entum , who built themselves in their own struggle . &quot;
&quot; this is the struggle , which must be performed . &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; I am more than happy to work to work , &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko said : &quot; I was waiting for the top fighters and this is MI@@ KE@@ Y .
it will be a great battle . &quot;
four vert@@ ices for ty@@ re
&quot; with an accident on the A7 , on Thursday afternoon four people were hard in@@ ju@@ red . &quot;
&quot; after first information , the driver lost a Opel Z@@ af@@ ira against 4.30 p.m. in front of the connector market , probably according to a tire block the control over his vehicle . &quot;
&quot; the car turn right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he sle@@ w himself and then lie on the roof at the GR@@ Ü@@ N@@ ST@@ RE@@ IF@@ EN . &quot;
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were hard to in@@ ju@@ red during the accident .
&quot; during the initial supply of the last by the rescue service was the A7 in the north for about an hour closed , then the traffic can lead to the left lane along the accident . &quot;
Fort@@ un@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; Dre@@ ad@@ chain works better &quot;
Andre Hoffmann hop@@ ed after 2 : 2 to the end of the season at Braunschweig that brings the optimization of def@@ enses in Au@@ e points .
&quot; with the first season , Andre Hoffmann is satisfied with the result , would not be the two oppos@@ ites at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig . &quot;
&quot; these were two oppos@@ ites too much , and we have to fit in Au@@ e even better , &quot; says the def@@ ensive player from Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains the turn@@ table should also be optimized .
and a gate after a fre@@ est@@ ing would no longer want to catch the continuing .
for the future it will be so no longer next to Michael ( R@@ ensing ) on line .
&quot; Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better aware of the experience in preparation with the rotating chain , than with the quad@@ rup@@ ulous . &quot;
&quot; yet I do not know how we can act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his coach Fried@@ helm Fun@@ kel , but Hoffmann is his thing for sure , &quot; because we just have to build up in the three chain on the half positions in KA@@ AN Ay@@ han and N@@ iko De@@ posit@@ el@@ mann players who can build well , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ condition is , but that we are even better harmon@@ ize and we do not make ourselves so many ab@@ yss . &quot;
&quot; of course , Hoffmann is going to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; but if one cannot speak after a failure of a com@@ promising start , I do not know . &quot;
&quot; the performance could certainly be okay , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; but if we are on Sunday with four points , and can concentrate on the Pok@@ al , we will certainly talk about a neat season . &quot;
one of them wanted to know nothing .
&quot; the start in season Be@@ ur@@ ges I first wanted to speak after six to eight players days , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Fun@@ kel , who does not want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e , just because the game of Saxony in He@@ iden@@ heim had to be broken down due to an accident . &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season virtually with a home game , &quot; said Fun@@ kel and Hoffmann believes that the players could be of Au@@ e perhaps even slightly fr@@ y as they had no heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against a asc@@ ension of the bones . &quot;
&quot; but they do not know so 100 % , where they are currently standing , &quot; says the Interior of the Fort@@ una . &quot;
&quot; though , the guests come from the Rhin@@ eland as easier favorite on Sunday at the end of last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e . &quot;
&quot; that we removed them away , only because we have the claim to come among the first six , &quot; &quot; Blocks &quot; , &quot; says Fun@@ kel , its balance in just a defeat against Au@@ e from nine playing quite positive . &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ l@@ iga , which one must hit by pre @-@ in , &quot; explains Fort@@ un@@ as Che@@ f@@ coach . &quot;
&quot; such a statement , would arrogan@@ t and arrogan@@ t . &quot;
and so Fun@@ kel wants to experience his players on Sunday in no case .
new results of the Swedish asylum @-@ publishing tests published
&quot; recent results of testing for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , who were subje@@ cted to a new method of medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons older than 18 years are . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish authority for For@@ ensi@@ c medicine ( satur@@ ation medicine ) has begun with the implementation of the tests last year .
&quot; they are supposed to do more precisely during the asylum seek@@ ers , after the Swedish migration authority ( Mig@@ rations ) because of errors in evalu@@ ating the correct age of some refugees was critic@@ ised that were inferior . &quot;
&quot; until today , Mig@@ rations has sent migrants and the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from the period from mid March to 31 July 2017 . &quot;
&quot; eight@@ een per cent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , whereas in further 25 cases the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency announced that the person &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
in 432 cases the conclusion was that the person is &quot; possibly under 18 years old . &quot;
the tests are conducted only in cases where the age of the person is placed in question .
&quot; according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency , the results are resistant to the past few months . &quot;
&quot; we do not see a big difference in the statistics of the past months , the figures are quite consistent , &quot; he said the magazine The Local . &quot;
&quot; the high proportion of cases where the person has been judged as over 18 years , does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ ers over his age has been li@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; in May the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there were 4@@ 42 cases to suggest that the &apos; search@@ ed person 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bl@@ a@@ det , the 5@@ 81 published results found it firmly , that in 243 of these cases the person had openly told that she will be in the year 18 years old . &quot;
&quot; the method of medical study assessment , in the x @-@ rays of Weis@@ el@@ ids and MR@@ T recordings are made by kno@@ bs , which are then analy@@ zed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , was also critic@@ ised in some areas . &quot;
&quot; a sce@@ pt@@ ics is the end@@ oc@@ rin@@ ologist Claude Marcus des Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work includes the assessment of the biological matur@@ ity of people to see if they were sooner or later than the pu@@ ber@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I do not think that the type of measurement should be used . &quot;
the biological age in this way is very un@@ certain .
&quot; if we cannot say it certainly , we should not do as if we could &quot; , &quot; he said the newspaper Metro . &quot;
&quot; Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency def@@ ended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk to judge an child as an adult . &quot;
&quot; the biggest risk is in it , if the person is just under 18 , in this case these are about 10 percent . &quot;
full of plan
working on the three bridges from the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are going well ahead .
on Wednesday seven tons was installed in the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; we are very good in time , it runs great , &quot; says Rein@@ hold Le@@ icht , buil@@ ders in the department of traffic and traffic in the Govern@@ si@@ dium of Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; in April , working at the same time began on all three gentle bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
the buil@@ ders is planned for October and is sure that the schedule is observed .
&quot; the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads over the Tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
she is a v@@ ault bridge made of concrete which is disgu@@ ised with red b@@ unt@@ sand@@ stone and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 meters .
it was built in the year 1900 .
&quot; as the two other bridges , it is now in the years now . &quot;
&quot; to guarantee the stability and traffic safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly refurbished . &quot;
the two other bridges lead to the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built from red b@@ unt@@ sand@@ stein .
&quot; both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10,@@ 60 meters long . &quot;
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach is now available at the north side of Lau@@ ter@@ bach on the northern side of a 1,30 meter wide and seven tons .
&quot; this is a bound@@ ary , which is also used as a operation . &quot;
on the southern part of the bridge the bridge should be inserted on Friday a 2,20 meter wide bridge .
it should then leave the pedestrian road .
&quot; the special thing is that it deals with production , a patent from the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company D@@ iz@@ wo . &quot;
the other two bridges are already provided with the pat@@ ented bridge valves .
special finger@@ spitz@@ en@@ feeling has provided the lines from lines through the construction work in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; because there is also a glass fibers , which many companies are connected . &quot;
the inhabitants were informed in advance of works by wr@@ ist on the project .
&quot; furthermore , first fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be wast@@ ed . &quot;
for the bridges between the construction building and the comp@@ elling in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg is the traffic cle@@ ared by a traffic light .
&quot; for construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bacher local entrance , the street is locked in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; &quot; Tann@@ en@@ hof &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Sie@@ ben Lin@@ den &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the cost of the three lo@@ op@@ iers will be together 700 000 Euro .
the whole is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ ast of German pot@@ ato sal@@ at
&quot; it is not so often that parties go on a strand , but when it comes to the alternative to Germany ( Af@@ D ) , comes along , what else is hard to bring under a hat . &quot;
&quot; the parties in the Kre@@ ist@@ ag volcano ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Left ) belong to a broad coalition that shows the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle Ron@@ dell to the loud &quot; &quot; large elect@@ ro @-@ building pre@@ lu@@ de &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; and known names to the start - like Alice We@@ idel , which forms together with Alexander Gau@@ land the top duo for the Bundestag on 24th September , and the dep@@ uty @-@ president Beat@@ rix from Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; but those who are already confirmed hours before the start of the event , do not want to listen to the Af@@ D . &quot;
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot;
&quot; originally , the town Pic@@ nic was planned under the motto &quot; All on a table &quot; at the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but will now take place on the parking lot below the Rond@@ ells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stadthalle . &quot;
a colorful picture that offers .

Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart speaks about her Bis@@ ex@@ u@@ ality
&quot; some people love gr@@ illed cheese and will eat him to the end of their lives .
&quot; but I want to try everything out , &quot; &quot; Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart quite openly about their Bis@@ ex@@ u@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; when I am even in gr@@ illed cheese , I think : &quot; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the probably most known relationship of the Hol@@ ly@@ wood@@ stars was one to her &quot; &quot; T@@ wil@@ ight &quot; colleagues Robert Patt@@ in@@ son , which was ultimately bitter . &quot;
&quot; despite all the in@@ su@@ red the brunette performers opposite the &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; I was in every serious love I have dated . &quot;
&quot; or do you believe about , I would have played it ? &quot;
&quot; after their separation , Kri@@ sten to know that it is bis@@ ex@@ ual : &quot; I have always lived and seriously believe in it . &quot;
it has never been confused or disabled .
&quot; I never liked it to be taken seriously , not seriously . &quot;
&quot; especially among they did it loud &quot; &quot; Bang Show@@ biz &quot; but in the school period when they prefer like a bu@@ b , not all the girls are typical girls . &quot;
this really hurt me .
&quot; when I was eleven , I told me the children , I would look like a bug . &quot;
I really felt attacked and embarrass@@ ed and embarrass@@ ed .
&quot; now I look back and tell me : &quot; &quot; girls , be proud of you ! &quot; . &quot; &quot;
especially the public they do not like to have their love life : &quot; people expect you to make you a certain way and angry me .
&quot; and perhaps some should call me some un@@ anchor , but I don &apos;t like to just@@ ify myself before the whole public . &quot;
govern@@ or of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
&quot; the democratic Gover@@ nor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thurs@@ days with President Tru@@ mp , that he will change the party . &quot;
&quot; whether you like it or not , the Democrats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; said govern@@ or Justice . &quot;
today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of re@@ thinking ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia I can no longer help you when I am a democratic govern@@ or .
the r@@ ally broke in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Re@@ public@@ ans , &quot; added Justice . &quot;
&quot; as a coach , I would say that it is at the time to play a different game . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp has previously promised a big announcement at the West Virginia Rall@@ ye .
&quot; Mr. Tru@@ mp won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ sed the democratic candidate in Hill@@ ary Clinton . &quot;
&quot; Justice , who is according to For@@ bes of the only bill@@ ion@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; For@@ bes presents that he poss@@ esses Koh@@ le@@ min@@ en in five states , and from his father a carbohydrates . &quot;
he is worth about 1,@@ 59 billion dollars .
in the meantime the Re@@ publ@@ ican National Committee on Thursday evening gave an explanation in which it said : &quot; the party change of govern@@ or Justice is another blow for a Democratic party who would rather than work to us to make our country great again .
&quot; with only 15 govern@@ ors and the control of the least legislative bodies in history is the announcement of govern@@ or Justice only the last rejection of a party that is from top to bottom without guidance , and the R@@ NC @-@ chairman R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the CB@@ S News . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russian &quot; &quot; Russian sorry for D@@ oping @-@ Sk@@ and@@ al &quot;
&quot; the worldwide chief of Athlet@@ ics , Sebastian Co@@ E , pra@@ ised on Thursday , what he described as apparent exc@@ use from Russia to a d@@ oping sc@@ and@@ al , but he repet@@ itive , it is not the moment for the country to be recorded again in the sport . &quot;
&quot; Russia &apos;s athlet@@ ics boss Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ ak@@ ht@@ in said during the IA@@ AF Congress at the eve of Athlet@@ ics world championship , that the bond of his country was correct from the sport and that he is decided to fight the d@@ oping . &quot;
&quot; he said , it &apos;s sorry for &quot; all athletes that were left in competitions gold and silver med@@ als . &quot;
&quot; despite his comments he agreed to the IA@@ AF congress for the maintenance of the ban , which in November 2015 , after a report of the world @-@ anti @-@ d@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) notes on state @-@ funded d@@ oping in Russia had found . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was a very open response , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF @-@ President Co@@ E the Re@@ porter . &quot;
&quot; the entire Council and the entire Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation is recognized for itself , that they experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation shall be re@@ designed . &quot;
&quot; Co@@ E said , he was also &quot; delighted that Russia will accept the criteria for his repet@@ ition . &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress has been achieved , but the Congress supports the recommendations of Task Force that this is not the moment to use Russia , &quot; said Co@@ E . &quot;
we have to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ ality this situation .
&quot; the gu@@ iding principle was always that we wanted to separate the cleaner athl@@ ete from the with@@ ered system , &quot; he added &quot;
ninet@@ een Russian athl@@ ete will start with the athlet@@ ics world championship that will start on Friday in London after the strict IA@@ AF criteria as a neutral actors .
&quot; the head of IA@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday , Russia still said some of the criteria for recovery . &quot;
&quot; drug tests were still in@@ adequate and promised coach are still free , he said Re@@ porters in London after a presentation at IA@@ AF Council . &quot;

Prinz Hen@@ rik does not want a grave next to his wife
&quot; the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried in his death by his wife . &quot;
this divided the Royal House on Thursday with .
&quot; traditionally , the Danish kingdom was joined in the church of Ros@@ kil@@ de . &quot;

&quot; the Queen was agreed with the decision of her husband , it was further in the announcement . &quot;
where prince Hen@@ rik was buried , be still un@@ clear . &quot;
but he did not have the intention to be joined in his French home .
Prinz Hen@@ rik had never made a ha@@ ehl that he was not happy with his title .
after the ascent of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would like to become king .
&quot; in 2016 , he went to retirement and presents the title &quot; &quot; Prin@@ z@@ gem@@ ahl &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; since Hen@@ rik in Denmark does not have the title and the function he wanted to see himself in front of his wife - even after death , declared L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by , the chiefs of the Danish king &apos;s house . &quot;
where the last retirement of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will be ultimately un@@ clear .
&quot; but he did not have the intention to be joined in his French home , but in Denmark . &quot;
he likes the land for which he has worked for over the past 50 years .
&quot; the native Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French Adel@@ s@@ sex , had met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London . &quot;
on the Thames he worked in the French message .
&quot; during his later wife the sympath@@ etic profess@@ ions of the people were always flo@@ od@@ ed , the prince Hen@@ rik had a serious stand in his nearly 50 years . &quot;
&quot; in a high@@ chair , Hen@@ rik about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I did . &quot;
&quot; my Danish was sw@@ immer , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk @-@ urfs instead of Str@@ ick@@ soc@@ ks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smo@@ ked instead of Virginia @-@ tobacco and the fact that I had the reputation to be the brand of social intellect@@ uals , I could not hope for understanding . &quot;
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not to ash@@ amed me .

&quot; precip@@ itation Prime Minister Stephan We@@ il ( SPD ) is named after the loss of red @-@ green regul@@ arity for a rapid re @-@ election of the country , but he does not want to res@@ ign . &quot;
because she spoke on Friday for the resolution of the Parliament .
previously the surprising res@@ ign@@ ation of a Green @-@ Members had a severe crisis in Lower Saxony by Prime Minister Stephan We@@ il ( SPD ) in a severe crisis .
five months before the official date of the farmers lost the red @-@ green coalition in Hannover thereby their kne@@ ading One @-@ votes in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .

CD@@ U @-@ fre@@ ight Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ üm@@ ler wants to recommend it to his faction .
&quot; with this , CD@@ U and F@@ DP would have had 69 seats in the Lower Saxony , SPD and Green 68 seats . &quot;
&quot; so far , the relationship was vice versa . &quot;
the new Land@@ tag will be regular at the 14th of January coming year .
&quot; Th@@ el@@ ler said , the red @-@ green government will now decide whether they could continue to rule in this situation without a majority . &quot;
&quot; however , Stephan We@@ il considers it to be essential that the country &apos;s holiday as soon as possible its self @-@ resolution . &quot;
the CD@@ U @-@ Group is expected to decide on Tuesday over their further procedure .
the country &apos;s agreement looks also the opportunity to withdraw from the Prime Minister of the Prime Minister and select a successor .

&quot; we of course go out that they have received their land @-@ day , which gives them back over the green country &apos;s list , with immediate effect , divided the Landes@@ ering Meta Jans@@ sen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot;
the Group president of the Green Anja P@@ iel said : &quot; we regret the decision of Elke T@@ westen . &quot;
they have deliber@@ ately decided to lead no pron@@ unci@@ ation of the Group .
&quot; also in front of the background , that there was no conclus@@ ive differences , we can not withdraw this step . &quot;
SPD @-@ pul@@ ler@@ kan@@ did@@ at Martin Schulz condemned the survi@@ ving of the Lower Green Gre@@ ens Elke T@@ westen to the CD@@ U as betra@@ yal .
&quot; the behavior of the former green @-@ members in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of the voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; wrote the head of the Socialists and Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot;
he support the decision of Prime Minister Stephan We@@ il ( SPD ) to choose the farmer .
the res@@ ign@@ ation of t@@ west@@ ens costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .

&quot; farm sm@@ ister in an interview - How do we protect ourselves from Gif@@ ts , Mr. Schmidt ? &quot;
Germany disc@@ usses about se@@ ated eggs .
how could the sc@@ and@@ al happen ?
how can consumers protect .
Land@@ gra@@ sm@@ in@@ ister Christian Schmidt ( C@@ SU ) stands in the interview with the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
Mr. Schmidt : how can the consumer protect from eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumers to check the eggs in your fridge and check the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp pressure .
on the consumer portal www.@@ food@@ war@@ n@@ .de the states provide the latest information about the affected Eg@@ gs .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; even if after all we are currently aware of a health haz@@ ard virtually impossible . &quot;
&quot; now , Al@@ di assumes the best possible crisis @-@ action - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the enlight@@ ening of the federal state is not really perceived ? &quot;
the food surveillance is the task of the Bundesländer .
&quot; nevertheless , my house began to be swit@@ ched immediately and is since announcement of Germany in close contact with the authorities of the countries . &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available for consumers .
trade has the same as the manufacturer to carry out worry that the compar@@ ing products are targeted and health@@ ful un@@ question@@ able .
&quot; if at eggs of the res@@ cent level of 0,@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded , they are not charged . &quot;
un@@ loaded eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time not the establ@@ ishments to blame .
sitting shops and consumers in the same boat ?
after the time @-@ time know the production facilities does not meet immediate fault .
&quot; rather , they must count on mut@@ ually illegal practices of service companies with economic damages . &quot;
as always there is too little contro@@ l@@ apping too little control .
there is no lack of personnel in the staff or on the conclus@@ ive jurisdiction ?
&quot; however , it was just the official inspe@@ ctions that have revealed the process . &quot;
&quot; however , the truth is also that food de@@ ception and criminal energy can never be excluded from 100 percent . &quot;
&quot; therefore , a consequ@@ ent education of such events and the hand@@ over to pro@@ secut@@ or in cases , in which off@@ ences can be of decisive importance . &quot;
I have already made several times a number of times that I expect the responsible authority of the responsible authorities .
is the regular al@@ ar@@ mis@@ m in food sc@@ and@@ als really necessary ?
consumers have the right to get secure and traffic food exclusively .
if a non @-@ approved inse@@ ct@@ icide in the food industry is used to consumers consumers .
&quot; by bre@@ aded funds are manufacturers , tra@@ ders and consumers in a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
basically it must be clear : the illegal use of the inse@@ ct@@ icide Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ food safety is not acceptable and must be stopped immediately .
&quot; in mind , it must be consistent and worked with high pressure on all levels . &quot;
I expect from all relevant authorities that the atomic facts will be cle@@ ared and seam@@ lessly .
how to work on the financial rules of football on ne@@ ym@@ ars Move to Paris
&quot; the rules that are aimed at aim@@ ing to prevent tremendous issues of European football football , ne@@ ym@@ ars Wel@@ tre@@ k@@ ord transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain . &quot;
&quot; any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Germain of the UEF@@ A , because the leading organisation that the European game has monitored power , cre@@ ws from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament . &quot;
&quot; financial fair @-@ play rules , which were launched in 2011 by the UEF@@ A , mean that PS@@ G must eventually prove that the transfer from Ne@@ ym@@ ar has been financed without great losses . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million $ ) to buy the Brazilian from his contract , and Ne@@ ym@@ ar will receive a sal@@ ary that will be several ten million dollars a year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of ne@@ ym@@ ars Move to France .
&quot; PS@@ G can make sure the money loose , so Ne@@ ym@@ ar writes and bring him into a galax@@ y of other stars , given the financing of the team by through the energy rich Herr@@ ing family of Qatar . &quot;
&quot; re@@ unite for the purchase of players a lot of money , but have to control a lot of money for the purchase of players who have to control the break @-@ Even point in their on football @-@ related business . &quot;
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his choice to the UEF@@ A president in 2007 .
&quot; the former French players believe that associations in their pursuit of success had tremendous deb@@ ts , effectively dist@@ ressing and ris@@ ky to rests when banks or owners have returned their support . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P run by concentration on the deb@@ ts of the clubs to monitor their losses . &quot;
&quot; the change meant that the business model , the Roman Abr@@ am@@ ov@@ ich originally used in 2003 - a club with potential bought and then power@@ fully invested in order to build the team and build a global brand - to become a harder matter . &quot;
&quot; during the current three year @-@ year period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can take losses in the amount of 30 million euros . &quot;
&quot; and although Plat@@ ini 2015 has fallen from the pres@@ idency in Un@@ gn@@ ade , his UEF@@ A successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ in continues to be missed . &quot;
&quot; certainly FF@@ P is not dead and we will rein@@ force the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea tra@@ ver@@ so , who is at the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , opposite the Associ@@ ated Press in the past week . &quot;
&quot; although the PS@@ G the buy @-@ out @-@ cl@@ ause of Ne@@ ym@@ ar has paid in a package , it can distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of his contract . &quot;
&quot; Ne@@ ym@@ ar has signed a 5 @-@ year agreement , so that the tra@@ ys can be arranged in the annual accounts for the next five years in the year . &quot;
&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P @-@ sanctions in 2014 has the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is located in the possession of Manchester City , with the he@@ avi@@ est sanctions . &quot;
PS@@ G received a money penalty of 60 million euros ( at that time 82 million dollars ) which was reduced later to 20 million Euros and it was arranged that the teams members of the season 2014 / 15 to 21 players will be limited to the usual normal 25 players .
&quot; the UEF@@ A is looking for clubs which could try to over@@ see their financing , by using their revenue by companies who are connected to the owners of a club . &quot;
&quot; while a Catalan company could be sp@@ osed the PS@@ G , if the value of sponsor@@ ing the default market should not exceed , the UEF@@ A would not be regarded as legitim@@ ate income . &quot;
&quot; this happened in 2014 , when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of the sponsor@@ ing of the P@@ SA was flow@@ ed by the Qatar Tourism Authority . &quot;
it was reported that a part of PS@@ G payments to Ne@@ ym@@ ar about payments of the organizational committee of the World Cup 2022 could come in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Kat@@ ar 2022 have denied that Ne@@ ym@@ ar WM @-@ Ambassador will be easy to find out and such a maneu@@ ver for the UEF@@ A regulatory authorities .
&quot; the existing sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEF@@ A will be more attention , any attempt to consider the rules . &quot;
&quot; the UEF@@ A had no pre @-@ prepared discussions with PS@@ G via Ne@@ ym@@ ars Transfer , said about the people who are familiar with the situation . &quot;
they spoke under the condition of an@@ onym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press since they were not found to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest published reports will show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 with a turnover of 54@@ 2.4 million Euros has achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros .
the accounts for the last financial year must be published yet .
PS@@ G expects that ne@@ ym@@ ars arrive a blessing for sponsor@@ ing De@@ als , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ bul@@ lets . &quot;
the association goes out that sales after signing at least 30 percent will increase .
&quot; the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best soccer players , and tried to prevent ne@@ ym@@ ars way@@ ward by claimed that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; finance d@@ oping &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the President of the La League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Kat@@ ars last owners to PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; ar@@ sen@@ al @-@ Manager Ar@@ s@@ ene W@@ enger , whose association is owned by an American Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , the reservations from La League against a state that is financed by an association . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of the owner , and that has completely changed the whole landscape of foot in the past 15 years , &quot; &quot; said W@@ enger on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; it is very difficult to respect the financial fair@@ play , because you have different ways or have different interests , if a country has such a great player to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new sch@@ og@@ g@@ il@@ supplier
in the past few years Ch@@ ocol@@ at Fre@@ y board has been produced on board for Swiss Life .
&quot; now , the conclusions of cooperation in front of a possible end : the airline will write the order . &quot;
Swiss @-@ Spe@@ aker Me@@ ike Fu@@ hl@@ rott confirmed on request of the newspaper agency S@@ DA a corresponding report of the newspaper &quot; Nord@@ west@@ sch@@ okol@@ z &quot; from Friday .

the products would be checked for every two to three years and have under@@ taken a quality control .
&quot; with the current supplier Ch@@ ocol@@ at Fre@@ y we are very satisfied , &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ person . &quot;
&quot; approximately 17 million small red sp@@ otted bag to 14 grams is spread over 14 grams per year , in front of the landing at the passengers . &quot;
about the cost the Swiss no information wanted to do .
&quot; industry standards in accordance with &quot; &quot; Nord@@ west@@ sch@@ okol@@ z &quot; &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million francs - the mig@@ ros subsidiary has achieved a annual revenue of about one billion francs . &quot;
but more important is the promot@@ ional effect for a Sch@@ og@@ gi@@ producer : it is a prestigious order .
&quot; how many applic@@ ants can be found in the new tender , the Swiss will not betra@@ y the Swiss . &quot;
but in question only Swiss manufacturers come .
&quot; according to the period of time @-@ report , Ch@@ ocol@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make a renewal of the Treaty establishing the Spring 2018 . &quot;
for the S@@ DA the largest Swiss Chocolate manufacturer is not available for an opinion .

the three @-@ day world champion is fighting on Saturday in the fin@@ als around a med@@ al .
&quot; his brother Christoph , Olymp@@ ics of 2016 , was failed to have a look at the national Cup contest , and could take a look at the disc@@ us competition by the grand@@ stand . &quot;

nost@@ algia goes into &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the N@@ iche
&quot; this repet@@ ition of the story is at the same time nost@@ alg@@ ically because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 @-@ er years , for the 90 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ part ( The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for himself - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , such as Elizabeth Banks , Amy Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Rud@@ d to greater things . &quot;
as a cultural art@@ if@@ act it is equally a par@@ ody and an em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era permanent memories .
&quot; but as a fran@@ chise , it feels like that the time would be tight . &quot;
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; worked surprisingly good , not only because of its as the Hum@@ ors ( it contained a original story for an speaking c@@ anned vegetables , which was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin . &quot;
&quot; by playing on the core of the g@@ ags - actor medium Al@@ ters play ge@@ ile children , who will grow to grow - nevertheless , they are still the im@@ possibility to return the last part of the day . &quot;
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults , who now play adults , is less emotional ro@@ oted and its par@@ ody goes more after the found@@ ries principle , including a reef on the Stal@@ ker movies of the 90 @-@ er years as &quot; The Hand That Rocks the C@@ radle &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; one point is a character by a Apple @-@ Power@@ Book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from the year 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
&quot; gr@@ acious C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ old ) , now Roman@@ aut@@ or , has not yet forgotten Kat@@ ie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mo@@ reau ) . &quot;
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has still not lost its vir@@ g@@ inity .
&quot; and there is another crazy @-@ malicious p@@ lot , included in the Ronald Re@@ ag@@ an ( also Mr. Show@@ old ) that is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well successful impression of Michael Ian Black ) . &quot;
as always the ex@@ changes of the best part of fran@@ chise .
&quot; it makes a lot of fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rud@@ d , the Matt D@@ ill@@ ons Unter@@ li@@ ppen@@ bart of &quot; Sing@@ les &quot; , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy has now feels like an old boy . &quot;
&quot; there are the moments of acc@@ idental mad@@ ness that this fran@@ chise could be achieved like a kind of repet@@ itive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series , until he achieved this as his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : twenty Years L@@ ater , &quot; which will show the film premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; at Amazon now rem@@ inds of another kind of nost@@ algia : to the revival of the Cold War by &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ on@@ de &quot; and even &quot; G@@ low &quot; with its East @-@ against @-@ West Ring@@ fight @-@ I@@ kon@@ ography . &quot;

it is an ingen@@ ious idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
&quot; there are some nice g@@ ags to watch ( the police betra@@ ying the time to check out chess on television , as Americans may do with football ) . &quot;
&quot; and the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Sl@@ ate , Nick offer@@ man , Mah@@ ersh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ v@@ igny - ensures a decent game &quot; Fin@@ de &quot; . &quot; &quot;

the message for the imag@@ inary communist audience is that western culture can make everything for food for a money .
the f@@ ict@@ ional Romanian creator is not wrong : we even make it with our own younger history and the inc@@ ense .
blow against drugs @-@ Maf@@ ia in the country
police is a blow against the Italian Maf@@ ia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; in the seventh morning in the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald @-@ B@@ aar district , in Rott@@ weil , Konst@@ anz , Ess@@ lingen , and Stuttgart numerous objects are still looking for , as the pro@@ secution of Const@@ ance on Friday . &quot;
15 compl@@ ained aged between 25 years and 77 years and are already ar@@ rest against them .
&quot; the officials larger amounts of marijuana and Kok@@ ain , Sch@@ uss@@ ri , as well as several hundred thousand Euros . &quot;
in the same ri@@ vals in Italy two persons were arrested .
against the two suspe@@ cts Ital@@ ians gave it German cust@@ ody .
the two are therefore probably delivered to Germany .
in the action there were Italian and Bav@@ arian investig@@ ators .
&quot; overall , more than 300 polic@@ emen were in use . &quot;
&quot; the members of the Maf@@ ia will organized drugs , serious violence , betra@@ yed murder as well as rob@@ ber@@ ing and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; already since summer 2016 , the pro@@ secut@@ or is determined against the organised drug trading in the southern German area . &quot;
&quot; between the pro@@ secut@@ ors in Const@@ ance and Palermo , a reg@@ al exchange and investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rott@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues on Sicily . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the Grand Prix was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo . &quot;
in the Vis@@ or of the studies there are mainly Italian nation@@ als with respect to the Italian Maf@@ ia .
&quot; even a inc@@ ident on 27 May in Hü@@ fingen , in early morning several shots were re@@ produced in a Gast@@ sta@@ ette , is likely to go to the bank account of the ban@@ de . &quot;
acc@@ ents large g@@ aps in fore@@ igner @-@ register
&quot; data from citizens who should not arise &quot; &quot; : a report according to the foreigners register in Germany has significant defects in Germany . &quot;
the lead to some engra@@ ved mal@@ ign@@ ments at Asyl@@ um .
&quot; the advoc@@ ate for the refuge@@ e management of the federal government , Frank @-@ Jürgen way , has made a media report according to major g@@ aps in the foreign register register . &quot;
&quot; short@@ com@@ ings in the regist@@ rated data could lead to asylum @-@ procedures and de@@ port@@ ations &quot; to some major mis@@ conception , war@@ ned in an analysis that is the &quot; South German newspaper &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to the register , ten million people are recorded with foreign nationality , including about 5,@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU states . &quot;
the data is thus managed by about 600 out@@ foreign authorities in Germany .
&quot; because the data was not sufficiently maintained , the data quality in parts has not been well maintained . &quot;
&quot; in individual cases data from 1921 have been found , &quot; of people who have long been no longer alive , or of citizens who have become German citizen and should no longer arise in the register . &quot;
faul@@ ty data numbers can be substantially sl@@ owing processes that means the report to further .
&quot; in the statistics of confl@@ ict@@ ing people , the EU citizens were recorded , which would not even need to leave . &quot;
&quot; however , such false arrangements did not lead to a dist@@ orted debate on how to deal with expressions , is it possible according to the analysis . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the federal government has apparently started to return refuge@@ e families with under 16 years of children back to Italy when they are submitted by there . &quot;
this go out of an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and refugees ( BA@@ MF ) reported the &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rel@@ er Zeitung .
&quot; in the paper , the BA@@ MF lead such procedures &quot; regarding families with children - except for inf@@ ants and small children - to Italy since the 1st of June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; since the end of 2014 , this was practically no longer possible , the newspaper under reference to the difficult situation on site . &quot;
after the Dublin agreement is responsible for refugees of the EU state to reach the EU .
&quot; if a mig@@ rant is far from another EU country , this state can send it back to the destination country . &quot;
&quot; for the reason we write the office now : &quot; &quot; now the recording capacity for families with inferior children in Italy significantly increased . &quot;
Italy have given the recording and accommodation of family guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( E@@ GM@@ R ) hold these commitments for sufficient .
other EU states would also send refugees in the context of Dublin agreement .
&quot; the inner political spokes@@ person of the left @-@ fra@@ ction in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ized this decision : &quot; families with children threat@@ ening due to the short@@ com@@ ings of the Italian asylum system human rights and a haz@@ ard of child . &quot;
second result is achieved
a total of 220 lit@@ res of the blood of in Ober@@ rich@@ enbach living persons ordered the ble@@ eding service for other people .
&quot; at least from the twelve citizens , which were awarded on Friday . &quot;
&quot; for all Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who joined 50 lit@@ re of blood with its now 100 donations . &quot;
&quot; traditionally , the church in the session of the municipalities are the multi @-@ willingness to sp@@ ends blood . &quot;

&quot; thus , three persons could benefit from a blood @-@ sp@@ ying . &quot;
at the same time Ma@@ is@@ enb@@ acher reported by the actions that are carried out in spring in Ober@@ rich@@ enbach .
&quot; in this year we achieved the second best result , &quot; said the DR@@ K @-@ roundabout . &quot;

the Bank of England will hold the interest rates at 0.25 %
&quot; the Bank of England will probably announce that interest rates are unchanged , after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have fought the spec@@ ulation over a rise . &quot;
&quot; the Bank of England has war@@ ned that the economic growth is &quot; &quot; remain &quot; , &quot; when they come to the interest rates in family in the middle of an increasing pressure . &quot;
&quot; the political decision makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 to keep the interest rates on 0.25 % , whereby the weak economic growth has increased its support for an increase in this month . &quot;
&quot; in her quar@@ terly report , the Bank would reduced its growth process for 2017 to 1.7 % and from 2018 to 1,6 % and war@@ ned that pressure on the household would continue to continue on almost 3 % . &quot;
&quot; however , they sign@@ alized that in the next few years of inser@@ ting would be necessary to breed inflation and she said that the credit card might have to rise more than expected to increase financial markets . &quot;
members also agreed to withdraw a part of the m@@ amm@@ ut con@@ jun@@ ctive package which was issued before a year after Bre@@ x@@ it .
&quot; it will demand time for the financial plan to provide a budget for banks , although said that it is expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds . &quot;
&quot; minutes after the decision on the interest rate said the Bank : &quot; in the central pre@@ diction of the M@@ PC , the GDP remains weak on short notice , as the pressure on the real@@ ities of the households continue to use the consumption . &quot;
&quot; the interest rates repeated it that &quot; a certain pen@@ al@@ ment of monetary policy &quot; is required for the cooling of inflation and a &quot; somewhat larger &quot; extent required than the markets are expected . &quot;
the markets pro@@ g@@ nost@@ ic at present the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another year 2020 .
&quot; however , the Bank emphas@@ ised that enh@@ anc@@ ements &quot; &quot; gradu@@ al &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; limited &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Bank for this and next year will be corre@@ cted by the Bank for this and next year compared to those in May pro@@ g@@ nost@@ cted 1.9 % and 1.7 % .
she has retain@@ ed its growth pro@@ gn@@ osis at 1.8 % in 2018 .
the po@@ und fell after these messages over the dollar and the euro .
the po@@ und fell by 0.5 % to 1.9 US dollars and fell by 0.3 % to 1.11 euros .
&quot; the decision to no change occurs after the recent disappoint@@ ing growth pay the rising expectations on an advert@@ ise , and the GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % increased to 0.3 % in the previous three months . &quot;
&quot; the growth is expected to lie in the third quarter at 0.3 % , although it is easy to recover after the bank at the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; the newest In@@ flu@@ ence report offered little enthusiasm for households , which are affected by an increasing inflation and reduced housing , as the shar@@ pen@@ ing is first even worse before they get better . &quot;
&quot; she added that monetary policy in the coming years can not &quot; prevent &quot; but she added that wages are significantly recover at the end of their three @-@ year projection . &quot;
&quot; the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is due to the weak pounds , which is due to compens@@ ate some of the lower consumption . &quot;
the decision is coming to a year after the reduction of interest rates on 0.25 % last August after the sh@@ ocking EU @-@ vote which created the s@@ ine of the sound .
the Bank estimates that it will likely take four years until this will achieve the prices and the economy .
&quot; in front of the last ver@@ di@@ ct of the Bank to the Z@@ ins@@ ane , the call for an advert@@ ise increased , since inflation increased the pressure on hard to penet@@ rated households , with three political decision makers in July already called a rise in 0,5 % . &quot;
&quot; inflation is taken during the last month of 2.9 % in June at 2,@@ 6 % , although the Bank said that this was expected to come back in the coming months . &quot;
the Bank told the trans@@ itions in relation to their goal of 2 % to a &quot; &quot; weak pounds . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director at Co@@ re@@ co Mort@@ gage Bro@@ ker , said : &quot; &quot; given the shortest return of the sw@@ ap market is likely to be more competitive , since the credit@@ ors are looking forward to shops and would like to finish the year in a positive way . &quot;
&quot; the market is particularly well suited for those who closing existing De@@ als and closing the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with toll free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) is supposed to be re@@ written HIV @-@ Dro@@ ge 10,000 people
patients will be obtained from September following a fight against high Court against financing of the drug in N@@ HS access to an &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV disease treatment .
N@@ HS England gave it known that one before the intercourse exc@@ used preval@@ ence phy@@ lax@@ is ( pre@@ p ) that can reduce the Infe@@ ction risk for about 86 percent now being delivered by the health service across a first three year @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people . &quot;
&quot; he commented to finance the process after the profession Court had confirmed a judgment of the Supreme Court of Justice in the past year , the N@@ HS had the authority for pre@@ p despite the claim that local authorities should finance him . &quot;
&quot; he was announced on Thursday by N@@ HS England @-@ Chief Simon Stev@@ ens as &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; , &quot; during the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) this was considered a &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health Clin@@ ics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be included in the first to follow the registration of people and will follow further clinics in October 2018 before it will be launched in the whole of April 2018 . &quot;
&quot; preval@@ ent processes lax@@ is ( pre@@ p ) is a consequence of HIV preparations , which are taken before sex to reduce the risk of an HIV infection . &quot;
studies have shown that pre@@ p the HIV transfer of Infe@@ ction endanger@@ ed significantly reduced .
pre@@ p prior to intercourse means that precisely enough medicines in the body are available to prevent an HIV infection .
such drugs can be taken every day or just two hours before intercourse .
&quot; those who come for treatment in question is pregnant or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexual and persons with HIV @-@ positive partners who were not treated successfully . &quot;
&quot; in clinics , appropriate participants will be identified to agree with the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known as such as anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment . &quot;
people who live in England and registered for a medical care can also be registered for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program will present £ 10 million and N@@ HS England a contract for delivery of the drugs used this week after an international competitive pro@@ curement .
&quot; the study aims to assess the entire potential of pre@@ p by clinical employees , as a large scale has been deplo@@ yed and implemented in a large scale . &quot;
Stev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should complement the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to contr@@ ace@@ ption of HIV and over@@ hau@@ led .
it is another milestone in which more than three decades lasting progress in dealing with one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot;
&quot; Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive Officer at NAT ( National Aids Trust ) said : &quot; &quot; this is a decisive moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ p , if it is targeted to need@@ y and endanger@@ ed people , the possibility to change the English HIV epide@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; from September to people with high HIV risk access to this N@@ HS financing attempt to develop a new instrument , which is really individually controlled and is not subject to negoti@@ ation with a partner , which leads to improve many , many lives . &quot;
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; Ian Green , CEO of the Terr@@ ence H@@ iggins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; the priority must now lie that the study is done quickly in the whole country and that no one who has left a risk to HIV . &quot;
&quot; now , as the pre@@ p @-@ test medicine was created , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infection . &quot;
&quot; Shar@@ on Hod@@ g@@ son , shadow @-@ Ministry of Health , said : &quot; &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p process is after mon@@ atel@@ ier delay and hes@@ it@@ ant realisation through the government welcome and over@@ due . &quot;
&quot; the evidence demonstrate how transformed this drug as part of our approach to the HIV prevention , and the transfer of this life changing infection can end . &quot;
this attempt takes us a step closer to understanding the benefits of pre@@ p .
&quot; now , it is important that this study is done as fast as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected with HIV , and that they will contribute to the end of the spread of HIV in society . &quot;
the big life live : mezz@@ anine and clever designer tricks have transformed this little Ear@@ ls Court Apartment in a generous home
&quot; Jo@@ anne Le@@ igh , a former ban@@ ker in a passion for real estate , decre@@ ased in 2014 from a large house in Kn@@ ight@@ s@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court Apartment . &quot;
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne is not packed their pockets and sold out .
&quot; before that I lived with my ex in Kn@@ ight@@ s@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; says Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; I sought after something , which was similar to my price . &quot;
&quot; this apartment was shown in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ceilings . &quot;
I love to love in her and made an offer on that day . &quot;
&quot; since the first visit , the 1,000 square meters was completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
&quot; originally a one @-@ room property with a snow@@ y layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add a balcony storage room , and a mezz@@ anine to be optimal for the generous ceiling . &quot;
&quot; I wanted to have high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot;
&quot; this was my request , &quot; &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; to this end she comm@@ enced the architecture and Design@@ studio Duck &amp; S@@ hed from Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from N@@ otting Hill , which was 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not just a development , but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; the blank@@ et was not big enough to place two rooms , so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezz@@ anine in which you are able to stand . &quot;
&quot; Er@@ fan had to create creative , to solve the award . &quot;
&quot; the steel piece is rather complicated , &quot; explained . &quot;
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms so arranged that they were flo@@ od@@ ed , without giving us g@@ aps . &quot;
&quot; it was not only about to build a simple platform , but to put the steel that he had for the function up or down the right height . &quot;
&quot; this arrangement allowed it to place Er@@ fan , two rooms at full height with each other - with a lot of additional drama . &quot;
for the mezz@@ anine is a classic copper window of retro@@ u@@ vi@@ us across the glam@@ orous lounge area .
&quot; mir@@ ro@@ red gold @-@ furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille illumination set the style for the program . &quot;
the use of mir@@ rors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light . &quot;
on both ends is a short cor@@ ridor mir@@ ro@@ red to let him longer work .
in the kitchen the mir@@ rors feels like a window in another room .
at the entrance offer mir@@ ro@@ red units for all Best@@ ecke and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
&quot; due to the perception of a glam@@ orous space , the beauty of the living room can complete the kitchen if it is not used . &quot;
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
special is this is that it is a guar@@ ant@@ or .
&quot; a bit of engineer went out there , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the st@@ ahl@@ reinforced , vene@@ ered M@@ DF door . &quot;
&quot; it is important , so it if you cut the door , very light gli@@ des . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the cle@@ ver@@ en usage of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could win additional 16 m ² , an extra bedroom and an improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the basic surface - or how your property is appreciated , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a IM@@ MO@@ BI@@ LI@@ EN@@ MA@@ IL shall enter and perform a calculation based on the floor size . &quot;
&quot; here , they managed to enlarge the ground floor and at the same time they use high quality materials that get the room its luxurious advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things you tou@@ ching and the therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; you do not tell you into the electric sockets in the walls .
&quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can be characterized by good design and increased square meters of slightly by default in something completely aston@@ ishing .
&quot; in fact , as Jo@@ anne , you could decide to leave this not . &quot;
&quot; brothers , strug@@ gling for a 500 million US dollar based &quot;
&quot; two brothers spent four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in an analysis because of one of the largest real estate @-@ imper@@ ial Vic@@ tor@@ ia worth more than 500 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; the former Director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football @-@ Club &apos; and developer Colin De Lut@@ is lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors by his younger brother Paul . he has brought him to the Supreme Court of Justice , to clarify how their property and their business . &quot;
Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 but a sharp debate about separation occurs in the Supreme Court of Justice .
&quot; together with her mother Anna , the brothers 38 Real Estate possess more than half a billion dollars , accumul@@ ated since the family 1973 a shop in Smith Street , Col@@ ling@@ wood . &quot;
there the family West@@ co je@@ ans founded and grew up to a chain of 160 items shops .
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
&quot; this money has been invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lut@@ is now includes offices in Stad@@ tz@@ en@@ rum , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centres in the suburbs . &quot;
&quot; after an agreement with her dece@@ ased father , Colin - by Paul as &quot; main super@@ visor , and the dominant personality &quot; &quot; is described in the family De Lut@@ is , about two thir@@ ds of the business , and Paul about one third . &quot;
a jurisdiction that this means that Colin is the value of € 316 million dollars and Paul has a value of 176 million dollars .
the division of real estate and cash has turned out to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; the words proposed by Colin proposed him with the left what I held for the best objects , he wrote in one of the first aff@@ id@@ av@@ it . &quot;
on the last Friday I took place after several trained h@@ mitt@@ ing the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice .
&quot; the brothers now also fight control over the existing business - of which Colin , such as Paul claims that excluded it . &quot;
&quot; Colin argu@@ ed , this is not true , but raises Paul to manage some pos@@ sessions . &quot;
&quot; in an early Aff@@ id@@ av@@ it , that was submitted by Colin , he says he hope to give the dispute . &quot;
&quot; my Italian heritage writes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; the costs will rise in the case , with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading attor@@ neys , including Allan My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and from both sides of the law firm . &quot;
Mrs. De Lut@@ is and her dece@@ ased husband Luigi were Italian immig@@ rants who run dairy bars and del@@ ik@@ at@@ ess@@ ments from the late 1950 @-@ er years and in the early sevent@@ ies a business in Br@@ uns@@ wick .
&quot; they used the security to buy the Col@@ ling@@ wood songs , in the Colin the first je@@ ans of the family opened . &quot;
&quot; Colin says that he started West@@ co , when he was in my last years the High School , as Paul was a small child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
&quot; Anna De Lut@@ is says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hopes their property worth to pass on their sons . &quot;
&quot; Luigi &apos;s often said to me , that he never wanted to land the brothers before judgment , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lut@@ is Group group , where Colin claims that Mark had paid 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; both Luke and Mark were , says Paul &quot; about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot;
Colin has been very re@@ held even though he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography from 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of the TV stars .
Fair@@ fax media took contact Colin and Paul De Lut@@ is and their attor@@ neys .
&quot; Colin repl@@ ied by SMS to say &apos; I can really not say much , &quot; &quot; because the case was before the courts . &quot;
&quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to compl@@ ain me and withdraw our family names by the courts , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of 2016 , Colin in writing to the court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother . &quot;
&quot; our father did not have cried that Paul and I would end up in our current battle , &quot; he said and added that he is still hop@@ ing for a solution . &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; our affair will be solved in the near future of the courts , &quot; wrote Colin . &quot;
tru@@ m@@ ps of new staff is planning to re@@ strict the media ab@@ st@@ in@@ ence of the President .
others have tried and are failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
&quot; if yes , he will be the first . &quot;
&quot; Polit@@ ico reports that the new rod of the White House is planning to re@@ strict the information flow to President Tru@@ mp - including the reports of news media , in the hope to hold the boss on a uniform course . &quot;
here is a piece of re@@ porter Jos@@ h Daw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new staff members of the White House , at his first working day , he held a main problem in President Donald Tru@@ m@@ ps &apos;s white house , which he repaired : bad information that goes into the hands of the President . &quot;
Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in correspondence - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information .
&quot; cellars diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to count Tru@@ mp by monitoring his media . &quot;
&quot; President Tru@@ m@@ ps relationship to television dates back - and now , where he is in the White House , is still strong . &quot;
&quot; if Kan@@ did@@ at Tru@@ mp was angry because of an un@@ fair reporting , it was productive to show him that he was a fair reporting of places that were to convince , &quot; &quot; said the former elect@@ oral vote Sam Nun@@ berg in February to Polit@@ ico . &quot;
&quot; Polit@@ ic@@ os Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; &quot; the key , Tru@@ m@@ ps Twitter hab@@ it has to hold under control , according to six former elect@@ oral election officers in it is to ensure that his personal media has a ste@@ ady praise . &quot;
okay .
&quot; but the idea that Tru@@ m@@ ps Twitter @-@ hab@@ it ever &quot; &quot; under control &quot; &quot; is ridicul@@ ous . &quot;
maybe this campaign call something that we do not know other - that Tru@@ m@@ ps Twe@@ ets could have included even more cy@@ mb@@ ase .
&quot; we will probably never know something about the twe@@ ets , the Tru@@ mp has not been sent . &quot;
&quot; when he made his staff again several times , anger from him away , then their efforts have been worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; however , no one has consistently caused it to cause Tru@@ mp control . &quot;
&quot; a part of the problem is that people in a wh@@ ites house , resulting from cont@@ acting parties , always try to submit their own agenda by making Tru@@ mp material that might support their views from the world . &quot;
&quot; Polit@@ ico - very busy with this story - told in May about the preference of consultants , the president of strategic reasons to introduce a doubt . &quot;
this was an example that was described by Re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former Tru@@ mp officials say that Tru@@ mp can respond as a volcano on a negative press cuts , especially those with damaged Lec@@ co , and that he can find out how these come from . &quot;
&quot; this happened in the end of February , when someone gave to the president malicious a printed copy of an article by Got@@ new@@ s.com , the website of the Internet @-@ Prov@@ ok@@ ate@@ urs Charles C. Johnson , who was the source behind a he@@ ap to be of Lec@@ ks &quot; in the White House . &quot;
&quot; although Johnson was b@@ anned from Twitter , or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he has expressed false evidence or he has ref@@ used in the past . &quot;
Tru@@ mp read the article and started to ask staff about Wal@@ sh .
&quot; Gold@@ macher added that the former Stab@@ sche@@ f Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage the paper stuff , and to document the Tru@@ mp . &quot;
how did it work ?
Kelly tries to do the same thing three months later .
&quot; maybe he will prove to be effective manager as Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tru@@ mp is still his impul@@ sive selves , and his consultants still seek influence . &quot;
these un@@ changing factors make wa@@ ys mission very difficult .
mast@@ ered crimin@@ als get mail from Euro@@ pol
&quot; as the address is unknown , the co @-@ aid of the population is praying and hop@@ ed . &quot;
the police throughout Europe send post@@ cards in this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards at dangerous crimin@@ als on the run .
&quot; since the addresses of the search@@ ed sever@@ ity is not known , are evidence of the population hop@@ ed and pray . &quot;
Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from action to follow the &quot; EU Most W@@ anted &quot; Adv@@ ent Calendar of Winter .
the experiences were shown that many vol@@ at@@ eries had hide from hol@@ ograms it was called Euro@@ pol .
you have put 21 post@@ cards for smo@@ ked crimin@@ als from 21 EU countries .
&quot; since 2016 the website www.@@ eu@@ mo@@ st@@ wanted , more than 2.5 million times has been viewed . &quot;
&quot; 36 of the online g@@ orges were previously arrested , at least eleven of them due to the publication on the website . &quot;
travellers negoti@@ ate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; mill@@ ion@@ s @-@ series &apos;
some of the prosper@@ ous house @-@ owner of the West Mid@@ lands are back with some resol@@ ute trav@@ eller on the con@@ scient@@ ious obje@@ ctions to re@@ acted one of the municipality of drawn dit@@ ch in order to re@@ claim a field in front of their man@@ sions .
the travelers have their 20 carav@@ ans on a field outside of a prosper@@ ous road from Sol@@ ih@@ ull .
&quot; they have horses , babies and an army of tran@@ spor@@ ter , after they were killed only in May , without being sc@@ ared by the Council to prevent their waste . &quot;
the tact@@ ical group found a gap in the def@@ ensive facilities and oppressed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ disabled to find a way .
&quot; en@@ rag@@ ed inhabitants have pushed the Council of Sol@@ ih@@ ull , who said that it is &quot; &quot; us@@ eless &quot; &quot; to deal with the problem . &quot;
&quot; an anonymous inhabitants said , &quot; You are on the fitting night there , after they were further for@@ ged from Bentley He@@ ath , where they cast stones on the pass@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Council must be forced by shame to implement the problem since it was us@@ eless when dealing with the problem was us@@ eless . &quot;
the travel@@ er were in May there , have been moved and are now back again . &quot;
&quot; more than yesterday evening , probably today more . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; &quot; the Council of Birmingham white , how to deal with it , making a long under@@ statement to protect their parks . &quot;
&quot; I live at the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I am not happy , to pay my common tax if the Council can not stop once . &quot;
&quot; the inhabitants who did not want to be called , &quot; &quot; It is ridicul@@ ous , we have just seen the last lap of these travel@@ er , only to be vacc@@ inated by another round . &quot;
&quot; the figures have increased this time , and you even have seen a horse in the park . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ person of the Council of Sol@@ ih@@ ull said : &quot; &quot; we are aware of an unauthorized camp on the land beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work with the police of Sol@@ ih@@ ul@@ ls . we se@@ ize the necessary legal steps to continue it as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; to support our prophes@@ y , it is very important that as possible to report as many inhabitants a anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police by sending them 101 . &quot;
&quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court needs to check , when we present our case . &quot;
Birken@@ hof gets Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Birken@@ hof the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts is currently being renovated and will be opened on the 1st of March next year .
these are good news for the city .
&quot; because with the closing of the hotel Birken@@ hof , by the then ambience of the hotel Birken@@ hof , through the then @-@ time ambi@@ ance company , 13 . April 2014 there went around 30 000 nights per year and even income by the city tax . &quot;
&quot; in the autumn of 2014 , in the face of a dramatic increase of refugees , which came across the district , the hotel building owned by the Land@@ ro@@ en as an collection , which is provided for contro@@ ver@@ si@@ al discussions . &quot;
the city had prevented the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers by setting up an illustration in order to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was then not un@@ contro@@ ver@@ si@@ al at that time .
&quot; but mainly the Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts Julian O@@ ss@@ wald , def@@ ended the hotel location , and spoke at that time of serious interest in the house . &quot;
he ought to keep right .
the group Lu@@ isen@@ hotels with headquarters in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern enjoyed the former Hotel Birken@@ hof in Berlin and will make it back to a house of the three @-@ star @-@ plus @-@ category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ stadt object four houses .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Man@@ al@@ b .
&quot; Lu@@ ise Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; at the former Hotel Birken@@ hof has been standing in front of the entrance for some time at the entrance of the entrance , and when you enter the house , it will be clear what extensive renovation work . &quot;
&quot; the so@@ ils were removed out , blank@@ ets for part ab@@ by , old bath@@ tu@@ bs from the rooms . &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
until March there is much to do .
&quot; it is actually a lovely place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
everything is to be renewed in black style .
&quot; the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entry range will be re@@ designed , there will be new windows . &quot;
&quot; everything sol@@ le later &quot; &quot; beautiful bourgeois &quot; &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses . &quot;
&quot; we want to make a jewel . &quot;
&quot; swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room are part of the equipment . &quot;
&quot; it does not apply to the high level of hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on an up@@ scale city level . &quot;
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms would be broad to expand .
&quot; both individual holidays , groups or business@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel . &quot;
conversation with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourism director Michael Kr@@ ause has already led so sc@@ erer .
the ideas of the city are covered with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; after the amount of investment , Thomas Sch@@ erer will not want to specify exactly . &quot;
&quot; under a million euros , he expects . &quot;
&quot; also the outer facilities are brought to the fore@@ front , this is already clearly visible . &quot;
&quot; in a courtyard there is a large terrace which is publicly available from the restaurant , which is publicly available . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ aires : us @-@ Spec@@ ifications Grand Jury
in Russia @-@ President Donald Tru@@ mp should be used by Robert Mu@@ eller for a report a so @-@ called Grand Jury for a report .
&quot; the board has received the work in recent weeks , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; under calling on the case . &quot;
the newspaper cle@@ ared the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller was wid@@ ened its proce@@ eds and intensi@@ fied .
the sender CN@@ N reported it was already an inv@@ itations of the Gre@@ mi@@ ums associated with a meeting between Tru@@ m@@ ps &apos;s son and Russian attor@@ ney .
us @-@ secret services inv@@ ent the Kre@@ m@@ lin for some time to be mixed in the pres@@ idential election in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller exam@@ ines whether there were parag@@ raph@@ s between Tru@@ m@@ ps elect@@ oral team and Moscow .
&quot; in the focus of the survey@@ ing , several men are to stand in the election campaign as a consultant of the Re@@ publ@@ ican . &quot;
&quot; according to , Mu@@ eller also took more and more Tru@@ m@@ ps private and business environment under the micro@@ scope . &quot;
&quot; Washington Post &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the special medi@@ ator Tru@@ mp has been in the centre for a few weeks ago and the head @-@ cast under@@ search , whether the President in the course of the affair may have imp@@ aired the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys is to prove to examine the evidence of possible crime , and decide whether the indi@@ ct@@ ment shall be raised . &quot;
Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore also called acc@@ id chambers .
mostly it is turned on when it comes to greater and contro@@ ver@@ si@@ al cases .
the procedure is always behind closed doors .
the committees can also be swit@@ ched on the Pro@@ secut@@ or for persons to take care of persons at E@@ id .
&quot; according to the station CN@@ N were already issued pre @-@ inv@@ itations , which are turning around the meeting between Donald Tru@@ mp J@@ r. and an Russian attor@@ ney . &quot;
persons who were involved in the meetings were given to a statement called it was in the report .
&quot; additionally , they should provide documents . &quot;
beside Tru@@ mp J@@ r. were also Tru@@ m@@ ps consultants and in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner as well as his former elect@@ oral chef Paul Man@@ a@@ fort during conversation .
&quot; legitim@@ acy said on Thursday evening in the US television , that the en@@ forcement show that Mu@@ eller can not let himself down in his work and that he should be necessary to act quickly . &quot;
&quot; but it is not necessarily called the Grand Jury at the end , to decide over the survey of an indi@@ ct@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; however , the en@@ forcement of the Gre@@ mi@@ ums will be the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for president Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the new re@@ vel@@ ations , the President on Thursday evening a speech in West Virginia , to present Russia @-@ affair as a campaign of his political opponents . &quot;
&quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; said Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; the issue give the Democrats a way to feel &quot; &quot; well , because they have nothing else to talk about which they can talk about . &quot;
&quot; his special T@@ y Cob@@ b declared in a statement , he know nothing of the appointment of a Grand Jury . &quot;
&quot; but this work also usually in intelligence , he stressed . &quot;
&quot; the White House endor@@ s@@ ements any action , which acceler@@ ated the work of the &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; in a fair way . &quot;
the former F@@ BI @-@ chef James Com@@ ey said three times that not be determined against the president .
I have no reason to accept that something was changed in the declaration .
Mu@@ eller was only used to have been fi@@ red after Tru@@ mp Com@@ ey .
&quot; because of this r@@ aus@@ ages , the accus@@ ations were turned against Tru@@ mp , he made the judi@@ ci@@ ary disabled . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ey said in June before a Senate , Tru@@ mp have asked him for a setting of the initi@@ ations against the former national security consultant Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n . &quot;
the president is under great pressure due to the examination .
&quot; after representation of US media , the White House material gathered for the special medi@@ ator and its employees . &quot;
the delet@@ ing spec@@ ul@@ ations about whether Tru@@ mp Mu@@ eller would be missed .
&quot; different from an independent special medi@@ ator of the Congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair around the later with@@ ered President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could moist@@ ur@@ izes in theoret@@ ically the president of the Treasury . &quot;
multiple sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step but prevention .
&quot; two groups of re@@ publ@@ ican and democratic Sen@@ ators put on Thursday law@@ ns , after which the special medi@@ ator could no longer be released as easy . &quot;
Antar@@ ct@@ ica : giant ic@@ eberg is driving in Antar@@ ct@@ ica
in the West@@ ant@@ ar@@ ctic there is a gig@@ antic Eis@@ berg seen from the nearly sie@@ ben@@ al size of Berlin &apos;s Shel@@ f@@ is .
this divided the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ Weg@@ ener Institute for polar and marine research on Wednesday .
&quot; the more than a B@@ illion ton of heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilomet@@ re long Col@@ oured out now to the north and I will probably need two , three years until he was mel@@ ted . &quot;
he is registered with 175 kilometers of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers of one of the largest ic@@ e@@ ye@@ ants who have registered the researchers in the past three decades .
a danger to man does not go from him .
&quot; how much the climate change has played a role in the quar@@ ry of the ic@@ eberg , is un@@ clear to research . &quot;
&quot; however , there has been a series of un@@ common break@@ throug@@ hs for some 30 years in the region , writes the US research centre for snow and ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a factor . &quot;
&quot; according to the opinion of many researchers , this could connect with the heating . &quot;
the now broken Kol@@ oss was hi@@ ther@@ to a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ fe@@ is .
Schel@@ fe@@ is sw@@ ims on the sea and is fed by large gl@@ ac@@ iers .
it thus continues to grow into the sea and breaks off regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ fe@@ is is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antar@@ ctic peninsula .
north of this Schel@@ ect was the balance of w@@ axing and v@@ om@@ iting in front of a few years ago .
a complete Schel@@ fe@@ is was there and writes AW@@ I @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
&quot; there were some things that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ fe@@ is is in danger , for the front can@@ te have never moved as far as ever . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the Iron plate can also be broken under voltage and could fall , if at a keyword a piece of slow . &quot;
&quot; the mel@@ ting of Schel@@ fe@@ is and Eis@@ berg increases the level of level , as it is on the water swimming and ice cream as much water as it gives to the mel@@ ting itself . &quot;
&quot; however , the loss of the Schel@@ ect is that the gl@@ ac@@ iers can go directly to the sea , and can be able to flow much faster than before . &quot;
&quot; this could possibly increase the level , but only in the court , writes the British research project to the observation of the Antar@@ ct@@ ica ( Mi@@ das ) . &quot;
&quot; the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ fe@@ is is after AW@@ I @-@ information with nearly 50 000 square kilometers , the fourth @-@ largest Schel@@ fe@@ is of the Antar@@ ctic . &quot;
&quot; on the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , on the front @-@ edge to the free ocean around 200 meters . &quot;
there it breaks off regularly .
&quot; although there is a natural happening , and that is not direct connection to climate change , the ice @-@ plate is now in an endanger@@ ed position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ Le@@ ary from the British Sw@@ an@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the wid@@ est retreat since the beginning of the record , &quot; also confirmed . &quot;
&quot; scientists would be contro@@ ver@@ si@@ al whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ fe@@ is now again grow back to the long @-@ term and possibly merge together , said his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last decades .
&quot; even if this researcher will not fall back the out@@ break of this gig@@ antic ic@@ eberg , so in the past decades there are very many ic@@ esh@@ ips of the ant@@ ar@@ ctic peninsula . &quot;
this long section of the Antar@@ ct@@ ica extends to South America .
&quot; according to data from the research program of British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the ic@@ eberg of the Antar@@ ctic peninsula has gone over 28 000 square kilometers since the 19@@ 50s . &quot;
to the decline have contributed the temperature increase .
the Antar@@ ctic peninsula have passed around three degrees in the past 50 years and therefore count towards the areas where the temperature at the quick@@ est ste@@ ady .
CD@@ U wants to be car@@ pet@@ al at the staff
&quot; because it is becoming increasingly difficult to occup@@ y free places , calls for the CD@@ U , from the working association to become more attractive . &quot;
only shortly before the summer time the Kre@@ ist@@ ag has taken 41 new places in the administration .
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the roundabout in M@@ ett@@ mann .
once again 17 apprent@@ ices have their first working day behind .
the instru@@ ctors in the circle are apparently very popular .
around 620 applications were to record the places for this year .
&quot; however , the circle is missing further to cope with the requirements and tasks . &quot;
currently there are no other play@@ site in the district of M@@ ett@@ mann .
&quot; among other things doctors and engineers , as well as forces of the general administration . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to take part in the Kre@@ el together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG the initiative and take the expert @-@ angel in the administration .
administration should develop a concept for recru@@ it@@ ment and personnel development according to the desire of the parties . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to cover not only at short @-@ term distress , but future @-@ oriented of the applic@@ ants , is called it . &quot;
&quot; the overall concept should be oriented towards inside and outside , concrete measures for cross @-@ clim@@ bers and include a vocational off@@ ensive , call CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot;
that sounds already after a good approach .
&quot; for the circle has to do with staff problems , which you did not know before . &quot;
other cities attract good officials and employees and offer more attractive terms .
the speech is by a regular &quot; competition of the public employer . &quot;
&quot; this comes with a high number of employees , the disease , or alter@@ ation from the service . &quot;
&quot; thus , the highest time to act therefore , so that no more places remain un@@ occupied . &quot;
&quot; Klaus @-@ Dieter peoples , leader of the CD@@ U , continues with his party beyond common application . &quot;
&quot; he did not have long ago at the Kre@@ ist@@ ag for a f@@ aust@@ di@@ cke , when he asked the recru@@ it@@ ment of public in question and the rest of the parties were intrig@@ uing . &quot;
peoples want to be reviewed that all possibilities are ver@@ ified from the commun@@ al labour market .
&quot; if we do not come here at a satis@@ factory solution here , the roundabout with the trade unions - perhaps also in collaboration with the circular cities - a door@@ way to strive , such people . &quot;
&quot; in order to pay the CD@@ U , the employees and officials will be better to pay when it is actually the T@@ ari@@ for@@ war@@ der for the public service . &quot;
&quot; the sal@@ aries currently are precisely written , cre@@ ases or more money is only when you switch to a higher stage which is oriented towards professional years . &quot;
but the tasks of the circle have always grown more and more in recent years .
only a few weeks ago we had to set up new spaces in which the provisions of the new pro@@ st@@ icking protection law .
&quot; not least by the rising number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hen@@ del@@ e and Rot@@ dire@@ ctor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff . &quot;
Italy we@@ ight@@ ening the tone to NGO migrants @-@ life@@ jacket
&quot; Italy has NGOs , the lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , war@@ ned that they may not continue to continue this if they are not able to hold new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not write a new Code of Con@@ duct , it is difficult to see how they can work on , &quot; said the minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Tur@@ iner daily La St@@ ampa . &quot;
&quot; Minn@@ ie &apos;s warning came a day after the Italian authorities had a boat of the German auxiliary organization &apos; Youth Rett@@ et &apos; , because their team had worked together with human traff@@ ick@@ ers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration . &quot;
&quot; the aid organisation that has only been in operation for a year , ref@@ used to express themselves to detailed ven@@ es of the Italian Staats@@ an@@ wal@@ ts Amb@@ ro@@ gio Cart@@ os@@ io . &quot;
&quot; for us , the rescue of human life is our top priority . so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search - and rescue @-@ zone , &quot; said the organization in a statement on social media . &quot;
&quot; we can collect all alleg@@ ations that are currently raised , only after we have collected all the information and evaluate the situation . &quot;
&quot; the Italian authorities had the boat of &apos; Youth Rett@@ et &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , has been monitored since October . &quot;
&quot; it is suspe@@ cted that his occupation infl@@ atable migrants will be delivered on board , which can be delivered directly from human traff@@ ick@@ ers and that the sm@@ ug@@ gler can be used again , so that the ships can be used again . &quot;
&quot; at least one such coinc@@ idental meeting was supposed to be only 1.3 miles before the Lib@@ yan coast , according to the state of the State Opera , whose content of Italian media has been published . &quot;
&quot; the occupation is sus@@ pic@@ ious , about the authority of the Italian coastline , the life@@ j@@ ackets in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not of any other mot@@ ifs . &quot;
&quot; under the Code of Con@@ duct , boats such as I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must have a Italian police on board that monitors their activities . &quot;
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs who are involved in search and rescue principles , have so far been declared to hold the code : Save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Act@@ iva Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday , that the new rules would be considered un@@ necessary , but acceptable , as they would not be &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; of their life@@ jacket . &quot;
&quot; among those who refuse to sign up , the Nobel @-@ prize @-@ carrier doctors are without borders ( M@@ SF ) . &quot;
&quot; Minn@@ iti now told that the number of migrants , which went greatly decl@@ ined after the rescue measures in Italy in the last few weeks , that the efforts to strengthen the Lib@@ yan coastline and the cooperation with the local citizens . &quot;
&quot; in the last few days we started to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; he gave plans for further discussions with Lib@@ yan citizens in this month of economic development initiatives and with Tsch@@ ad , Niger and Mali about measures to reduce the number of migrants that these countries can be able to reach Europe . &quot;
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
&quot; nine We@@ il@@ er@@ mer B@@ iker who met Berlin &apos;s out@@ post &quot; and two guest riders met in Wach@@ en@@ heim , in order to enjoy four days in Tri@@ als and places of interest . &quot;
&quot; therefore , three provided guides were available . &quot;
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer Valley proved to be a good starting point for tours .
the Burg@@ un@@ - and W@@ einf@@ est of Wach@@ en@@ heim was an welcome extra .
the first tour conducted in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards for Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above De@@ id@@ es@@ heim .
&quot; there were view@@ points , partly in towers , of which one could look far beyond the P@@ ill@@ zer forest and the spread levels . &quot;
&quot; in between there , there was always a longer asc@@ ents for the long tri@@ umph@@ s . &quot;
on the second day it went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to Sal@@ ine and the People @-@ Festival Wur@@ t@@ markt .

in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim breath@@ s the b@@ iker in the air @-@ air surgeon healing .
also Neustadt was controlled .
&quot; after 173 kilometers and almost 4500 altitude , the group had the P@@ ien@@ zer forest of its best side - sporty and cultur@@ ally - meet . &quot;
console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ l@@ iga equipment used for e @-@ sport
sitting the sport stars in the future in front of computer con@@ soles instead of moving through wind and weather over the state authority ?
&quot; fact : e @-@ sport has long been a serious industry to have a lu@@ crat@@ ive business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high g@@ ages . &quot;
&quot; this also recognized the first federal states , which are increasingly involved in this field . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2015 , the V@@ f@@ L Wol@@ fs@@ burg , later followed the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last of the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , founded in mid July a E @-@ Sport Department and took two professionals for the computer game F@@ IFA 17 under contract . &quot;
&quot; we hope to insp@@ ire the new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says the Board of Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
he is certain that on this train still some clubs asc@@ ending .
&quot; the coming weekend organized at the F@@ IFA World Cup F@@ IFA in London the first &quot; &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; , &quot; where the gam@@ er &apos;s gam@@ er will compete with each other . &quot;
&quot; beside sha@@ ke and Wol@@ fs@@ burg , such as Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Eindhoven qualified . &quot;
Robin Dut@@ t sees great potential in the E @-@ sport .
the Ex @-@ Trainer by Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen is now a agency for virtual football player .
&quot; the real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ old , that the young people are still going to go into the stadium , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; and : associations versu@@ s all possible markets , especially the Asian , to conquer . &quot;
&quot; with prominent e @-@ sport@@ smen under the contract , one could only be more often more often in these markets than once in the year to send to Asia . &quot;
what is it exactly ?
&quot; when e @-@ sport are computer games like &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 &quot; , &quot; Counter@@ strike &quot; or even the soccer simulation F@@ IFA on competitions . &quot;
&quot; long have long been established , as in normal sport , lactose @-@ established , in which the pro@@ s are based on each other . &quot;
and in the ascent of Asia is E @-@ Sport already part of the official program .
but is it all about the right sport ?
for many is the idea for sure .
also Ingo F@@ rob@@ ous has long been dealing with the question .
&quot; for the professor at the German Sp@@ orth@@ och@@ schule in Cologne is E @-@ Sport , because it is compet@@ ently and many biological and physical reactions which one can also find in classic sport - for example increased heart rate , hormon@@ al actions , hormon@@ al changes . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it needed cognitive skills , a technical and tact@@ ical understanding and quick respon@@ si@@ veness . &quot;
&quot; professional gam@@ ers should not only be on the console , but also their bodies and pay attention to nutrition . &quot;
&quot; the fit player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; however , F@@ rob@@ ous looks also problems : &quot; d@@ oping is becoming more and more a subject . &quot;
controls are difficult to run in online games and in the scene lack@@ ed the structures of the classic sport .
&quot; positive , the scientists emphas@@ izes the high integ@@ rative effect of the E @-@ Sports . &quot;
&quot; players are internationally on the road , which is like a big global family , there are no intercultural shirts . &quot;
a study of business advice Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association of Inter@@ active entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) tells the E @-@ Sport for rapid growth ahead .
&quot; to be implemented in Germany 50 million euros in Germany , mainly about advertising , sponsor@@ ing and major tournaments . &quot;
in three years the turnover of 130 million should lie .
against the barely 2.4 billion euros in the Bundes@@ l@@ iga is that little .
&quot; however , the E @-@ Sport &quot; is no longer far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice @-@ h@@ ockey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte consultants . &quot;
international are many countries already .
great markets are Asia and the USA where ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodr@@ igu@@ ez on US Team NR@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Asht@@ on Kut@@ cher is investing in e@@ Sport @-@ competitions Un@@ ik@@ r@@ n .
also in Europe doing a lot .
&quot; in an Norwegian school , E @-@ Sport has been introduced as a lesson , says F@@ rob@@ ous . &quot;
in the Netherlands and in France the football @-@ first@@ l@@ iga associations according to Dut@@ t are now obliged to set up an e @-@ sport department .
&quot; in European comparison , Germany said V@@ f@@ B @-@ Board R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; only in nost@@ algia to fall , and the old times may be clar@@ ified , today is no longer sufficient . &quot;
&quot; it is about to preserve the tradition of the association , but the company at the same time are at the same time in the modern market . &quot;
&quot; we live in a digit@@ ised world , &quot; says Dut@@ y . &quot;
&quot; there you can not remember it , that only when football is everything there remains , as it always was . &quot;

&quot; Michelle Carter because of the texts , Conrad Roy for su@@ icide . &quot;
a woman from Massachusetts has been condemned to two and a half years because she has encouraged her friend to su@@ icide .
&quot; Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of their condem@@ nation behind bars and five years ago . &quot;
&quot; Carter was condemned in June due to negl@@ igent killing of Conrad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 . &quot;
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is un@@ spoiled .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to stay free up to the appeal .
she had been confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years but their legal representatives argu@@ ed that both them and Mr Roy has suffered from a psych@@ ic disease .
&quot; in red p@@ ants and a cream @-@ coloured bl@@ use d@@ ressed , Carter da with tears in the eyes , with folded hands and down@@ wards eyes as she was condemned . &quot;
&quot; their actions have taken Conrad Roy , &quot; &quot; said the pro@@ secut@@ ors in the court . &quot;
she ended his life to make her own better .
&quot; it has no responsibility taken over , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it has no re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
&quot; but Car@@ ters attor@@ ney said , it was a &quot; aw@@ ful change , which they completely de@@ pl@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; however , judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said , but he did not know that their &quot; age or matur@@ ity or even their spiritual disease have a significant impact on their actions . &quot;
&quot; a pro@@ secut@@ or read a statement by Ro@@ ys mother Lyn@@ n Roy , that had said that there is no day at which I would not smoke the loss of my beloved Son . &quot;
&quot; I would like that he is proud of me , and how I go with everything . I try , despite all of my pain , which we will be for eternity with us for his sisters , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ ys S@@ ister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she will be pursued by the knowledge &quot; that she will never be able to participate in the wedding of their brother , or will be an a@@ unt for his children . &quot;
&quot; no more that only person have been together with whom I was together for my birth every day , is a pain that I will always keep in my life for the rest of my life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ence , since there is no law in Massachusetts , that makes it a crime to demand a different gen@@ ocide . &quot;
Carter was 17 years old when Roy has found dead from a carbohydr@@ ate oxid@@ ation in a vehicle .
&quot; the case laid national attention on , after car@@ ving texture , that she had encouraged him to end his life . &quot;
&quot; hanging you on , spring of a building , get yourself , I know not , there are many ways , &quot; she said in several news that she had sent them in the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family . &quot;
&quot; in the moments before his su@@ icide , she wrote : &quot; you must do it , Conrad &quot; and &quot; Every@@ thing you have to do is to turn the generator , and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter draws attention through the death of Roy and ord@@ ained that they should benefit from any press by the case .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
&quot; among the few , the Carter def@@ ended , was sent@@ enced to Am@@ anda Knox , which was sent@@ enced in Italy because of Mor@@ a by her British fellow @-@ ro@@ omm@@ ate in Italy before it was acqu@@ itted two years ago . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Knox , 30 years old , published in the Los Angeles Times a comment : &quot; Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua K@@ imm@@ ich : learn from the new Mini @-@ L@@ ah@@ m of FC Bayern
Joshua K@@ imm@@ ich was allowed during Audi Cup as captain . is no co@@ incidence .
the FC Bavaria tr@@ aut the Con@@ fed Cup winner has a large season to - extra @-@ motivation .
&quot; what was different in his place in the cabin , that looked Joshua K@@ imm@@ ich immediately , even if the additional gar@@ ment was very small , very small . &quot;
&quot; but since far and wide on the second day of Audi C@@ ups of course no Philipp L@@ ah@@ m , and also no Manuel Neu@@ er , he made himself turn to him . &quot;
&quot; the coach has not announced it , &quot; &quot; told the Con@@ fed Cup winner after his first use as Bavaria @-@ captain . &quot;
&quot; good , the beginn@@ er could have better run than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples . &quot;
but the signs of the coach could also indicate that .
&quot; not the eight year older Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al was born in the youth of youth , de@@ pri@@ or@@ ant and straight out of the holiday professionals existing C @-@ El@@ f as a player leader , but he was . &quot;
sugar to be distributed in the most ador@@ able ones that one wants to keep a lot of thing in the mood .
&quot; so he was to compete for the heritage of L@@ ah@@ m , a small extra @-@ motivation can only use a good extra @-@ motivation . &quot;
&quot; K@@ imm@@ i confirmed : &quot; this is what you want to play as a player , responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday fl@@ itz@@ te of 22 @-@ year @-@ old as mini @-@ L@@ ah@@ m over the field .
&quot; on the right side , that is now his position , the white bin@@ ders on the arm did her evil . &quot;
&quot; and at all , K@@ imm@@ ich in this start@@ formation such as the one who can take the ruin for the best in the hand . &quot;
he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ disp@@ uted trou@@ pe . &quot;
he had the look for the whole while many others were busy themselves .
&quot; Vid@@ al thus , his lack of fitness to over@@ play ( kl@@ app@@ ings hardly ) ; Renato San@@ ches to get to the devil come out of the services of Asia @-@ journey ( kl@@ app@@ te also limited ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le not a negative effect in their first appearance in Bavaria @-@ Tri@@ k@@ ot . &quot;
this is all painted very well .
&quot; Sü@@ le went beside K@@ imm@@ ich , Rud@@ y before the defense , both ag@@ ented sou@@ ver@@ um . &quot;
&quot; the well @-@ occupied Napoli @-@ Sturm are often hard , also tried to succeed in playing a few times . &quot;
&quot; his colleague Rud@@ y gave it that the result was &quot; &quot; not as it was , how we hop@@ ed that . &quot;
&quot; however , he showed a decent performance at the debut . &quot;
&quot; gam@@ bling , Temp@@ ow@@ ech@@ sel : &quot; for this style I was also fet@@ ched . &quot;
&quot; as usual this Bavaria world still has for re @-@ turn , you saw the connection to the party . &quot;
&quot; Rud@@ y for example was not one or two , but determined six or seven interviews . &quot;
K@@ imm@@ ick adopted a few kn@@ ives in the back of his new fellow players .
&quot; there he heard an interesting proposition : &quot; &quot; what happened here , I have already been doing now . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , you just have to win any game . &quot;
&quot; after all , this does not have to pass over the New Testament . &quot;

company pleased with rh@@ en@@ land @-@ care ministers : economy lob@@ t Wiss@@ ings pace
&quot; it was often un@@ question@@ able , the relationship between the land and the regional economy , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) is still in the audit@@ orium of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palatinate . &quot;
&quot; this shows itself after more than one year , in which the new economic sm@@ ister Volker Wiss@@ ing ( F@@ DP ) is in office . &quot;
chambers and companies from the region speak on T V @-@ request of a change in economic policy - and impeccable at the same time the old minist@@ ries .
&quot; Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer companies ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wiss@@ ing attacks the wishes of the economy to block the Lem@@ ke &apos;s Office . &quot;
the biggest K@@ ehr@@ t@@ wende looks Nat@@ us in the infrastructure policy : the complete closure of the highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is at the pri@@ or@@ it@@ ional list of the country now completely .
&quot; even this year the ministry was hop@@ ed to a planning process , until 2021 should stand right . &quot;
a role in the plans of the country also plays the west side of Trier who is in the cau@@ ti@@ ous need of the federal state plan .
&quot; be it to take the route in December 2020 , says Minist@@ eri@@ or Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ us looks to a sign@@ post to support regional , but internationally consistent companies . &quot;

&quot; in addition , you have to learn an open ear for people who want to create their own company pra@@ ising the I@@ HK . &quot;

the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
&quot; with the planned road construction are quickly facts going to create , at the same time it lack@@ ed the country on the necessary staff , says Jan Glock@@ auer , main business leader of the I@@ HK Trier . &quot;
&quot; from 56 new engineers , to adjust the knowledge of the country &apos;s mobility , so far only 29 places are occupied . &quot;
the I@@ HK asks for more orders to external offices .

Audi should change 85@@ 0,000 Diesel vehicles - aut@@ oh@@ er@@ ers are faced with a counter @-@ reaction
&quot; one day before the announcement of Audi said BMW , that I would offer to update the software in more than 35@@ 0,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the BMW leader said , the company is the opinion that &quot; there are intelligent options as a driver , and moved to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - diesel vehicles to offer or re@@ strict . &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes @-@ vehicles in Europe to reduce his diesel emissions .
none of the companies describe business as a recall .
European automotive manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon di@@ oxide emissions .
&quot; but the nit@@ rogen Ox@@ ides , the diesel engines are regarded as car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ s and can cause as@@ thma . &quot;
&quot; the cost of the automotive manufacturers , plants to the neutr@@ alization of the diesel vehicles to install out@@ down de@@ g@@ ase , also take what it makes it difficult to maintain the price of the cars . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel will also charged the powerful car fir@@ ing and ignore the signs of the problem .
&quot; the companies try to avoid the errors of Volkswagen to prevent the use of so @-@ mentioned de@@ preci@@ ation devices to regul@@ ate the emissions when a car was tested , but by normal driving conditions . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , several employees were charged by Volkswagen , others will be investigated on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
last month the former leader of Ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in Germany in the motor development of Ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics in Germany .
&quot; the former manager , Zac@@ che@@ o Giovanni Pam@@ io , is Ital@@ ians and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be put on trial in the United States . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi has been included in German criminal exp@@ editions in Volkswagen after the authorities have been installed Audi to handle the emissions regulations in Europe and a request that was concentrated on the United States . &quot;
the inclusion of Audi into the investigation could be Volkswagen hard @-@ bit : the luxury car manufacturers are proportional to the profit of Volkswagen .

Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ ol@@ l@@ enn@@ es and the laughter against suffering
&quot; Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was designed to be one of the best @-@ released Cart@@ oon , the cel@@ ol@@ l@@ enn@@ es of his characters are trademarks . &quot;
also with 85 the Argentin@@ ian is still a film and works on a film .
&quot; his message : laughter , &quot; &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was born on 4 August 1932 as son of Spanish in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist he suggested himself as a sign of luck cards by - which makes it frustr@@ ated .
&quot; the happ@@ iest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he once said . &quot;
&quot; after stations in Lima , New York and Paris succeeded at the end of the 1960 &apos;s breakthrough : with the release of his cart@@ oons in &quot; Paris Match &quot; and then in the &quot; star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot;
even in China I found Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o many fans .
again and again the artists inspired by cities .
&quot; big , rounded mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o figures in drawings with the sh@@ aded tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow . &quot;
&quot; in the early morning he is dedicated to their own data , even today on the drawing , works almost ten hours every day . &quot;
&quot; calendar , puzzles , books for Gross and Klein , T @-@ Shirts , Pl@@ ush @-@ animals and watches find his dro@@ ll figures still much diss@@ em@@ ination worldwide . &quot;
&quot; for six years , he has also working on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters . &quot;
&quot; the main person in the film &quot; &quot; Crazy Island &quot; &quot; is a gir@@ affe - Mor@@ dil@@ less popular animal in his drawings - who has a thousand @-@ feet as counter@@ player . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D movie , the 2019 should be on the chin wall . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they are saying , it is strange for me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o . &quot;
the screen@@ play is not written by him .
&quot; therefore , he is more focused on the TV series , which is produced as its original design@@ ations . &quot;
lav@@ ender from Provence threatened by climate change
&quot; it has become a symbol of Provence in the south of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change . &quot;
&quot; the lav@@ ender is caused because of the d@@ rought rem@@ inding conditions and because of the diseases transferred to insects , which scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions to find great head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , expert on the agricultural Department of CRI@@ EP@@ P@@ AM in Provence , said : &quot; the lav@@ ender in Provence is effectively endanger@@ ed because the plant was exposed to the impact of climate change , which has brought much less rain in the spring and autumn a lot more . &quot;
this has effects on the life span of lav@@ ender .
&quot; there is also a small tick , a mic@@ rob@@ atic , the d@@ warf delicate , and in very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is a lot on the game .
lav@@ ender oil l@@ ends not only for vac@@ ation@@ ers but is also very wonder@@ ed for perf@@ umes and cosmetics .
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; &quot; instead of very long p@@ ushing with a large number of flowers we have smaller , UN@@ TER@@ EN@@ TW@@ IC@@ K@@ EL@@ TE and either missing or weak@@ ened . &quot;
&quot; so , we have less parts with e@@ ther@@ ic oil . &quot;
&quot; among the solutions that are considered to be considered , a better water distribution and the sl@@ owing of the dar@@ ken@@ ing of the ground , but also the b@@ acking of plants with a protective mixture of sound and water and the development of varieties that are resistant to dry . &quot;

ass@@ ass@@ ination of a journalist emphas@@ ises the growing threat in Mexico
&quot; the employees of the Weekly Rio@@ do@@ ce , usually meet with tw@@ il@@ in order to review their plans for reporting the recent chaos in the state Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , cor@@ rupt and un@@ ce@@ able drug war . &quot;
&quot; but on this day , in the shadow of her own tragedy , they came together to talk about security . &quot;
it was commun@@ icated to them that it is important to change their routines .
&quot; two high @-@ level journalists discuss what is more secure : they are supposed to take their children with the office , the 2009 goal of an attack with gran@@ ules were , or they were at home . &quot;
security forces have three words written on a plate on the front of the room : opponent , Neut@@ ral , allies . &quot;
&quot; they ask the re@@ porter , names for each column - no proof is necessary , per@@ cept@@ ions and panc@@ akes . &quot;
&quot; there are addi@@ cts , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are sus@@ pic@@ ious , on the hearing @-@ list of the government or cart@@ elle , a catalog of crimin@@ als to make the chaos of Mexico dangerous . &quot;
&quot; there is no rest period of violence , and while throughout the land there are more journalists : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena Nie@@ to in December 2012 will be up to attacks and threats under Bundes@@ schutz , and until now there was at least seven dead in seven states . &quot;
among the latter there is their editors and its inspir@@ ations of Rio@@ do@@ ce , the co @-@ founder Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and journalist , &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence associated with drugs . &quot;
&quot; its absence will be deeply felt , although its presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Val@@ dez , which shows his mid @-@ finger with the word &quot; Justice &quot; &quot; on the faç@@ ade of the Rio@@ do@@ ce building . two re@@ porters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Miriam Ram@@ i@@ rez , wear T @-@ shirts that will show his smiling face with glasses or its typical pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut . &quot;
&quot; the workshop will take place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ porters discuss their shared topics , trau@@ ma , their night@@ mar@@ es , ins@@ om@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although 2010 has been established a probe @-@ law firm in order to process the cases of journalists , this according to the Committee for the protection of journalists only have been introduced to the protection of journalists . &quot;
&quot; as with most thousands of Mor@@ den , which are connected every year with drug trading and organised crime , the mur@@ derer of journalists are rarely question@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; at Rio@@ do@@ ce , they are still ins@@ ist to treat the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , even though they are un@@ even east and although the terrain is still ob@@ li@@ que . &quot;
&quot; without information on the k@@ iller , without justice , the meeting regarding the discussion of the safety little benefits , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it is very du@@ mm to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; says he . &quot;
&quot; as long as we do not know the Why , we don &apos;t know all . &quot;
in the morning of May 15 Val@@ dez is the office of the newspaper Rio@@ do@@ ce office in the capital of Cul@@ i@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; he made it only to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla from two men was stopped . he was shot out of his car and 12 times he was shot down , presum@@ ably because of the name of the paper - which is translated with &quot; &quot; Zw@@ öl@@ f@@ ter River &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the scrap@@ er went away in his car and defe@@ ated it in the vicinity .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adults .
rum@@ ors tend to fly in Cul@@ i@@ ac@@ an .
but on the topic Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ mans re@@ port@@ ability last year and delivery to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the blo@@ ody slau@@ gh@@ ter@@ ies of the country , since ri@@ val@@ ing groups have been strug@@ gling to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it is nothing that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or more people are shot at the street or that the cemetery is full of dist@@ orted , two @-@ sto@@ rey m@@ ol@@ een for drug addi@@ cts , which are larger than many houses for the living . &quot;
&quot; forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; peace &quot; , &quot; if only a Kart@@ ell has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs @-@ merchan@@ dise in the United States . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ que@@ z ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Rio@@ do@@ ce , with the gu@@ ilt that he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings have contributed to the murder .
&quot; first , in February the publication of an interview with Damascus Lop@@ ez , one leaders of one of the riv@@ alled Kart@@ ell@@ ings in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans sons . &quot;
&quot; this publication likes the sons of angry , suspe@@ cted women , any copy of the issue on as soon as it was delivered to Zeit@@ ungs@@ k@@ ios@@ k . &quot;
&quot; the second error was to force Val@@ dez , after the conf@@ isc@@ ation of a different newspaper , which had published the same history , leaving the country to his own security . &quot;
Val@@ dez has been a legend in Mexico and abroad and his killing is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists .
he had so long survived that his friends and colleagues felt that he would always be there .
&quot; he worked in 2003 as experienced re@@ porter for Nor@@ o@@ este , when he joined together with five colleagues in the founding of Rio@@ do@@ ce and 50 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism to encounter without the pre@@ d@@ ow@@ ry problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ que@@ z . &quot;
&quot; with the time the newspaper earned a reputation because of cour@@ ageous and honest coverage , and sales and advertising . &quot;
&quot; re@@ porters loved it , hard pass@@ able investigations without fear of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else could treat . &quot;
eight years after the creation of Rio@@ do@@ ce she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot @-@ Prize &quot; for its coverage in Latin America .
&quot; in the same year Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the protection of journalists in the persecution of Mexican drugs , where always it led . &quot;
he gave voluntary to that he was afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to continue , &quot; &quot; he said to the time of CP@@ J . &quot;
&quot; drug trading in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ v@@ ien@@ to @-@ TV . &quot;
you will need to take the task to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b .
&quot; I do not want to be asked , &quot; &quot; What did you do in the face of so many dead ... why did you not tell what went before ? &quot;
&quot; the Rio@@ do@@ ce team mixed by Val@@ dez , the Sp@@ a@@ ß@@ vogel , which was like a d@@ ock@@ workers , the friend , the generous with h@@ ugs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive . &quot;
you trust in his routine .
he always would bear his hat .
&quot; he would always go to El Guay@@ abo , the bar facing the office , go and sit there at the same table . &quot;
&quot; well , ask them : was his love for the routine of his inheritance ? &quot;
&quot; his death also has forced to ask her to question their own assum@@ ptions about it , as they can do their work best and remain in life . &quot;
&quot; they do not like you to move with their wives , their children , their clean@@ est shops , their home@@ y and run@@ ways &quot; to move drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ que@@ z . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ catering and self @-@ preservation . &quot;
his own instin@@ cts trust .
&quot; when it smells wrong , stay away from it . &quot;
&quot; anger is , the editor of the Rio@@ do@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real , that &quot; smell a sense that can be del@@ usion ... and then the thing is happening with Javier . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer in Sin@@ alo@@ a no longer - just as not as in Tam@@ au@@ li@@ pas , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero , gu@@ err@@ ero , gu@@ err@@ ero , weak institutions and cor@@ rupt government officials . &quot;
the landscape is changing constantly .
&quot; in the room , in which the employees from Rio@@ do@@ ce to the Security Council , there were suddenly no phones allowed . days before , Spy@@ ware , who is sold solely to governments , for monitoring journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
&quot; outside two polic@@ emen , protection against the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree . &quot;
they were commissioned by the provin@@ cial government to protect the offices of Rio@@ do@@ ce in a four @-@ story building in a mid @-@ class area of Cul@@ i@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; half in the Scher@@ z , some of the re@@ porters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of polic@@ emen , which is the govern@@ or itself as not trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; it is months ago , since the re@@ porter went into the mountains , where the drugs de fac@@ to are under control . &quot;
for the issue of this week Rio@@ do@@ ce has turned out to three main stories .
there was the ass@@ ass@@ ination of the former known Box@@ ers Jul@@ io Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
&quot; they also had an ex@@ pos@@ é among the citiz@@ enship , which focused on the h@@ omet@@ own of the Govern@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; and there was a group , which led in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cul@@ i@@ ac@@ an , a block away from the office of the State &apos;s old town . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who kid@@ nap@@ ped or how it came to pass , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favourite local from drug trucks and authorities . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ porter learned from public records , that the restaurant was registered under the name of a polit@@ ician who ruled the govern@@ ors of the Party Party ( Pr@@ i ) which domin@@ ate almost the whole century all political levels . &quot;
recently several pr@@ i govern@@ ors were acc@@ used due to high @-@ class cases of corruption .
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real bat the re@@ porter , about previous inc@@ idents in this local to write , including one , in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escap@@ ed to a military inc@@ ident . &quot;
only a few months before the reader would have seen the Kolum@@ ne of Val@@ dez as the most informed source of the kid@@ n@@ apping .
&quot; earlier we had already knew what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nickname &quot; &quot; El FLACO &quot; &quot; because of its slender body stat@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; now , all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
&quot; the office of Val@@ dez has been dedicated to storage space for signs and stick@@ ers who have been devoted to the murder of journalists , because the employees have become something that they had never expected , activists on behalf of the press . &quot;
Re@@ porter Miriam Ram@@ i@@ rez schn@@ app@@ ed a few signs and went to a demonstration in the next morning because of another journalist to the office of the state .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez was killed in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; a burnt body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests that it is . &quot;
&quot; throughout the country , journalists have turned out to be t@@ oug@@ her in organised protests &quot; SO@@ S Press &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on this day , the director of Bo@@ j@@ or@@ que@@ z is taken away in Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the case Val@@ dez . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with the govern@@ or of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the ass@@ ass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez the authorities to bring journalists , and bring them to them because they have said the truth . &quot;
&quot; she has since then asked that she is divided by the government again , because it is concerned that their anger has been viol@@ ated their obje@@ ctivity . &quot;
Val@@ dez had repeated that journalists in Mexico from organised crime to involved in the government agencies and an equal company . &quot;
&quot; in his last book &quot; &quot; Nar@@ co Journ@@ alism &quot; , &quot; he wrote that re@@ porter are not only killed by drugs , but also on the command of politicians and security forces that organised with organised crime under a ceiling . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Art@@ icul@@ o 19 &quot; &quot; Art@@ icul@@ o 19 &quot; &quot; has been assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials in the past year . &quot;
&quot; in Mexico you are afraid , because they would like you di@@ spro@@ port@@ y the mouth , &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot;
obviously the murder have a det@@ err@@ ent effect .
nobody for@@ getting the death of the blog@@ ger@@ in Maria Elizabeth Mac@@ ias in the northern bound@@ ary state of Tam@@ au@@ li@@ pas six years ago .
&quot; your body was found along with a note that was said to be signed by Z@@ et@@ as @-@ Kart@@ ell , &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer sam@@ pling and head@@ sets lay in addition to their separated head .
&quot; some branches have chosen to close , like the newspaper El Norte , in the northern bound@@ ary state of Ch@@ ih@@ u@@ ah@@ ua after the ass@@ ass@@ ination of the correspond@@ ent Mi@@ ro@@ sl@@ ava Bre@@ ach in March . &quot;
others continue to do as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after the ass@@ ass@@ ination of her director in 2004 .
&quot; in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ arez took public to the drug card with a Editorial on the title page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists are from their homeland or even fl@@ own from the country .
it is a pain decision .
&quot; it is hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and look for dangers . &quot;
&quot; and sometimes they are ge@@ ared , as it seems to be mur@@ dered to the photographer of Reu@@ in@@ osa , the 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico @-@ city three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot;
&quot; for those who continue to stay and continue , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions . &quot;
I@@ bar@@ ra who once wanted to be po@@ ets there is that the drug trading carries it over .
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and therefore I became re@@ porter , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was finished , the re@@ porters of Rio@@ do@@ ce was on the pav@@ ement in front of the office and d@@ rank beer , than once all their tele@@ phones started . &quot;
a series of sho@@ ot@@ ings with tap@@ e@@ riv@@ als and security forces in the vicinity of the bath@@ es Maz@@ at@@ lan had left its dead .
the war escal@@ ated on how it was promised by a series of Kart@@ ell messages in the region .
from the Bord@@ stein@@ k@@ ante they have published the news on the website of Rio@@ do@@ ce on mobile phone .
the title page had to be changed on the next day .
Sir@@ ens he@@ ul@@ ens close to - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ que@@ z draws a look at the polic@@ emen who have stopped to see if they were in willingness .
if they were afraid that they did not show it .
&quot; under the huge portrait of the fallen fo@@ unders of the newspaper , whose mid@@ finger was visible to all Sin@@ alo@@ a , followed the staff of Rio@@ do@@ ce his tracks . &quot;
&quot; how can you only think about it , &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ que@@ z , &quot; &quot; if at the same day , the practition@@ er was mur@@ dered to send it to the coverage on the street . &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age to diver@@ si@@ fy its enemies .
at first sight it looks like a statue , though a terrif@@ ying . &quot;
&quot; now , researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible Nash@@ or@@ ns of a Canadian mountain work were so well preserved that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; it was so well preserved that they could even find that his sc@@ up@@ y skin of red@@ dish Braun was - and they said , she would have had something from a &quot; &quot; tranquil past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report in the magazine &quot; Current Biology &quot; presents him as &quot; the best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs that has ever been found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs copies of the world . &quot;
the Fos@@ sil is a newly discovered kind of N@@ od@@ osau@@ rs which lived in the middle of the Cre@@ t@@ ac@@ eous period before between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
&quot; his incredibly good preserved state has researcher who described it as &quot; &quot; really remarkable &quot; , &quot; f@@ ade &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic is the pan@@ zer@@ te species fres@@ ser the best preserved Fos@@ sil of its kind .
&quot; Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k was found in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; he met something that seemed to see from the surrounding cliffs at the Plat@@ ze , and decided to see more accurately . &quot;
that of him discovered Fos@@ sil was sent to the Royal Tyr@@ rell Museum of Pale@@ ontology .
&quot; they spent the next six years ago , the wild animal within the 2,@@ 500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy pe@@ ppers . &quot;
after all this hard work the finished product is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you only have a little bit with the eyes bl@@ inking , you could almost believe that it &apos;s slept , &quot; &quot; said the Haupt@@ aut@@ or Cal@@ eb Brown , scientists in the Royal Tyr@@ rell Museum , where the cre@@ ature is to be seen . &quot;
&quot; it will enter into the scientific history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs copies , the Mon@@ a Lisa of the Dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; researchers have found that this plant e@@ aters , though he is covered with a arm@@ or and a wall@@ ed tanks is similar , probably by meat e@@ ager din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; the strong ge@@ ar@@ mo@@ red din@@ osau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age , in order to hide pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a sh@@ iel@@ ding technology that is used as counter@@ part , which is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this would have allowed to mix better in its environment and to diver@@ si@@ fy its enemies , say experts , which suggests that it was threatened by major din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
the 110 million years old cre@@ ature from the family of the N@@ od@@ osau@@ rs has made his first head@@ lines in May and is now at the Royal Tyr@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ontology .
&quot; researchers have now studied the wild animal and it marked the wild animal and is called Bo@@ realistic Mark Mitchell , one of a team who has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours with it carefully . &quot;
the amazing maintenance of the specimen allowed it to document Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the patterns and the form of sc@@ ales and arm@@ ours via his body .
&quot; they discovered the con@@ ter@@ sh@@ ady , a common defence method in the animal world , which means the top of the cre@@ ature dar@@ ker than its under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the con@@ voy is common , the results are surprising , since the size of Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta is far beyond that of the living animals . &quot;
it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ rs of enough pressure due to meat we@@ ighted din@@ osau@@ rs that the evolution was fav@@ oured the confrontation of confrontation as a means of survival .
&quot; but most contemporary animals that use the contem@@ por@@ ter@@ ation - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or belt animals - are much smaller and vulner@@ able as lo@@ ot , which was sign@@ alized that this N@@ od@@ osau@@ rs was exposed to a real struggle for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong carn@@ iv@@ ore behavior based on a massive , strongly geological din@@ osau@@ rs how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs @-@ carn@@ iv@@ ores have been to have been &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their sc@@ ales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ rs .
&quot; scientists continue to investigate the animal on references about his life , including his conservative , Dar@@ min@@ hal@@ tes to find out what it has eaten as his last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs when he died , into a river , and pushed into the sea where he s@@ ank on the back to the sea . &quot;
&quot; at that time Alberta was as warm as southern flor@@ ida today , and rivers and oceans probably much more widespread than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this N@@ od@@ osau@@ rs is really remarkable , because it is fully covered with preserv@@ ated skin , but also in three dimensions remains and the original form of animal . &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the result is that the animal is almost as exactly as in the early Cre@@ t@@ ac@@ eous period .
&quot; you do not need to use a lot of imagination to re@@ construct it . if you just want a little bit with the eyes , you could almost believe that he is at bed@@ time . &quot;
&quot; the Cre@@ t@@ ac@@ eous period was a time when giant Ther@@ opo@@ da , carn@@ iv@@ ore Dinosau@@ rs who stood on two legs , the earth had gone through . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them , the ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , millions of years after Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mo@@ red din@@ osau@@ rs was pushed by some of its fur@@ ious ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this belongs to Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 11.@@ 5 m ) long , six tons of heavy mon@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; the scientists , their latest findings in the journal Current Biology will believe that Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta was reconc@@ iled after death in the sea and in the mud . &quot;
&quot; the cre@@ ature was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k , when he was in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum it is the best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely surrounded by mu@@ zzle to h@@ ips . &quot;
the creatures were average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and have grown up to 3.000 pounds ( 1.@@ 300 kg ) .
&quot; it included two 20 @-@ inch @-@ long peaks , supported by his shoulders . &quot;
researchers believe that the pan@@ zer@@ te species of fres@@ ser was curved through the Western Canada until a flo@@ od@@ ed river it fl@@ ut@@ tered into the open sea .
&quot; however , the underwater funeral of the din@@ osau@@ r kept its arm@@ or in exquisite . detail . &quot;
&quot; the remains of this particular specimen , are so well preserved that the Hau@@ tre@@ ste are still stock@@ ed along the din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
like Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko written for National Ge@@ ographic is such a level of preservation as &quot; rarely as a win in the lotto numbers .
&quot; the more I remember , the conf@@ use it gets . &quot;
hidden out of the skin still cover the hol@@ low tank plates that carry the sk@@ ull of the animal .
&quot; his right foot @-@ foot lies on his side , and his five fingers are up to the top . &quot;
I can count the shed on his sole .
in the th@@ under@@ storm : mass ar@@ amb@@ ol@@ age on A8 : a lot of den@@ ers
demol@@ ished accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass @-@ ar@@ amb@@ ol@@ age .
&quot; there are numerous promises , kilomet@@ re @-@ long St@@ aus - and G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
on the highway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A8 ) in the afternoon afternoon at a mass @-@ ar@@ amb@@ ol@@ age had been viol@@ ated for about 20 people .
&quot; after the first information on the police were at 5 p.m. between the connections Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a swe@@ ating nearly 30 cars , including trucks . &quot;
&quot; above , the exact number of recent items were not at first no information . &quot;
&quot; it is easy to medium to medium @-@ heavy inj@@ uries , &quot; said a police authorities . &quot;
a big b@@ aking up to rescue vehicles was at the accident .
the A8 was completely locked in the direction of Munich .
&quot; in Fahr@@ enheit , Munich is a few kilometres long ago . &quot;
&quot; as an AZ @-@ re@@ porter reports , it also came on the counter @-@ car to massive disabilities - by numerous g@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; the fire fighting the characteristics of the vehicle , which now have to count with delicate pen@@ al@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; shortly after 18 : 45 am the second accident occurred on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot;
there was a coll@@ ision between an aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ spor@@ ter and a car .
a rescue @-@ driver was on the way to the accident .
Deutsche Bahn : Group test@@ et &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced once : nothing is sitting on the train and sle@@ eps .
or you are dee@@ pen@@ ed in his work and has just an ingen@@ ious thoughts .
and then : pu@@ ff@@ f .
comes from Schaff@@ ner and ar@@ ouses an in@@ active or rip the chassis out of the workflow .
zack7.com / index.php ? ID _ lang = 1
but the times of inter@@ ru@@ ptions are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn test@@ et currently the creator @-@ card control .
it is simply confirmed by mobile phone that you have taken place and analys@@ ed the ticket .
&quot; currently , a test run on two routes . &quot;
&quot; comes the offer , we expand it out . &quot;
&quot; it is then expected to be available in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; said a rail speaker . &quot;
&quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; calls the train to the train station without Schaff@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; to use the use , however , you need to be met some requirements : you need a smartphone or tablet . &quot;
and you have to booked an online ticket - what is already doing most passengers already .
&quot; you have to also bought it on the app of railway , the DB Navigator , which is the most comfortable type of ticket booking . &quot;
and finally you need a seating area .
&quot; for the &quot; &quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; works so : you rises in the train , calls his ticket under &quot; My Tickets . &quot; &quot;
the test customers will then appear a button to electronic discharge .
the train cou@@ riers get on their mobile devices a message that chassis X is located on the train and the booked seat .
&quot; if the train cou@@ riers comes at the chassis control to place Y , he knows that there is a passenger with already made @-@ made online ticket . &quot;
&quot; so , one can continue to sleep , further silent . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should be able to act . &quot;
&quot; those who are relaxed without a ticket control by our access staff , check in the DB navig@@ ator just yourself . &quot;
&quot; this enables the guests to shape their travel time in the train personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing @-@ Board of DB . &quot;
&quot; second Plus : &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today , to address the individual customer needs . &quot;
&quot; who often drives the train , knows that apart from late @-@ del@@ ays and missed the timet@@ ables are among the greatest nu@@ is@@ ions belong to the greatest trou@@ bles . &quot;
&quot; for often , one does not have any documents in any case , but one of the fellow travellers do not need any documents that you need to de@@ valu@@ ation of online tickets . &quot;
either the credit card or the recru@@ it@@ ment or otherwise a document must be wise .
&quot; the result are endless discussions between train cou@@ riers and chassis , which leads to poor mood in the part of or scale and del@@ ays in control of your own tickets and take the Schaff@@ ner at the end the time takes care of any other concern . &quot;
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and this also applies only to the connections ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE .
further access numbers on the same route have not yet been released .
how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
the 9th of August 2014 Brittany Fer@@ rell was sh@@ aken up to their core .
&quot; just one day after they had arrived in New York City , that sat in St. Louis born on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b flat that they rented and sc@@ rolling through Facebook on their phone . &quot;
she st@@ um@@ bled upon a post by someone from High School .
&quot; the police just killed a 18 year @-@ year child , and it is still on the road , it was there . &quot;
&quot; confused , because no one had posted on their Feed the information , it closed Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot;
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly saved on their tim@@ eline .
&quot; Rap@@ per from the area of St. Louis was thereby the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white polic@@ emen in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , Mo . , was killed live . &quot;
he posted a picture of brow@@ n@@ le@@ bl@@ os@@ em body that was stretched on the road and stay there four hours .
&quot; this is wild , I thought fer@@ rell . &quot;
but death was for them and their community has nothing new .
she put her cell phone in order to return later in the evening to twe@@ et over people on the Can@@ field Drive .
&quot; there were photos of the police and people , the scre@@ amed , and by a man who claimed to be brow@@ ns father , who made a sign with the inscription : &quot; Fer@@ g@@ us@@ ons Police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
they observed a live feedback with which a polic@@ eman in front of a group of prot@@ esters with a bar@@ king dog stood .
&quot; in another video , she said , received a different polic@@ eman , and cried : &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill . &quot;
&quot; this is not common , &quot; rem@@ inded Fer@@ rell to their statement . &quot;
that is not the kind of murder that we have acc@@ ustom@@ ed to us and which we can only call .
at that moment I felt Sch@@ üt@@ tel .
I was angry and we@@ pt .
she booked a return trip and went to the next day at home .
&quot; after landing at 23 o &apos;clock she brought her 6 @-@ year old daughter from the house of her father , and decided that the two left the next morning to Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on . &quot;
&quot; what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , is the subject of a new documentary , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; , &quot; in the cinema starting from the 11 . &quot;
&quot; it is a story of survival and protest , the love and loss of strength , the strength and the resistance , which is from the point of view of the people who live in the community and filled the streets to demand answers . &quot;
&quot; as a fer@@ rell with her daughter who carried out a cau@@ li@@ king and a suitable crown , after Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , the two a conversation that she had countless times before this morning &quot; over the black experience and the black condition . &quot;
&quot; you remember how I have taught you when black people have to fight for this , what they believe ? &quot; remember what she said . &quot;
we now go to Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on because the police has killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that was not correct .
&quot; I could not take her away , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell . &quot;
that which happened today is a highlight of its ... what happened in the past .
you have to know it and see it and being raised in it .
&quot; it must be well developed not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the different layers of the black experiences and the black constitution and what we have to do to free ourselves to free ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even if I have lucky to give her an experience , when they personally had no bo@@ at@@ ant rac@@ ism , she is no different from the next black women child . &quot;
&quot; I have the feeling , I would give her a bad service to hold them away . &quot;
&quot; the first stop when they arrived in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authorities , when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ accus@@ ation of officer Dar@@ ren Wilson wa@@ ited . &quot;
Fer@@ rell and daughter joined together with a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared bags and hal@@ ves them on prot@@ esters .
slowly started a new kind of activ@@ ism for fer@@ rell form .
&quot; my activ@@ ism has totally changed after 9 August , she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Miss@@ ouri @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student N@@ urs@@ es Association and was concentrated on food justice and health inequality in black communities . &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organis@@ ing .
it is all come . &quot;
weeks later I met Fer@@ rell during an evening demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an one of the co @-@ directors of the film .
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her Camer@@ am@@ ann Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ rar , wanted to be documented only &quot; &quot; documented &quot; , &quot; what happened . &quot;
&quot; a question came from Fer@@ rell in the meaning : &quot; &quot; do you want to document , or tries to find a story that you can explo@@ it ? &quot;
&quot; this sce@@ pt@@ icism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of men , often from wives - in a community that benef@@ ited from their pain and its resistance . &quot;
&quot; like Fol@@ ay@@ an recently declared : &quot; &quot; we heard that people who were born in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on and raised their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the field , who is known for his activ@@ ism rum by to@@ dest@@ ra@@ kt . &quot;
&quot; his commitment brought Fer@@ rell closer to the project , together with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; &quot; in the years following browsers . &quot;
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us . we speak , &quot; said Davis . &quot;
&quot; that was the main thing for me , as these people are represented , because I will be presented . &quot;
&quot; the goal was not to focus on Fer@@ rel@@ ls experience - to show that it is not about a Messi@@ ah guide , but about a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it proved to be the most important part of the film . &quot;
&quot; whose show documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Fer@@ rel@@ ls life , as she loves and mar@@ ry her wife . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rell and lau@@ g@@ hed when they saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
&quot; but I have understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work , and in the in@@ ception of black people . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Fer@@ rel@@ ls are repeated the role of black weak women in the wider Black @-@ L@@ ives movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three fo@@ unders of the movement , which are characterised by killing of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ by Martin in 2012 the film &quot; &quot; Black@@ li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; &quot; in social media . &quot;
&quot; black , g@@ ay women in leaders have borne the movement in total , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , g@@ ay women must carry the main last of all . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to notice that &quot; the movement is really kept up by black women and many black women .
&quot; however , it is clear that &quot; this is no affir@@ mat@@ ive type of action , &quot; in the he@@ rell because of their identity as the heart of the film was selected . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who sh@@ ook this energy , &quot; &quot; said them . &quot;
&quot; it is not a co@@ incidence , although she was in front of the front , because in a life at these cru@@ ises as a black , sw@@ il woman is so much on the game . &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile the news cameras in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on have long gone , but the rac@@ ial connections between the congregation and the police are still alive . &quot;
Fer@@ rell is for 2 ½ years because of the block@@ ing a highway on a demonstration .
&quot; it describes the soci@@ opolit@@ ical atmosphere of the area that they call her home : &quot; &quot; a m@@ ess . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , she sat down on a singing and she feels like going on this memory , since she went over three years ago in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on onto the road . &quot;
it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we have to love each other and assist .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV @-@ readers discuss bit gallery
the bit gallery moves the people even though it is not yet built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping center at the south of the pedestrian zone divi@@ des since the first presentation of 2009 the population in advoc@@ ates and opponents .
&quot; cold , the theme hardly leaves . &quot;
&quot; also on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg , &quot; the subject will be discussed . &quot;
&quot; while the one to the bit gallery say , &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; &quot; that would be real class &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; does not need man &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or quite simply : &quot; &quot; meg@@ ab@@ ahn ! &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) . &quot;
&quot; while the advoc@@ ates build that a gallery runs more customers to the city , of which the other businesses will benefit , fear the enemies that then stop the pedestrian zone . &quot;
&quot; added : the gallery will be planned precisely on the property , on which the peasant market is marked , in the 13 direct mark@@ eters of their products . &quot;
with the start of construction will be the conclusion .
the Gallery @-@ M@@ acher want to integrate a Mark@@ thal in the new building - and a place for a place to sit outside sitting .
&quot; Simone : &quot; &quot; we have been around for many years almost weekly in the peasant market for many years . &quot;
&quot; mostly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the land rejo@@ ice again very much . &quot;
even the but@@ cher we have discovered for us .
&quot; we would like to reserve that even during and especially after construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer . &quot;
in other cities there is also .
above all the small mark@@ ings in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ensing : &quot; whether direct mark@@ eters are based in a mark@@ ings in the gallery , comes to the height of the rent . &quot;
&quot; however , this is likely to be low in the new project but rather low . &quot;
&quot; Eva Kil@@ ic : &quot; &quot; what &apos;s shopping in Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
&quot; clothing , shoes , dro@@ pping or supermarkets : I find the super@@ flu@@ ous . &quot;
there is already enough in our city .
one looks like many stores here are empty - some for months and years .
&quot; but there is not even a decent weekly market , it is all the more important that us remains at least the market hall . &quot;
&quot; because after all , the goods are made fresh , mostly directly from the producer and is very inexpensive . &quot;
&quot; as you see , shop will be mixed in a shopping center only by larger companies , because the h@@ ort@@ ions are often not portable for a retail@@ er . &quot;
&quot; shame there is almost no longer and what still exists , then will probably disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping center with a market hall fits me not together .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
above all : where is the peasant mark@@ ings during the construction time ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even in duration when the bit gallery will actually come .
or it creates the Ges@@ pen@@ st bit gallery before , all the shops made from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Marqu@@ et : &quot; this is simply not going to work .
&quot; and a shopping center , which is empty , no one needs . &quot;
&quot; in my opinion , it would have been better to promote a real peasant market instead of this gallery . &quot;
but for a peasant market there is no place thanks to the w@@ ahn@@ sinn@@ ing many - as I find - meaning@@ less building projects in Bit@@ burg is no place anymore .
&quot; when the peasant market is building , a piece of culture will disappear . &quot;
a suitable simil@@ arity : artist creates portrait with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
&quot; in the middle of the room of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which are almost unlimited at the cables from the ceiling . &quot;
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Tup@@ oth@@ ills and Haar@@ lem which were sent by Chelsea M@@ anning .
&quot; p@@ anning sent the excer@@ pts from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former secret analy@@ st has made a 35 @-@ year @-@ old prison sentence , having publicly made public messages on the Wik@@ i@@ Le@@ aks website . &quot;
the new exhibition that was opened on 2 August the A Be@@ coming Re@@ quest@@ ance ( A suitable simil@@ arity ) .
&quot; it is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline has been converted into technology , computer science and art , and M@@ anning , a trans@@ former and pione@@ ering dis@@ sid@@ ents , whose condem@@ nation of Barack Obama was converted when he was only three days in his ministry . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been created by the algorithms , which was created by M@@ anning and created from the 30 portraits , such as someone can look with these genom@@ ic data - the many ways , as they can be interpreted and the har@@ dened determin@@ ism of these interpret@@ ations - but also to identity . &quot;
&quot; p@@ anning that was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but has already been talking about identification as a woman , was sent@@ enced to 20 accus@@ ations , including six cl@@ ashes against the sp@@ ion@@ ag@@ eg@@ es@@ etz , computer was and theft . &quot;
&quot; through the prison her picture was sup@@ pressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gr@@ assy , black @-@ white Sel@@ f@@ ie , in which M@@ anning is still sitting on a bicycle seat and a plat@@ in@@ blonde per@@ imeter has been associated with which it was associated with it . &quot;
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came straight from the great success of her 2012 @-@ project &apos;@@ Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions .
&quot; in it , the artist portraits of stran@@ gers from for@@ ensi@@ c art@@ e@@ facts such as cigar@@ ette envelop@@ e and che@@ wing g@@ um that extra@@ cting the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people might look . &quot;
&quot; this was the time , where she received an e @-@ mail from a timer . &quot;
&quot; they brought an interview with Chelsea M@@ anning while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press @-@ look at the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; and she could not visit this time and she could not be photograp@@ hed , that is why you wanted to make contact with Chelsea , and asked if they wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot;
the artist and its in@@ im@@ pris@@ ed mus@@ e have become invalid wall@@ ets that have several letters ex@@ changes over the course of two years .
&quot; they even don@@ ate one of Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o illustrated Com@@ ic &quot; Sup@@ pressed Images , &quot; which would predi@@ ct a future in which the President Chel@@ ation Jud@@ gment and it would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot;
&quot; that Obama actually was only a few days , after the book was published , Mann@@ ings release for seven brutal years in K@@ ansas , was a welcome kind of lucky meeting . &quot;
&quot; there is now also the opening of the exhibition somewhat deep and Star@@ kes , as Donald Tru@@ mp leads a war against inform@@ ants from the governmental camp and against trans@@ gender forces to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways that he should actually fix , continue to escape . &quot;
&quot; as De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg after the strange tim@@ ing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen from a particular reason . &quot;
&quot; in one on the wall of the gallery listed artistic statement called M@@ anning with its super@@ large signature below ( the &quot; i &quot; in their surname is provided with a heart . ) an end of the &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , whose basis of gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture have been . &quot;
on the opposite wall is its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a exchange rate of Cs and Gs and As , in pencil . &quot;
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hopes to show through the inclusion of 200 letters ( or nucle@@ ot@@ ides following the high @-@ developed scientific Lex@@ icon of the artist ) to show how amazing things we are all .
&quot; what people will hopefully take away is that our gen@@ ome does not take care of who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video @-@ Werk of 2007 , Sp@@ ur@@ ious Mem@@ ories . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so these are the 30 of these stories . &quot;
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in an own room , is a page from the above mentioned Com@@ ic Nov@@ elle . &quot;
it shows m@@ anning how they appear with a release @-@ ele@@ fon in the hand out of the discipl@@ in@@ tro of the United States such as King &apos;s Kong .
&quot; if she asked your speech , then they won &apos;t , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; so , never stop the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came straight out of a letter that she wrote me , &quot; &quot; said the artist who greet you from Philadelphia . &quot;
I am still go@@ os@@ eb@@ um@@ ps when I talk about it .
&quot; M@@ anning has not seen the exhibition is not personally seen - as it should be predi@@ cted in the Com@@ ic book - but if they should do it , then they will be welcomed into the center of the room by their own genom@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ ren , such as hor@@ des of Protest@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; it was also aimed at all , as everything was written in the exhibition until the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ings St@@ atur ) , in which their genetic hap@@ log@@ groups were written with pencil . &quot;
&quot; in the past I had it on the wall , but I wanted it to feel like a man @-@ set , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg by the portraits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement , which formed with Chelsea , like the movement , which also behind their liberation . &quot;
Professor of the University of North@@ western and an employee of the University of Oxford because of killing
&quot; a nation@@ wide human hunt is in the way for a professor at North@@ western University and a member of the University of Oxford , which was considered a suspe@@ cts for a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly inj@@ uries . &quot;
on Monday we were issued for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham L@@ ath@@ em ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren , because of their alle@@ ged participation in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au presented like the acts of the Court of Cook County . &quot;
&quot; the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , after several stit@@ ches died . &quot;
one of the police authorities of Chicago published general community @-@ system that the Le@@ iche was discovered on 27 July .
&quot; officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several inj@@ uries of his body . &quot;
&quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still standing on the place of the events for dead , and det@@ ective investigate the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police are active after the two suspe@@ cts . &quot;
L@@ ath@@ em has been an extraordinary professor of Micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at North@@ western University since 2007 .
&quot; Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the Vice President for University relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that L@@ ath@@ em has been judged now in judged and be excluded from the super@@ visor of North@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; this is now a criminal issue that is investigated by the competent authorities and the North@@ western University co@@ operates at this investigation , &quot; said Cub@@ bage . &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; a spokes@@ man of the University and the Som@@ erv@@ ille College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; &quot; we are in contact with police in the UK and ready to help us to help us to help us to help us the U.S. investig@@ ators . &quot;
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens have sh@@ ocked and want it to be .
&quot; Chief Communications Officer of the police authorities of Chicago , Anthony Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi , said he called the suspe@@ cts . &quot;
&quot; the police has an idea of its where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them , &quot; said Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspe@@ cts . &quot;
&quot; Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said , the police received a call from the building car@@ et@@ aker of the Grand @-@ Plaza @-@ building that had just a mysterious tip that had happened in apartment 10@@ 08 . &quot;
the police are the scene as a very cruel .
Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said it was un@@ clear whether the inc@@ ident was held on 27 July .
it was confirmed by safety cameras that L@@ ath@@ em and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; said Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation to the inhabitants : &quot; &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of O@@ pf@@ ers and explo@@ res a variety of mot@@ ifs , including a possible home country . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will conclude the WA@@ DA @-@ road@@ map in the near future &quot; - the Russian vice @-@ prem@@ ier Mut@@ ko
Russian vice @-@ prem@@ ier Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it will not last long until the remaining criteria of the world @-@ anti @-@ d@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) to restore the Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; in a certain stage of ful@@ fil@@ ment of the criteria of the Roadmap , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in collaboration with Ukrain ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) . &quot;
&quot; the WA@@ DA @-@ road@@ map was updated in this regard , &quot; Mut@@ ko explained on Thursday . &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA to comply with the code that describes the criteria for re@@ integration of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the website of the organization .
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he contains nothing that could cause concern for Russia . &quot;
&quot; everything was announced , everything will be implemented . &quot;
&quot; and the results are presented to the International Olympic Committee ( I@@ OC ) and the WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; however , one of the criteria mentioned in the list is fixed that the Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping authorities have approved the reported results of by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren to alle@@ ged state @-@ sponsored D@@ op@@ ings in the Russian sport . &quot;
&quot; in relation to the matter Mut@@ ko : &quot; &quot; we lead the examination because our anti @-@ d@@ oping system has a mistake . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there was no state programs , and we will not ad@@ mit something that does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Mut@@ ous &apos;s words agreed with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping Commission . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with the Russian Merchan@@ dise R@@ Sport at the beginning of the day Sm@@ ir@@ nov announced problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping organizations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contro@@ ver@@ si@@ al positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; no one has to accept this report unconditional &quot; , &quot; she added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot;
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was ruled in November 2015 in the course of d@@ oping sc@@ and@@ als of the WA@@ DA of the implementation of D@@ op@@ ing@@ contro@@ ver@@ ges in Russia .
&quot; however , you have been allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK anti @-@ d@@ oping ( UK@@ AD ) . &quot;
&quot; after a visit to the main quarters of the organization in Moscow in July the WA@@ DA @-@ General director Olivier Nig@@ gli , that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moved to the right direction &quot; to be used again . &quot;

&quot; start @-@ ups that will help your business , not to be closest to the next U@@ ber &quot;
Amy Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure the happiness in your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up but the survey@@ s did not work .
&quot; answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; and even if you spoke an@@ onym@@ ity , sad@@ dened some workers not the process . &quot;
&quot; there was simply never consistency and obje@@ ctivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who operates 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Society Ma@@ dison reed . &quot;
it has got people from outside for help .
&quot; a new breed of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is on the wax , to help companies find out how their employees feel . &quot;
&quot; by creating and licens@@ ing software , which enables the specific purpose of the measurement of employee engagement , it enables companies to perform survey@@ s , spec@@ ific@@ ity groups and demo@@ graphic groups , and in some cases wh@@ ist@@ le@@ bl@@ ow@@ ern allow the C @-@ Suite execut@@ ives and turn right at the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; you now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for the persecution of their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software Analytics tools used to measure employees . &quot;
&quot; Er@@ ret@@ t said , that she won a better insight into what your employees do and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the sn@@ ap survey@@ s and survey@@ s of certain teams , it offers a heat @-@ card of the company that shows at a glance , which units have most complaints and which managers can have low conditions results - so that you can tem@@ ples why . &quot;
&quot; businesses come to see that at the top of the workplace culture have to remain , so that you will not be the next qu@@ iver that has been published in Sk@@ and@@ ale , who describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ities where those who have spoken , pun@@ ished . &quot;
for start @-@ ups such as G@@ lin@@ t this wish is an overview of lu@@ crat@@ ive business opportunities .

&quot; Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent bad behaviour and recogn@@ izing , saw an expression of interest and activity beginning of this year in the midst of the U@@ ber F@@ all in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ ters has nearly 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la . &quot;

&quot; as G@@ lin@@ t , Conver@@ cent companies lets companies tailor @-@ made &quot; pulse &quot; survey@@ s , send confidential answers in real time and view the heat cards of your problem . &quot;
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line with the employees of bad behaviour .
&quot; and if the main business guide is included , complaints shall go directly to the super@@ visory board . &quot;
&quot; the Court of public opinion has captured the Regul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Quin@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Conver@@ cent . &quot;
&quot; if a company is found that its staff is poor@@ ly treated or un@@ eth@@ ically , it can experience precious consequences by consumers @-@ boy@@ cott , workers and fluctu@@ ation , said Quin@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations , conver@@ cent for more than one year to ensure that staff are aware of the policy and procedures and have a simple way to have their corporate key . &quot;
&quot; sooner if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or e @-@ mail for the company headquarters , a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; it was often a intim@@ idation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Coun@@ sel , who said , there was no good opportunity to follow the complaints from employees . &quot;
&quot; now , since the company conver@@ tible conver@@ ts , problems that have previously been identified before leaders who have been hidden in towns in cities or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or un@@ ob@@ serving intern@@ s . &quot;
&quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view of the experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who manages the risk management Group of Ruby Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment , dispute . &quot;
&quot; company began to take eth@@ ics , values and staff involvement in 2002 after the accounting company Arthur Ander@@ sen because of eth@@ ical violations by the En@@ ron @-@ Sk@@ and@@ al , said Quin@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; but it took until the &quot; Social Media at their right came , &quot; that companies recognized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot;
&quot; before using technology to monitoring eth@@ ics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ cent offer your software as service , and put the company with re@@ curr@@ ing fees for the use of their products . &quot;
it is a business model and a chance that will find the approval of Venture Capital investors who have both start @-@ ups .
&quot; conver@@ cent received $ 10 million in financing in February by companies such as Sapphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , which was raised the entire capital to $ 47 million . &quot;
&quot; Gl@@ itz@@ ers ensure $ 10 million in November by Bess@@ emer Venture Partners , and brought his entire financing to $ 60 million . &quot;
&quot; these investments will hardly come surprising , given the net@@ worked nature of companies , culture and Venture Capital . &quot;
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more than before .
in competitive markets such as Sil@@ icon Valley are high sal@@ aries and interesting projects only inser@@ ts .
the employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are glad to be in a company that heard their voices , and that work that you do is worth doing this company , then Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Employee Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In that use both Conver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
investors can reach Rend@@ ites when their portfolio is well run . company running well when employees are committed and engaged .
&quot; if the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find assistance . &quot;
the data on the staff of commitment to the experts of the workplace culture is important .
but the data is us@@ eless if the administrator of a company does not take action .
&quot; in fact , if a company asks employees after your feedback , it may have an expect@@ ation that change on the way . &quot;
&quot; and if the change is not fast enough , or not at all , these disappoint@@ ments can breed and acc@@ used . &quot;
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you have to be willing to have 4,000 talks , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kot@@ ter International , the company has seen too much to the collection of data . &quot;
&quot; for if you are not going to follow employees , &quot; Hab@@ t ye really listened ? &quot;
take care of it ?
&quot; and if you don &apos;t care about , why should I ? &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ dison Reed , who has now passed monthly employees , was able to initi@@ ate measures on the same day when a problem is reported on G@@ lin@@ t , so Er@@ ret@@ t . &quot;
&quot; and according to the collection of feedback from frustr@@ ated staff , it was able to organise several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems . &quot;
&quot; in Ruby Tuesday , the company will always receive new insights on the staff , and it hopes that for a long term , this leads to better bond@@ ing of workers in a branch that is known for high revenue . &quot;
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose man , &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you will lose also customers . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose customers , then you will lose company . &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A fixed the two @-@ days practices and makes a long day for the brood
it goes to 23 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA @-@ foot@@ ball@@ ers are talking on one side of the new exercising fields of the team on campus .
some have pushed out their tri@@ ot@@ ation parts and show the back full of swe@@ at from the first day of training .
for a good part of the team these unt@@ ested minutes have a lunch break .
&quot; players who are written to the summer courses , will return after the three @-@ hour exercise will return after the three @-@ hour exercise , before they return the next morning at 6 : 30 to the water@@ man Football Center . &quot;
&quot; this is for the guys the next three days a real trekking mill , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before Monday to Tuesday was . &quot;
&quot; the N@@ CA@@ A eliminated two @-@ days exercises to facilitate the load of the players , and she actually extended her days - at least until the final on Friday . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the first three trainings of the U@@ C@@ LA should start at 19 : 15 in order to meet the already completed time @-@ plans of the player . &quot;
the compromise away from the two days is more than one day at which the brood at the beginning of the Camp@@ s almost one week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six playing times in West@@ wood practical exercises .
you will keep up in the course of August 18 exercises . 20 before the beginning of the form@@ ers rules for their pre@@ lu@@ de against Texas A &amp; M in September .
&quot; Mor@@ a said that he support the change of N@@ CA@@ A sup@@ por@@ tive , even if they add the multiple routes of the player to add another point . &quot;
&quot; we put this enormous burden three or four days on them , and it is very challenging , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; and they just pressed , they are plac@@ ken , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will really great . &quot;
&quot; the U@@ C@@ LA will end its practices as soon as the Camp is finished , what is subject to the clear view of its fields by an ad@@ joining parking area and the bor@@ dering Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the up@@ scale class that is already covered with foot@@ prints , no easy task . &quot;
&quot; Bru@@ ins players will occup@@ y the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a spatial , that there might be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far fet@@ ched that people rent there a room and then set up there to record a exercise . &quot;
&quot; if you have the vide@@ ob@@ and of an exercise , it is a pretty good deal . &quot;
&quot; but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 . &quot;
&quot; we will do the best , with what we have . &quot;
I am not too much concerned with this .

&quot; the company said in a statement on his website , that it will begin with the use of updated mechanical learning methods to identify possible fal@@ seh@@ ood and to display them in fact @-@ tested , which may be displayed in fact from the original article from the original article . &quot;
&quot; Facebook was critic@@ ised as one of the main distrib@@ utions for so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News , many believe that they also have influenced the US pres@@ idential elections . &quot;
&quot; the problem has also become a big political issue , with the French voters in advance of the pres@@ idential elections , and Germany supports a plan , according to social media networks , if it does not succeed , h@@ asser@@ ted post@@ ings like the elections in September quickly . &quot;

creating a Com@@ ic @-@ Nov@@ el : a castle in the history of England
in his younger past the small Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a sque@@ eze music video and was for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ er and 1980 @-@ er years a key@@ hole .
&quot; but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history of his cozy seat in the ir@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and is now available for inspiration for a graphical novel of Jamie Rhodes , a mop@@ l@@ astic Yor@@ k@@ sh@@ i@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents . &quot;
&quot; I find it so nice to look at the manus@@ cript from someone who has been dead for 300 years , he says w@@ ouldn &apos;t . &quot;
what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand .
&quot; a Castle in England &apos; embr@@ aces the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documented the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . every story was illustrated by another , upcoming British artist , Br@@ ion@@ y May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Green@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book of Rhodes , based on an archive : he wrote 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories , &quot; a collection which was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project which he un@@ expect@@ edly found . &quot;
&quot; I only have been written on the th@@ um@@ b pressure on the side of a letter which was written by a dou@@ gh@@ ost in the 1700 &apos;s years , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; says he . &quot;
&quot; that is his th@@ um@@ b screen !
&quot; and letters did always smell to smoke , because then there was a fire because of light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives in late 300 years later , the smell has an effect , as if it would be even too . &quot;
&quot; Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
&quot; for someone who be@@ aten so with old papers , he will be supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; &quot; To be honest , &quot; &quot; I said my welcome greeting &quot; ) , it seems to be all too beautiful to be true . &quot;
&quot; Rhodes spent his days to explore the Vic@@ tor@@ ian &quot; new &quot; castle , to study the archives and study the many treasures and curios@@ ities of the castle , such as the mont@@ ory hy@@ ena heads in the walls and the bottles , the centuries had spent in the dit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; he emig@@ rated by the terrain and the ruins of the old castle , and spoke with land@@ lords , gardening and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book . &quot;
then at night he d@@ rank it &apos; whis@@ key and started to write .
&quot; the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown since the National Trust was only in 2006 as the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died . &quot;
&quot; when Rhodes was met a decade later , the staff began to take care of the archive , which he as &quot; hundreds of years , in which Arist@@ oc@@ rats said &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot;
&quot; diary books , letters from the time of the English Em@@ pi@@ res , cards that would be what pos@@ sess@@ ed , &quot; says Rhodes , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch that fought for two families . &quot;
&quot; guys , let everything go to his ais@@ le ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to take on a bre@@ wing base in the English story including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , who left a man who left the newly built castle in order to join the farmhouses of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is an essay by a revol@@ t that occurred 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book with the title &apos; Kn@@ oll Famil@@ ies of K@@ ent and Sussex &apos; , says Rhodes . &quot;
&quot; the peasant revol@@ t began in this area and I thought , a revol@@ t was a good start . &quot;
perhaps the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot;
&quot; other stories are firmly ro@@ oted in the history of the castle , as &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; that tells the story of the Jes@@ u@@ ite , which were the family of Dar@@ rell seven years while the English Reformation . &quot;
&quot; or &apos; The Sm@@ ug@@ gler &apos; , in which the sm@@ ug@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rell presented out of the 18th century by filled a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was only years later than his Sar@@ g was excav@@ ated ) . &quot;
&quot; the Dar@@ rel@@ ls are Rhodes &apos;s family family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gentlemen like to be convenient G@@ aun@@ er , getting again deb@@ ts and make money for things that they could not afford . &quot;
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ rell men sol@@ dered their deb@@ ts , doing rich old women . I imagine it as a he@@ ap well out guys , with a talent to advert@@ ise with a talent . &quot;
after the end of his release in the castle Rhodes is looking for other unique scre@@ ib experiences
&quot; he has got a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a com@@ ic novel on El@@ äm@@ än@@ son@@ ki , the grounds of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has been re@@ claimed by nature again . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back again , &quot; &quot; says he . &quot;
&quot; it was like : &quot; Oh , now I have to be ready again with the dam@@ n life . &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Marien@@ kap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the filling of the 301 years old Marien@@ kap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf has started the city of Bad Honnef on Friday to launch a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) .
&quot; still until Thursday , Mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team to keep the logo and slogan to Nelson Art@@ z . &quot;
at the end of August it is to be the highlight of the campaign to be a festival on the island of Graf@@ en@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; too nice for us .
&quot; or ? , ask the makers of action since yesterday on the poster at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer Chapel . &quot;
&quot; we think that ( of course ! ) do not really , &quot; write them on their yesterday . &quot;
but we use this measure to win your attention .
and to make clear that it is better than it seems .
basically we are the fixed convict@@ ion that we do not know the beauty and attra@@ ct@@ iveness of our city very well .
&quot; in action , it is about more than &quot; &quot; only &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , it means it further . &quot;
&quot; it is considered to formul@@ ate an un@@ mistak@@ able promise , one which is the city an un@@ mistak@@ able All@@ ause . &quot;
&quot; after all , they stand in the competition with other municipalities . &quot;
a medium @-@ part amount will be the city of Bad Honnef their new umbrella brand and the campaign cost .
military re@@ forming in Turkey - Er@@ dog@@ an fear of the army
every year early August advis@@ es in Ankara from the Ober@@ ste Military Council ( Y@@ as ) and tran@@ sports in the officer of officers .
this is how this week .
at first sight a normal process .
but nothing is routine in the Turkish army forces a year after the put@@ sch .
&quot; the meeting was no longer held in the building of the General@@ ate , as before , but in the minister of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; the discussions took place under the chairman of the government now also the five vice @-@ prem@@ iers as well as the ministers of Defense , Inner@@ es , judi@@ ci@@ ary and foreign . &quot;
&quot; thus , the civilians were in the Y@@ as in the Trans@@ ition . &quot;
the government moves in the military the bre@@ eders .
&quot; Direct@@ orate @-@ General Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the Com@@ man@@ ders of the army , the avi@@ ation and the Navy have been cancelled . &quot;
&quot; since the e@@ iter@@ ated Cou@@ p , leader Er@@ dog@@ an 169 of the 326 gener@@ als and Admir@@ als fi@@ red . &quot;
&quot; more than 10.000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of the alle@@ ged connections to the movement of exile @-@ Pre@@ dig@@ ers Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , Er@@ dog@@ an as wire of the put@@ sch . &quot;
&quot; against 486 people , who should immediately be involved in the put@@ sch , will be negoti@@ ated in Ankara since this week . &quot;
&quot; on the day after the cou@@ p Er@@ dog@@ an had been referred to as &quot; divine gift , &quot; as he denied the opportunity to fully pur@@ ify the armed forces . &quot;
but has Er@@ dog@@ an the army really in hand ?
&quot; at the end of February the newspaper &quot; &quot; hur@@ ricane &quot; &quot; published an article with the title &quot; &quot; discomfort &quot; &quot; in the military headquarters . &quot;
&quot; in general , there will be concern for an increasing &quot; Islam@@ isation &quot; of the army , which manif@@ ests itself in the lifting of the head@@ ache for Sol@@ dat@@ ors , wrote the newspaper . &quot;
the clean@@ ers of the army and the security forces goes on any rate .
&quot; in mid July Er@@ dog@@ an by Dec@@ ree further 73@@ 95 State services , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 546 soldiers . &quot;
it seemed that I got dog@@ dog@@ an the military .
the gener@@ als earlier than the actual men of the country .
three times they call upon their role as guardi@@ ans of world@@ ly state order .
&quot; after his election in 2002 Er@@ dog@@ an Er@@ dog@@ an came to the power of the military step by step , not least in calling for the reform of the European Union . &quot;
former officers say Er@@ dog@@ an was targeted by a Islam@@ ist of the armed forces .
&quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; Voc@@ al Europe &quot; &quot; war@@ ned a name @-@ named officer of fear of persecution abroad asylum , the Turkish army will be in a few years &quot; full of extrem@@ ists and sal@@ af@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; meets that , such a development could not be cold . &quot;
anyway it is in the alliance after the pur@@ ification doubts about the commitment of the Turkish army .
&quot; leaders and operating skills are &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; say N@@ ato diplom@@ ats . &quot;
Washington changes rules for the Green Card
&quot; there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of Green Card , President Donald Tru@@ mp , quoted from the media . &quot;
&quot; it looks especially to lower the leg@@ ality immig@@ rants on 5@@ 0,000 per year , strict regulations for the reduction of Visa for a temporary work@@ permit and limitations for families @-@ oriented Visa . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Re@@ public@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill is meant to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; this law will decrease poverty , increase wages and billion dollars to tax@@ pay@@ ers and will do this by changing the US the way from other countries Green Cards . &quot;
the law will prevent the chains of migration and replace the current system .
&quot; this new procedure procedure will come to the candidates who have English , who will have financial resources to assist themselves and knowledge that our economy will come forward , &quot; said Tru@@ mp , c@@ ited from the American media . &quot;
ministry wants to get a route for racing shuttle
again and again in the past few months the future of the race increases - now it is to go quite quickly .
&quot; even before the end of the year , at the mar@@ o@@ den route , on which the tourist train runs , built . &quot;
&quot; to ensure the future of the racing increase in the long @-@ term , according to the information of the traffic Ministry are still working on the track . &quot;
&quot; with the decision to order the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Rac@@ ing@@ ig , the country belongs to this especially important for tourism , &quot; declared traffic Secretary Klaus S@@ ühl on Friday in Erfurt . &quot;
the cost of the re@@ conditioning of the route refer to about 2.5 million euros .
by this sum I take the country 75 percent .
&quot; the contract , on its basis the shuttle is to be ordered in the future from the country , it is currently finally coordinated , explained S@@ ühl . &quot;
the ministry and the Süd@@ th@@ ür@@ ingen as a operator are already informed about the technical details .
&quot; these are the road@@ map used in the vehicles and quality standards , &quot; said S@@ ühl . &quot;
the planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be closed for a duration of eleven years .
&quot; thus , the race ste@@ aling @-@ shuttle will be ordered on December 2017 . &quot;
the Renn@@ ste@@ ig shuttle is one especially popular with tourists popular train connection between the stations of Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ ste@@ ig .
&quot; in the course of a pilot group has been tested , whether the route is used by sufficient many people to order them into the future in the future . &quot;
the circuit is also strong in parts .
the rise of sex robot is real and we should worry about
&quot; just as you thought , that there will be 2017 not even crazy , a new report about technological developments in the field of sex robots . &quot;
&quot; yes , indeed . &quot;
sex @-@ robots are currently a great thing .
recently the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for responsible Robotics ) ( FR@@ R ) has published a report on the development of sex robot in the next five to ten years .
&quot; according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , emer@@ itus professor of Robotics and artificial intelligence at the University She@@ ff@@ ield and Co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must start to take their rise seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the eye @-@ color of the robot , its shape of the nip@@ ple and the type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ag@@ el . &quot;
&quot; the people make themselves fun , but the companies deliver any amount of it , and we will see them much more frequently seen , &quot; &quot; said Mr. Shar@@ key in the release of his new report . &quot;
modern sex@@ es have developed from their infl@@ atable partners using a silic@@ one skin which feels warm - with aware of human reactions which can be achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; the user can custom@@ ize his robots even in accordance with its beliefs , &quot; &quot; and it all choose from the eye @-@ color of the robot to the type or colour of its fingers . &quot;
&quot; but it is still distur@@ bing that many robots have the &quot; person@@ alities &quot; , &quot; which would be a ste@@ pp@@ ford woman to look progressive . &quot;
modern sex@@ es have developed to robots with a silic@@ one skin .
&quot; the Real@@ amb@@ ix robot allows for example to adapt its robots to the properties which they appe@@ aling , as well as students . &quot;
&quot; and then there is one of the True Compan@@ ion developed Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex robot with pre @-@ programmed person@@ alities such as &quot; Fr@@ ig@@ id Far@@ rah , &quot; which gives the impression of drawers and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with a &quot; advent@@ urous &quot; personality . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has adapted a personality that is adapted as good as possible , the website of True Compan@@ ion . &quot;
&quot; like what you like , and she does not like what you like , etc . &quot;
it also has its mo@@ ods over the day - just like real people !
&quot; it can be tired , fixed on conversation or can be &quot; &quot; in the mood ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are many distur@@ bing aspects of this rise of sex robot - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the inferior female properties , the stimul@@ ates on r@@ ape , if one step up on Fr@@ ig@@ id ( does not mean a step on Fr@@ ig@@ id ) , rest@@ less a most . &quot;
on his website the True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ rator but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) have a vibration , why can men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; &quot; is the name of the website . &quot;
&quot; however , these sex robots are not only a fat or just another sex@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; their appearance and increasing refin@@ ement point out to something Dun@@ kl@@ eres and deeper into our culture , to a retreat from the ideal equal rights of gender equality towards a desire for sex with sub@@ jug@@ ation as optional enc@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; most men will of course hold any sex robot , and while the FR@@ R will notice their rising popularity , nevertheless they remain provis@@ ional on the edge of the consumer culture . &quot;
&quot; but what is per@@ me@@ ated from the bound@@ ary , can be in terms of the spirit of time in which we live , very instru@@ ctive . &quot;
&quot; and many people are not we@@ ird or off@@ ensive , until them the free market there will be permission . &quot;
&quot; however , there is a certain di@@ vor@@ ce that this highly developed sex robot in a time arise in which the rights of women are threatened worldwide in which there has been a president in the White House , which has been pra@@ ised to women sexually . &quot;
the ab@@ err@@ ent aspect of the television series &apos; The hand@@ maid &apos;s Tale &apos; ( &apos; The report of the hand@@ maid &apos; ) are not the graphic images that affects the in@@ sufficient body and the out@@ set eyes but how realistic this vision works .
&quot; the Republic of Gilead is a le@@ ap , but at the moment this does not feel like a big le@@ ap . &quot;
the goal behind these sex robot is to make a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( if possible with Por@@ nost@@ ar pro@@ portions ) .
&quot; they want to feel that they feel human , that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body . &quot;
&quot; but , on the point , when it comes to their &quot; person@@ alities &quot; , &quot; the robots do not represent real women . &quot;
you cannot even separate from her companion or just go away .
&quot; they do not have any medi@@ ation or a background history , nothing that indicates independence or anything that could distur@@ b the imagination tot@@ aler submission . &quot;
other words : they are pleas@@ ing slaves .
or to express it in the re@@ design of 2017 : ma@@ ids
Tru@@ m@@ ps Big Power ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney to the ep@@ it@@ ome of the healthy life .
&quot; it has become a b@@ ins@@ ign@@ ity of the Tru@@ mp era , that the political st@@ aging is polar@@ ized , who have polar@@ ized families in small format . &quot;
around Christmas and harvest feast there was in the US newspapers with advice on how to deal with the horror of Tru@@ mp .
we are all sup@@ pos@@ edly asked for all of us to bur@@ sting our filter bub@@ bles .
&quot; less noticed is the power of Tru@@ m@@ ps , families together . &quot;
&quot; I chose this , because my cous@@ ine , a lin@@ ks@@ ger@@ ed fertilizer that lives in Chicago and has long been visited with the Re@@ public@@ ans in our family , who has visited this week in New York . &quot;
it rem@@ inded me that unity may have a powerful enemy a powerful effect .
&quot; with Tru@@ mp in the White House , everyone who knows them , including the re@@ publ@@ ican relationship , with whom she had fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and very strange on the same side . &quot;
&quot; around the dining table , this is certainly a good thing , but it falls to me in a further context that this will also bring significant risks . &quot;
&quot; the left was strengthened by Tru@@ mp , but the resulting effect of his pres@@ idency has the power to move all right to the right . &quot;
&quot; when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alisation &quot; and Tru@@ mp , we refer to the gr@@ us@@ eless opportunity to make us out of a day out of one day . &quot;
&quot; however , there is another fr@@ ight@@ ened long @-@ term scenario in the Tru@@ mp Re@@ public@@ ans of the right wing , &quot; which appear once compared to its standards suddenly as an ep@@ it@@ ome of reason . &quot;
&quot; I find myself today from an active nost@@ algia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s ur@@ ian version of the mad@@ man , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax statement saw ) - both compared to Tru@@ mp in fact than very mild criminal off@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; if tru@@ mp goes , the next can@@ did@@ at of the Re@@ public@@ ans only be mentally healthy to qualify as imm@@ eas@@ urable improvement . &quot;
&quot; when my cous@@ ine in the city was , we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park , the biggest of the car@@ uss@@ ells of New York parks , and the best three dollars that you can spend in town , if you do not need caffeine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are enormous , the fiber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all cl@@ owns are kn@@ ur@@ ry and the animals turn out to look full of fear about their own shoulders - most dark , and the climate of music convey@@ ed this in a strange way . &quot;
&quot; so many cl@@ ich@@ és of a city dis@@ ap@@ point : the views of high buildings are old , the sky@@ lines are becoming familiar to offer a lot of excitement and the reality of the city will not meet the dream . &quot;
&quot; five years later , and I am still not all over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage - the topics of the pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not - but a big roundabout in the north of London . &quot;
&quot; however , the Central Park @-@ carousel is still a strange magic experience , as here two two year @-@ year @-@ old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ s can go on it and all have a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could evaluate the carousel , I would have given him full score , but fortunately no one has asked afterwards . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , I was forced to rate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before I could get my credit card . &quot;
&quot; in Coff@@ eh@@ aus on the corner of my road it is the same , plus the option to put an average rating with a 15 % ti@@ pping turn - this to buy something about the counter . &quot;
&quot; this does not only lead to a sl@@ owing of what actually should be a neutral exchange , but also pract@@ ise pressure on the server to put personality in a situation in which no need is required . &quot;
&quot; the poor woman in the department store was ap@@ olog@@ ating gr@@ ac@@ eful while I tired the experience , you have tired my credit card with five stars . &quot;
Oscar Pist@@ or@@ ius with chest ache from prison to hospital
Pist@@ or@@ ius has left the prison for a nur@@ ser@@ y for the second time .
&quot; last year , he was brought to the hospital for the treatment of snor@@ kel to the hospital which he suffered the pris@@ ons according to a fall in his cell . &quot;
Pist@@ or@@ ius was sent@@ enced by Mor@@ des after an appeal to the pro@@ secut@@ or against a first tot@@ ality .
he t@@ öt@@ ete Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning of the Valent@@ ine 2013 by taking them several times a door of the toil@@ ett@@ enk@@ ins in his house in Pretoria on her .
Pist@@ or@@ ius claimed that he held his girlfriend for a no@@ ct@@ urn@@ al inv@@ aders who have hidden himself in the cabin .
&quot; the pro@@ secut@@ ors have announced their intention , this time against the six @-@ year @-@ year @-@ old sentence of Pist@@ or@@ ius is app@@ ell , from which they say , it is too s@@ ighted . &quot;
the National pro@@ secution authority said that they will rise to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the one could be heard in this year .
Pist@@ or@@ ius runs out that his sentence has increased to 15 years when the pro@@ secut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .

software Update for Diesel @-@ vehicles : what those concerned have to know now
how exactly will the software update instead ?
does Diesel drivers take part in action ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
&quot; with diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW @-@ Group software updates are offered for a total of around 5,@@ 3 million cars . &quot;
they are supposed to improve the gas@@ ification of cars in the emissions classes Euro 5 and in part .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ Diesel or worse are excluded .
Anja S@@ met@@ anine of the ACE Auto Club Europe will give boarding facilities :
is the new action compul@@ s@@ ory ?
&quot; no , the tra@@ ded software updates are optional . &quot;
&quot; the oblig@@ atory updates before apply only to the vehicles , the Schum@@ acher software , &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anine . &quot;
their retro@@ fitting has arranged the office @-@ office ( KBA ) .
how and from when are clients informed about updates ?
&quot; the makers have announced a fast implementation in the next months , but not an exact date . &quot;
Daimler has already commun@@ icated to any person concerned .
&quot; if anyway , an Inspe@@ ction is sus@@ cep@@ tible , it will be done in their frame . &quot;
how long should the re@@ tra@@ ders have been drawn up ?
&quot; difficult to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ anine . &quot;
the approach from the commitment of the manufacturers as well as from political pressure .
because we have seen volunt@@ arily and act the aut@@ oh@@ er@@ isk at the environment so far .
how long should the update take ?
the retro@@ fitting itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
consuming it could be an appointment .
&quot; what do we do , which do not travel by car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ? &quot;
the ACE dr@@ ills to wait .
&quot; presum@@ ably , foreign manufacturers would re@@ pul@@ ling , so S@@ met@@ anine . &quot;
threat@@ ens a massive price drop of Euro @-@ 4 @-@ cars ?
the ACE fear that .
&quot; but even in the regions , where you can thre@@ aten . &quot;
in rural area so far there has been no added value for older diesel .

we make the city li@@ vable
&quot; Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , continues in the coming year in R@@ ente . &quot;
the spot is already written - suitable applic@@ ants are however rare .
since 31 years W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister .
&quot; and the work makes him great fun , as he convey@@ ed in the press of the press . &quot;
&quot; he reports of diver@@ si@@ fied , but also demanding tasks , waiting for his followers . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we have no application to fill the application process . &quot;
the city is looking for a architects or construction engineer at the next time .
&quot; thus , - in compliance with the regular cancellation period - still enough time for a revision . &quot;
&quot; as Has@@ l@@ ach applies to the administrative community as sub @-@ rights authority , the applic@@ ants must be agreed . &quot;
because this function wants to keep the city definitely .
&quot; if it would not be able to fill out these no longer , we would have to drive citizens to consultation up to Off@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; but citiz@@ enship in the city and himself is important , says W@@ acker , who reported by a good factory , as well as good mood between authority and citizens . &quot;
&quot; in more than 30 years in office , some major projects accumul@@ ate accumul@@ ated on the h@@ acker with pride . &quot;
&quot; we make the city li@@ vable , he is about the building office and his staff safe . &quot;
&quot; but also in the future , there are varied projects on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen@@ parking space will be stopped . &quot;
the Kin@@ zig@@ bridge between Bol@@ l@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed and the stadium is still subject .
&quot; the latter is going to get around EUR 1.5 million euros to book , &quot; when we make it right , &quot; appreci@@ ates w@@ acker . &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks are waiting for my successor . &quot;
the work here makes fun . &quot;
&quot; ancient , for a Stadt@@ bau@@ meister of great play@@ room . &quot;
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s own bau@@ hof and gar@@ dener can be quite flexib@@ ly respon@@ sive .
&quot; you can move much , so s@@ acker , and the design of the green areas will be pra@@ ised by citizens and visitors . &quot;
&quot; as the old town as the ensemble is under monument protection , it is important to have &quot; an eye to have what cle@@ aring , when constructions are approved , emphas@@ ises the out@@ going city master . &quot;
anyway the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister makes high responsibility .
&quot; he is builder , &quot; at the end everything goes here over my table . &quot;
&quot; in support and coordination , he can count on many years of employees : Markus Neum@@ a@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been in charge for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( deep @-@ construction ) has been around for 15 years . &quot;
&quot; also , that his successor remains for a long time , W@@ acker : &quot; we are looking for someone who really is really identified with the place . &quot;
&quot; for continuity is not only important for a good mode , but also for the further creation of the city . &quot;
&quot; if Roland W@@ acker seeks to provide information about the city Has@@ l@@ ach , a closed study as a diplom@@ at engineer or Bachelor &apos;s architecture in the fields of construction and construction projects . &quot;
&quot; Stadt@@ bau@@ holz is underground and deep @-@ construction , construction planning , ridge , administration of urban properties , Municipal Court with Bau@@ hof and Municipal Arts , including Sub@@ sidi@@ aries , including monument protection . &quot;
bicycle on wi@@ res : closed on the ground @-@ track
&quot; according to police , the still un@@ known perpet@@ rators had thrown the blue bike on the train ride in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) . &quot;
these were so badly damaged that the her@@ ed@@ itary goods had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male plates and look for the night @-@ hour after them .
near the Tat@@ ort was by witnesses a ros@@ ar@@ oter Rol@@ ler@@ - and a bike riders have been observed .
&quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ bu@@ ff , &quot; said Ö@@ BB @-@ Spe@@ aker Christoph Pos@@ ch for APA . &quot;
the or the perpet@@ rators would have brought itself into great danger even at risk .
&quot; in addition to the damage at the L@@ ok and the plant as well as the bel@@ low , and the cost of rail transport may also go to the perpet@@ rators of the rail@@ ways . &quot;
&quot; overall , be caused by a &quot; significant &quot; sum , &quot; said the speaker . &quot;
the damage were fixed at the Fri@@ day@@ afternoon , the railway traffic on the south trail could be led without disabilities . &quot;
&quot; nearly ten person@@ es , Fri@@ days were abandoned , two of them consider the remote traffic . &quot;
&quot; goods did not fell out , but they had late . &quot;
according to Ö@@ BB @-@ Spe@@ aker Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be replaced about 200 metres short@@ cut .
isol@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
&quot; red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help , IB@@ D ( inflammatory intest@@ ine ) . &quot;
red meat and chocolate can sound for your digest@@ ion as a night@@ mare .
&quot; but a new study asser@@ ted exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and milk products , the symptoms of patients could relie@@ ve the symptoms of patients with inflammatory intestinal diseases . &quot;
&quot; the incur@@ able condition that affects approximately 1.3 million and in Great Britain 30@@ 0.000 , causes magn@@ ets and ble@@ eding , re@@ curr@@ ing or ble@@ eding waste , weight loss and extreme tired@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; while those affected are usually framed , meat and dairy products to alle@@ vi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers found at the Wash@@ ing@@ toner University , researchers found that the essential amino acid Tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an from proteins to develop immune cells that promote toler@@ ant intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells in the intest@@ ines , to ensure that harmful mic@@ robes , which hide themselves in the body , not into the body . &quot;
&quot; cells which are able to dis@@ solve inflammation , are balanced by cells balanced and protect the tolerance and protect the body without sensitive tissues . &quot;
&quot; when the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation , it can result in a inflammatory intest@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; in experiments , it was found that a kind of tolerance of promoting immune cells in mice occurs , which carry a certain bact@@ erium in their intest@@ ines . &quot;
and the bact@@ erium requires tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an - one of the stones of proteins - to dis@@ solve the appearance of the cells .
&quot; Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; &quot; we have a connection between a bact@@ erium - L@@ act@@ ob@@ ac@@ ill@@ us re@@ uter@@ i - which is a normal part of the intest@@ ine micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that provide tolerance . &quot;
&quot; the more tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an the mice in their food had , the more they had of these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he suggested that the combination of L. re@@ uter@@ i and one of Tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an rich diet toler@@ ated , less inflammatory ... &quot;
&quot; the post@@ doct@@ orate Prof. Dr. Luisa Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an uses a kind of immun@@ otherap@@ ist that encour@@ ages tolerance when she found out that a group of study inter@@ acting such cells had , but another group of the same tribe but that was not separate . &quot;
&quot; they suspe@@ cted that the difference with the Dar@@ mm@@ ik@@ ro@@ bi@@ omas of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i that usually live in the intest@@ ine tract . &quot;
the intest@@ ines of the mice were found DNA @-@ sequ@@ encing and there were six bacterial species found in the mice with the immune cells but without the mice were missing .
mice were raised in a ster@@ ile environment so that they did not developed a Dar@@ mm@@ ik@@ ro@@ bi@@ ome and they did not developed this kind of immune cells and they received the L. re@@ uter@@ i and the immune cells .
&quot; to understand how the bacteria explo@@ res the immune system , the researchers led L. re@@ uter@@ i in an fluid and then transferred small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - to un@@ ri@@ pe immune cells that were isolated from mice . &quot;
the immune cells developed into the toler@@ able cells .
&quot; when the active component is cleaned out of the liquid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of the Tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an Met@@ abol@@ ism that is known as In@@ do@@ l @-@ 3 @-@ milit@@ ic acid . &quot;
&quot; if the researchers have dou@@ bled the amount of tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an in the ch@@ uck of the mice , the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent , but when the tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ ane values were half@@ down , decre@@ ased the number of cells by half . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an explained that people have the same toler@@ able cells such as mice , and that most of us can protect L. re@@ uter@@ i in our gast@@ ro @-@ intestinal tract . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether Tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an @-@ side products made of L. re@@ uter@@ i the cells in humans develop as with mice , but def@@ ect in G@@ enen in relation to Tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an were found in people with inflammatory represent@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; she said : &quot; &quot; the development of these cells is probably something that we would like to promote , since these cells are able to control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot;
potentially high imp@@ ure levels can result in the presence of L. re@@ uter@@ i to an extension of this population .
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United with Nem@@ anja Mat@@ ic has committed a &apos; gen@@ ius &apos; .
&quot; at Manchester United has signed a &quot; &quot; gen@@ ius &quot; &quot; with Nem@@ anja Mat@@ ic , in Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ field player at the Mit@@ tw@@ och@@ eve of his debut . &quot;
&quot; the 40 million pounds of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A @-@ Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday , and impressive in the holder role , as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira , to Bel@@ ie@@ ben . &quot;
Mat@@ ic was excluded from the preparation @-@ Asia @-@ tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes to improve M@@ our@@ in@@ ho that he had to improve the Premier League season before the start of the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time but his experience , intelligence , a gen@@ ius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot;
&quot; we will help him to be ready later than later . &quot;
&quot; besides Mat@@ ic start , Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u at the Avi@@ va stadium , as M@@ our@@ in@@ ho his start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season . &quot;
&quot; the Independent revealed this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho still wished three more novel@@ ties , but he ins@@ isted that the club already made a fantastic job . &quot;
&quot; three of four to get , I thank the association , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; I will be happ@@ ier if she got four out of four , but they have given great trouble . &quot;
Boeing &quot; m@@ alt &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the US @-@ plane maker Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers in the sky .
&quot; the pilots flew by Seattle in US @-@ State Washington starting , but drawing up in Marqu@@ ette in US @-@ state Michigan and moved to the form of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers over the US , which are several thousand kilometers . &quot;
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the wheel@@ chairs the shape of a Dream@@ worker was to be .
the whole was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had already made such advertising earlier .
&quot; thus , the number &quot; &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; &quot; and the Boeing logo became painted in the sky . &quot;
&quot; new draft for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem &quot;
&quot; but as the wind turns , as Sig@@ mar Gabriel still SPD @-@ boss was , looked by socialist democratic Prime Minister for elections always with a certain concern after Berlin . &quot;
&quot; merely a bar@@ fire from the part@@ ying , just no counter @-@ wind from the covenant - so was the most important desire of the elect@@ oral fight . &quot;
since Martin Schulz leads the party has changed the basis .
since then the staff members of the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus with gu@@ sen@@ ders the events in the SPD @-@ governed country capitals .
&quot; what Schulz has been received from there since the beginning of the year , with head@@ wind would not be described in the base . &quot;
there were excav@@ ation .
and indeed one after another .
the covenant of the red @-@ CD@@ U looks after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony a general signal against co@@ al@@ itions of SPD and Gre@@ ens .
&quot; it once again shows more : red @-@ green can simply not be reliable , &quot; said CD@@ U @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber on the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
the surprising fra@@ ction of a Green @-@ MEPs has short@@ ened the government of Prime Minister Stephan We@@ il ( SPD ) in a severe crisis .
five months before farmers lost his red @-@ green coalition with its A @-@ voices majority stake in the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Gre@@ ens @-@ Federal State of Michael Kell@@ ner has prompt@@ ed the ab@@ orig@@ ines of the Green Gre@@ ater Elke T@@ westen to return their mandate .
the commit to the CD@@ U means a clear dist@@ ortion of the voters .
Elke T@@ westen must immediately return its mandate , &quot; said the federal leader and elect@@ oral campaigns of the Gre@@ ens of the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; this must not be true not true , &quot; &quot; s@@ igh a SPD @-@ election , when the new Hi@@ ob@@ s@@ bot@@ le has reached the Part@@ icles . &quot;
&quot; Stephan We@@ il , SPD @-@ Prime Minister of Nieder@@ s@@ achsen , is after the commit of the green MP@@ s Elke T@@ westen to the CD@@ U without its own government . &quot;
it is the provis@@ ional highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in the SPD .
and no one knows what comes next .
the mis@@ ery began with the un@@ expect@@ ate defeat at the Saarland &apos;s election in March .
&quot; a blue eye , more not , cal@@ med down the comrades . &quot;
according to the farmers in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ West@@ ph@@ alia will be everything different .
it was then too - and it all became much worse .
the defeat in Kiel was brought the SPD in the diving , the Düsseldorf @-@ Ple@@ ated hau@@ te the party per@@ ched . &quot;
trem@@ ors r@@ app@@ ed the comrades in the weeks after that .
then when they had just begun new courage came the G @-@ 20 summit of Hamburg .
and with him the next r@@ yst@@ er came .
&quot; Mayor Olaf Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD country chef who lost his Nim@@ bus , because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie during his city . &quot;
&quot; and because he was doing so much wrong in the crisis of crisis , so what you can do wrong . &quot;
&quot; since then , Sch@@ olz is fighting for its political survival . &quot;
now also Stephan We@@ il .
&quot; because of the VW @-@ Ab@@ gas@@ ket and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Prime Minister has already been in criticism for some time in criticism . &quot;
mi@@ ese re@@ mot@@ age@@ ously added .
&quot; nevertheless , or perhaps this is why he tried to put in the covenant acc@@ ents in the past weeks . &quot;
the amb@@ ition of the former civil master from Hannover to build his power in Berlin also remained hidden in the surroundings of Martin Schulz .
they left him as they spoke of We@@ il a stabil@@ isation of the party .
&quot; now , the exact opposite could enter . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , Because it hits on the part@@ isan internal constra@@ int of the Lower Gre@@ ens in basically no fault . &quot;
and Schulz certainly not .
&quot; sometimes , the comrades do not seek to keep his own ranks . &quot;
&quot; your wrath is based on the Gre@@ ens , and here mainly on the ab@@ stain@@ ed parliament@@ arians in T@@ westen . &quot;
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democrat@@ ically , like Mrs T@@ westen their own career , says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , Chief of the Part@@ icle , leader of the Part@@ isan network in the SPD @-@ Bun@@ dest@@ ag@@ s@@ fra@@ ction , the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; Ms. T@@ westen is not elected because of their person as a director , but on the country &apos;s list of the Sax@@ on Gre@@ ens in parliament , so the lower @-@ Sax@@ on members . &quot;
the logical consequence would it be that they returned to their mandate .
&quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , Chief of the SPD @-@ Bun@@ dest@@ ag@@ s@@ fra@@ ction , indi@@ cted an &quot; &quot; un@@ democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the voters of four years ago was clear : the people have made Stephan We@@ il for the Prime Minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower SPD as a nickname de@@ did@@ at into the Bundestag . &quot;
&quot; now , the personal career re@@ membran@@ ce of a future CD@@ U @-@ MEPs have the Wah@@ ler@@ result , &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot;
he invited to clarify the back@@ grounds .
I want to know if there has been more or more on the CD@@ U Nieder@@ s@@ achsen has given .
convey@@ ors for Ort@@ ig@@ ern III
who wants to save house in the years will soon be able to get support from the country .
&quot; in addition , Mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representative ste@@ g city development on Wednesday in Emp@@ fingen . &quot;
at the beginning of the information event there were only a look back on that before .
since 1991 it has been given in Emp@@ fingen Renov@@ ation areas .
&quot; back then , in the renovation of I from 1991 to 2004 , the land of Baden @-@ Württemberg has taken over two thir@@ ds of the promot@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; after all accounts II from 2005 to 2016 , the aggreg@@ ates were still at 60 percent . &quot;
&quot; for sch@@ ind@@ ler , the previous s@@ lo@@ ys are a &quot; success @-@ project &quot; &quot; - it is finally important to promote the internal development , and not only new construction sites . &quot;
on 4 April you have received the information by the Govern@@ si@@ dium Karlsruhe the information that there is a Renov@@ ation area III .
&quot; the convey@@ or amount of the amount will be 833 Euro , of which are 500 000 Euro from the country , the rest of the municipality of Emp@@ fingen . &quot;
how does a re@@ activation area arise ?
&quot; we will continue to examine so sh@@ ind@@ ler , where the &quot; truly old &quot; houses are . &quot;
&quot; but it also plays a role , whether in the planned territory ever interest . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , the area of borders could also be shif@@ ted again . &quot;
Ste@@ g Sh@@ ades by Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel . &quot;
&quot; Keller presented the contents of the federal states of &quot; Social City , &quot; as part of the san@@ itation would then be performed . &quot;
the core of the program are the re@@ vit@@ alis@@ ing of Inn@@ enst@@ äd@@ ten to improve the living and employment conditions and expansion of infrastructure .
&quot; the measures would be object @-@ related , that is called per plot . &quot;
the s@@ iting area would finally be defined as stat@@ utes .
the assistance time for the convey@@ or runs from 1st January 2017 until 30 April 2026 .
&quot; even until September this year it would only be carried out once again , as part of those involved in the san@@ itation area participants will receive a question@@ n@@ aire regarding the filling . &quot;
&quot; in November or December , the pro@@ posit@@ ional sign should be carried out , so that next year can be started with the san@@ itation . &quot;
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann stated that every Commun@@ e will carry out the trou@@ bled tests .
it is about to evaluate the urban mis@@ ors and decide when rehabilitation is and to what extent .
it will also be entered into the ground@@ book for the respective plot .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will once again come to Emp@@ fingen and get a picture of the situation .
Got@@ zel stressed to a key success factor for the project was the participation of the participants .
&quot; therefore , there will be question@@ n@@ aires that will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and will be completed by the end of the summer holidays . &quot;
&quot; the yellow question@@ n@@ aire is the &quot; building and ground@@ waters &quot; , &quot; in which it is among other things about construct@@ ional condition and san@@ itation views . &quot;
&quot; in the gray question@@ n@@ aire , the &quot; household and housing &quot; , &quot; data can be made available to size , distribution and inhabitants of a housing . &quot;
&quot; the blue &quot; &quot; mach@@ ining &quot; &quot; is only allowed if in the building of business areas are operated . &quot;
&quot; however , Got@@ zel is pointed out that a fulfilling question@@ n@@ aire is not at the same time a request to funding . &quot;
&quot; moreover , new measures are not promoting . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ ind@@ ler emphas@@ ized that the distribution of convey@@ or works according to the &quot; &quot; Wind@@ ho@@ prin@@ zip &quot; &quot; work - who first comes , mah@@ ated first . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to book a convey@@ or for later &quot; &quot; reservation &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; finally , photos of the project &quot; &quot; Ort@@ sk@@ ern II &quot; &quot; were shown to make the wes@@ ome of a renovation &quot; . &quot; &quot;
British invent@@ ors himself sets up a micro@@ chip to get into the house and car
&quot; an British inventor is the first in the country that is equipped with a microphone , so that he can open its door@@ step , and can even start his car with a hand@@ movement . &quot;
&quot; Steven North@@ am , 33 , had to implant the tiny chip between Dau@@ ms and Ze@@ ig@@ ef@@ inger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simpl@@ ify her life with technology by its company Bio@@ Te@@ q . &quot;
&quot; he has made himself with Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , a consultant manager at the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standard . &quot;
the technology resem@@ bles a cats and dogs implant implants and takes only 30 seconds .
&quot; the company of Mr. North@@ am also wants to change the locks of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , everything for a surcharge of £ 300 per castle . &quot;
the married father of one has now built both at home and his BMW Z@@ 4 technology which begins when his hand is at the wheel .
the advertis@@ ements of the White House cost the tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands
&quot; the decision of the White House , a Marine hel@@ icopter to the South Law@@ n for an event to fly , which costs American production in the last month , costs tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the data of the military , which were left to the TIME magazine until 24.@@ 000 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , if the president is on board , was the heart of the event on 17 July in the White House with American design programmes . &quot;
&quot; President Donald Tru@@ mp , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and condu@@ ctive officials of the White House made a tour of products from all over 50 states . &quot;
&quot; the hel@@ icopter in Connecticut craft@@ ed hel@@ icopter was issued next to a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a fire@@ man car from Wisconsin and a for@@ k@@ lift . &quot;
&quot; the military office of the White House demanded the presence of the hel@@ icopter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fr@@ ago , barely 36 hours before the hel@@ icopter on the South Law@@ n land@@ ed , according to the records of the Marine Hel@@ icopter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit that is responsible for the operation of the hel@@ icopter . &quot;
&quot; I only wanted to be aware that you are aware of this , because there is an unusual event with a high visibility , wrote the com@@ mander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event of his su@@ peri@@ ors , the dep@@ uty Mar@@ ine@@ com@@ man@@ de@@ ur for avi@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the message showed that the hel@@ icopter occurred on 17 July at 7 pm on the South Law@@ n for the event at 15 o &apos;clock , and so long remained , until the lawn between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 p.m. on this evening . &quot;
&quot; the note adds that if the departure should be del@@ ayed from the White House , because of the restriction of the services a second team would be needed for the return flight . &quot;
the original airline was during the event during the hel@@ icopter during the security during the period remained on the ground during the plane .
&quot; from the TIME provided , it was not clear that ultimately a second flight was required . &quot;
Hat@@ ch Act offers state @-@ of state property for political purposes .
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked whether the event could hurt the purpose .
&quot; a question we asked if it was a violation of the Hat@@ ch acts , and we were informed about that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the command@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you are locked , &quot; repl@@ ied the dep@@ uty command@@ ant . &quot;
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not be covered by Hat@@ ch Act .
but also official events have political overt@@ ones .
&quot; at the event , President of the President gave a call for the reform of the healthcare reform that was in the Senate , and he propag@@ ate the efforts to inv@@ ading the government regulations . &quot;
&quot; the use of the aircraft that is known as Marine One or Air Force One , from politically advant@@ ageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon . &quot;
President are obliged to use them for the trip .
&quot; however , their use only for a photo @-@ OP is unusual . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp took a study carried out in February as the pres@@ idency plane in Melbourne , Florida , Tax@@ i@@ services , and his Twitter account is full of messages related to the use of the pres@@ enter through its predecessor . &quot;
&quot; the White House is enthusiastic about the show &quot; Made in America &quot; - the products from all 50 states that are manufactured by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the Deputy Press@@ ese@@ ed of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 @-@ occup@@ ations often lead training flights in the area around Washington and the South Law@@ n through to reset the U.S. Pres@@ idents in the White House with precise cent@@ imet@@ al movements .
&quot; as a Tru@@ mp in early July at the G@@ 20 Summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 was conducted in the White House of 58 exercising . &quot;
&quot; the flight for the &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event count on training needs of the airline for the month , said an official . &quot;
hel@@ icopter units flew in addition to 11 hours on this day for &quot; non @-@ pres@@ ets emissions . &quot;
&quot; the White House said that tax@@ pay@@ ers were the burden for none of the other requ@@ is@@ ites , which were presented at the event . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ man of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky said , the company was not involved in the hel@@ icopter on the South Law@@ n . &quot;
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not hold any bud@@ get@@ ing design@@ ations for the pres@@ idential elections , and it is difficult to determine the exact costs of the event . &quot;
&quot; according to St@@ und@@ ent@@ ric of the US Ministry for the fis@@ cal year 2017 , the DO@@ D @-@ refund is for the V@@ H @-@ 3D but 24.@@ 380 USD per flight . &quot;
records of unity draw the flight time of the aircraft than 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Cor@@ ps Air Fac@@ ility in Quant@@ ico in Virginia .
the White House argu@@ ed that the actual cost of operation of the hel@@ icopter is far below this rate .
&quot; the costs of tax@@ pay@@ ers on the basis of estimates for the refund is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; this estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual means . &quot;
&quot; according to a R@@ AND study from the year 2015 the refund for DO@@ D does not contain personnel costs , but take into account the cost of fuel , maintenance and contract . &quot;
&quot; at this time the former press review of the White House , Sean Sp@@ ic@@ er , the use of hel@@ icopter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present this week things which are produced in America , &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot;
&quot; and I know that S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and the State Connecticut are very proud of that they contribute to our national security , and I go out that hundreds , if not even thousands of people dependent . &quot;
and I think like most Americans are all proud of the hel@@ icopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have been ti@@ reless .
&quot; of course , it is appropriate to emphas@@ ize that . &quot;
&quot; it was not clear whether Tru@@ mp were inter@@ viewed with the hel@@ icopter , when he entered his tour over the South Law@@ n for the event , but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat of a fireplace . &quot;
&quot; in the White House , Tru@@ mp spoke to representatives of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and j@@ ok@@ ing with the media about his own fleet of corporate products . &quot;
&quot; I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky very good , &quot; said the President , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;

the TC blue @-@ White Ne@@ uss takes place at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel at the Tab@@ ell@@ end@@ al Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer SV .
&quot; despite five games still mac@@ ell@@ os@@ er balance , the peak of the second tennis @-@ Bundes@@ l@@ iga has received the sense of reality . &quot;
teamwork Mar@@ ius Z@@ ay has no respect for the opponent .
&quot; this is a compact team , that always plays in quite similar formation . &quot;
&quot; especially on the rear positions , I find the team very good . &quot;
for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer SV provide the im@@ ports from the high north .
&quot; their plans and fin@@ s can even refer to the Davis Cup .
&quot; and they are also strong in double , &quot; says Z@@ ay overlooking Har@@ ri Hel@@ i@@ ova@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andre Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ read , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen as well as Andreas Bj@@ erre@@ hus ( all Denmark ) . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is always hard for us . &quot;

the Ne@@ uss@@ er team for the trip in the high north is practically .
his debut for blue @-@ white could be Max@@ ime Jan@@ .

&quot; but he should be in Kiel but also like Bot@@ ic Van de Zand@@ schul@@ p , N@@ iels Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and the Belg@@ ians Jul@@ ien C@@ agn@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; after his two vict@@ ories on the last Sunday at the Al@@ ster , Má@@ t@@ é Val@@ k@@ us@@ z could again put into the team again . &quot;

roll back : the city presents 46 kitchens ...
the city organized the K@@ ita @-@ lunch again itself .
with fixed contact partners for the children and a assignment to the team .
in the urban kinder@@ gart@@ ens the clock is re@@ directed .
&quot; in September 1 , the city Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply in the urban kinder@@ gart@@ ens facilities ( Kit@@ as ) . &quot;
&quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , dep@@ uty director in the field of youth , it is a good news : &quot; we are all very happy . &quot;
we will continue to be bo@@ iled except house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and delivers fresh sque@@ e@@ ed .
&quot; the city operates in the Kre@@ feld area of 46 kinder@@ gart@@ ens , in 44 get the children to lunch time a warm meal . &quot;
&quot; last Kit@@ aj@@ ar , more than 2800 children at the tables , and the need is growing constantly . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , not only children who will be looked after 45 weekends , at the K@@ ita at mid@@ day , &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; the offer also applies to 35 @-@ hour support , if children until 2 p.m. stay . &quot;
&quot; 46 sub @-@ time forces have turned from 1 September kitchen service : they war@@ med the dishes , complement the meals , raw materials and fruit , port@@ ion@@ ing the meal individually , giving the food out , clean and clean the kitchen . &quot;
&quot; employees are firmly assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
the size - there are two @-@ dig@@ ging equipment as well as sevent@@ y facilities - decides over the circum@@ ference .
&quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers belong to the K@@ ita @-@ Team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; thus , they are much more integrated and it is easier for the ital@@ izing easier , ped@@ agog@@ ical concepts . &quot;
because that is why it comes to healthy eating and cooking lessons .
&quot; the children should help , the food prepare . &quot;
the direct connection of the chef &apos;s team is there meaningful .
also for children .
&quot; they have a known force in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar to them and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the pur@@ ification of the K@@ ita rooms - so far the task of the kitchen forces - is now being done by special det@@ erg@@ ents .
&quot; this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - in addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen performance also the charm , which they experience in charge between self @-@ governmental and foreign delivery to the city as well as the most economical set out of the press . &quot;
and that although 46 sub @-@ time forces are new to be adjusted .
&quot; but these hours fall at around 750 people in the educ@@ ator area not so strong in weight , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;

G@@ MB @-@ concern over investments in the Mc@@ Vit@@ ie factory in Glasgow
an Union &apos;s union wishes to make a long @-@ term commitment to production in their work in Glasgow .
G@@ MB Scotland said the company took over the future of investments in the Tol@@ l@@ cross location .
&quot; more than 500 employees work in the work , which provides in addition to other products of Hob@@ bs and rich Tea bis@@ cuits . &quot;
Mc@@ V@@ ities owner Pl@@ adi@@ s said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
he added that staff and trade @-@ representatives as the first experience would change when their activities would change .
&quot; in a letter to the Fil@@ i@@ alle@@ iter of the company called G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vit@@ ie &apos;s on , &quot; raise concerns that financing for the modernis@@ ation of production lines will not be driven . &quot;
&quot; G@@ MB @-@ Senior @-@ organ@@ izer Dre@@ w Du@@ ff@@ y , said : &quot; &quot; the fact that we can win a clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tol@@ l@@ cross , our members are deeply concerned . &quot;
&quot; generations of families have worked here and the work@@ force focus on the local community and the large area Glasgow , an important pillar of decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social dis@@ advantage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , under the perspective of jobs , the wage and well @-@ being , and against the background of Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising life @-@ administration and the chron@@ ological production process , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needed a thri@@ ving production presence at Mc@@ Vit@@ ie . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ person of Pl@@ adi@@ s said : &quot; the Fil@@ i@@ alle@@ ite at Tol@@ l@@ cross has only received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will respond directly to this since we appreciate the continuous commitment of employees and trade unions . &quot;
&quot; we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at Tol@@ l@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed . &quot;
&quot; we discussed with the employees , that we operate as all companies that are active in an extremely competitive and uns@@ afe economic , our business regularly review - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to be competitive . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; &quot; in recent years we have invested in our Tol@@ l@@ cross location more than 5 million pounds , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot;
&quot; we recognize the heritage of Tol@@ l@@ cross as a production facility , and all of you should change our operations on the site , the employees and their trade union will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona war@@ ned three years ago by Ne@@ ym@@ ar ?
the side of La League likes their interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
&quot; Paris Saint @-@ Germain will not let the persecution of Ne@@ ym@@ ar , after it has given an offer of £ 189 million to dis@@ solve its free@@ zing cl@@ ause , but do they war@@ ned Barcelona before three years before the world war ? &quot;
&quot; the sens@@ ational approach has stopped the transfer window in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than dou@@ bled the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba in the past season for 89 million pounds to Manchester United . &quot;
&quot; after termination , Ne@@ ym@@ ar is to the most expensive players in the world and the highest paid professional athletes in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is angry about the way out when Ne@@ ym@@ ar has forced his way out outside the Catal@@ ans , although the Club has always given its best to take care of him since its arrival of Santos in 2013 . &quot;
but the football world was war@@ ned by the PS@@ G pres@@ idents in front of this prospect ?
&quot; as Manchester City 2014 interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ idi , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ a@@ ifi had a strict warning for any association who wanted to sign up one of the best players from PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players , then we will contact them in opposition to them , we will contact her player , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ a@@ ifi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; but if they try to sign one of our players with yourself , this will have consequences . &quot;
Barcelona seems to have exceeded these line with the Spanish club at the beginning of this summer &apos;s interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti express .
&quot; PS@@ G made clear that they would not allow the International to travel to Italy under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by taking one of their pricing for Ne@@ ym@@ ar . &quot;

interview : &quot; &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Report ent@@ last@@ y Pope Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Report to the mis@@ needed waste @-@ last@@ y Pope Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this means author and histor@@ ian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the Final Report to the Miss@@ ing sc@@ and@@ al at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further discussions .
&quot; Christian Weis@@ n@@ der , spokes@@ man of the reform movement &quot; &quot; We are the Church , &quot; explained by the former Reg@@ ens@@ burger Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller , as well as by the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year &apos;s brother of the emer@@ itus Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an exc@@ use . &quot;
&quot; it would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church , if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deeper understanding of their own sub@@ ways or their then false assessment of the processes . &quot;
&quot; the Vatican &quot; Os@@ serv@@ atore Rom@@ ano &quot; however , &quot; however , critic@@ ized the reporting of violence in the cathedral @-@ cl@@ amps with &quot; two levels &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with regard to the trans@@ ference in Regensburg , nobody knows that it should be prevented &quot; rib@@ bon and sham@@ eful deeds &quot; &quot; that the author of Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , as the author , and a member of the National Italian Bio@@ eth@@ ics Committee . &quot;
&quot; hab@@ it , the Catholic Church as a source of all ev@@ ils to describe , is part of the all @-@ day drive and prepar@@ es public opinion that is normal to normal , writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot;
also in Gl@@ oria of Thur@@ n and T@@ axis review in an interview with the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk : &quot; we would like to go to the church and this is a aw@@ less fres@@ co@@ es . &quot;
&quot; in addition , they pointed out that in their youth &quot; bl@@ ows have been a very normal ped@@ agog@@ ical means &quot; &quot; to talk with children , as I was one , ready to be done . &quot;
&quot; it is unfair to apply today &apos;s standards to earlier decades , because the world has changed . &quot;
in the context of reports about the Miss@@ ing attacks are often also pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
&quot; completely too wrong , the author and histor@@ ians Michael Hes@@ emann , who were translated to the &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; says H@@ esh@@ emann , &quot; &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; when he did the results of the thes@@ es . &quot;
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report presented by the dioc@@ ese Regensburg with the En@@ light@@ enment attor@@ ney Ulrich Weber ?
&quot; total 547 Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were killed between 1945 and beginning of the 1990s , with high level of plau@@ sibility , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen sexually . &quot;
&quot; in the final report it says to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , which was active from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg , so that from Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. has been applied in many cases forms of physical and mental violence . &quot;
&quot; especially in high emot@@ ion@@ ality , the punishment was able to fall off the punishment for the student . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , in contrast to many other compl@@ ained that many victims were subje@@ cted to the general humanity by R. , and therefore in numerous cases despite violence even more positive memories with it . &quot;
&quot; in the interview , H@@ esh@@ emann , the final report was declared at the Miss@@ ionary Dom@@ sp@@ atzen by the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in his opinion . &quot;
Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ pages report on the &quot; prevention of violence against the &quot; Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; is a contra@@ dict@@ ory picture by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; for a raise many students to raise his &quot; &quot; humanity &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; at the other he also appears as a Chol@@ er@@ iker and perfe@@ ction@@ ist , which was more often acted , if a domain was mus@@ ically @-@ mus@@ ically @-@ top @-@ performance . &quot;
how do you evaluate as his bio@@ graph this thesis ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann , if you have the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself rather than the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ever occurs in it . &quot;
he has just dedicated eight pages and he is clearly acqu@@ itted from any sus@@ pic@@ ion of the mid@@ day or co @-@ landscape in the terrible cases sexual abuse .
the non @-@ violence in the pre @-@ school occurred outside of its activity .
one can take him all of it too late or taken first an@@ cho@@ oses not seriously enough .
&quot; the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ agements , where he worked , was felt by virtually all respond@@ ents as - as literally - &quot; salvation , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; thus , the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also poses an excellent testimony that describes him as a warm @-@ heart@@ ed , &quot; &quot; thought@@ ful &quot; , &quot; thought@@ ful , &quot; &quot; kn@@ owled@@ geable , &quot; &quot; kn@@ owled@@ geable &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; said the guys regularly with cakes , bis@@ cuits , and Bon@@ bons . &quot;
only a minority compl@@ ained about his perfe@@ ction@@ ism and his high emot@@ ion@@ ality that also led to wh@@ ut@@ aus@@ al .
&quot; that he cast not only with chairs scar@@ ce and the mud , but also in ear@@ ed guys to the hair or ears , he has already given years ago , deeply regret and ap@@ olog@@ ize for it . &quot;
&quot; however , in his honour , it must be said that such survey@@ ing methods have been widely used in the question@@ able time , the 1960s and 19@@ 70s , with parents like teachers . &quot;
do you know even such breeding methods ?
&quot; of course , I think everyone of us was born before 1968 . &quot;
&quot; I also experienced this in a world@@ ly school , a state @-@ Gymnasium . &quot;
&quot; compared with what it actually goes to this report , namely the re@@ plac@@ eable sexual abuse and non@@ violence at the school , are the fre@@ il@@ ich Bag@@ at@@ elles . &quot;
&quot; as you know , if it is not more likely to do with his acquain@@ t@@ ance and his role as the brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media has just returned to him . &quot;
&quot; on the Bav@@ arian Pope , many who have never understood him , still e@@ ager . &quot;
but the truth is : the report is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
in the media the report was reported much about the subject of abuse at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
Georg R@@ atz@@ inger will also be put in conclusion on sexual abuse as a burden on sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : very clearly no .
no single of the 67 victims of sexual over@@ es claims to have familiar to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were consecr@@ ated .
&quot; I never dre@@ amed to speak with my father or my mother , &quot; &quot; said a affected dep@@ uty for the others , &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrassing . &quot;
the true problem with the clar@@ ification of sexual abuse was and yet is that most of the victims is silent .
&quot; if they do not even become parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a choir leader , who would certainly not have been a colleague who would have been a colleague of the perpet@@ rator . &quot;
how do we evaluate the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ students R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in regard to the missions ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : a gif@@ ted student set it so : &quot; &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case , in which he would have had made timely findings and would have been able to stop the respective perpet@@ rators . &quot;
&quot; I think it ... also for really absurd , to accept that ... &quot; Bu@@ ben in@@ trusive or more clear or more , have opened up to their parents , intern@@ ships , trust , etc . &quot;
that one speaks to him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; thus , the report on the very clear result : &quot; that in the field of interested students and / or their surroundings , it could not be confirmed in the context of the examination . &quot;
what sexual abuse affects is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus free from every ro@@ vis@@ as .
thus it cannot be t@@ ackl@@ ed him not prevented or brought him to the ad .
&quot; therefore , there is also no reason to bring his good name to these res@@ ist crimes , as it is unfortunately in some cases . &quot;
in the media there was a lot of &quot; violence &quot; at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thrown out in the report . &quot;
does he need to live with this accus@@ ation ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the big problem that in the reporting everything was mixed and rever@@ ed to a huge milking , sexual abuse and violence , and somewhere , right in the midst of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
but this is exactly what is a mis@@ use of the report .
&quot; namely , there is clean separate : between the pre @-@ school and the gymn@@ asium of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and violence as well as we say once , other accus@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the report alleg@@ ations of the period since 1945 , so also from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not a choir leader of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; the whole aw@@ ful test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases in which bu@@ ds of sa@@ dist@@ ic teachers were quite cont@@ ented and constit@@ uted , which occurred on the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ hofen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous states have to be ruled out . &quot;
&quot; but with them Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , for he got the boys first to face when they were already on the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ aging . &quot;
&quot; in which was , as the most witnesses emphas@@ ize the topic &quot; &quot; Vor@@ schule &quot; &quot; tab@@ oo . &quot;
one was just happy to be their escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; paradise &quot; states .
what was different on the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ aging school ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there were already discipline but not a sa@@ dist@@ al authority .
&quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report is coming to the conclusion that &quot; many victims were under@@ estimated that &quot; many victims of the general humanity by R. under@@ estimated , and therefore in numerous cases despite violence even more positive memories with it . &quot;
&quot; thus , at most still the fore@@ cast , can be taken away . &quot;
&quot; but despite all efforts the report could only define two periods , in which he was reported on the states of the pre @-@ school . &quot;
&quot; the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish himself and responsible from the events at a school , where he did not want to listen and responsible ( so the witness ) had nothing to hear , and then again around 1993 . &quot;
index@@ ed Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in front of the states consistently the ears ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : no , since 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ agements , which was even re@@ produced by the report . &quot;
&quot; in it he points this to that , &quot; that in the pre @-@ school we will continue to practice the audit@@ ed sentence . &quot;
&quot; already , given the danger of negative press of the sever@@ ance , he received urgent need . &quot;
&quot; of course , this was of course at a time when legal clarity existed , as a test result in Bavaria had long been b@@ anned . &quot;
&quot; before , it occurred in a legal gray area , as each one of us still knows . &quot;
there was also difficult for him to guess where the affected might have been ex@@ agger@@ ated or dramatic and where really the per@@ mis@@ sible limit was exceeded .
&quot; however , one can not say he could always have gone . &quot;
this is simply not true .
&quot; only in 1980 , the audit@@ ed at schools was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria too . &quot;
&quot; Princess Gl@@ oria of Thur@@ n and T@@ axis said yes , it was unfair to apply today &apos;s educational standards to the time . &quot;
how do you see that ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we histor@@ ians speak there from the &quot; &quot; Fall@@ ing of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; thus the danger to assess their moral standards . &quot;
the prin@@ cess has already been right .
&quot; but this is of course not true for sexual abuse , which was ab@@ stain@@ ed at all times and also not for what in the pre @-@ school of contradictions and violence against in@@ no@@ cent children , which goes far beyond that at that time . &quot;
&quot; this is all completely terrible and I &apos;m glad that it will finally be revealed . &quot;
&quot; but at the same time I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protecting , for all this had nothing to do with him . &quot;
&quot; his means to discipl@@ ining and punishment , so ear@@ thy and in the hair and ears were widespread in the 19@@ 70s . &quot;
&quot; when physical punishment then it was forbidden , he also has strictly kept it . &quot;
which image of his reg@@ ens@@ burger time has Georg R@@ atz@@ inger because in talks with you for the book &quot; My brother of the Pope &apos; ?
came the subject of audit@@ or at the same time as speech ?
&quot; Michael H@@ emann : well , in the book it is about life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , tells out of his perspective , as the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen played only a side @-@ roller . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , I am not at all that he led there to be a strict Reg@@ iment . &quot;
&quot; but it has to be said once again : without these perfe@@ ction@@ ism , without the demand un@@ condition@@ ally discipline , it would have been hardly possible from which until then rather national known Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen an institution of space tran@@ sp@@ ies of Europe and its musical tradition , which went the same twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with bis@@ cuits and cand@@ y alone , one makes no big singers and above every success , right in which area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ healing . &quot;
as what kind of people you have experienced by Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in talks about their book ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond I have experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really well , and again experienced as wonderful , hum@@ orous , ground@@ ed , deep smooth and heart@@ ed good people , from which one could not imagine that he could only do something a fly . &quot;
&quot; I am regularly updated with how many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen still today , 23 years after his Emer@@ ging , regularly contact him to visit him , he is almost blind - and to treat it as a member of her family . &quot;
&quot; those who are not for@@ given him up to today , that he was strictly strict to them , so are clearly in the minority . &quot;
&quot; most Dom@@ sp@@ atzen are today thank@@ ful to him today , that he enriched her life and brought them to the world of music . &quot;
&quot; and that he always became a good , v@@ ä@@ ter@@ ful teacher - a strict father , certainly that may be - but also a ador@@ able respect@@ able son , to whom she is still standing today and to worship them . &quot;
&quot; and please , once again , all that you cast him are y@@ os@@ ening methods that were then on the day of the day . &quot;
we can be glad that we have long been overcome this time .
&quot; but it is most un@@ just , a man , just because he is prominent and one more prominent brother has to make the medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at . &quot;
&quot; and the evil intention that stands behind it , only too obvious . &quot;
&quot; for the report , who was just published , relie@@ ve him . &quot;
&quot; now it would have acquired an 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria and maybe in Germany probably no one would like to know the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
