<seg id="8">"the historical maps of the digital Bavaria Atlases, a quotation of the geoportals of Bavaria of the government, are anything but currently very enlightened."</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare it with current online maps.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the cities and communities in the spread-area of the Munich Merkur has changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the digital Bavaria-Atlas is an Flickr, which is not seen as such."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the big oversized card have been incorporated for cities and communities for more detail, so-called urine leaves."</seg>
<seg id="13">This resulted in accordance with the Bayerische Staatsmessengers between 1810 and 1864 and released the first measurement of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army-leader Bayern since the spring of 1800 during the Second World War II with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographic recording of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">"even if the French troops with the peace of LUNÉVILLE from 9 February 1801 finally passed: there were the present neighbours, which created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria map."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph was progressing the project, founded the" Topographical Bureau "- and thus the Bayerische Staatsoper administration."</seg>
<seg id="19">The WP sheet for Munich dates back to the year 1856 and can be found like any other on the website of the Bayerische Staatsbibliothek.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of Early / Today is most impressive in the example of the country's capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has spread itself in all directions and has grown up.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is subsendling that appears in the map of 1856 still relatively isolated.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Sendling was set up for 21 years after creation of the map, so 1877, as Münchner district."</seg>
<seg id="24">Today Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">"the homes of Untersendlings focus in 1856 along the present plingshot road that was only named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the insurrection of the Bavarian peasants against Austria 1705."</seg>
<seg id="26">"where today is the Westpark is, one sees nothing more than fields - at first glance: when Hindemooms appears a smaller-piece card with tutzing lines and numbers: handmade Flurings made of the so-called" "document", "which was derived from the basic tax."</seg>
<seg id="27">Small pitches have no farmers on this day - but Kleingärtner of the plant "country in sun.</seg>
<seg id="28">A large founders stands north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Theresienwiese, since 1810 locations of the Oktoberfests, in the 19th century there was a meadow - and no concrete."</seg>

<seg id="31">"in the sphere of the present district Au-Haidhausen, one is not only the street" "Gasteig" "or from the ascent" "On the ventilation" "- but also in large letters" "Irren Anstalt". ""</seg>
<seg id="32">"yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße, people used to be with madness."</seg>
<seg id="33">There was 1858 / 59 the Münchner circle-Irrenanstalt "on the Auer Lüch.</seg>
<seg id="34">"from 1872 the Dr. Bernhard of Gudden, the establishment of the psychiatrist, which is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwigs."</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was advanced for his time and ended, for example the Ankle of the so-called Irren."</seg>
<seg id="36">"in addition, he is forbidden to apply violence against the insets," says Hermann Wilhelm, Head of the Museum Haidhausen, who has worked for an exhibition with the Anstalt. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"for 280 patients had first place, later on 500 places it was expanded."</seg>
<seg id="38">Sometime also this capacity is no longer considered - the reason for the construction of the roundabout in hair 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">"there have been the Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-East, one of the largest psychiatries in Germany."</seg>
<seg id="40">On the Areal of the former Auer Anstalt now meet young people in Munich Salesianum.</seg>

<seg id="44">"the Marienplatz was at 1856 as" "Head Square" "the department called" "Kaufinger Gasse." "</seg>
<seg id="45">A crucial change brought the Second World War also in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The Bombs of the Allies in December 1944 many holes in the city center.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big stayed until today - at Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">"the German Institute, small business buildings and a pit chapel from the Middle Ages once stood on Marienhof, where these days were the pre-work and on 5 April 2017 the Spatenstich are made for the second S-Bahn line."</seg>
<seg id="49">"with the slider, the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and the hole on Marienhof."</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil rights group before travel warder for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the Promotion of coloured has issued a warning for colourful people who are travelling on the discriminating politics and the racist attacks of the state to Missouri.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the federal state Missouri which should enter into force up to 28 August 2017, as a series of questionable, racenbased incidents shall occur in recent times throughout the whole state and be noted here in the opinion of the group."</seg>
<seg id="53">"a recently adopted law of Missouri, which makes people more difficult to gain discrimination, as well as the prosecution authorities of the state, the disproportionate force of minorities, the disproportionate group, said the NAACP."</seg>
<seg id="54">They have violations of the citizen's rights to happen.</seg>
<seg id="55">"they are stopped for their skin color, they will be merged or killed," "said the President of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star."</seg>
<seg id="56">"we hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not yet heard."</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that has issued the organisation for a state in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the group quoted incidents like racist Verses against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">"Sanders died under questionnworthy circumstances at the beginning of the year, when he had taken no gasoline during the journey through the State of Missouri in custody, without a crime of criminals."</seg>
<seg id="60">"the Council also points to a recently published report by the Office of the Secretary General of Missouri in which it is shown that black driving force in the state 75 percent are more common than circumcised."</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and their families, friends and staff informed about what could happen in Missouri", "said Chapel."</seg>
<seg id="62">People need to be willing to bring it to Kautsky or relatives that they travel through the state.</seg>
<seg id="63">"Missouri back in 2015 100 Hasscrimes, according to the latest figures from the Hassle-report of the FBI, which is the state in relation to the number of such injury to the 16th rank of the country."</seg>
<seg id="64">"the travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri's law, which would make it harder to complain a company because of residential or employment discrimination."</seg>
<seg id="65">"previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) travel warned for Texas and Arizona, after the states of immigrants have passed, the local law enforcement authorities committed to relieve people because of immigration to further racial profiled."</seg>
<seg id="66">"travel openings are usually issued by the Foreign Ministry for other countries, but in recent times have stakeholders the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the USA."</seg>
<seg id="67">Weidezaunproject is elementary-related</seg>
<seg id="68">The hereditary Weidezaun project is a success-project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU-Bundestagsabp Peter White and Kordula Kovac have sent a picture on site.</seg>
<seg id="70">"at the Archennenhof family Schwendemann met representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU-village, together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MEPs."</seg>
<seg id="71">"Markus Schwendemann granted first insights into his farm, in which he is 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest swans, 40 dairy cows, and also houses many kittens and houses in five apartments holiday guests."</seg>
<seg id="72">"the" "Schwarzwaldmilch" "is for him the agull-free product line for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the Feriengaeste is exclusively regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">"as he is also called BLHV President of Fischbach, he called the Weidezaunproject as an" elementary project. ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I can carry on such steep areas not profitable economies.</seg>
<seg id="76">"the green environment care for a lot of work, much mates with the motorsense are processed."</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have to fight here with the terms and conditions with the Topography," "stressed Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="78">"in 2003 he took over the elevated operation and entertains these without chemical planting protection and fertilizers, even if he is not a bioenterprise."</seg>
<seg id="79">"for Mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear:" "the Commune has recognized the meaning of the Weidezren project, and is happy to know about the leader."</seg>
<seg id="80">"at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, the farmers would have to be supported."</seg>
<seg id="81">Hope that the forceasing of the areas could be gone even quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the biggest treasure we have, are the people who work in agriculture and make thoughts about how they continue their operation," stressed the Mayor. "</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers stand by promoting many times in criticism</seg>
<seg id="84">Over the Weidezaunts were fenced in 2013 a total of 25 plots from eleven participants.</seg>
<seg id="85">"the disclosure surface is thus 40 hectares, which can not be raised until at least 2023."</seg>
<seg id="86">"from the total cost of 71 500 euro, half over Leader was promoted, a quarter carried the municipality of fishing."</seg>
<seg id="87">"thus, the farmers remained 12 610 Euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres Weidezaun."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," said Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="89">"Kordula Kovac stressed:" "you do not make a really good job, without farmers and land."</seg>
<seg id="90">Also for Peter white stood firm: "here are the best food produced."</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscrutiny line (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows the state promotion of pastures.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is the disclosure of the Schwarzwalds.</seg>
<seg id="93">Condition is the presence of one of the LPR-named conveyors.</seg>
<seg id="94">"in addition, the insignificant surface must not be bad (hanging over 35 percent) and must be threatened by the fortification."</seg>
<seg id="95">"for 2018, Weidezaunproject 2018 currently runs the application of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build a little 16 kilometers fence."</seg>
<seg id="96">"the disclosure surface corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros."</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">"now, the White House of Trump takes the Statue of Liberty"</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is it when they begin to attempting the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans estimate this as well as any other - hence the painstaged Sturz Saddam Hussone at the Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he did a symbolic axe into a bright argument with Jim Acosta from CNN on the proposals of the drastic limitation of legal migration with the Statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="102">"to stay fair, Miller does not handle the statue itself."</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of jetties and Liberty-Imitators would have had it punched if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but he took their meaning, and in particular the meaning that you have written, when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the memorial, was added to his base."</seg>
<seg id="105">"as Miller Acosta, I will not enter into a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... an symbol of American freedom, which illuminated the world."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the poem, which you relate to which later was added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is obvious, but how he formed it himself, it is not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about the contemporary resonance on the ascending words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state does not only charge any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor:" "your wounds, your arms, to breathe out, free to breathe, to the miserable waste of your rich coastal."</seg>
<seg id="109">"there was never a time, in which the" "apostasy waste" "was better seen on our screens."</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller dedicated himself in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural struggle: it is indeed a conflict around the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who sat down to place their words after their death at the base - knew very good that they had a high-political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American Republicans by putting the female embodiment of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem is the female figure out no longer abstract - it has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she herself gives herself a very different name: mother of the exilants.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist Coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and exactly how Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people of the right wing wanted to change it for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the great cry as Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is argued, but rather an early neokonservo be that the American flame is moving into the world." Lady Liberty goes forward. "</seg>
<seg id="119">It is supposed to carry the torches of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch should not shine the way to the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual is Limbaugh here on something stamped.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is quite and certainly a question of the perception of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great imaginative fact of Lazarus was to see it as they were seen by the exhausted, but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships have been viewed."</seg>
<seg id="124">"it is in the truest sense to see the world from the perspective of men, the refuge and a chance to improve their lives."</seg>
<seg id="125">Her statue speaks to them the words of hope and will of the will they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">"and of course, this is not the perspective that Miller and Trump will ever be able to acknowledge."</seg>
<seg id="127">"your torch should not shine the path, but the hate which is the only source of power to ignite."</seg>
<seg id="128">World championship 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the team of Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="129">"Eilidh Doyle reminds of a time, when only two Schotten belonged to the team of Great Britain."</seg>
<seg id="130">"the director of the Athletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-headed Scottish contingent in the world championship will make a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athlete was selected for London 2017 which starts on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="132">Black believes that "in Scotland has developed something special, and the athletics of the United Kingdom has something to learn from it."</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it and we try to understand it, and we will continue to find it until we find it," said Black. "</seg>
<seg id="134">I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think that it has something to do with what they did.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish Athlets think that it has something to do with what they did.</seg>
<seg id="136">British Athletics: it has something to do with what they did.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type at the road.</seg>
<seg id="138">"whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="139">"several of the Scottish Athleten are medals-candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - which was elected against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m Route, while Eilidh Doyle was elected to the team at the team captain."</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eilidh is quite modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">"their captain's speech was incredible," says Black. "</seg>
<seg id="142">"a series of athletes, no matter whether they were scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very motivates."</seg>
<seg id="143">"the passion and the real feeling, the Eilidh brought quite naturally, were great."</seg>
<seg id="144">"the Commonwealth of silver medal, who will compete with their fifth world championships at the 400-m hurdles, says that it is" "incredible" "that 16 Caves are in the British team."</seg>
<seg id="145">"Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, who were achieved in 1983 and 2015."</seg>
<seg id="146">The midwiper Muir runs on this path and has placed two European records last year.</seg>
<seg id="147">"it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runners."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, the 1.500 m is another one, which one should be included in a great season which should observe the victory at the British team trials and the Anniversary Games."</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle reminds of their first world championship as the only other carrot in the team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">"the scientists of the capitulate says that they are" "enormously" "of the fact that many of their land sleeves not only belong to the team, but in some cases also among the medals and at the finals."</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing about this team is to be chosen that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so that it was a great honour for me, but knowing that my team-mate for me and have chosen to make it something very special for me," she added. "</seg>
<seg id="152">Obviously I am very proud of all the villi that belong to the team.</seg>
<seg id="153">It just shows how far we come.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to rise on Podiums."</seg>
<seg id="155">What my speech affects the chapters?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think it went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation since we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to set up this home support and benefit from it that we are back at the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">"I get a second chance to go there and compete, and there will be just such a great atmosphere out there."</seg>
<seg id="160">Block of critics on Facebook: do not take care of a public office if you do not wear the arrangements of voters.</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">"the Americans loved George Washington, but it took not long until the newspapers took him because of all that, from the inner policy up to its political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">"he pimed in criticism, sure."</seg>
<seg id="164">But he has not brought his critics to silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">"for in 1783 Washington:" "the freedom of expression can be taken away - and, stupid and stumm we will run as the sheep on the slaughter."</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland to governor Larry Hogan who needs to work on it to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 persons and deleted that their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union put him in the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"the rod of the Governor did the complaint as frivol, and the online comment was full of a counter-reaction with" Na, and?. "</seg>
<seg id="170">"it is only Facebook," said many people. "</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is particularly important if it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">"this is a republican Governor in an overwhelming democratic state, which is amazingly popular."</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second-second agreement of the 50 Governor of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary Hitzhead.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict compliance with the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very sent to use Facebook as a primaiden funds to connect with its voters and play his hairy head according to chemotherapy in his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">"therefore, the blocking of people who come to the side of the Governors - the public Forum is, which is officially referred to as officially and by staff who are paid with public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="179">"in an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans Speaker Amelia Chasse the actions of the governor and argues that blocking the comments is nothing more than a moderation."</seg>
<seg id="180">"but it is too simple to use the image of trouges or spammers, or hasserted people, which sponges online the whip."</seg>
<seg id="181">The mail spoke with some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">"and these are only real people who talk to their chosen leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, no trolls."</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane. "</seg>
<seg id="184">The pastor quoted the Bible in his post and appelled at Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">"attorney in Lakshmi Sarma Ramani from Bowie, Md., was not hasserted, but she asked about hate crimes."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I commented polite that I was disappointed, that there was no reaction to all-hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the commentary box of the posting "" The Post. "" "</seg>
<seg id="187">"I don't appreciate this idea if a number of people at the same subject takes place, then they are more likely to be mistaken by some of them as a so-called collective employment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">"what the employees of the governor as" focused Spam attack, others would probably call "intercession." "</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply setting a critic or a negative comment deleted.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much immer than in former time when you have done the same thing to collect newspapers to gather newspapers with critical ladders and to burn protesters or protesters.</seg>
<seg id="191">But exactly this is exactly digital.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public officials who has criticised the Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is charged by Twitter-users who were blocked from his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question fell last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">"the Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County deceived the First Amendment, according to the U.S. district of James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she preaching a voters by her facebook site."</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky received Governor Matt Bevin (R) also a visit from the ACLU because of its use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so hard.</seg>
<seg id="198">"at the moment of Washingtons, the time of affordable portos had a similar effect as the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers noted between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous envelope clever on its leadership. "</seg>
<seg id="200">And even at that time Washington anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">"the people, the pseudonyms like" "Juricola", "Valerius," "Belisarius" and "Portius", "wrote all the letters to newspapers, the Washingtons decisions made."</seg>
<seg id="202">"petitions, which have collected its position on the contract of Amity, trade and shipping with Great Britain, according to the historical documents that were collected by the online Papers of George Washington Project."</seg>
<seg id="203">But he has not brought them to silence.</seg>
<seg id="204">Freedom of expression and disagreements are the basis of our nation.</seg>
<seg id="205">And true leadership means to accept that.</seg>

<seg id="1410">"this happened in the end of February, when someone gave to the president malicious a printed copy of an article by Gotnews.com, the website of the Internet-Provokateurs Charles C. Johnson, who was the source behind a heap to be of Lecks" in the White House. "</seg>

<seg id="1534">"moreover, the Iron plate can also be broken under voltage and could fall, if at a keyword a piece of slow."</seg>
<seg id="1535">"the melting of Schelfeis and Eisberg increases the level of level, as it is on the water swimming and ice cream as much water as it gives to the melting itself."</seg>
<seg id="1536">"however, the loss of the Schelect is that the glaciers can go directly to the sea, and can be able to flow much faster than before."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"this could possibly increase the level, but only in the court, writes the British research project to the observation of the Antarctica (Midas)."</seg>

<seg id="1540">There it breaks off regularly.</seg>

<seg id="1811">"but on this day, in the shadow of her own tragedy, they came together to talk about security."</seg>
<seg id="1812">It was communicated to them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">"two high-level journalists discuss what is more secure: they are supposed to take their children with the office, the 2009 goal of an attack with granules were, or they were at home."</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security forces have three words written on a plate on the front of the room: opponent, Neutral, allies. "</seg>
<seg id="1815">"they ask the reporter, names for each column - no proof is necessary, perceptions and pancakes."</seg>
<seg id="1816">"there are addicts, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspicious, on the hearing-list of the government or cartelle, a catalog of criminals to make the chaos of Mexico dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"there is no rest period of violence, and while throughout the land there are more journalists: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto in December 2012 will be up to attacks and threats under Bundesschutz, and until now there was at least seven dead in seven states."</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter there is their editors and its inspirations of Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas. "</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and journalist," wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence associated with drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="1820">"its absence will be deeply felt, although its presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, which shows his mid-finger with the word" Justice "" on the façade of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts that will show his smiling face with glasses or its typical panamahut. "</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop will take place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared topics, trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although 2010 has been established a probe-law firm in order to process the cases of journalists, this according to the Committee for the protection of journalists only have been introduced to the protection of journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with most thousands of Morden, which are connected every year with drug trading and organised crime, the murderer of journalists are rarely questioned."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"at Riodoce, they are still insist to treat the violence of Sinaloa, even though they are uneven east and although the terrain is still oblique."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without information on the killer, without justice, the meeting regarding the discussion of the safety little benefits, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very dumm to waste my time in this workshop," says he. "</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we do not know the Why, we don't know all."</seg>
<seg id="1828">In the morning of May 15 Valdez is the office of the newspaper Riodoce office in the capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he made it only to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla from two men was stopped. he was shot out of his car and 12 times he was shot down, presumably because of the name of the paper - which is translated with" "Zwölfter River". ""</seg>
<seg id="1830">The scraper went away in his car and defeated it in the vicinity.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adults.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the topic Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzmans reportability last year and delivery to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloody slaughteries of the country, since rivaling groups have been struggling to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it is nothing that in Sinaloa every day someone or more people are shot at the street or that the cemetery is full of distorted, two-storey moleen for drug addicts, which are larger than many houses for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">"forget for a minute that there is a state of" peace "," if only a Kartell has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs-merchandise in the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="1838">"nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, with the guilt that he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"first, in February the publication of an interview with Damascus Lopez, one leaders of one of the rivalled Kartellings in the war with Guzmans sons."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this publication likes the sons of angry, suspected women, any copy of the issue on as soon as it was delivered to Zeitungskiosk."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second error was to force Valdez, after the confiscation of a different newspaper, which had published the same history, leaving the country to his own security."</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez has been a legend in Mexico and abroad and his killing is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had so long survived that his friends and colleagues felt that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">"he worked in 2003 as experienced reporter for Noroeste, when he joined together with five colleagues in the founding of Riodoce and 50 US dollars."</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa, it was impossible to operate journalism to encounter without the predowry problem," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1847">"with the time the newspaper earned a reputation because of courageous and honest coverage, and sales and advertising."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporters loved it, hard passable investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else could treat."</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the creation of Riodoce she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot-Prize" for its coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the protection of journalists in the persecution of Mexican drugs, where always it led."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave voluntary to that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"" "I would like to continue," "he said to the time of CPJ."</seg>
<seg id="1853">"drug trading in Sinaloa" is a way of life, "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV."</seg>
<seg id="1854">You will need to take the task to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb.</seg>
<seg id="1855">"I do not want to be asked," "What did you do in the face of so many dead... why did you not tell what went before?"</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the Riodoce team mixed by Valdez, the Spaßvogel, which was like a dockworkers, the friend, the generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive."</seg>
<seg id="1857">You trust in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He always would bear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always go to El Guayabo, the bar facing the office, go and sit there at the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">"well, ask them: was his love for the routine of his inheritance?"</seg>
<seg id="1861">"his death also has forced to ask her to question their own assumptions about it, as they can do their work best and remain in life."</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they do not like you to move with their wives, their children, their cleanest shops, their homey and runways" to move drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-catering and self-preservation."</seg>
<seg id="1865">His own instincts trust.</seg>
<seg id="1866">"when it smells wrong, stay away from it."</seg>
<seg id="1867">"anger is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal, that" smell a sense that can be delusion... and then the thing is happening with Javier. "</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the old rules, as he and others say, are no longer in Sinaloa no longer - just as not as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero, guerrero, guerrero, weak institutions and corrupt government officials."</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is changing constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">"in the room, in which the employees from Riodoce to the Security Council, there were suddenly no phones allowed. days before, Spyware, who is sold solely to governments, for monitoring journalists and activists in Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1871">"outside two policemen, protection against the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree."</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a mid-class area of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">"half in the Scherz, some of the reporters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of policemen, which is the governor itself as not trustworthy."</seg>
<seg id="1874">"it is months ago, since the reporter went into the mountains, where the drugs de facto are under control."</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week Riodoce has turned out to three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the former known Boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">"they also had an exposé among the citizenship, which focused on the hometown of the Governors."</seg>
<seg id="1878">"and there was a group, which led in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block away from the office of the State's old town."</seg>
<seg id="1879">"there was no official word about who kidnapped or how it came to pass, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favourite local from drug trucks and authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1880">"a reporter learned from public records, that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who ruled the governors of the Party Party (Pri) which dominate almost the whole century all political levels."</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently several pri governors were accused due to high-class cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">"Villarreal bat the reporter, about previous incidents in this local to write, including one, in which a son of" El Chapo "Guzman escaped to a military incident."</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months before the reader would have seen the Kolumne of Valdez as the most informed source of the kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"earlier we had already knew what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "" El FLACO "" because of its slender body stature. "</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now, all channels of communication with our sources are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">"the office of Valdez has been dedicated to storage space for signs and stickers who have been devoted to the murder of journalists, because the employees have become something that they had never expected, activists on behalf of the press."</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez schnapped a few signs and went to a demonstration in the next morning because of another journalist to the office of the state.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">"a burnt body was discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests that it is."</seg>
<seg id="1890">"throughout the country, journalists have turned out to be tougher in organised protests" SOS Press "." "</seg>
<seg id="1891">"on this day, the director of Bojorquez is taken away in Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the case Valdez."</seg>
<seg id="1892">"at a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez the authorities to bring journalists, and bring them to them because they have said the truth."</seg>
<seg id="1893">"she has since then asked that she is divided by the government again, because it is concerned that their anger has been violated their objectivity."</seg>
<seg id="1894">Valdez had repeated that journalists in Mexico from organised crime to involved in the government agencies and an equal company. "</seg>
<seg id="1895">"in his last book" "Narco Journalism", "he wrote that reporter are not only killed by drugs, but also on the command of politicians and security forces that organised with organised crime under a ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="1896">"" "Articulo 19" "Articulo 19" "has been assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials in the past year."</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico you are afraid, because they would like you disproporty the mouth," said Ramirez. "</seg>
<seg id="1898">Obviously the murder have a deterrent effect.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Nobody forgetting the death of the bloggerin Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern boundary state of Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">"your body was found along with a note that was said to be signed by Zetas-Kartell," here I am because of my reports. "</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer sampling and headsets lay in addition to their separated head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">"some branches have chosen to close, like the newspaper El Norte, in the northern boundary state of Chihuahua after the assassination of the correspondent Miroslava Breach in March."</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others continue to do as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo after the assassination of her director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">"in 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez took public to the drug card with a Editorial on the title page with the heading" What do you want from us? "</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists are from their homeland or even flown from the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a pain decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">"it is hard to find work in exile, and they still watch the streets and look for dangers."</seg>
<seg id="1908">"and sometimes they are geared, as it seems to be murdered to the photographer of Reuinosa, the 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico-city three months after the escape from Veracruz."</seg>
<seg id="1909">"for those who continue to stay and continue, it is a daily dance with risky decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1910">Ibarra who once wanted to be poets there is that the drug trading carries it over.</seg>
<seg id="1911">"Mexico goes to hell, and therefore I became reporter," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="1912">"at midnight on the last Friday, when the last issue was finished, the reporters of Riodoce was on the pavement in front of the office and drank beer, than once all their telephones started."</seg>
<seg id="1913">A series of shootings with taperivals and security forces in the vicinity of the bathes Mazatlan had left its dead.</seg>
<seg id="1914">The war escalated on how it was promised by a series of Kartell messages in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1915">From the Bordsteinkante they have published the news on the website of Riodoce on mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The title page had to be changed on the next day.</seg>
<seg id="1917">Sirens heulens close to - another shooting in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Bojorquez draws a look at the policemen who have stopped to see if they were in willingness.</seg>
<seg id="1919">If they were afraid that they did not show it.</seg>
<seg id="1920">"under the huge portrait of the fallen founders of the newspaper, whose midfinger was visible to all Sinaloa, followed the staff of Riodoce his tracks."</seg>
<seg id="1921">"how can you only think about it," "said Bojorquez," "if at the same day, the practitioner was murdered to send it to the coverage on the street."</seg>
<seg id="1922">Dinosaurs used camouflage to diversify its enemies.</seg>
<seg id="1923">At first sight it looks like a statue, though a terrifying. "</seg>
<seg id="1924">"now, researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible Nashorns of a Canadian mountain work were so well preserved that experts have described it as" Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs. "</seg>
<seg id="1925">"it was so well preserved that they could even find that his scupy skin of reddish Braun was - and they said, she would have had something from a" "tranquil past." ""</seg>
<seg id="1926">"the report in the magazine" Current Biology "presents him as" the best preserved dinosaurs that has ever been found, and one of the best dinosaurs copies of the world. "</seg>
<seg id="1927">The Fossil is a newly discovered kind of Nodosaurs which lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period before between 110 million and 112 million years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1928">"his incredibly good preserved state has researcher who described it as" "really remarkable", "fade"</seg>
<seg id="1929">According to reports in National Geographic is the panzerte species fresser the best preserved Fossil of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">"Shawn Funk was found in the Suncor Millenium Mine in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1931">"he met something that seemed to see from the surrounding cliffs at the Platze, and decided to see more accurately."</seg>
<seg id="1932">That of him discovered Fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">"they spent the next six years ago, the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) heavy peppers."</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all this hard work the finished product is now ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you only have a little bit with the eyes blinking, you could almost believe that it's slept," "said the Hauptautor Caleb Brown, scientists in the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to be seen."</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will enter into the scientific history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs copies, the Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers have found that this plant eaters, though he is covered with a armor and a walled tanks is similar, probably by meat eager dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the strong gearmored dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage, in order to hide predators, and used a shielding technology that is used as counterpart, which is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this would have allowed to mix better in its environment and to diversify its enemies, say experts, which suggests that it was threatened by major dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the family of the Nodosaurs has made his first headlines in May and is now at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers have now studied the wild animal and it marked the wild animal and is called Borealistic Mark Mitchell, one of a team who has spent more than 7,000 hours with it carefully."</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing maintenance of the specimen allowed it to document Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the patterns and the form of scales and armours via his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered the contershady, a common defence method in the animal world, which means the top of the creature darker than its underside."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the convoy is common, the results are surprising, since the size of Borealopelta is far beyond that of the living animals."</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that the dinosaurs of enough pressure due to meat weighted dinosaurs that the evolution was favoured the confrontation of confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most contemporary animals that use the contemporteration - think of deer, zebras or belt animals - are much smaller and vulnerable as loot, which was signalized that this Nodosaurs was exposed to a real struggle for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong carnivore behavior based on a massive, strongly geological dinosaurs how dangerous the dinosaurs-carnivores have been to have been" "said Brown."</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists continue to investigate the animal on references about his life, including his conservative, Darminhaltes to find out what it has eaten as his last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaurs when he died, into a river, and pushed into the sea where he sank on the back to the sea."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at that time Alberta was as warm as southern florida today, and rivers and oceans probably much more widespread than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurs is really remarkable, because it is fully covered with preservated skin, but also in three dimensions remains and the original form of animal." "said Brown."</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that the animal is almost as exactly as in the early Cretaceous period.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you do not need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it. if you just want a little bit with the eyes, you could almost believe that he is at bedtime."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the Cretaceous period was a time when giant Theropoda, carnivore Dinosaurs who stood on two legs, the earth had gone through."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the king of them, the tyrannosaurus Rex, millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaurs was pushed by some of its furious ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"this belongs to Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six tons of heavy monster."</seg>
<seg id="1958">"the scientists, their latest findings in the journal Current Biology will believe that Borealopelta was reconciled after death in the sea and in the mud."</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he was in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum it is the best preserved dinosaurs of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely surrounded by muzzle to hips."</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and have grown up to 3.000 pounds (1.300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">"it included two 20-inch-long peaks, supported by his shoulders."</seg>
<seg id="1963">Researchers believe that the panzerte species of fresser was curved through the Western Canada until a flooded river it fluttered into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">"however, the underwater funeral of the dinosaur kept its armor in exquisite. detail."</seg>
<seg id="1965">"the remains of this particular specimen, are so well preserved that the Hautreste are still stocked along the dinosaur."</seg>
<seg id="1966">Like Michael Greshko written for National Geographic is such a level of preservation as "rarely as a win in the lotto numbers.</seg>
<seg id="1967">"the more I remember, the confuse it gets."</seg>
<seg id="1968">Hidden out of the skin still cover the hollow tank plates that carry the skull of the animal.</seg>

<seg id="2033">"in another video, she said, received a different policeman, and cried:" I will kill you... animals all kill. "</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not common," reminded Ferrell to their statement. "</seg>
<seg id="2035">That is not the kind of murder that we have accustomed to us and which we can only call.</seg>
<seg id="2036">At that moment I felt Schüttel.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept.</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a return trip and went to the next day at home.</seg>
<seg id="2039">"after landing at 23 o'clock she brought her 6-year old daughter from the house of her father, and decided that the two left the next morning to Ferguson."</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the subject of a new documentary," Whose Streets "," in the cinema starting from the 11. "</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a story of survival and protest, the love and loss of strength, the strength and the resistance, which is from the point of view of the people who live in the community and filled the streets to demand answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"as a ferrell with her daughter who carried out a cauliking and a suitable crown, after Ferguson, the two a conversation that she had countless times before this morning" over the black experience and the black condition. "</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remember how I have taught you when black people have to fight for this, what they believe?" remember what she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2044">We now go to Ferguson because the police has killed a 18-year-old boy and that was not correct.</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I could not take her away," "said Ferrell."</seg>
<seg id="2046">That which happened today is a highlight of its... what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">You have to know it and see it and being raised in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it must be well developed not only activism and organization, but also the different layers of the black experiences and the black constitution and what we have to do to free ourselves to free ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even if I have lucky to give her an experience, when they personally had no boatant racism, she is no different from the next black women child."</seg>
<seg id="2050">"I have the feeling, I would give her a bad service to hold them away."</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first stop when they arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authorities, when the activists were waiting for the possible non-accusation of officer Darren Wilson waited."</seg>
<seg id="2052">Ferrell and daughter joined together with a local business owner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags and halves them on protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly started a new kind of activism for ferrell form.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism has totally changed after 9 August, she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and was concentrated on food justice and health inequality in black communities."</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organising.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It is all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later I met Ferrell during an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan one of the co-directors of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2059">"Folayan said she and her Cameramann Lucas Alvarado-Farrar, wanted to be documented only" "documented", "what happened."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"a question came from Ferrell in the meaning:" "do you want to document, or tries to find a story that you can exploit?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">"this scepticism was nourished by countless cases of men, often from wives - in a community that benefited from their pain and its resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"like Folayan recently declared:" "we heard that people who were born in Ferguson and raised their voices and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">"Folayan had already worked together with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the field, who is known for his activism rum by todestrakt."</seg>
<seg id="2064">"his commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, together with six other locals followed the team of" Whose Streets "" in the years following browsers. "</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us. we speak," said Davis. "</seg>
<seg id="2066">"that was the main thing for me, as these people are represented, because I will be presented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the goal was not to focus on Ferrells experience - to show that it is not about a Messiah guide, but about a community that comes together," said Folayan - it proved to be the most important part of the film. "</seg>
<seg id="2068">"whose show documents of" Whose Streets? "surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrells life, as she loves and marry her wife."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and laughed when they saw the finished product for the first time. "</seg>
<seg id="2070">"but I have understood that there must be a certain vulnerability in this work, and in the inception of black people."</seg>
<seg id="2071">"in addition, Ferrells are repeated the role of black weak women in the wider Black-Lives movement."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of the movement, which are characterised by killing of the black teenager Trayby Martin in 2012 the film" "BlacklivesMatter" "in social media."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leaders have borne the movement in total," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, gay women must carry the main last of all."</seg>
<seg id="2075">Folayan agreed to notice that "the movement is really kept up by black women and many black women.</seg>
<seg id="2076">"however, it is clear that" this is no affirmative type of action, "in the herell because of their identity as the heart of the film was selected."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who shook this energy," "said them."</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is not a coincidence, although she was in front of the front, because in a life at these cruises as a black, swil woman is so much on the game."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel their energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">"meanwhile the news cameras in Ferguson have long gone, but the racial connections between the congregation and the police are still alive."</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is for 2 ½ years because of the blocking a highway on a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">"it describes the sociopolitical atmosphere of the area that they call her home:" "a mess." ""</seg>
<seg id="2083">"nevertheless, she sat down on a singing and she feels like going on this memory, since she went over three years ago in Ferguson onto the road."</seg>
<seg id="2084">It is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We have to love each other and assist.</seg>

<seg id="2088">From "dream" to "megalomania": TV-readers discuss bit gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves the people even though it is not yet built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping center at the south of the pedestrian zone divides since the first presentation of 2009 the population in advocates and opponents.</seg>
<seg id="2091">"cold, the theme hardly leaves."</seg>
<seg id="2092">"also on our Facebook page" Volksfreund Bitburg, "the subject will be discussed."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"while the one to the bit gallery say," that would be a dream "(Anja Becker) or" "that would be real class" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "" does not need man "(Siggi Betzen) or quite simply:" "megabahn!" (Lars Scholz). "</seg>
<seg id="2094">"while the advocates build that a gallery runs more customers to the city, of which the other businesses will benefit, fear the enemies that then stop the pedestrian zone."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"added: the gallery will be planned precisely on the property, on which the peasant market is marked, in the 13 direct marketers of their products."</seg>
<seg id="2096">With the start of construction will be the conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The Gallery-Macher want to integrate a Markthal in the new building - and a place for a place to sit outside sitting.</seg>
<seg id="2098">"Simone:" "we have been around for many years almost weekly in the peasant market for many years."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"mostly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the land rejoice again very much."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Even the butcher we have discovered for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">"we would like to reserve that even during and especially after construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer."</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities there is also.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Above all the small markings in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "whether direct marketers are based in a markings in the gallery, comes to the height of the rent."</seg>
<seg id="2105">"however, this is likely to be low in the new project but rather low."</seg>
<seg id="2106">"Eva Kilic:" "what's shopping in Bitburg?"</seg>
<seg id="2107">"clothing, shoes, dropping or supermarkets: I find the superfluous."</seg>
<seg id="2108">There is already enough in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">One looks like many stores here are empty - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">"but there is not even a decent weekly market, it is all the more important that us remains at least the market hall."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"because after all, the goods are made fresh, mostly directly from the producer and is very inexpensive."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"as you see, shop will be mixed in a shopping center only by larger companies, because the hortions are often not portable for a retailer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"shame there is almost no longer and what still exists, then will probably disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping center with a market hall fits me not together.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Above all: where is the peasant markings during the construction time?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old Edeka would be the solution - even in duration when the bit gallery will actually come.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or it creates the Gespenst bit gallery before, all the shops made from Bitburg? "</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "this is simply not going to work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"and a shopping center, which is empty, no one needs."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"in my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real peasant market instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">But for a peasant market there is no place thanks to the wahnsinning many - as I find - meaningless building projects in Bitburg is no place anymore.</seg>
<seg id="2123">"when the peasant market is building, a piece of culture will disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2124">A suitable similarity: artist creates portrait with Chelsea Mannings DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">"in the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York are many faces to see - white, black and brown, which are almost unlimited at the cables from the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupothills and Haarlem which were sent by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"panning sent the excerpts from the prison Fort Leavenworth, where the former secret analyst has made a 35-year-old prison sentence, having publicly made public messages on the WikiLeaks website."</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition that was opened on 2 August the A Becoming Requestance (A suitable similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">"it is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline has been converted into technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transformer and pioneering dissidents, whose condemnation of Barack Obama was converted when he was only three days in his ministry."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"Dewey-Hagborg has been created by the algorithms, which was created by Manning and created from the 30 portraits, such as someone can look with these genomic data - the many ways, as they can be interpreted and the hardened determinism of these interpretations - but also to identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"panning that was born as Bradley Edward, but has already been talking about identification as a woman, was sentenced to 20 accusations, including six clashes against the spionagegesetz, computer was and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"through the prison her picture was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a grassy, black-white Selfie, in which Manning is still sitting on a bicycle seat and a platinblonde perimeter has been associated with which it was associated with it."</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg came straight from the great success of her 2012-project'Stranger Visions.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in it, the artist portraits of strangers from forensic artefacts such as cigarette envelope and chewing gum that extracting the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people might look."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"this was the time, where she received an e-mail from a timer."</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they brought an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," said Dewey-Hagborg at a press-look at the new exhibition. "</seg>
<seg id="2137">"and she could not visit this time and she could not be photographed, that is why you wanted to make contact with Chelsea, and asked if they wanted to make a DNA portrait."</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and its inimprised muse have become invalid wallets that have several letters exchanges over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">"they even donate one of Shoili Kanungo illustrated Comic" Suppressed Images, "which would predict a future in which the President Chelation Judgment and it would be able to see the exhibition personally."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"that Obama actually was only a few days, after the book was published, Mannings release for seven brutal years in Kansas, was a welcome kind of lucky meeting."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"there is now also the opening of the exhibition somewhat deep and Starkes, as Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the governmental camp and against transgender forces to find new, tweetable ways that he should actually fix, continue to escape."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"as Dewey-Hagborg after the strange timing of all these things, she said that" things happen from a particular reason. "</seg>
<seg id="2143">"in one on the wall of the gallery listed artistic statement called Manning with its superlarge signature below (the" i "in their surname is provided with a heart.) an end of the" automatic fragmentation, whose basis of gender, race, sexuality and culture have been. "</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a exchange rate of Cs and Gs and As, in pencil. "</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hopes to show through the inclusion of 200 letters (or nucleotides following the high-developed scientific Lexicon of the artist) to show how amazing things we are all.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take away is that our genome does not take care of who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video-Werk of 2007, Spurious Memories. "</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so these are the 30 of these stories."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"the last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in an own room, is a page from the above mentioned Comic Novelle."</seg>
<seg id="2149">It shows manning how they appear with a release-elefon in the hand out of the disciplintro of the United States such as King's Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"if she asked your speech, then they won't," says it. "</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so, never stop the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came straight out of a letter that she wrote me," "said the artist who greet you from Philadelphia."</seg>
<seg id="2153">I am still goosebumps when I talk about it.</seg>
<seg id="2154">"Manning has not seen the exhibition is not personally seen - as it should be predicted in the Comic book - but if they should do it, then they will be welcomed into the center of the room by their own genomic simulacren, such as hordes of Protestants."</seg>
<seg id="2155">"it was also aimed at all, as everything was written in the exhibition until the size (5" 2, Mannings Statur), in which their genetic haploggroups were written with pencil. "</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had it on the wall, but I wanted it to feel like a man-set," said Dewey-Hagborg by the portraits. "</seg>

<seg id="2434">"the left was strengthened by Trump, but the resulting effect of his presidency has the power to move all right to the right."</seg>
<seg id="2435">"when we speak of" normalisation "and Trump, we refer to the gruseless opportunity to make us out of a day out of one day."</seg>

<seg id="2579">"red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help, IBD (inflammatory intestine)."</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestion as a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">"but a new study asserted exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and milk products, the symptoms of patients could relieve the symptoms of patients with inflammatory intestinal diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2582">"the incurable condition that affects approximately 1.3 million and in Great Britain 300.000, causes magnets and bleeding, recurring or bleeding waste, weight loss and extreme tiredness."</seg>
<seg id="2583">"while those affected are usually framed, meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers found at the Washingtoner University, researchers found that the essential amino acid Tryptophan from proteins to develop immune cells that promote tolerant intestines."</seg>
<seg id="2584">"the leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the intestines, to ensure that harmful microbes, which hide themselves in the body, not into the body."</seg>
<seg id="2585">"cells which are able to dissolve inflammation, are balanced by cells balanced and protect the tolerance and protect the body without sensitive tissues."</seg>
<seg id="2586">"when the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation, it can result in a inflammatory intestine."</seg>
<seg id="2587">"in experiments, it was found that a kind of tolerance of promoting immune cells in mice occurs, which carry a certain bacterium in their intestines."</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the stones of proteins - to dissolve the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"Professor Colonna said:" "we have a connection between a bacterium - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestine microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that provide tolerance."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more tryptophan the mice in their food had, the more they had of these immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"he suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and one of Tryptophan rich diet tolerated, less inflammatory..."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"the postdoctorate Prof. Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan uses a kind of immunotherapist that encourages tolerance when she found out that a group of study interacting such cells had, but another group of the same tribe but that was not separate."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"they suspected that the difference with the Darmmikrobiomas of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that usually live in the intestine tract."</seg>
<seg id="2594">The intestines of the mice were found DNA-sequencing and there were six bacterial species found in the mice with the immune cells but without the mice were missing.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterile environment so that they did not developed a Darmmikrobiome and they did not developed this kind of immune cells and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">"to understand how the bacteria explores the immune system, the researchers led L. reuteri in an fluid and then transferred small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - to unripe immune cells that were isolated from mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerable cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"when the active component is cleaned out of the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of the Tryptophan Metabolism that is known as Indol-3-militic acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"if the researchers have doubled the amount of tryptophan in the chuck of the mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophane values were halfdown, decreased the number of cells by half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">"Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerable cells such as mice, and that most of us can protect L. reuteri in our gastro-intestinal tract."</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether Tryptophan-side products made of L. reuteri the cells in humans develop as with mice, but defect in Genen in relation to Tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory representations."</seg>
<seg id="2602">"she said:" "the development of these cells is probably something that we would like to promote, since these cells are able to control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine."</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high impure levels can result in the presence of L. reuteri to an extension of this population.</seg>

<seg id="2898">"in addition, they pointed out that in their youth" blows have been a very normal pedagogical means "" to talk with children, as I was one, ready to be done. "</seg>
<seg id="2899">"it is unfair to apply today's standards to earlier decades, because the world has changed."</seg>
<seg id="2900">In the context of reports about the Missing attacks are often also pope-brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2901">"completely too wrong, the author and historians Michael Hesemann, who were translated to the" "My brother of the Pope" "My brother of the Pope". ""</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I must take Georg Ratzinger in protection," says Heshemann, "" for all this had nothing to do with him, "" when he did the results of the theses. "</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report presented by the diocese Regensburg with the Enlightenment attorney Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"total 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were killed between 1945 and beginning of the 1990s, with high level of plausibility, 67 Domspatzen sexually."</seg>
<seg id="2905">"in the final report it says to Georg Ratzinger, which was active from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg, so that from Domkapellmeister R. has been applied in many cases forms of physical and mental violence."</seg>
<seg id="2906">"especially in high emotionality, the punishment was able to fall off the punishment for the student."</seg>
<seg id="2907">"nevertheless, in contrast to many other complained that many victims were subjected to the general humanity by R., and therefore in numerous cases despite violence even more positive memories with it."</seg>
<seg id="2908">"in the interview, Heshemann, the final report was declared at the Missionary Domspatzen by the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger in his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Hesemann, the 440-pages report on the "prevention of violence against the" Regensburger Domspatzen "" is a contradictory picture by Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger. "</seg>
<seg id="2910">"for a raise many students to raise his" "humanity". ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">"at the other he also appears as a Choleriker and perfectionist, which was more often acted, if a domain was musically-musically-top-performance."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate as his biograph this thesis?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"Michael Hesemann, if you have the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself rather than the name Georg Ratzinger ever occurs in it."</seg>
<seg id="2914">He has just dedicated eight pages and he is clearly acquitted from any suspicion of the midday or co-landscape in the terrible cases sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The non-violence in the pre-school occurred outside of its activity.</seg>
<seg id="2916">One can take him all of it too late or taken first anchooses not seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the Domspatzengagements, where he worked, was felt by virtually all respondents as - as literally -" salvation, "" heaven "and" better world. ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"thus, the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger also poses an excellent testimony that describes him as a warm-hearted," "thoughtful", "thoughtful," "knowledgeable," "knowledgeable" and "understanding," said the guys regularly with cakes, biscuits, and Bonbons. "</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complained about his perfectionism and his high emotionality that also led to whutausal.</seg>
<seg id="2920">"that he cast not only with chairs scarce and the mud, but also in eared guys to the hair or ears, he has already given years ago, deeply regret and apologize for it."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"however, in his honour, it must be said that such surveying methods have been widely used in the questionable time, the 1960s and 1970s, with parents like teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you know even such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think everyone of us was born before 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"I also experienced this in a worldly school, a state-Gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared with what it actually goes to this report, namely the replaceable sexual abuse and nonviolence at the school, are the freilich Bagatelles."</seg>
<seg id="2926">"as you know, if it is not more likely to do with his acquaintance and his role as the brother of Benedict XVI, that many media has just returned to him."</seg>
<seg id="2927">"on the Bavarian Pope, many who have never understood him, still eager."</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report is Georg Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media the report was reported much about the subject of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Georg Ratzinger will also be put in conclusion on sexual abuse as a burden on sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: very clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No single of the 67 victims of sexual overes claims to have familiar to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I never dreamed to speak with my father or my mother," "said a affected deputy for the others," "It was all very embarrassing."</seg>
<seg id="2935">The true problem with the clarification of sexual abuse was and yet is that most of the victims is silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they do not even become parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir leader, who would certainly not have been a colleague who would have been a colleague of the perpetrator."</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do we evaluate the Domspatzen-students Ratzinger's role in regard to the missions?</seg>
<seg id="2938">"Michael Hesemann: a gifted student set it so:" "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case, in which he would have had made timely findings and would have been able to stop the respective perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I think it... also for really absurd, to accept that..." Buben intrusive or more clear or more, have opened up to their parents, internships, trust, etc. "</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks to him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"thus, the report on the very clear result:" that in the field of interested students and / or their surroundings, it could not be confirmed in the context of the examination. "</seg>
<seg id="2942">What sexual abuse affects is Georg Ratzinger is thus free from every rovisas.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Thus it cannot be tackled him not prevented or brought him to the ad.</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore, there is also no reason to bring his good name to these resist crimes, as it is unfortunately in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">In the media there was a lot of "violence" at the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is thrown out in the report. "</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he need to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that in the reporting everything was mixed and revered to a huge milking, sexual abuse and violence, and somewhere, right in the midst of Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is exactly what is a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">"namely, there is clean separate: between the pre-school and the gymnasium of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violence as well as we say once, other accusations."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"in addition, the report allegations of the period since 1945, so also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not a choir leader of the Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"the whole awful test pedagogy, the cases in which buds of sadistic teachers were quite contented and constituted, which occurred on the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous states have to be ruled out."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with them Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, for he got the boys first to face when they were already on the Domspatzengaging."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"in which was, as the most witnesses emphasize the topic" "Vorschule" "taboo."</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was just happy to be their escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradise" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different on the Domspatzengaging school?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there were already discipline but not a sadistal authority.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report is coming to the conclusion that" many victims were underestimated that "many victims of the general humanity by R. underestimated, and therefore in numerous cases despite violence even more positive memories with it."</seg>
<seg id="2959">"thus, at most still the forecast, can be taken away."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"but despite all efforts the report could only define two periods, in which he was reported on the states of the pre-school."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish himself and responsible from the events at a school, where he did not want to listen and responsible (so the witness) had nothing to hear, and then again around 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Indexed Georg Ratzinger in front of the states consistently the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Hesemann: no, since 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengagements, which was even reproduced by the report."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"in it he points this to that," that in the pre-school we will continue to practice the audited sentence. "</seg>
<seg id="2965">"already, given the danger of negative press of the severance, he received urgent need."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"of course, this was of course at a time when legal clarity existed, as a test result in Bavaria had long been banned."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before, it occurred in a legal gray area, as each one of us still knows."</seg>
<seg id="2968">There was also difficult for him to guess where the affected might have been exaggerated or dramatic and where really the permissible limit was exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">"however, one can not say he could always have gone."</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">"only in 1980, the audited at schools was officially abolished in Bavaria too."</seg>
<seg id="2972">"Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis said yes, it was unfair to apply today's educational standards to the time."</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Hesemann: we historians speak there from the" "Falling of Anachronism," thus the danger to assess their moral standards. "</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess has already been right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"but this is of course not true for sexual abuse, which was abstained at all times and also not for what in the pre-school of contradictions and violence against innocent children, which goes far beyond that at that time."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"this is all completely terrible and I'm glad that it will finally be revealed."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"but at the same time I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protecting, for all this had nothing to do with him."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"his means to disciplining and punishment, so earthy and in the hair and ears were widespread in the 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"when physical punishment then it was forbidden, he also has strictly kept it."</seg>
<seg id="2981">Which image of his regensburger time has Georg Ratzinger because in talks with you for the book "My brother of the Pope '?</seg>
<seg id="2982">Came the subject of auditor at the same time as speech?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hemann: well, in the book it is about life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, tells out of his perspective, as the Domspatzen played only a side-roller."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, I am not at all that he led there to be a strict Regiment."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"but it has to be said once again: without these perfectionism, without the demand unconditionally discipline, it would have been hardly possible from which until then rather national known Regensburger Domspatzen an institution of space transpies of Europe and its musical tradition, which went the same twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with biscuits and candy alone, one makes no big singers and above every success, right in which area, but always discipline, passion and self-healing."</seg>
<seg id="2987">As what kind of people you have experienced by Georg Ratzinger in talks about their book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond I have experienced Georg Ratzinger really well, and again experienced as wonderful, humorous, grounded, deep smooth and hearted good people, from which one could not imagine that he could only do something a fly."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I am regularly updated with how many former Domspatzen still today, 23 years after his Emerging, regularly contact him to visit him, he is almost blind - and to treat it as a member of her family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who are not forgiven him up to today, that he was strictly strict to them, so are clearly in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">"most Domspatzen are today thankful to him today, that he enriched her life and brought them to the world of music."</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he always became a good, väterful teacher - a strict father, certainly that may be - but also a adorable respectable son, to whom she is still standing today and to worship them."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, once again, all that you cast him are yosening methods that were then on the day of the day."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have long been overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is most unjust, a man, just because he is prominent and one more prominent brother has to make the medial scapegoat."</seg>
<seg id="2996">"and the evil intention that stands behind it, only too obvious."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"for the report, who was just published, relieve him."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now it would have acquired an 93-year-old man who has acquired great merits and without the outside of Bavaria and maybe in Germany probably no one would like to know the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
