this has made clear of the Hollywood Star in an interview now un@@ ambig@@ uous .
&quot; I will always put in drawers or come from outside label , that with me and the reality usually little to do . &quot;

gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the Pyr@@ amid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
at the end of a golf event in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger sought a bit of di@@ version with a horse@@ back ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
&quot; &quot; &quot; golden Sport@@ pyramid &quot; &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger &quot;
&quot; after a couple of minutes the horses remembered their holidays , they brought them to the fast Gal@@ opp at home to the feed . &quot;
&quot; a few kilometers at this pace , I have fear . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger . &quot;
and thus the Reit@@ k@@ arri@@ ere ended again .
on Saturday I was at the best gol@@ fer at all times - 101 tournament sie@@ ge - again near horses .
he left himself with his family over the power of the AL@@ RV on a horse @-@ sw@@ ang he did not go for photo@@ buck@@ le .
&quot; long was the first time in Aachen , and therefore also with CHI@@ O . &quot;
the reason was quite convin@@ cing .
the German Sp@@ orth@@ ilfe over@@ hau@@ led the man from An@@ hausen as part of a small Gala @-@ Golden Sport@@ pyramid .
on Awards there is not a like@@ able athl@@ ete not .
&quot; Federal Ministry , Silver Lor@@ be@@ er@@ blatt , Champions @-@ Tour of the year ... &quot;
even the British Queen has already d@@ ged him .
long is the 18th prize winners of the Pyr@@ amid .
in Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler .
&quot; this award means me much , &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; because she is not only for@@ warded for sporty successes , but also for social commitment . &quot;
&quot; for decades , Lan@@ ger has been supporting the offspring . &quot;
and so he also gave the prize money from 25.@@ 000 Euro .
&quot; with 15 more outstanding sport@@ smen , the two @-@ master master &apos;s master was recorded on Saturday at the &quot; Hall of Fame of the German Sports . &quot;
&quot; among the excellent belong to the excellent Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Tur@@ ner Eber@@ hard G@@ ien@@ ger , Bob P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , Bob P@@ usch Mein@@ hard N@@ eh@@ mer , the Spr@@ inter Frank Wien@@ e@@ ke , the Spr@@ inter alia Al@@ win Sch@@ ock@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um of the handicraft of all Er@@ hard . &quot;
many of these athletes were on Saturday after Aachen .
&quot; after the official part of the illustr@@ ating society in the Spring@@ stadium , where the Lav@@ azza @-@ Prize ran . &quot;
Bernhard Lan@@ ger held a distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ tons and Tru@@ m@@ ps economic policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
invest in infrastructure and prevent the trade agreement T@@ TP - they want both Clinton and Tru@@ mp .
&quot; however , the two US pres@@ idential elections are to be found in the control and energy policy as well as in a basic question . &quot;
&quot; differences between Donald Tru@@ mp and Hill@@ ary Clinton is a fundamental , rather philosoph@@ ical difference . &quot;
the report on the role of the state .
Tru@@ mp wants to keep the doubt rather small and war@@ ns before that as the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regul@@ ations .
Clinton wants to control the economy to death and regul@@ ate to death .
&quot; he himself would be quite different , claims Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; he will continue to regul@@ ating regul@@ ator , and he makes for a wide range of tax density with lower tax movements - for individuals and for businesses . &quot;
&quot; Clinton says : the state has certain tasks to fulfil , he has dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the taxes would increase for the rich , says it . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic of infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; in the nuts , Tru@@ mp and Clinton are almost wor@@ t@@ ense . &quot;
the democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state Invest@@ ments in the infrastructure are classical democratic policy and are rejected about the state @-@ critical Te@@ apart@@ y @-@ wing of the Re@@ public@@ ans .
&quot; thus , on Tru@@ mp , we could send you a partial discussions on Tru@@ mp . &quot;
significant are the differences in the energy and climate policy .
Tru@@ mp wants to build coal power plants and to drive the coal @-@ production in the USA .
oil production is also possible to announce the Paris climate agreement in so far protected areas .
&quot; Clinton does not want to build and calls for renewable energies with its investment program , &quot; &quot; a country will create the super@@ power of clean energies and millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want that we are . &quot;
&quot; however , not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far away from each other . &quot;
&quot; TP@@ P , the tran@@ sp@@ az@@ ical trade agreement , they both do not want to sign . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , both of the US do not wish to isol@@ ate international trade , but simply protect American jobs better . &quot;
which should then be paid even better , demands about Clinton . &quot;
the current minimum re@@ warding of 7,@@ 25 US dollars is a hunger re@@ warding .
she wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour .
&quot; what Tru@@ mp will do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum re@@ warding must be r@@ ightly , then he says , he may not be changed . &quot;
but the great discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the control policy of the two camps .
&quot; on the one hand , Tru@@ mp , who wants to relie@@ ve the economy and citizens to boost growth . &quot;
&quot; his critics keep him off , so that the household def@@ icit would be even greater . &quot;
&quot; at the other side , Clinton , who wants to ask at least by the rich that they pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are also not the solution . &quot;
escape : &quot; any woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot;
&quot; sexual violence is part of women who fle@@ e alone , almost for everyday life . &quot;
when they arrive in Germany they often are trau@@ mat@@ ised .
a house offers refuge .
in a large kitchen sitting four women .
each has a baby that is at most one year old .
one has laid their little son in the arm .
he gu@@ ed with great eyes curious in the room .
his mother died on the tabl@@ etop .
remember that it is observed .
she sm@@ iled short and k@@ isses the chin .
the scene is normal .
until one speaks with Kat@@ rin Bah@@ r .
&quot; she is a leader of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social assistance in Bavaria , and deals with the subject of women on the run . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are whis@@ per@@ ed .
they live in the Munich north in one of the few de@@ centralized accommodations for all@@ otted women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs worked together with Pro Familia and the Munich Ripper .
&quot; recently , it was officially opened . &quot;
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men are no - also not as visitors .
the exception is a watch@@ man in front of the door .
&quot; it is not ex@@ agger@@ ated to say : any woman who arri@@ ves here , has done on their flight experience with sexual violence , &quot; says Bah@@ r . &quot;
&quot; men fle@@ e because of wars , because they are politically pursued because of them torture or death , or because their families send them as hop@@ n@@ ants to Europe . &quot;
&quot; at women we@@ igh other reasons for flight : &quot; &quot; many ste@@ al themselves secret@@ ly , because they do not see any other way out . &quot;
&quot; in her home they have experience with sexual violence , compul@@ s@@ ory , honesty , slavery or constra@@ ints . &quot;
this is driving her away .
on the run it goes on .
&quot; that tractor is demand for example for a bottle of water a sexual act , is not r@@ arity , &quot; says Bah@@ r . &quot;
and the women are alone they are not protected by their families .
&quot; who believe that the end as soon as they anchor in Germany , ir@@ re , tells Bah@@ r . &quot;
also here the women of refugees were often regarded as inferior and worse .
&quot; this is that about 90 percent of women who live in the Munich , are trau@@ mat@@ ised , appreci@@ ates them . &quot;
&quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntary . &quot;
many women were so usual that they have nothing to say .
&quot; or they do not trust , openly about the experience , because the shame is too big . &quot;
&quot; since they often do not help to help , there need more accommodations for them , calls rail@@ ways . &quot;
Bavaria are responsible for accommodation of refugees in Bavaria .
&quot; on the question , whether they live from a similar project like in Munich in its competence area , please answer some with no . &quot;
&quot; in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , there is something in the accommodations of governments . &quot;
&quot; also in Schw@@ aben alone are not separate alone , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , Press@@ es@@ pre@@ cher of the government . &quot;
&quot; in Ober@@ bay@@ ern , Unter@@ - and mid@@ fran@@ ken there are some common @-@ accommodations floors , or own houses only for single @-@ standing women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women . &quot;
&quot; also the committee &quot; rights of women and gender equality &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be accommod@@ ated by men . &quot;
&quot; in a study which was published for the Committee , it is : &quot; it is very important that men and women are separate . &quot;
&quot; l@@ acks the privacy and women and women together , it may come to - for@@ tw@@ isting - violence against women come . &quot;
&quot; especially the washing rooms should be separated and for women easily accessible , stands in the study . &quot;
&quot; how much the women feel the needs of this protection , one can see on the cr@@ ush , which gives it to the house in Munich . &quot;
&quot; since you have spoken around , we have a long waiting list , &quot; says Bah@@ r . &quot;
you could easily make a second house .
assistance : demands for new work@@ force
&quot; dep@@ uty of assistance centers have called their union , new labour measures in their dispute regarding a new contract . &quot;
&quot; the Junior Do@@ ctors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( B@@ MA ) has requested its entire Council , starting at the beginning of September more labour measures . &quot;
&quot; the J@@ DC said that there were Minister of Ministers , respond@@ ing to the wor@@ ries concerning the contract . &quot;
assistance and media clients have agreed in July through the rejection of a contract which was agreed with the B@@ MA .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted for the elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members who was published on Thursday night on Twitter , the President of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court , said that the government was &quot; per@@ sever@@ ely calm &quot; to problems that was rejected that the contract was rejected . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; in view of what has the J@@ DC board designed to fully reject the proposed new contract , reject the proposed new contract and concerns the official new negotiations on all of them . &quot;
&quot; in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Board has asked a formal application to a special meeting of the B@@ MA Council to start a step @-@ escal@@ ating labour measures , which begins at the beginning of September . &quot;
&quot; the dispute led to that assistance centers of this year , the first total attacks in the history of the N@@ HS . &quot;
&quot; the leader of the B@@ MA Assist@@ enz@@ ien Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana came to the choice for rejection of the agreed contractual conditions , which were recommended by the B@@ MA . &quot;
&quot; he divided B@@ MA members during meetings , which were still held before the vote of 5@@ 4.000 assistance , and medi@@ z@@ inst@@ ud@@ ents that the contract be beneficial and should be accepted . &quot;
after the vote said the healthcare sm@@ ister Jerem@@ y Hunt that the contract for doctors in England would be un@@ attended .
Russia and Turkey : a &quot; alliance of external pages &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended up a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give herself the hands and to pro@@ claim a official end of the eight months of the permanent war of words and economic sanctions .
&quot; but when Vladimir Putin presents his Turkish counter@@ player in the gold @-@ plated hall of St. Pet@@ ers@@ burger Pal@@ ast@@ es , I cannot honour my inv@@ ading that Ankara must show this reconciliation . &quot;
&quot; it gave the hand @-@ attack , yes . &quot;
&quot; but Putin &apos;s sm@@ iles throw @-@ mal@@ li@@ pp@@ y and he was hardly heat , even for its rel@@ ap@@ preh@@ ensive circumstances . &quot;
Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Er@@ dog@@ an on the other hand said to his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report all five times .
I could no longer count it .
&quot; he also spoke that relations with Russia will not only return to their old level before the crisis , but even better . &quot;
the next day a newspaper that Er@@ dog@@ an would have been so da@@ ze than never happened before .
I seemed to indicate his enthusiasm rather to interpre@@ t the opposite .
&quot; but one of Putin ex@@ radi@@ ant , sustainable radi@@ le showed that the state of Russia had nothing forgotten . &quot;
&quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first to mention what he mentioned in his introdu@@ ctory words : the shot of a Russian f@@ ighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey . &quot;
Mos@@ k@@ aus &apos;s reaction at the time was w@@ ut@@ ri@@ bran@@ ded .
Putin divided up and acc@@ used Ankara to be like to have fallen into the back .
the verb was even greater since it was committed by a def@@ ic@@ ent friend .
it will be re@@ building up again if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; months , the state of controlled media led to a heavy , unlimited attack on Ankara . &quot;
at once it seemed to be the Turks for everything to blame .
&quot; most of the test were the alleg@@ ations of condu@@ ctive officials , that Er@@ dog@@ an &apos;s own family has benef@@ ited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria , which are controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot;
he has taken this veh@@ ement .
&quot; but in St.@@ Petersburg , the official message was that there is time to look forward . &quot;
&quot; finally , this meeting took place only because Putin was given by the President Er@@ dog@@ an the sorry who he wanted to hear . &quot;
Russia could make a kind of victory .
for Ankara the benefits of a ce@@ ase@@ fire are clear on hand .
&quot; Er@@ dog@@ an needs to be primarily all friends who can get , after spending last month at a failed cou@@ p nearly his ministry . &quot;
repet@@ itive terror@@ ist attacks on Turkey have also sh@@ aken it .
but there are also economic mot@@ ives .
&quot; Russian sanctions have taken Turkey hard - especially the ban on char@@ ters , which usually bring several millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year . &quot;
the number is returned by almost 90 % .
in Russia will be easier to be carried out in Russia and Char@@ ter@@ companies when the flights are taken up again .
they count on a late season@@ al rush to the Mediterranean .
this week pro@@ g@@ nost@@ ically the cou@@ rier can be cheap fruits and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agr@@ im@@ ports are allowed again .
&quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti set it as follows : &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry to the West as it was in response to the tried power of power as a weak response .
&quot; in addition , the ongoing Gro@@ ll come across the sn@@ ail accession negotiations and Putin - the enlight@@ ening to pull out of the cool@@ ly benefits and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the west . &quot;
&quot; the Russian state won in Ankara with certainty a bonus for this , that he called for the tried cou@@ p support for the chosen state organs . &quot;
this is a prosper@@ ous fear for Moscow which even has a deeper fear of reg@@ im@@ ation .
&quot; the summit meeting in this bright palace at the sea made it possible Russia and Turkey , one as it used to build me an analy@@ st once called &quot; &quot; Alliance of external pages &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still big differences between the two still . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave the role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey are supporting le@@ pers . &quot;
&quot; it could be indic@@ ative that after nearly three hours at first , both pres@@ idents appeared on the press conference , that they could not even stri@@ ped the subject . &quot;
President of Turkey susp@@ ect it clearly on a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emphas@@ ize this . &quot;
&quot; it is not a clear consensus on it , where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found to Syria . &quot;
&quot; but after months of open subt@@ let@@ ies - and given the potenti@@ als for a complete dis@@ infection , as NATO @-@ member of Turkey the Russian martial jet - it is certainly better that the two leaders at least talk together . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland is no longer available
the R@@ BS brand should be reduced to a Back@@ office role in the direction of the Bank nur@@ ser@@ f .
the Royal Bank of Scotland is no longer available to customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan divided the BBC Scotland with that the brand R@@ BS were connected to the global ambit@@ ions of the Bank .
the Bank has since been diss@@ oci@@ ated since it had to be almost col@@ lab@@ eled and saved for eight years ago .
&quot; in this period , bran@@ ding &quot; R@@ BS &quot; is used to protect other end @-@ consumer brands . &quot;
they supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ing from the Six Nations Rug@@ by to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray .
but now she decided to put more national brands in the focus .
&quot; the Royal Bank of Scotland will be available only to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized . &quot;
in England and Wales all RS@@ B Refer@@ ences will change the headquarters headquarters and the IP@@ West .
the Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are other , smaller brands for private business , which are more significance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dru@@ m@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a guided tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness Sh@@ ire .
&quot; he divided the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the brand RS@@ B is to be employed to our Invest@@ ors , as well as the brand that our employees will be busy , since we are now going to become a bank of brands . &quot;
&quot; when the Bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand . &quot;
&quot; now , I say that we are not pursu@@ ing global goals , but local goals . &quot;
each of these brands will stand in their own churches for something completely different and our employees will work under these brands with customers .
R@@ BS has already said that there will be his Six Nations sponsor@@ ing no longer and that it is increasing the per@@ cept@@ ance of the various brands in his sport sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; it is time for us to develop into the bank of the brands , as we focus on inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; said the board . &quot;
it would have been very z@@ yn@@ ically three years ago when we had said that we will be a great bank for our customers and these brands would have been lan@@ c@@ ated .
&quot; but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes . &quot;
&quot; we can launch these marks again , so I think that the time has come . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori reaches its 3.@@ 000@@ ten prize at New@@ market
D@@ ett@@ ori spra@@ yed champ@@ agne after a double on New@@ market that brings to him 3.@@ 000@@ ten gain
the J@@ ockey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori added on Friday his 3.@@ 000@@ ten British win at New@@ market .
&quot; he sat on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction , which is trained by John Gos@@ den on his local rac@@ et@@ rack with his second win of the night a milestone . &quot;
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Ital@@ ians is the sixth J@@ ockey who reaches the milestone in the low@@ lands .
&quot; he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ g@@ ott , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Will@@ ie Car@@ son . &quot;
&quot; three @-@ day winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who previously won on G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar , said : &quot; it is something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is also here
I am very happy about that it is going to happen at New@@ market because I am talking about 30 years ago .
&quot; it is not a big meeting , it is not Royal As@@ cot - it is a ban@@ ish Friday evening with 20,000 people . &quot;
I am relie@@ ved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes the bu@@ bel than he gets the victory of Prussia .
&quot; two J@@ oc@@ keys have reached the milestone in the obstacles - J@@ ockey Richard Johnson and the re@@ tired 20 @-@ Mal@@ ige winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who reached more than 4,@@ 300 vict@@ ories in a re@@ ord@@ ing career . &quot;
&quot; L@@ ester Pig@@ g@@ ott , the ninth D@@ erb@@ ys@@ ie@@ ger was 4.@@ 4@@ 93 Kar@@ rier@@ es@@ ie@@ ge &quot;
Frank@@ ie is one of the best J@@ ockey of the modern and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone only a few before him .
&quot; he has style and is strong , but it is his tact@@ ical intelle@@ ct that distingu@@ ishes him from the others in the weight control . &quot;
&quot; he is a fantastic amb@@ assador for races , his enthusiasm and char@@ ism enthusiastic fans for years for this sport . &quot;
&quot; I said Frank@@ ie in a couple of weeks ago in Ep@@ s@@ om , that he would have received 6@@ ,000 profits when he would not only have a weekend and big tournament h@@ ockey ! &quot;
Frank@@ ie has already rid@@ den nearly 30 years of winner which is great .
&quot; he has a lively personality , which is good for an British race , but in addition it is an incredible J@@ ockey . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
&quot; from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ mo@@ unts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flag@@ ship of the British Flach@@ r@@ enn@@ ens for two decades . &quot;
it was ner@@ ve @-@ thr@@ illing .
&quot; a whole series of big tournament , including its famous &quot; &quot; Gl@@ or@@ rich Sie@@ ben &quot; in 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane cr@@ ashing and received a drug . &quot;
&quot; three years ago he had difficulty in the beginning , when he returned from his six@@ teenth locks , but he showed an impressive strength to beat his branches and return to his beast . &quot;
and he is not yet at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori has once said earlier that he wants to continue with competitions up to his at least 5@@ 0.@@ ten years .
Russia Putin dam@@ ert staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has made un@@ expect@@ et@@ able his staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was a lot of years part of the nar@@ row@@ est confidence of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed as special for environmental and transportation .
&quot; in a statement of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , Putin without giving reasons &quot; Ivan@@ ov@@ s has been ordered by its duties as chairman of the Russian pres@@ idential administration . &quot;
&quot; Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been pro@@ xy since 2012 Ivan@@ ov@@ s Deputy , was appointed to his successor . &quot;
&quot; V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at . &quot;
1972 in the Est@@ onian capital Tallinn he made his conclusion at the renowned State of Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ GI@@ MO ) and worked in the message in Tokyo .
&quot; on the website of the Kre@@ m@@ lin it is said ( in Russian ) , that he later became a head @-@ chief and staff manager of the government . &quot;
&quot; about his appointment he said to Putin , &quot; &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot;
I think that it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as a state authority and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday with that Ivan@@ ov was asked to have asked his post and recommended v@@ ain@@ o as its successor .
convince the smiling faces ?
this step has happened Moscow mysterious .
&quot; Sergei Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of the nar@@ row@@ est trusted Vladimir Putin &apos;s and works like he is the Soviet intelligence , the K@@ GB . &quot;
as a rod he was one of the most powerful men of the country .
&quot; at a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast on TV , both men claimed that the rod was on own wish . &quot;
&quot; but despite of sm@@ iles for the cameras , here are only few of them convinced - especially now , shortly before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
&quot; so , this is the consequence of a kind of power struggles ? &quot;
this is currently no one .
&quot; but the official asser@@ tion - that a man who was used to lead to a potential President , once the Russian environmental policy would like to lead to great sce@@ pt@@ icism . &quot;
&quot; in his comments on Putin who c@@ ited on the website of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , Ivan@@ ov &quot; It is true that I have asked you in early 2012 in a conversation with me this very complicated post - you could almost say - compl@@ ain about four years . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , I have been the president of the Russian pres@@ idential management for four years . &quot;
Ivan@@ ov took up the post in December 2011 .
previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin &apos;s former member of the state @-@ assured of the K@@ GB .
&quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the B@@ und@@ ess@@ es@@ Service ( F@@ SB ) , which was appointed K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his substitute . &quot;
&quot; but Putin called to power , Ivan@@ ov called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people , whom he trusted . &quot;
&quot; once was believed that Ivan@@ ov could have become president of Russia , since a third term Putin would fall against the Constitution . &quot;
&quot; but this item was taken by another , nearby allies Put@@ ins , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev . &quot;
Putin became prime minister before he was three and a half years later .
Criminal M@@ inds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fi@@ red after having made producers

Que@@ ens@@ ferry Crossing : bridge is now connected to F@@ ife
the £ 1,35 billion co@@ stly project should be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the north deck of Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings with the vi@@ adu@@ ct - which means the bridge is now connected to F@@ ife .
&quot; it is the first of four con@@ cluding the &quot; cover bl@@ ower &quot; , &quot; which is the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
the bridge section of F@@ ife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30.000 tons .
&quot; it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons concrete and 46 Sch@@ rä@@ g@@ se@@ ile . &quot;
the £ 1,35 billion for the project should be completed by May 2017 .
&quot; today Keith Brown takes place a visit today and was one of the first , who went from the country to the bridge . &quot;
he said : &quot; this is a historical and symb@@ olic moment in the construction of Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings .
&quot; we are all witnesses of an engineer @-@ art of a truly ep@@ ic dimensions in this project with over 3@@ 0,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the closures is between the vi@@ adu@@ ct and the bridge deck a he@@ ik@@ le activity , which require extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit . &quot;
&quot; overall , nearly 79 % of the total bridge covers are at their place and the last section of the Dec@@ ks today gets a Bet@@ ong@@ th for the deck , which means that the entire Deck is ready to be raised on the bridge to his place . &quot;
Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Construct@@ ors said : &quot; the first closure represents a substantial milestone in every bridge project . &quot;
in this fantastic project the closure of tr@@ end@@ setting and deep @-@ building .
&quot; after installation of the last road @-@ deck@@ s and its connection with the expansion of the North @-@ deck , we had to close the gap between the North or land . &quot;
this was reached by pul@@ ling the northern Zu@@ br@@ inger@@ bridge 700 mill@@ imeter south .
this was a massive and at the same time very hot activity .
&quot; massive , as the vi@@ adu@@ ct 222 metres long is , ca . 6@@ ,000 tons weighs and with an increase of approximately 3 % . &quot;
&quot; as the toler@@ ances , as the toler@@ ances , that the team works , tiny , they were only a few mill@@ imet@@ res . &quot;
&quot; fortunately everything went very well . &quot;
saving in the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay : three men have good luck to be alive &quot;
&quot; three men have &quot; happiness still alive , &quot; after they were thrown from her fishing boat before An@@ gles@@ ey . &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e R@@ N@@ LI life@@ jacket on Friday at 13 : 20 B@@ ST alarm after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay .
&quot; the three men had difficulties to swim in safety while their boat was moving from their own strength . &quot;
&quot; we looked like the boat in their proximity to turned and set us the worst , &quot; &quot; said the leader of the lif@@ ter station of Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e V@@ ince Jones . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the strong winds bl@@ owing the boat already out of their reach until we left to water , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 . &quot;
they all came on board the coast of the coast and were brought back to the lif@@ ebo@@ at station
&quot; Mr. Jones said , &quot; The three men who were thrown into the water , fortunate un@@ hurt and still to be alive . &quot;
&quot; though , the boat engine had an emergency , but this re@@ deemed by the bo@@ res of the bo@@ ots of the person , who serve the boat . &quot;

hard hurt - man st@@ ug@@ g@@ out on his ex @-@ friend
a man has attacked his ex @-@ friend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and difficult in@@ ju@@ red .
&quot; as the police were told , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had the key to the apartment to get his personal things . &quot;
&quot; instead , the alcoholic bore , the clothes of his ex @-@ friend . &quot;
&quot; when these came into the apartment , he went twice to them . &quot;
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was viol@@ ated by the hand and in the body .
police could take the perpet@@ rators .
&quot; during the 50 @-@ year @-@ old the clothes of his ex @-@ friend destroyed , he called his mother . &quot;
this al@@ armed then whose sister .
&quot; together with her life , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old she wanted to calm her brother . &quot;
she could not move him but to leave the apartment .
&quot; therefore , she went out with her life from the house . &quot;
on the road they met the ex @-@ CV of the male .
&quot; when the two women prayed again the apartment , h@@ ub@@ ste of the 50 @-@ year @-@ old his sister to the side and grip his ex @-@ friend . &quot;
who is building Br@@ igs cheap apartments ?
the SPD and Green mine : investors should be much stronger in the future in the future .
how do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 cheap apartments in the coming years ?
the SPD propos@@ es to the next install@@ er of a &quot; action concept . &quot;
but conflict is programmed .
in first line it is about the question : who is supposed to build the cheap apartments actually ?
a regulation is missing .
&quot; SPD leader Christoph Brat@@ mann says : &quot; &quot; we are going to build up with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build up to urban areas in the future of 20 percent of all the apartments as a social housing . &quot;
the favorable apartments can also occur in stock .
&quot; however , the great dispute in the Town Hall is however , so Brat@@ mann : &quot; how to build up with investors who want to build on private areas ? &quot;
&quot; we want to build , that investors have at least 10 percent , but as possible as 20 percent of the apartments as a social housing . &quot;
&quot; a new urban@@ istic housing programme , which will cost millions of cost and must be financed still , should provide incentives for incentives . &quot;
&quot; the problem , so Brat@@ mann : &quot; there is no agreement between the fact@@ ions . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as a few rules as possible .
the left is still a hardness test for investors .
&quot; regardless of , so Brat@@ mann , bah@@ ne a shar@@ pen@@ ing of the situation on the housing market . &quot;
&quot; the action concept is implemented , which will provide additional tasks in the building management . &quot;
more staff is needed .
it is un@@ clear whether we get the specialists .
&quot; yet , the program is not entirely : because the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments that should be built anyway . &quot;
&quot; however , how is the loss of other about 1300 cheap apartments which will run in the coming years ? &quot;
only until the year 2020 it will be 500 apartments .
&quot; to prevent this , so the plan@@ atory spokes@@ person Nicole Palm , should now be sold out @-@ running ties from the city . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , we would have to be thought to get back into the price . &quot;
this is possible in the Western city .
on one stroke could solve the problem .
in the west city you are running for the end of the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments you could get there to the price connections for cheap apartments .
only : these are the owners who do not want to use the property companies .
&quot; for , the number of social housing is raised in the Western city again dra@@ st@@ ically , one can be removed from the purpose of so @-@ called inter@@ ference . &quot;
a concentration of social weak in just a few neighbor@@ hoods should not give it more .
the Gre@@ ens expect that there will be even movement in the discussion .
&quot; leader Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; for a broad majority must be the CD@@ U with the boat . &quot;
I have concentrated on more construction sites for family houses .
but what does not mean that not yet a compromise can be found .
&quot; Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that is worthwhile itself &quot;
it is fascinating to see how the world changes .
&quot; their teenage children and child no longer go outside , but rather than they prefer to spend their leisure time , on screen at rigid , was charged in the last decade of many . &quot;
&quot; at Pok@@ emon Go , it is about to get people from the sofa and become more active . &quot;
&quot; the time on the screen was first on the TV , then on video games and last on smartphones . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it &apos;s great to see that technology and activities are not mut@@ ually exclusive . &quot;
&quot; I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that were based on the characters , initially created for the video games in the 199@@ 0@@ ern ( later it emerged from a cartoon , game cards and other spin @-@ off@@ s ) . &quot;
&quot; how many phenomena of pop culture s@@ ank the interest in front of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand in early July . &quot;
the launch in other countries was post@@ pon@@ ed by the massive demand that the server over@@ loaded .
&quot; within a few days Pok@@ é@@ mon Go more users as Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter . &quot;
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , the players go outside with their smartphone and search for Pok@@ é@@ mons which were followed by a GPS and once they were found once , &quot; &quot; photograp@@ hed &quot; &quot; ( via a screenshot on the phone ) or &quot; &quot; captured &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a generation that played the game when she was still younger , the W@@ ahn took place and jum@@ ped for the search of the sofa . &quot;
in the US the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; average &quot; person returns every day .
&quot; Cardi@@ og@@ ram , a app for Apple Watch , pursu@@ ing a App for Apple Watch , the Washington Post announced that within two days following the launch of the game , the number of per@@ sec@@ uted people who train every day 30 minutes , by 45 percent to 53 percent . &quot;
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only sees the raw data to increase power .
&quot; many public adv@@ ancement campaigns for health , people want to take care of &quot; 30 minutes to take &quot; , &quot; from the sofa to come &quot; and &quot; every day active in his ears , because many public messages are boring for health and come to people coming . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the meaning of sport cannot be over@@ rated . &quot;
&quot; who regularly drives sports , reduces its chances , to prevent cancer or depression . &quot;
&quot; physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here . &quot;
&quot; but the wonder@@ full of Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that fun to them . &quot;
&quot; thus , three pillars of health covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine , as well as fun . &quot;
some people close to the hunt even new friends .
&quot; as always there are also m@@ ump@@ y players , which must always be compl@@ ain about something . &quot;
and yes anyone could run against a door .
what should it be ?
it has a breakthrough .
&quot; even if you were able to follow smartphone apps such as Fit@@ bit earlier , they gave us no reason to play sports as it does this game . &quot;
the new will lose its charm and the use will leave with time .
&quot; however , due to poker success there will be more games to unite the apps and virtual reality with the activation of the real world and will help many people on the hunt , more active , f@@ itter and health@@ ier . &quot;

and now the Olymp@@ ics are finally available .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American Tur@@ ner@@ in er@@ kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday to the majority of the majority and increased the gap between themselves and the rest of the world before all eyes under the head@@ light of the Olympic Games .
your overall result of 6@@ 2.@@ 198 lay clearly before the Silver Medal and &quot; Final Five &quot; -@@ Mann@@ ion@@ sk@@ amer@@ ad@@ in A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze statue Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
&quot; the American Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ nt on the flo@@ od@@ ing of women in the field of wood in the art of art at the Olympic Summer play in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osex@@ ual America , which wins a multi @-@ bank title and a total of the fifth , while she consolid@@ ates their reputation , the best of their generation or even at all . &quot;
she broke in tears as their final results was shown and found their long journey at this moment an end .
&quot; this success makes it the same le@@ ague for as unique athletes such as Michael P@@ helps , which brought her sports to new heights : &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es has won the last three years its sport @-@ art , 15 World Championship - including 10 gold med@@ als , which said a mixture of honesty and precision , that the Olymp@@ ics of Pat@@ rons in 1984 Mary Lou Rett@@ on by her said that they &apos;ve ever seen &quot; the best tur@@ ner@@ in that I have ever seen . &quot;
&quot; it expected them a last test in Brazil , a competition which was not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a burden over@@ sized expectations . &quot;
&quot; not return with a hand@@ ful gold back to family in Spring , Texas , would be considered to be a disappointment . &quot;
&quot; the American Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace her , after each of the gold and silver of the women in the field of cultural activities in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday , won . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es brought the first med@@ al on Tuesday , while on the fare@@ well party , served in retirement @-@ standing team @-@ ordin@@ ator by Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi . &quot;
&quot; although it cons@@ isted , during their long journeys to the top , never the future is planned , this is not really true . &quot;
part of its ground exercises - which contain its typical tum@@ bling pass - is adapted to Latin American music that would be at home on the street outside the Olymp@@ ia@@ arena in Rio .
this is not a co@@ incidence .
&quot; this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as small child and by Train@@ ers A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother was discovered during a school plane to the gym , was trained in the Bo@@ or@@ man . &quot;

they set up again with 15.@@ 4@@ 33 on the pig bal@@ ks again - and sat down with a 15.@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor .

&quot; the perpet@@ rators fi@@ red eight shots from a hand@@ hel@@ p@@ ist , while he was on the co @-@ driver of the car and then flew with another vehicle , is in the report to read . &quot;
&quot; the police shared that the triple murder does not seem to be the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y , as the att@@ acker did not have the hand@@ bags , or the $ 2,@@ 900 who were in possession of one of the adult victims . &quot;
&quot; the police authorities of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting is condu@@ cting the investig@@ ators to become a close look , whether they are connected with four previous attacks . &quot;
&quot; altogether , mainly in h@@ isp@@ anic resid@@ ences were killed within four months in nine attacks seven people and two more in@@ ju@@ red . &quot;
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , shared Howard der K@@ HP@@ O , a subsidiary of CB@@ S , beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is thought that the suspe@@ cts has used several vehicles , including a brown n@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln . &quot;
&quot; investig@@ ators WE@@ IG@@ ER@@ TEN , the evidence has revealed that the attacks are linked to the conclusion that the attacks are linked and by the same mur@@ der@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; Ellis , 33 , was by their inj@@ uries and died later . &quot;
&quot; Liner , 31 , and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site . &quot;
a witness to the police declared that it was not unusual to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .

investig@@ ators found Pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen and secured a bul@@ let from the seat as well as spher@@ es from the engine .
&quot; mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ year with micro@@ ce@@ phal@@ op@@ ie : &quot; &quot; it gets better &quot;
&quot; like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old love Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ uto the s@@ ingen , toys and of course his mother . &quot;
&quot; but as the least of his al@@ ter@@ ies has Ed@@ mund micro@@ ce@@ ph@@ ie , the result of a genetic distur@@ b@@ ance , about his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ uto during their pregnancy nothing . &quot;
&quot; when he came home for the first time he was my first thought , I do not create that . &quot;
I create that not .
I have not left myself .
&quot; whatever is wrong -- of course , one has left out of it , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; your husband Vincent and her was told that Ed@@ mund may never recognize them under circumstances , and that he may not even survive . &quot;
some doctors even went so far that they smote him to institution@@ al@@ ise him .
&quot; my first answer to that was &quot; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &quot; &quot; explained Pic@@ ci@@ uto . &quot;
Ed@@ mund can run with the help of a hearing .
Ed@@ mund could neither be sitting or sitting down to his third age of life and he can still not speak .
but he slowly makes progress .
it can run with support and cycling .
he also likes to play with his two brothers and sing .
Elizabeth shows the drawing language that means Ed@@ mund for &quot; Please sing me a little bit before . &quot;
&quot; we bring him drawing language at &quot; &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ uto CB@@ S News . &quot;
but there is no typical string language -- says it . Ed@@ mund has invent@@ ed a number of characters alone .
micro@@ ce@@ phal@@ ie has a variety of causes : genetic such as Ed@@ mund as well as infections with viruses such as mask or Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how to influence the life of the Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus Inf@@ ant .
Pic@@ ci@@ uto is rem@@ inded of the emotional price of an un@@ certain future .
I asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still does not know it really .
&quot; I have ever wonder@@ ed for a long time after the pro@@ gn@@ osis , because I don &apos;t expect to tell me someone really . &quot;
&quot; but Pic@@ ci@@ uto has caused a hop@@ eful rat@@ ory for m@@ others of inf@@ ants , which were caused by the Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus . &quot;
it will be better .
you know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .

&quot; pat@@ ron@@ age for storm , which were trac@@ ed to various assault , over@@ flowing the crime scene . &quot;
it seems that there is clearly a long @-@ lasting struggle here .
&quot; on the road , on both sides of the walk , were sle@@ eves . &quot;
&quot; thus it seems to have been here several armed fighters , who were very active involved in the police , distributed police Gin@@ aldi of the police in Philadelphia to the transmitter . &quot;
there were also several houses and vehicles made in the area .
&quot; there came to no feast , and the police are present@@ ly reviewed reports according to the surveillance video . &quot;
on Tuesday there was another 6 @-@ year girl hit by a cross @-@ sle@@ eps at the arm when she played in front of her house in the neighborhood of the West Oak Lane .
she recovered and the police still search for a suspe@@ cts .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie &quot;
that is what I present to me under the women &apos;s Olymp@@ ics in the gymn@@ asts and that is out of more than one reason .
&quot; first , I have never seen so dominant since 1984 at every summer Olymp@@ ics and the USA were never so dominant . &quot;
&quot; and secondly : this team has three gymn@@ ast , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who gives very inspiring for many young girls from other skin color . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the J@@ üd@@ in is and Ma@@ dison K@@ oc@@ ian , the cath@@ ol@@ ik@@ in is , ab@@ round , makes every pride . &quot;
this team is finally reflected in the United States .
it has fixed the black and bright female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years the number one was one below the female gymn@@ ast a Afr@@ o @-@ American .
last year were Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
at the last Olympic Games Gab@@ by Douglas had a surprising Olymp@@ ics and America che@@ ered .
&quot; now the world was able to witness witness of the incredible performance of the triple World Championship in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez as she was unexpected , but master@@ ful Gy@@ mast@@ ic rout@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ osex@@ ual America who won at an individual mult@@ it@@ ful event for women gold . &quot;
team member of A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
&quot; we are experiencing the tip of this sport , but we do not see competition in the whole country . &quot;
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie smote all the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to create it into the ol@@ ymp@@ ic team . &quot;
&quot; they are the &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; &quot; because the next Olymp@@ ics will have only four gymn@@ ast in the team . furthermore , this is the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a trainer . &quot;
&quot; but the reality is like that Tur@@ ns a expensive sport is and Tur@@ ner primarily associated with private tournament that are maintained by parents , which are up for training , furnishings , travel and hotel costs ( for the coach and their gymn@@ asts and families ) . &quot;
the majority of these assets are located in aff@@ lu@@ ent loc@@ alities who can support the business .
in these verses the Tur@@ ner received their overall training and that is for families a expensive and long @-@ term engagement .
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , Train@@ ers by Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , Train@@ ers of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both have trained their athl@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; we need to be inspired to the municipalities of countless , young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a high @-@ quality and easier accessible tournament . &quot;
I founded my tournament of 20 years .
in my events we have free and affordable turtle in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban young people ( especially black and h@@ isp@@ anic ) and trained national and international winners .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my h@@ omet@@ own ) to offer the youth high @-@ quality gymn@@ asts that make the opportunity to learn from this great ol@@ ymp@@ ic sport .
&quot; Tur@@ nen develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind . &quot;
this combination provides li@@ fel@@ ong advantages for health as well as for school and professional success .
&quot; it is the inspiration of this team , which bring thousands of young girls to interest to the tower and that is great . &quot;
&quot; it is so important to participate in the sport , especially for girls . &quot;
this is such an exciting time .
&quot; thanks Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this genuine presentation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ en of the ol@@ ymp@@ h gol@@ is@@ ian and thank you , F@@ ass her so many young girls with different background motiv@@ ates to start their way , healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
assistance services would like to organise further strikes after they have rejected Jerem@@ y H@@ unts on proposal
&quot; the Ministers had hop@@ ed to end the dispute over the changes through acceptance of a reform@@ ist agreement with the functioning of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7.@@ 000 assist@@ ants who voted for him . &quot;
&quot; in July , Hunt plans un@@ ve@@ ils to introduce the contract and said that N@@ HS would be harmful in a &quot; &quot; Niem@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; &quot; and any other delay for employees and patients were harmful . &quot;
&quot; the first assist@@ ants should receive a new contract , which includes changes to night@@ s- and weekends , to improve the care of time @-@ up hours . &quot;
&quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the Chairman of the B@@ MA Com@@ mit@@ tees shared last night in a communication with : &quot; Assist@@ enz@@ ists have reported the proposed treaty to the proposed treaty , in particular that it is to cope with the current financial crisis . &quot;
&quot; with only eight weeks , who still stay , until the first group of doctors will fall under the new contract , need to be made progress and time runs out . &quot;
efforts on the part of the B@@ MA for solving disputes through discussions on the government to participate in the government and sometimes on o@@ hr@@ en@@ be@@ aming silence .
&quot; this happened of a failure , the Jerem@@ y Hunt have only been doing the last month , that his door would always be revealed . &quot;
Jerem@@ y Hunt has to act now to lift the condition and concerns the concerns of assistance .
&quot; if he did not do this , so we have made the assist@@ ants clearly that they are ready to perform further labour measures . &quot;
&quot; the last strike end of April saw a revol@@ ving of nearly 13@@ ,000 routines and 100.000 terminals , as nurs@@ es and specialist were included in order to provide doctors on the string post@@ operative coverage . &quot;
the Ministers had hop@@ ed to end the dispute over the changes by adopt@@ ing the reform@@ ist contract with the functioning of the British Medical Association .
&quot; the B@@ MA wants to be a better w@@ oven re@@ warding for the 5@@ 4.000 assist@@ ants , which are subject to the contract . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , Direct@@ orate @-@ General of the N@@ HS employees , called on the assistance &quot; assistance &quot; to stop the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; labour measures reach none of the only little , but already loaded teams and service provider and prepare the patient , care and their families only concerns , distress and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
in the last two months we were talking to the comfort of the assistance of assistance and with the Ministry of Health and other minist@@ ries are positive to the concerns about the guardi@@ an@@ ship and the wh@@ ist@@ le@@ bl@@ ow@@ ings .
&quot; the employers hop@@ ed that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as un@@ disp@@ ens@@ ation , flexibility for those who were coming from a professional out@@ time , mutual recognition of the curr@@ iculum , mutual recognition of the curr@@ iculum , Health Education England and the Health Education Ministry regarding compliance with the B@@ MA in November , February and May . &quot;

the Regul@@ ations of the N@@ HS is recommended for a four years to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems further .
around 14@@ 0.000 people suffer from a heart attack each year and a quarter of them suffer a further heart attack or a stroke .
galvan@@ izing and stroke are caused by accumulation to high @-@ old material in the arter@@ ial walls .
&quot; when the exposure breaks , it can cause a blood flow to hide the blood flow up to the heart and thereby caused a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; when the blood flow turns out , it can flow through blood flow and cl@@ ashes through the blood flow to the brain , which causes a stroke . &quot;
people who already had a heart attack , are subje@@ cted to a higher risk to another . &quot;
&quot; T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is manufactured by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and is distributed under the trade name Br@@ il@@ ique , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood vessels un@@ prob@@ able . &quot;

culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness makes vot@@ ing in Muslim &apos;s areas
the former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ for Rah@@ man was reached last year on violations of a governmental report due to corruption from the office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to spread that widespread elect@@ oral churches has been ignored in Muslim municipalities - as a net@@ worked governmental report today revealed today .
&quot; the former cabinet member of Sir Eric P@@ ickl@@ es compreh@@ ends verb@@ ally the police , vot@@ ing and Rath@@ äuser for this to have ignored evidence of &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity &quot; &quot; due to &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity &quot; &quot; due to &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the former Minister for Integration and Commun@@ al government , who is now a threat of voters from religious mot@@ ives so bad , that it should be the police should be allowed to set down@@ stairs outside of choices . &quot;
he recomm@@ ends that the voters should lead to a ID in order to prove their identity in elections .
&quot; at the moment , an elect@@ orate must only call its name and address . &quot;
&quot; the report suggests , not removable ink on the finger of a person when they agree to prevent their vote , to prevent someone twice . &quot;
wh@@ ist@@ le@@ bl@@ owers should receive more protection says Sir Eric .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he calls for the press to have access to municipalities and decisions made by non official comm@@ on@@ tees or work@@ groups . &quot;
&quot; this serves not only against elect@@ oral campaigns , but also the communist government is also intended to protect against the broader cor@@ rupt and financial markets that goes with it , &quot; &quot; said he . &quot;
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets elect@@ rif@@ and@@ als in the east of London .
&quot; last year , I decided that the Mayor Lut@@ on Rah@@ man decided according to a lit@@ an@@ ei in cor@@ rupt and illegal practices of his ministry . &quot;
the court was that Rah@@ man would have denied the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; on z@@ yn@@ ic way and that he would have brought his critics with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ op@@ hob@@ bies for silence .
&quot; Rah@@ man is supposed to have led his campaign on the basis that it is the a@@ ids duty of Muslims , to choose him . &quot;
&quot; up to 300 voices were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the result of an im@@ itation , in which a person is chosen as someone else . &quot;
Sir Eric said that there would be no evidence of fr@@ aud throughout the country .
&quot; he expressed particularly al@@ ar@@ ming of frau@@ dul@@ ent stamp - at the older members of the Muslim Community pressure on people , have a candidate to choose from their choice . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric , depic@@ ted , made several recommendations to smo@@ ked the elect@@ oral system , including joining the identity to prove the identity . &quot;
&quot; in his report it says : &quot; &quot; as evidence was appropriate that pressure on vulner@@ able members of some ethnic minorities has been exercis@@ ed , especially women and young people in order to choose according to the will of the elders , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ic or ban@@ ana background . &quot;
there were concerns ... state institutions such as such behaviour due to &quot; politically correct &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to the eth@@ nie and religion should be ignored .
&quot; Sir Eric said to 50 recommendations to pur@@ ify the system , including the ban that political activ@@ ist envelop@@ es editing to stop &quot; &quot; election &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report , which is drawn by Ther@@ esa May in Er@@ l@@ apping , requires also t@@ oug@@ her registry to prevent that the elect@@ oral directory is used to im@@ mig@@ r@@ illation and social concrete . &quot;
consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID .
&quot; not remote ink on the finger of a person , as soon as she has given their voice to prevent someone twice . &quot;
systematic commit of the nationality of a person to carry out that they are entitled to .
a three @-@ year limit on applications to an automatic envelop@@ ing .
prohib@@ ition that political activists have full mail and envelop@@ es of envelop@@ es .
police provide the authority to set out wr@@ aps around the elect@@ oral stations .
a leg@@ islat@@ ure that facilit@@ ates an indi@@ ct@@ ment for intim@@ idation according to the representation of the People Act 1983
photographers in elect@@ oral stations .
request that only English must be used in the elect@@ oral stations ( except for Wales ) .
&quot; intensi@@ f@@ ication of the training , to ensure that the employees rule the rule that voters alone into the elect@@ oral cabin . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; , &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets Fall have not been placed any crime . &quot;
&quot; the election Court has been Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his dep@@ uty for a lit@@ an@@ ei on cor@@ rupt and illegal practices , &quot; &quot; said he . &quot;
it was in@@ sufficient due to a number of reasons for quite sufficient - according to the high requirements in criminal procedures - guilty .
it also critic@@ ised the effective &quot; dis@@ solution &quot; of the election @-@ regist@@ rations of the Rath@@ äuser .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the Court of Tower Ham@@ lets from last year was a warning @-@ signal .
&quot; our country is borne by the mother of the parli@@ aments of a proud heritage , but the wor@@ rying and conce@@ aled of some authorities threat@@ ening this good reputation . &quot;

&quot; on hon@@ ors of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that have found the time on our screens , FE@@ MA@@ IL has created a list of Olymp@@ ics that have more than just a certain simil@@ arity with hol@@ ly@@ wood@@ crafts . &quot;
&quot; the h@@ unter and the wolf : team member of the US team in Archery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared since his childhood with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio &quot;
&quot; besides K@@ ates Dou@@ ff in the Rad@@ r@@ enn@@ bahn , many people in the internet point out , like a certain bow@@ cher of the z@@ ema of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio could be . &quot;
&quot; the team member of the US team at Archery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a rush on Twitter after pictures , on which he sees the Wolf of Wall Street Star un@@ cann@@ y . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the ar@@ cher got the mad@@ ness in the social media and gave to that he has already heard since his childhood that he looks like Leo . &quot;
&quot; I myself do not see great simil@@ arity with the exception of facial hair , Bra@@ dy the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot;
&quot; he is a well @-@ looking guy , so I do that at ease as compl@@ iment . &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 this year will undoubtedly become more in the center : the sincere simil@@ arity between the British fores@@ h@@ inger Greg Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor Ne@@ il Patrick Har@@ ris .
the Russian Tur@@ ner@@ in Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with its huge , ex@@ pressive eyes should go through double @-@ off for the Cu@@ ban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria E@@ ste@@ fan . &quot;
and in the swimming pool the South African Schw@@ immer Cameron van der Burg@@ h has been compared with the Gle@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison .
&quot; a course above : this user is the view that Nathan is the &quot; &quot; athlet@@ ic version &quot; &quot; of the in@@ ception actor . &quot;
a further continued comparison has been drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ i that proves similar to heavy eyebrows and lips .
&quot; the Russian silver med@@ itations Y@@ ul@@ ia E@@ f@@ im@@ ova points more than just the sun @-@ baked skin and bl@@ ond hair like the actress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ Cor@@ d , while the American Adrian Adrian Gh@@ aly@@ n@@ ne was att@@ ested , a &quot; athlet@@ ic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; strong women : football star Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter actress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar facial form and eyes &quot;
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy about that others have fallen the simil@@ arities .
theory in the room : according to this user there is a reason for the simil@@ arity of the pa@@ ares maybe for a reason
&quot; a Twitter User@@ in explained their satisfaction , that &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the US @-@ soccer star Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter actress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar facial form and eyes . &quot;
&quot; other popular compar@@ isons g@@ err@@ i Wal@@ sh @-@ Jenn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical with the actress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold med@@ aill@@ ants in the Tur@@ ns Gab@@ by Douglas , who resem@@ bles their own beautiful , wide smile , which resem@@ bles that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union . &quot;

the buyer did not know where they should sit down when a woman over@@ laid their clothes in the midst of a priest to try under@@ p@@ ants .
&quot; in order to gr@@ ac@@ ulate the situation , they know how they looked out in it , moved out and put them back into the shelf . &quot;

&quot; a mother of two children , Jenny David@@ son , who was at the same time in the store , said that after the mysterious wife had tried the under@@ wear , she turned back to og and the store without buy something . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; people could not believe what they saw . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the sales area , they took a pair of under@@ p@@ ants out of the base , moved their own Stru@@ m@@ ess and p@@ ants , and tried them . &quot;
&quot; she did not even try to find a somewhat discre@@ te place to do it - she was just there , fre@@ ch like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; everybody died when they did the under@@ p@@ ants that you obviously have not liked , since they put them back into the shelf . &quot;
they repet@@ itive the same with three other sub@@ p@@ ants before they finally decided that you have nothing liked to come back again .
&quot; it did not seem to distur@@ b , that they would like to think any one or about the person who would buy the under@@ p@@ ants that they had tried . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. David@@ son , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; as ref@@ utable to think that someone would have under@@ p@@ ants with home , who had a different person and that were not washed . &quot;
the inc@@ ident occurred on Tuesday morning .
&quot; Mrs. David@@ son added : &quot; as I have got , the staff tries to pull the cl@@ amping pieces from the sale after they left - what exactly is good . &quot;
&quot; I would hate it to go home with a new pair of under@@ p@@ ants to go home and find out that a different wife she had , and went back and did not washed away . &quot;

how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a before ce@@ ase@@ fire
&quot; the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of D@@ ail@@ y@@ mail.com could make it a bit safer for you . &quot;
&quot; we spoke with Rh@@ one Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand@@ master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Ver@@ ban@@ des in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers . &quot;
&quot; regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or from behind , this video will show you how to turn it for your inc@@ ense . &quot;
&quot; when you accumul@@ ate yourself from behind , then you should see yourself as the first turn , so that you can see your att@@ acker , &quot; &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
take the weapon then between your fore@@ arm and your shoulder before you hit him with your free el@@ bow in the face .
&quot; then beat him so@@ jour@@ ned with the knee in front of p@@ iste and turn , while the att@@ acker before pain collap@@ sed , the weapon out of his hands . beat it with the run into the face and move forward , while they set the weapon to him . &quot;
&quot; with att@@ ackers that approach from the front , the technique is similar - move your body from the bus line , grab the weapon and turn them , so that the att@@ acker cannot shoot . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , take the weight onto the weapon and beat the att@@ acker on the chest , then turn the weapon out of his grip before they move ahead and set the weapon to it . &quot;
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it is Miz@@ ra@@ chi pre@@ power .
&quot; but remember that there is the saf@@ est , your money too rich - if you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a grand@@ master . &quot;
Reis@@ ender Ian W@@ right scrap@@ ers for a travel guide to his tongue at the dirty places of Europe

&quot; before the der@@ ivation of each object , he used a L@@ umin@@ ometer to get up and to show us what he will be included . &quot;
&quot; but the experiment , which was fil@@ med under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ h@@ iker &apos;s Guide to Inner Strength , brought some surprising results to day@@ light . &quot;
&quot; the thought , the fl@@ oppy kno@@ b of a draw toil@@ ette , which has already been used by thousands , but actually are in a kitchen m@@ ashed more bad bacteria . &quot;
&quot; on his journey through Europe Mr. W@@ right spoke to doctors and medical professionals on the promotion of intestinal bacteria , as well as his own health . &quot;
&quot; luck@@ ily , nothing left what he le@@ ak , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth . &quot;
&quot; Mr. W@@ right was known to test the res@@ il@@ ience of his intest@@ ine , by going through the world , and peculi@@ ar as well as wonderful things . &quot;
&quot; from public funds to train stations , up to a dishwasher of toilets , the task set his immune system definitely under a sample &quot;
&quot; in the film he told , &quot; &quot; already as a child I was relatively un@@ worried about what my health concerns and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms , and mud . &quot;
in the film he was definitely righteous .
&quot; the only thing he spreads , was a dirty public toilet in Russia . &quot;
its pro@@ spect@@ acle showed a L@@ umin@@ omet@@ ry of over 4000 units .
in comparison to this amounts to the L@@ umin@@ omet@@ ric hands less than 60 .
&quot; but there was a Russian toilet , which he ref@@ used to op@@ pose after their L@@ umin@@ omet@@ ry over 4000 units , while fres@@ hly washed hands one of less than 60 &quot;
&quot; Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Val@@ io produced the &quot; &quot; The L@@ ick@@ h@@ iker &apos;s Guide to Inner Strength , &quot; which shows the bacterial number in different locations such as the bathroom &quot;
&quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; this comes to the worst thing I got in a toilet , near . &quot;
there is nothing lubr@@ ication than that !
I &apos;m going to do nothing here because it is inside the inside .
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ h@@ iker &apos;s Guide to Inner Strength &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Val@@ io .
&quot; the company presents Mr. W@@ right with Val@@ io Ge@@ fil@@ us , which contains both Mil@@ act@@ ob@@ ac@@ illi as well as vitamin C and D , to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ ios Senior Venice President for snacks , ju@@ ices and new categories N@@ iko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to make consumers really something new . &quot;
something that is fascinating to the sight and at the same time the benefits of pro@@ biot@@ ics is explained .
&quot; we led crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings by , so that we said &quot; L@@ ass us Ian . &quot; &quot;
they claim that the interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of only about the products speak , we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system . &quot;
the growing interest in the intestinal health is a global phenomenon and this documentary we could provide more information on an interesting fashion .
I think that the film shows that we have a great sense of hum@@ our !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the direction of the film , added : &quot; let me tell me so - I would have put my respect for Ian , when he did some of the things that I would have reli@@ ant him as the ek@@ el@@ ian Russian toilet , which is shown in the film . &quot;
&quot; of course , there were things where it was easier to bring it to them and others , where this was quite difficult . &quot;
I am glad that we have recorded some of these dirty delicacies on film .
&quot; in one of Val@@ io the survey conducted by 2015 Associ@@ ated 84 percent of all respond@@ ents Mil@@ act@@ ob@@ ac@@ illi , in particular with the well being of stomach and intest@@ ine and 58 percent said that they have at least occasionally products used to have attached Mil@@ act@@ ob@@ ac@@ illi . &quot;
&quot; A@@ social family destroyed before Del@@ og@@ ation of social , in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall &quot;
a as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family left their social apartment after del@@ og@@ ation with a damage in the amount of £ 5@@ 0,000 because she had their neighbours terror@@ ist .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ aun Tre@@ bil@@ c@@ ock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in S@@ alt@@ ash to Corn@@ wall .
&quot; after they were r@@ ape from their property , we found sh@@ ocked employee , the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able state . &quot;
&quot; the walls of kl@@ aff@@ el holes on , wooden di@@ ps were ri@@ pped , tr@@ ash was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ffiti was lubr@@ icated to the walls . &quot;
the family were destroyed and it is thought that they live in a private accommodation now
&quot; Donn@@ a Mc@@ Ev@@ oy , who works for house@@ keeping at Corn@@ wall Housing , said that they are afraid that the apartment is no longer repaired . &quot;
she said : &quot; it was for people here an absolute night@@ mare and I am the view that people do not have to live in this way .
there are many things to consider when this property will probably be considered as not as beautiful part Corn@@ walls .
the family is rob@@ bed and their reputation is also .
&quot; the couple had three sons , who lived in the apartment and the police said that the terror which the family had added , tr@@ as@@ sm@@ ates with bas@@ eball , drugs , drug abuse , drugs and over@@ hau@@ g@@ ies , dispute and flu@@ ids . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ don , 47 whose name was on the le@@ ase , got an arrangement for anti @-@ party behaviour . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house , which will be demol@@ ished under circumst@@ ance , age was found in the age of &quot;
&quot; they were negoti@@ ated in the property , in which in the past , the wooden sh@@ ri@@ mp were ri@@ pped up . &quot;
neighb@@ ors said that they saw them on the road and regularly had to inv@@ oked the police .
Corn@@ wall Housing del@@ og@@ ged her and her partner this week r@@ ape by the property after they gave them a prolong@@ ed period of 11 weeks to move volunt@@ arily .
&quot; the Del@@ og@@ ation were covered by light@@ ened neighbours , they said that their lives was made to hell . &quot;
&quot; one said , &quot; she d@@ ded to anyone . &quot;
we lived 20 years next to them and it was always bad .
&quot; the countless times , which we say the police here are incredible . &quot;
&quot; today , tomorrow we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet - this we are not usual !
&quot; now , where they are finally away , it will be beautiful . &quot;
&quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ pat@@ rick , Ne@@ igh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall Housing , said that it would have been able to cooperate with local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house , to which the police was launched at regular inter@@ vals , 20 years &quot;
on the over@@ head side of the par@@ aly@@ se were dropped into tr@@ ash and old toys .
&quot; he added : &quot; it is a shame , that there was the ten@@ ant to accept any responsibility for their behavior , and that of their family since there is always the last step , the Corn@@ wall Housing into consideration . &quot;
&quot; that was a very difficult case , as the behaviour was extremely and their acts to be able to watch their neighbours for their neighbours . &quot;
&quot; I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the commune who have made cour@@ ageous to us and we have made the information provided . &quot;
I hope that this development will sp@@ ends a couple of neighbours and the message convey@@ s that ant@@ iso@@ ial behaviour will not be toler@@ ated .
F@@ itz@@ pat@@ rick said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but that they all were over 20 . &quot;
a dirty mattress located in one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ ing on the ground .
&quot; workers of the house@@ keeping will now have tr@@ apped , the house surrounded by the house . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 the police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g cannabis as well as sc@@ ales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ ies and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 . &quot;
Skel@@ don received a money penalty after they had become guilty of the pos@@ sessions of a drug of class B in commercial view .
she said that money was for a tom@@ bst@@ one of her son Lee Skel@@ don that came to life when they came to an accident .
&quot; after they were without shelter , the T@@ anya and their partners are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh . &quot;
many rooms of the house were coated with gra@@ ffiti .
the police says that they will not be ten@@ ant who will not hold the assignment .
Angela C@@ row from the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall shared that the Del@@ og@@ ation was a clear warning to the other ten@@ ant who do not hold the assignment .
&quot; this goes to those who can think of themselves without su@@ peri@@ ors , as well as those who were damaged by such a behavior . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall will never be crimin@@ als and ant@@ iso@@ able behaviour will continue to work together with partners to protect our communities .

bronze went to the Japanese Jun Miz@@ ut@@ ani .
the two Chinese have made it as expected to play in the end@@ game and made the title together .
&quot; with this , it was clear that the third time in a row would pick up a Chinese title in the sign of five rings . &quot;
last non @-@ Chinese at the top Olympia Tre@@ pp@@ chen was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Leg@@ ion@@ aire Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
&quot; mA and Z@@ hang were left on the record alone , between the sent@@ ences and time @-@ outs they had no co@@ aches in itself . &quot;
&quot; they had with@@ drawn up on the grand@@ stand , and left their shel@@ ters in a fair competition alone on each other . &quot;
&quot; the mat@@ ches until here I played for my country . &quot;
&quot; in the fin@@ als I play for me , &quot; had some log@@ ically told . &quot;
after the Part@@ ie pos@@ ented gold and silver med@@ isted winners with the China flag .
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ able .

Donald Tru@@ mp Sp@@ t ″ huge problems ″ in the election campaign
the leadership of the U.S. Re@@ public@@ ans is led by massive concerns , even in traditionally conservative states to do their majority . &quot;
pres@@ idential Donald Tru@@ mp has now been weaknesses of his election campaign in the previous re@@ publ@@ ican Hoch@@ burg Utah .
a rare moment in which the normally magn@@ anim@@ ous and self @-@ confident m@@ uted Multim@@ ill@@ ion@@ aire as something like concerns expressed as correspond@@ ents reported .
&quot; after having thrown 16 ri@@ vals within the own re@@ publ@@ ican camp of the race , now the doubts will grow on his success in the struggle for the White House . &quot;
&quot; we have enormous problems in Utah , &quot; said Tru@@ mp in front of evangel@@ ical Christians , which he asked for support in important states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot;
&quot; debt , false reports of his can@@ did@@ acy , he participated again his well @-@ known media . &quot;
Re@@ publ@@ ican High @-@ Mount@@ ing
Utah is usually a safe bank for the Re@@ public@@ ans .
&quot; according to a survey of Sur@@ vey@@ or from June according to Tru@@ mp and its Con@@ cur@@ rent@@ in from the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton , equally . &quot;
&quot; other institutes see Tru@@ mp in the front , but not by the distance that are common to re@@ publ@@ ican candidates within the state . &quot;
as endanger@@ ed Arizona and Georgia also apply to Arizona and Georgia .
&quot; in an interview of the Sen@@ ders CNB@@ C answered Tru@@ mp on the question , as he would stop the Rise of Clinton : &quot; just as I did so far . &quot;
&quot; and let &apos;s leave : this will be &quot; &quot; either successful , or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot;
&quot; he do not make anything other than &quot; &quot; the truth to tell . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if it does not know for him at the end for reasons of political corre@@ ctions , it is fine , said Tru@@ mp . &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
&quot; according to the press , the party of Tru@@ mp should have threatened to ret@@ rie@@ ve funds for the support of his election campaign , he should not present any better revers@@ ing values . &quot;
instead of it to take the candidates of the Re@@ public@@ ans for the congress more than the arms .
Olympia : tr@@ ister fr@@ aud in D@@ oping @-@ Test
the I@@ OC wants to set up a discipl@@ in@@ complete commission to the event .
Ken@@ ias became athletes after the second d@@ oping affair at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro Un@@ gem@@ ach .
&quot; after a prayer , such a d@@ oping control in the Olympic Village has sent a coach to the house in Kenya . &quot;
the International Olympic Committee shared with us to set up a discipl@@ in@@ complete commission to examine the case .
&quot; a Ken@@ y@@ onic function had shared that the former Spr@@ inter and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , in the Olympic village had a urine test under the name of the 800 @-@ meter @-@ L@@ äu@@ fers Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich . &quot;
this was reported by the team of Ken@@ ias from the d@@ oping controller .
&quot; the IA@@ AF , the I@@ OC has asked the information about the event in order to strict own research , shared a IA@@ AF speaker . &quot;
&quot; depending on the results of the examination and the following measures of the I@@ OC , the IA@@ AF will make an assessment on the IA@@ AF statement . &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) has gone to the d@@ oping @-@ control station and signed as Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich , the sample delivered and signed , &quot; explained Ken@@ ias Chef de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot;
he was owned by accredit@@ ation of athletes that stood on the list for workouts in the world @-@ anti @-@ d@@ oping Agency .
Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich was released in Beijing WM @-@ four over 800 meters .
four days before was the Ken@@ yan athlet@@ ics Michael Rot@@ ich drawn from the Rio @-@ Games .
he is to be informed against cash payments of his country on cont@@ est@@ ing d@@ oping @-@ tests .
&quot; according to the report , he should have been arrested by his return at the airport of Nairobi . &quot;
Kenya at the I@@ OC according to numerous D@@ oping @-@ Ver@@ go has been under special observation since some time .
at the announcement of the I@@ OC issued more than 2000 D@@ oping target targets before the Rio @-@ Games I was advised to be advised that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia will be taken into the visa .
the world @-@ anti @-@ d@@ oping Agency had exercis@@ ed much pressure in Brazil on the African country to create an anti @-@ d@@ oping law and a functioning control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before Olympia beginning .
&quot; in the episode , the WA@@ DA Kenia from the list of countries , whose d@@ oping com@@ bating con@@ form with the rules of the WA@@ DA are . &quot;
Kenya is regarded as a big runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the land won at the World Cup 2015 in Beijing most med@@ als .
in a series of television report the ARD were repeatedly re@@ produced again that in Kenya D@@ oping funds are easily accessible and there is a significant ment@@ ality of the sport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ OC @-@ member Richard Po@@ und called for a similar study in Kenya as he had presented them in Russian Athlet@@ ics . &quot;
this could be proven that in this sport su@@ perf@@ icial and systemat@@ ically thought was thought .
Russia the athletes have been ruled out by the summer .

&quot; it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra . &quot;
I would say that we really have music really in our blood !
in this st@@ aging Bart@@ oli plays a older Maria .
&quot; they remember their kindness with Tony , while the younger Mary plays and dances . &quot;
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
&quot; first , because they are musical exceptional ! &quot;
and then there were Mary &apos;s personality .
&quot; she says it in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and funny and bright . &quot;

&quot; she resem@@ bles me very , my Italian character , which I did as Roman , laugh@@ ing Bart@@ oli . &quot;
D@@ ud@@ am@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Cec@@ ilia is a wonderful artist .
it is such an honor to work with her .
it is an enormous man .
and Bart@@ oli gives the compl@@ iment back : &quot; D@@ ud@@ am@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passion@@ ately !
condu@@ cting is for him a necessity .
&quot; one sees it in any of his movements , in his blood , it is his life ! &quot;
it is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , this is very important at all ! &quot;
&quot; for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; , &quot; this piece is about pre@@ judi@@ ces and fan@@ at@@ icism . &quot;
&quot; today we did the refugees , then the Pu@@ ert@@ ik@@ ans went to New York , and the New York inhabitants did not want them . &quot;
&quot; they are the same themes , and they are just as significant as it was today . &quot;

&quot; as the paper reports on the figures of the Federal Ministry of Finance , the Turks was already judged before the cou@@ p the largest group of the political persecution recognized in Germany . &quot;
30 June shall be 11.@@ 386 people and therefore nearly 29 percent of all as as@@ yl@@ ated recognized ( 39.@@ 625 ) .

Mecklenburg @-@ Vor@@ p@@ ommern : &quot; where to go where it is doing &quot;
&quot; stran@@ gely Mecklenburg @-@ Vor@@ p@@ ommern : the locals get nothing from the summer @-@ election campaign , and the hol@@ iday@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ West@@ ph@@ alia may not choose the farmer . &quot;
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vor@@ p@@ ommern they have understood .
&quot; 2021 will not be held at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ in parliament decided already at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; because stup@@ id as far as it is not : summer holidays , heat , and land @-@ day fight - that is b@@ ites . &quot;
&quot; the nat@@ ives , which are to be convinced by the elect@@ oral elements are on vacation . &quot;
&quot; most holiday makers , which are in the country , on U@@ se@@ dom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not a locals , can therefore not choose the farmer . &quot;
&quot; there are practical problems : in the holidays are hel@@ pers , the posters as@@ ps , bal@@ lo@@ ons , fl@@ yers are spread and counting at the end of voices , only we@@ aken . &quot;
&quot; until 4 September 2016 , the elect@@ oral and last Fer@@ ient@@ ag , Mecklenburg @-@ Vor@@ p@@ ommern has to leave the election of Mecklenburg @-@ Vor@@ p@@ ommern once again . &quot;
&quot; the hot phase , if one can say that at all , has just begun . &quot;
&quot; and it is also about something : Prime Minister Erwin Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CD@@ U Co@@ alition , must be for his office . &quot;
&quot; SPD , since 1998 the strongest party , lies clearly in survey@@ s behind the CD@@ U . &quot;
&quot; it is thr@@ illing , how strong virgin Af@@ D cuts and what remains at the end of Ko@@ al@@ ition@@ st@@ aug@@ ht@@ s . &quot;
&quot; cel@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 , has an almost un@@ ob@@ trusive elect@@ oral campaign , can be seen from his big pl@@ aster . &quot;
&quot; he travels throughout land , spread ros@@ es and chat a little bit with the people , just as it did its legendary wor@@ t@@ kar@@ ger predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , Seel@@ ering k@@ old feet get and gives ch@@ anc@@ ellor Merkel had the blame for the after@@ glow of the Af@@ D . &quot;
&quot; your refuge@@ e policy , you &quot; We do that &quot; &quot; have acceler@@ ates the rise of sp@@ op@@ ul@@ ators , which will now cost him the beautiful office . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U with its nickname de@@ co@@ dates , the Minister of Lorenz Caff@@ ier , has already been experiencing , as it is , when you make the wrong time at the right place of the election campaign . &quot;
she has invited two ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel to major profess@@ ions ; Merkel Bundestag is located in the north @-@ east .
&quot; but the target group did not work , there were more North Rhine @-@ West@@ ph@@ alia , Berlin and Saxony as Meckl@@ en@@ burger and Vor@@ p@@ ommern . &quot;
&quot; there was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; held Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vor@@ p@@ ommern , recently in N@@ DR . &quot;
&quot; but it was too much to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , the North @-@ CD@@ U is largely un@@ covered in the usual elect@@ oral rate of market spaces and above shopping centres with umbre@@ llas and bal@@ lo@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; this , so , coconut , plays only a &quot; &quot; sub@@ ordin@@ ate role &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; also the Union has mast@@ ered that you have to walk on the land the base , that it must be very str@@ ing@@ ent , once again a wire to the people . &quot;
&quot; you are going on like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : in the expan@@ se of the country hardly there . &quot;
&quot; the Council of the CD@@ U @-@ vot@@ ers Kok@@ ert at his comrades , however , is also self @-@ ext@@ ingu@@ ishing : &quot; you must go there where it is aw@@ ake , namely , where men are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Gol@@ dene weddings , each birthday party must be used . &quot;
&quot; because much on the game stands , Sell@@ ering has now called its SPD in a particularly dedicated election campaign . &quot;
&quot; in survey@@ s the Socialists and Democrats recently rose with 22 percent behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) , and just just before the Af@@ D ( 19 ) . &quot;
&quot; at the election of 2011 , the SPD had already won the SPD with 35,@@ 6 percent in front of the CD@@ U ( 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Gre@@ ens , small @-@ party with seven percent in the survey@@ s , the jump into the farmer . &quot;
they make a modern vir@@ tue of the holiday @-@ need a modern vir@@ tue and place their elect@@ oral fight @-@ largely into the internet .
&quot; online @-@ election campaign , it is called the state @-@ president Claudia Müller . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , green choices set up on track @-@ ensu@@ ite according to local mo@@ ods under the vac@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; Sil@@ ke Ga@@ jek , the Sp@@ ell@@ an@@ di@@ dat@@ in , cur@@ v@@ t just with a house@@ boat through the m@@ ec@@ kl@@ burg@@ ische lakes and finds it still beautiful . &quot;
&quot; your impression : &quot; &quot; vot@@ ing in Mecklenburg @-@ Vor@@ p@@ ommern is not a penalty . &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ refurb@@ ishment : Gast@@ orials suffer from block@@ ing
&quot; with the B 27 , there is nothing to m@@ eck@@ ern . &quot;
&quot; for those responsible for those who are working at 5.@@ 30 p.m. in the morning and only at 20 p.m. , there is no praise praise . &quot;
&quot; they all made pretty jag@@ ged , &quot; tells El@@ vir@@ a T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff by the jet gas station . &quot;
this is a Super@@ team .
there is no delay .
&quot; the job@@ site could be moved on weekends to half @-@ time scheduled to be moved to the south , until the end of October all will be ready . &quot;
&quot; it will also be the horror of those responsible for constructions , for example when it comes to furnis@@ hing co@@ desc@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; since the job@@ site on Monday to south , there is also the block@@ age of the as@@ erg@@ straße in kil@@ ter@@ dingen , and therefore the connection to Rott@@ enburg again has changed the traffic situation within the place . &quot;
the citizens can now take away from Of@@ ter@@ dingen who drive out of the B 27 again .
the de@@ viation by the place seems to go back .
&quot; since there was some significant disorders , &quot; says the dep@@ uty management of the modern@@ ization of the principal main manager Florian King . &quot;
&quot; the inhabitants of Bach@@ er@@ straße , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had chosen to fight with more traffic noise , because many barriers were sought and rather their Nav@@ i trusted as the sign@@ age . &quot;
what led to some trucks in residential areas .
&quot; as well as the speed , the community has not been kept , the municipality will rein@@ force the mess@@ enger of Mö@@ ss@@ ingen . &quot;
&quot; there was significant cross@@ ings , &quot; says King who made himself on site about the situation . &quot;
there are two to three per minute .
the Quick@@ est was on the road with 77 pcs in the pace @-@ 30 @-@ zone .
&quot; since the job@@ site , it has become more quiet but quiet@@ er . &quot;
for business@@ men at the B 27 it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rott@@ enburg now open the road again .
in the cards we are not happy to have a business@@ man .
&quot; but that the B 27 @-@ renovation of them has led to revenue growth , each one lets you see . &quot;
&quot; however , some more and some less affected . &quot;
&quot; who has to do with the &quot; end customers &quot; , &quot; so for other companies , it has hardly any consequences . &quot;
&quot; also at the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Ma@@ ier Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; maximum light decline &quot; , &quot; but also a means that of course &quot; the career is missing . &quot;
the strongest exploited are the local along the road .
&quot; J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , will find clear words . &quot;
this is already existing @-@ threat@@ ening .
&quot; not only him , but all the restaurants have it &quot; hard . &quot; &quot;
it lack@@ ed the customers from He@@ ch@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rott@@ weil . &quot;
we have to be glad to be happy about every Euro sales .
&quot; revenue refer to &quot; far over 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tr@@ acking have cast its operation &quot; by two years . &quot;
the half of his employees have to be released .
&quot; if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been released , the policy would have been different . &quot;
&quot; instead , President Jörg Schmidt based on a request of G@@ öh@@ ner , whether there &apos;s a financial compensation , with the hint answered , the guest &apos;s benef@@ ited otherwise from the advantages of the situation on the B 27 Now they are even the dis@@ advantages that sur@@ render . &quot;
&quot; G@@ öh@@ ner knows of other land@@ circles , where something generous have been treated . &quot;
&quot; with all cl@@ uster , G@@ öh@@ ner is certain that his inn@@ s will continue . &quot;
&quot; after all , the family run already settled since 17@@ 15 , he refers to the long history . &quot;
&quot; that other Stamm@@ ga@@ este is now due to the complicated traffic @-@ leadership less frequently preventive , it can understand . &quot;
&quot; if you do not drive out , it is also what is beautiful . &quot;
&quot; that his ancest@@ or is back to the end of the san@@ itation , it has no doubt . &quot;
&quot; despite the crises with B@@ SE and birds , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the impact of the B 27 building work on its client@@ ele for the biggest crisis that has experienced his inn@@ s in its long standing history . &quot;
&quot; six months work , this is already brutal . &quot;
constantly in the name of terror@@ ist attack on laws .
after the recent adv@@ ancement of the Minister de Ma@@ iz@@ ière now presents a thick@@ er security package .
but what has a Dul@@ ce status to do with terror ?
and what does the co@@ al@@ location say to all that ?
Thomas de Ma@@ iz@@ ière gives the Com@@ mentary .
&quot; all his proposals were politically zum@@ ut@@ ible , &quot; says the Federal Minister for the presentation of his new security styles . &quot;
they over@@ call anyone .
&quot; other , further points would first be discussed within the parties . &quot;
I also participated in it .
&quot; but as the Minister of Minister him , but in the outcome , and in a &quot; &quot; achieved consensus &quot; &quot; within the coalition . &quot;
de Ma@@ iz@@ ière has left a little time following the recent proposals in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach before it presents his conclusions to safety in the Republic .
but the fall now all the more extensive .
&quot; some is already known , pro@@ sp@@ ilt : that a new security authority to take care of the buttons enco@@ ded communication is not new . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also , not the fact that Germany must include several EU requirements for passengers and tru@@ ce . &quot;
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for safety authorities is also not surprising .
&quot; partly , de Ma@@ iz@@ ière starts a second check @-@ up for proposals that has not to be done with the SPD . he wants to put sympath@@ etic to terr@@ org@@ y under punishment and ji@@ ha@@ dists with a double citiz@@ enship in the German pas@@ sport . &quot;
&quot; they will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; space of the CD@@ U @-@ man . &quot;
he nonetheless hold this for reasonable and also called nothing that have no chances for co@@ al@@ ition@@ ers .
a few new ideas presents de Ma@@ iz@@ ière .
they are partly in himself : he plans quick access for de@@ port@@ ations and more possibilities for adher@@ ing people before the de@@ port@@ ations .
refugees who are targeted at the country to check out their smartphones and add social media accounts for a security ex@@ am .
&quot; with Dul@@ rations for un@@ even asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to make some worse than so far - about such , the off@@ ences , or their papers throw away from their identity . &quot;
some of them is political and legally har@@ ass@@ le .
maneu@@ ches also affects or un@@ balanced and leaves questions openly .
and with some points - in the in@@ equ@@ alization of thought for example - represents the question : what does that actually have to do with security and terror ?
&quot; yes , says de Ma@@ iz@@ ière , it is important to differenti@@ ate between issues refugees and terror . &quot;
but it is not in b@@ illing that the Att@@ ach@@ ers of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg refugees were .
&quot; in addition , many people are worried about the high refuge@@ e concerns about security . &quot;
&quot; and things , which are deeply employed , now they left out in elect@@ oral times . &quot;
the inner security is enormous in the focus .
&quot; only the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uns@@ ure is great .
and yes .
Union and SPD are therefore increasingly concerned with the subject of inner security .
in the past few days it went up between the two parties .
&quot; first a gar@@ rison argument about the equipment of the Bundes@@ pol@@ ize@@ dek , then on a security @-@ political ideas of some Un@@ ions @-@ Minister , in which the resources also call a bur@@ ka ban and a return from the double citiz@@ enship . &quot;
de Ma@@ iz@@ ière is also here to reconc@@ il@@ able sounds .
from a return from the two @-@ pass he hold nothing .
we have satisfied the discussion in Germany .
they are not meaningful because it is not meaningful .
and at a bur@@ ka ban he constit@@ utional concerns .
&quot; whether its own package is constit@@ utional on all corners , and if it is indeed &quot; mostly &quot; is necessary for the co@@ al@@ location . &quot;
there is quite a lot in what to fight against dispute .
&quot; however , the SPD is currently trying to pro@@ filed in the subject of inner security . &quot;
&quot; Part@@ e@@ ich@@ ef Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ aled first time careful talk and says : &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything about what to contribute to security . &quot;
even more Volkswagen gl@@ imp@@ ure comes through .
&quot; despite diesel @-@ sk@@ and@@ als , the equipment used worldwide . &quot;
&quot; however , not in all markets it runs around . &quot;
at the return action there are vor@@ tex for a term .
Volkswagen will start with the exp@@ ands of the second half @-@ year .
&quot; in Europe &apos;s biggest high@@ ways , in spite of its many brands in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ driven markets continues to develop a plus . &quot;
&quot; but in July weak@@ ened the core brand VW especially in Western Europe , and thus we@@ ed the overall sales , as shown in the D@@ ax not@@ ated companies . &quot;
the brand of VW in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year of year .
&quot; in Western Europe , according to China the second most important market , the sales was 14 percent below the previous year . &quot;
in the h@@ omet@@ own Germany the excav@@ ations around almost a six@@ ties .
bran@@ ding Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weak@@ ly numbers from July above all on two selling days less in Europe .
&quot; in addition , it has been a purchase in some core markets through &quot; altered economic conditions &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the situation around the cou@@ p of Turkey , the British V@@ ot@@ um will also be charged to the end of the EU , explained a spokes@@ person . &quot;
&quot; in the USA , where the &quot; &quot; gas@@ ket first escal@@ ated , there is also further a min@@ us to book . &quot;
great cap for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; overall , the most commonly affected house of the Nieder@@ s@@ achsen continues through the diesel engines : after the first seven months is only a supplier of 0.3 percent to 3,@@ 37 million vehicles to be@@ ech . &quot;
Fred K@@ appl@@ er was able to report on a sales basis from January to July .
&quot; 1.3 percent more vehicles delivered Volkswagen in this time , worldwide 5,@@ 904 million . &quot;
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated with a software agreement .
alone in Germany you call some 2.5 million wag@@ ons for retro@@ fitting into the gar@@ ages .
&quot; in the course of the retro@@ fitting , VW , that the conversion of cars has no negative effects . &quot;
&quot; after retro@@ fitting the vehicles , there was no deteri@@ oration of fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor rate . &quot;
&quot; the car@@ makers set up the customer after the retro@@ fitting &quot; &quot; guaranteed &quot; &quot; certificate , but not of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was on Friday in corporate circles . &quot;
reason are legal subt@@ let@@ ies .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; had reports , Volkswagen has now granted its German customers now a guarantee for re@@ warded Diesel models . &quot;
this would have been confirmed on the last Monday VW @-@ representative in the Bundes@@ ir@@ sm@@ ister@@ ium .
&quot; from the road @-@ to @-@ ister@@ ium , it was confirmed that it was this meeting . &quot;
&quot; VW , the listing of my investig@@ ators and the KBA has to be fulfilled . &quot;
&quot; devi@@ ations of these are not accepted , &quot; said the Federal Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( C@@ SU ) according to the ministry . &quot;
&quot; VW has assumed the guarantee that in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor performance after the trans@@ forming no deteri@@ or@@ ations take place and all typ@@ ing relevant vehicle values unchanged . &quot;
&quot; Volkswagen self uses the term &quot; &quot; War@@ ran@@ ty &quot; &quot; but not as it was in corporate circles . &quot;
&quot; in the wide term &quot; &quot; War@@ ran@@ ty &quot; &quot; Volkswagen the opportunity to come for example a half year after retro@@ fitting into a workshop - and this can lead to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do . &quot;
&quot; even in the customer interest , it is important to avoid that it comes with any other damage , that is nothing to do with the Ab@@ g@@ ass@@ k@@ and@@ al , to an uns@@ ure with regard to possible warranty conditions , as it was . &quot;
&quot; therefore , I do not use the term &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; . &quot; &quot;
Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enbank G@@ mund at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands from rich as@@ parag@@ us in the future Criminal Tribun@@ al - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; chef Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s only about 139 customers , the 40 million euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or day@@ time parking . &quot;
&quot; the Bundes@@ verband German banks speaks of a single fall , and looks at this no signal : normal counter would not fear , to pay for their austerity criminal law . &quot;
&quot; banks banks money through night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay up to 0.4 per cent of criminal law . &quot;
this fee demands the Rai@@ ffe@@ eis@@ enbank G@@ mund from September by private and corporate clients for deposits than 100.000 euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or day@@ time accounts .
&quot; the first 100.000 euro are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100.000 cost more than 400 Euros in the year , &quot; said Paul . &quot;
&quot; he has been estimated at least 40 million euros , that could be with@@ drawn from one day on the other and that he could not be util@@ ized . &quot;
&quot; that lie with me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 per cent of costs , &quot; &quot; said the bank@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; I can not place for any million 4000 euros . &quot;
the costs will give it further to the perpet@@ ual principle .
&quot; money simply lie in the v@@ aul@@ ts of the Rai@@ ffe@@ isen database would be much too dangerous , &quot; I have experienced four over@@ s , I do not yet know the fifth , &quot; &quot; said the bank . &quot;
most of the customers have had understanding and change to other investors .
only a few hikes to other banks .
&quot; the gen@@ ossen@@ schaft Bayern explained : &quot; &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the ECB will be caused by all banks significant costs . &quot;
&quot; not to carry , be &quot; &quot; economic permanently not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account , credit cards or trans@@ itions . &quot;
the prison for deposits from three million euros had made the Thuring@@ ian People and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enbank Alt@@ en@@ burger Land with their skat@@ bank branch 2014 head@@ lines .
&quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , chief executive leader of the Ban@@ ken@@ Association , said : &quot; &quot; we do not expect to pay the priv@@ at@@ ile dec@@ anting for deposits , this competition is much too strong in Germany under banks and savings . &quot;
&quot; a ban@@ ker said , at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see it will give it a cliff that is equipped by the property a bit of lush . &quot;
that can be a small bank for the problem when they get free money hat@@ s .
&quot; 1911 . founded in 1911 , gen@@ ossen@@ schaft G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rott@@ ah @-@ E@@ gladly , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot;
&quot; living in the region living well @-@ known actors , athletes and entrepreneurs . &quot;
&quot; the gen@@ ossen@@ schaft Bayern &quot; are currently no further banks to calculate the basis for deposits of priv@@ ative customers , &quot; said spokes@@ man Ernst . &quot;
&quot; President of the federal state of German folk banks and Rai@@ ffe@@ isen banks ( Bv@@ R ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared the end of June : &quot; the thres@@ hold , go to neg@@ atives towards the private customers , is very high . &quot;
&quot; competition is hard , and it threat@@ ening the migration of investors . &quot;
customers in Germany will not leave the width in the width .
destination plates : who che@@ ys actually sound @-@ plates ?
lonely men middle aged records .
&quot; before you go to the commentary piece , to ex@@ trac@@ ed him under the pseud@@ onym of non @-@ aven@@ ues with r@@ ins@@ ults , this statement is derived from the current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the multipl@@ ying of sound records is not attributed to a boom in mill@@ enn@@ ial speci@@ als who wish to welcome the novel@@ ty of physical objects but on mid@@ life nost@@ algia . &quot;
those who have recently bought a record are of all pre@@ diction according to the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most in@@ most vulner@@ able .
it is also not a hor@@ des by hob@@ bies - it has an emotional meaning : older but@@ aries retain their feelings rather for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it alone time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
&quot; if this blog is a news report on television would follow me the camera would follow me in the midst of a busy street in Soho , a modest gray cl@@ age and wild . &quot;
&quot; so , let us take a look at that . &quot;
&quot; even though the heart is slowly moving to its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where once independent seller has been residents - there are still a hand@@ ful fantastic record @-@ stores . &quot;
&quot; I would probably ask the c@@ amer@@ am@@ ann , the camera will stand out for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to assess their age and minds through observation . &quot;
&quot; Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , which I visited by S@@ ister Ray ( data number : eight men middle aged ) into the Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( data number : eight men middle aged ) , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and through the shops to fill the few hours . &quot;
&quot; is he a collector , ask me ? &quot;
&quot; I appreciate , &quot; says he . &quot;
&quot; I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates . &quot;
&quot; these sound plates , shown above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I am not followed to him home ) , cl@@ ides the walls of his living room . &quot;
&quot; the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and sing@@ les , the result of his available income : it is now able to buy panels which he could not afford when they appeared and again to buy items when he sold young and ple@@ t . &quot;
&quot; many things I bought , are from the late 60@@ th , early 70s , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things where I was probably something to buy it , &quot; &quot; says he . &quot;
&quot; he is true that those who buy records , rather intro@@ vert@@ ed and would like to spend time , and adds : &quot; I do not smoke and I drink not very much . &quot;
this is my lungs .
&quot; WE@@ Z , 25 who works by S@@ ister Ray works , also believes many customers that he meets to the You@@ Go@@ v profile . &quot;
&quot; however , he has also noticed a new wave of people who have heard about the Medi@@ enh@@ pe , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and allow yourself to purchase their old records . &quot;
&quot; from the conversations that I have led , people are usually inher@@ ent in 1998 or in 1999 of their collection . &quot;
&quot; customers who once bought their records , to buy CDs now , sell their CDs to buy their records once again . &quot;
this would explain the boom of tra@@ ilers of the record of a particular age .
but what about the con@@ genital emotional meaning of plates ?
it takes only a few seconds in a shop like Ph@@ onica to recognize that tur@@ nt@@ ables offers a soothing community of equ@@ alities .
&quot; according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers participated in the cont@@ act@@ less payment system . &quot;
some tur@@ nt@@ ables are overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to draw back to the stability of confidential sound @-@ noise from objects that give happ@@ ier jewels .
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the col@@ t of a void or possession of the owner as a kind of comfort , &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot;
this is for me as a collector and I think that it is so many people with many people .
it is a simple way to deal mentally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social worker ! &quot; &quot; k@@ ills an employee of a flat stack . &quot;
&quot; a survey of IC@@ M in April revealed that nearly 50 % of the people who bought the last month a record , they have not yet been mixed . &quot;
&quot; the survey found also that 41 % have a record player that never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record , have no record player . &quot;
&quot; at this time of post office , I would probably be very concerned while I bl@@ aze through a stack to Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations bl@@ aze . &quot;
&quot; J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works with Sounds of the Universe ( data number : three men middle ages ) has noticed a &quot; &quot; Trophy &apos;s aspects &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; someone arrived only recently here and said , &quot; &quot; I had no record player , but I would like to buy a radio@@ head record , so I would put them into the shelf , &quot; &quot; says he . &quot;
&quot; this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens . &quot;
&quot; more product @-@ last@@ y , less mus@@ i@@ kl@@ ast@@ y . &quot;
&quot; we have people who say , &quot; I have no tur@@ nt@@ ables . &quot;
&quot; these are younger people , not older who come to slow . &quot;
&quot; stop that has dedicated to the record almost an entire floor , has a b@@ ail audience when I travelled . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , Teen@@ age@@ j@@ ungs and Women middle age . &quot;
&quot; even though the atmosphere is something less relaxed than in the af@@ ore@@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts neu@@ ester synth@@ etic and sex@@ t@@ ec@@ ter pop instead of experimental jazz , from the loud@@ speakers - it is good to see such a diversity among customers . &quot;
&quot; none of them looks strange , but nag@@ ging psychological grap@@ mat@@ a are hard to conce@@ iv@@ able if one stands in addition to someone 30 seconds long . &quot;
&quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been around for a few minutes in the store and considers the Var@@ iet@@ es on the sale of the panels . &quot;
it more makes a man@@ ne@@ quin as a big one .
&quot; it does not deserve much , so the collection of sheets is not a real option , says it . &quot;
it costs much .
&quot; it is easy to listen to music from a computer or to another way , but the beauty of plates is ... &quot; she is driving with a de@@ ar@@ able s@@ igh . &quot;
I do not know how to explain it - it is really unique .
&quot; my last stop is a business , from which it is said that a new generation of tur@@ nt@@ ables have inspired : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; while I give the pret@@ ension to sample the je@@ ans Hot@@ p@@ ants , I wat@@ ched a group of young teen@@ ager , which group@@ ed for a moment to buy polar@@ oid cameras before a father and daughter to think a cros@@ ley tur@@ nt@@ ables . &quot;
&quot; on the left is a staircase , a wall full of panels of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential records for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; nobody looks like it - maybe because they are only purely decorative , some as far above that it is impossible to drive them . &quot;
it is pure &quot; tur@@ nt@@ ables . &quot;
&quot; but considering that any attraction for these objects could mean more money for the industry and to send some customers to the depths of Soh@@ os for more , there is nothing to compl@@ ain . &quot;
&quot; it is not a surprise that a population group , which has more time and money than others , even the one that is most of the most luxury items such as plates . &quot;
&quot; also , if my repl@@ ication were able to agree that the results of You@@ Go@@ v , let them , at least in tur@@ nt@@ ables in Soho , the large number of female collectors and tur@@ nt@@ ables , which exist in reality , tur@@ nt@@ ables and in Onlin@@ e@@ for@@ en . &quot;
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
&quot; they spend their Thursday morning with certainty not with the st@@ rolling through tur@@ nt@@ ables of the Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves by plates , while they solidi@@ fied the middle of a un@@ cann@@ y , 30 @-@ year @-@ old moder@@ ator , who is on the shoulders nothing of the middle aged men . &quot;

French court leh@@ older offer on demol@@ ition of shops in the jungle refuge@@ e camp
&quot; a French court has rejected a quot@@ ation of the authorities in Calais , do@@ z@@ ens of provis@@ ional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais , living in the thousands of refugees . &quot;
&quot; for a cour@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation this week argu@@ ed the authorities in Calais that the state should be commanded , 72 provis@@ ional shops or sell , hair@@ dress@@ ers or tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in provis@@ ional restaurants . &quot;
the Pre@@ fecture of Calais ar@@ gues that these places should be lower because they would be a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and that a fire and sanitary risk .
&quot; humanitarian groups shared with the court that shops and restaurants are important , as the free meals that are offered by the state @-@ supported union and other groups , not enough food for the growing numbers in stock . &quot;
they carried out beyond that the provis@@ ional shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; a court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the bank transfer of people who operate the 72 provis@@ ional business , but spatial that the concerns of the pre@@ fecture of Calais . &quot;
&quot; judge Jean @-@ François Mol@@ la said that the grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than just people feed , which are living in extremely pre@@ dic@@ ular conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas of quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
&quot; one of the places that was threatened by the Nieder@@ re@@ issen , the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café des Lag@@ ers , which is common and French meals a day , English and French classes as well as a advice on asylum @-@ need@@ y for the hundreds of vulner@@ able , un@@ accompanied minority year in stock . &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement Trailer
&quot; Germany &apos;s t@@ aser must be set to the next generation of speed sensor : in different countries , among others in H@@ esse and Brandenburg , new light@@ ning devices are tested especially effectively . &quot;
the fut@@ ur@@ istic en@@ forcement En@@ forcement Trailer for the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example at accident points where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
&quot; for example , on highway building or to run bridges with temporary Tem@@ pol@@ im@@ it , there are often no necessary infrastructure to ensure there with a stationary sh@@ aker for compliance with speed control . &quot;
a permanent mobility structure can be too dangerous or consuming .
&quot; the En@@ forcement trailer is self @-@ sufficient : its battery keeps on un@@ interrupted measurement operation five days , the fall@@ op@@ ters will be encrypted via a modem . &quot;
laser technology can also be captured all vehicles over several tracks simultaneously .
&quot; variable speed ranges , as well as penetration @-@ bot@@ e to time , timet@@ ables and vehicle class can also be monitored . &quot;
in the up@@ loaded state you can move the trailer according to the manufacturer by each car with trailer coupling .
&quot; so that he is not easy to handle , he is low@@ ered in the measuring mode , so that the wheels will disappear in the ar@@ mo@@ red and by the way also sh@@ us@@ eless out@@ lets . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a built @-@ in al@@ ar@@ man@@ lage is to protect the bl@@ ater before v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
since 2015 the trailer is tested according to the information of Vit@@ ronic in different countries and now also used .
&quot; in addition to foreign authorities with the new technology : the youngest has made France 100 pieces , after an order of 150 pieces last year . &quot;
&quot; great Britain brings silver in the 7 @-@ er Rug@@ by , after Fiji master@@ class gold &quot;
&quot; the impressive performance of Great Britain at the 7 @-@ er Rug@@ by came in the fin@@ als on Thursday evening at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when it came to a result of 43 @-@ 7 in the De@@ alers Stadium here in Rio . &quot;
&quot; Fiji shared a master@@ class in handling , Side @-@ Ste@@ pping , desc@@ ending , lin@@ ien@@ cing and ro@@ her force to win gold - their first Olympi@@ am@@ ed@@ aille of any color . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was destroyed by the not too bad tro@@ l@@ ery of the Silber@@ med@@ aille - Great Britain on this day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they smote New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the significant defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in half @-@ fin@@ als on the same day could fall to them in the fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; but independently of them , Fiji , in this form a 15 @-@ man team was be@@ aten in stock . &quot;
&quot; it could be for GB a con@@ sol@@ ation - but will probably not - that at least a Br@@ ite tomorrow a gold med@@ al around his neck , Fi@@ j@@ is Che@@ f@@ trainer Ben Ryan , the former manager for England from Wimbledon . &quot;
UK had a difficult path behind him .
eight years ago they lost under Ryan each game with the Adelaide Se@@ v@@ ens .
here they lost only one .
&quot; this t@@ att@@ ing is going to do , but the progress is aston@@ ishing . &quot;
Fiji began wonder@@ fully and did the attacks GB@@ s from fun cl@@ aws .
&quot; it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. , when the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 to the top , as O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au in the corner . &quot;
&quot; with four minutes of playing , Jerry Tu@@ w@@ ai said another attack on the right corner , which he turned . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB barely hit the ball .
&quot; an excellent T@@ ackle of Mitchell st@@ opp@@ ed the mountain of Mann Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa a third gate , but it has Fiji . &quot;
in the seventh minute j@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua in the right corner one touch down and there was 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the re @-@ ship and there was still a minute game time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pre@@ ached by further weak tr@@ ackl@@ ing the GB teams and stor@@ my to line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
&quot; it is so , as if Fiji was born to play that 7 , while GB still d@@ az@@ ze . &quot;
so it is too .
&quot; GB led basic changes to half @-@ time through and closed the fi@@ ji@@ anic gap ... for all four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova went through a brilliant stop@@ play of Fiji . &quot;
&quot; Dan N@@ ort@@ on started an attempt for GB , made a touch@@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game worked for a long time in favor of the Süd@@ se@@ ein@@ sul@@ ans , whose fans decl@@ ined , flags , and d@@ anced on the tri@@ b@@ une . &quot;
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the i @-@ bag with another attempt in the last seconds .
&quot; the reef , the Fi@@ j@@ is embr@@ ac@@ ute and GB cau@@ ti@@ ous be@@ aten in the lawn . &quot;
&quot; earlier in the day , Fiji Japan had defe@@ ated in semi @-@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain penet@@ rated South Africa in a scar@@ ce @-@ fin@@ al@@ match from the race - UK transformation of difference . &quot;
K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks in the first half to the front but Dan N@@ ort@@ on broke the line with an impressive foot@@ work and achieved an gate among the post in the second half .
&quot; a brilliant late T@@ ackl@@ ing by Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ German team , secured the gain - and thus the silver med@@ al . &quot;
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by battle with cancer of the trainer to rowing
there will be no emotional gold than with these games and that is what you want .
&quot; from the first rud@@ der until the last , 220 hard H@@ ie@@ ve , which enter into history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; even though it were only the two that were in the ruin , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the Train@@ ers Robin Williams , was all present as she was the second Olympi@@ ad in two without tax @-@ being , which laid the first women in the history of British sport that laid such a scale . &quot;
&quot; their domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all their 39.@@ ter uses , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled . &quot;
what we see are two brilliant Athlet@@ es who are concerned about the surface with the elegance of sw@@ elling gli@@ des which is not reflected the type of tri@@ umph@@ s .
&quot; behind each gold in the pack is a batt@@ al@@ ion on willing hel@@ pers that make the difference and it was no one beh@@ il@@ ful than the coach that would not survive the difference if he was not able to survive this day when he was diagnosed as cancer . &quot;
as he said he was ris@@ ky .
&quot; I had bladder cancer , the oper@@ able is and they did . &quot;
&quot; if you do not do that , he spreads everywhere . &quot;
it would have been a fairly bad situation .
it is changing a bit of view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio had luck , that he could be at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , could begin to start the break down to a minimum , if that under such circumstances is the right concept . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , so I had to go back soon again . &quot;
it was an incent@@ ive .
&quot; I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet walk at a time when they said that some steps would be lying . &quot;
so it begins .
&quot; the rowing is already a challenge , but that makes it a bigger one . &quot;
&quot; in the in@@ fertility of the victory , their first thoughts of Williams , who went to a ner@@ ve @-@ final morning to talk a bit more than usual and thus tried to process his own fears . &quot;
&quot; st@@ anning that was as the captain in the Royal Art@@ illery Reg@@ iment in an application in Afghanistan , &quot; &quot; I was this week a emotional wre@@ ck . this might be something extremely , but it means so much . &quot;
&quot; it is repeated only , how much me this means , how much I and Helen and also Robin from there . &quot;
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
&quot; without Robin , we would no one , therefore , is a massive thanks to him . he is the best coach in the world . &quot;
I could not have any better person for coach or a better coach .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have no race lost during the last five years .
&quot; the couple had a hard rhythm , with which their opponents could not keep up with them . &quot;
&quot; even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to join , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver too much in reserve . &quot;
we were very at the moment caught .
&quot; Helen called &quot; &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it really is important to un@@ interrupted themselves .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not out of doing something rab@@ les .
&quot; today we wanted no fire@@ works today , we just wanted a good result to go out and win the race what we did . &quot;
the couple will take a long time before taking decisions on his future .
&quot; glo@@ ver must appear next week at a wedding , their own with the TV @-@ advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall . &quot;
now she wants to enjoy the moment .
I did not want to say that my last race was .
this could have too much pressure .
in London it took about six months to gr@@ asp that I am a Olymp@@ ics .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
&quot; that feels so much better , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
31 years of exempl@@ ary for clarity :
&quot; the managing director of the water @-@ purpose &quot; &quot; vector @-@ group &quot; , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler , continues to retirement . &quot;
the association is regarded as &quot; Bav@@ arian . &quot; &quot;

&quot; his tasks has been very diverse and they extend from water resources and maintenance work across office and organis@@ ing activities , calculation of charges and contributions to emergen@@ cies , &quot; said the Chairman . &quot;
&quot; outstanding events called for the start @-@ up and inaugur@@ ation of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , ground@@ work sales in the field of new well ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , the modern@@ ization of a central computer control ( 2004 ) , the re@@ creation of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the gradu@@ ation of water pipes . &quot;
I have no st@@ agn@@ ation and I have always recorded new additions because water life be@@ de@@ ed and drinking water is the most important food .
&quot; in her Lau@@ dat@@ io , it pra@@ ised G@@ öll@@ ers loyal , reliable and correct service over 31 years . &quot;
&quot; he has used himself with much heart @-@ purpose for its water@@ purpose @-@ purpose , and he has used the water @-@ purpose association , as if it would be his own company . &quot;
a few weeks ago he worked as a real practition@@ er the success concept of the vector @-@ up group for nit@@ rate reduction in front of the water@@ forum of the district of Unter@@ fran@@ ken .
he received a lot of recognition and praise for it .
&quot; Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler s@@ aber pra@@ ised Wasser@@ wart Al@@ f@@ ons Grie@@ bel , who worked with him in 28 years with him . &quot;
he is the best Aqu@@ arius and he was a faithful cre@@ en .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as an highlights from his point of view he called the Brun@@ n@@ Construction and the rest@@ art@@ ing of the branch of the branch .
but the biggest challenge and the hard@@ est use were the up@@ heav@@ al at the peak container at the dr@@ aught at a 3rd of January .
&quot; here , at minus 17 degrees the whole night will work through , so that the loc@@ alities were supplied with water . &quot;
&quot; also the supply of Neu@@ brunn , one can only maintain the rise in P@@ ett@@ stadt with mud . &quot;

steel - L@@ ace made for German steel industry
the exploited and energetic German steel industry remains spar@@ ed by additional cost in mill@@ ennium @-@ height .
&quot; financial bur@@ dens , that threatened the industry from the Eco @-@ funding sector , are from the table . &quot;
&quot; it ab@@ ide in the liberation of renewable energy sources in the German steel industry , said Bundes@@ ver@@ sm@@ ister Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; west@@ German Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Fri@@ day@@ edition ) . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m really happy that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the European Commission had planned to be planned , to use the steel manufacturer , the gases coming from the high @-@ furn@@ ace for consumption for their own consumption , to check@@ out . &quot;
the steel industry can be used to provide additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , I now give a basic certificate with the EU Commission for talks with Compet@@ itive Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; only if the generators will be replaced in steel plants , all an EEG re@@ location of 20 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , this will not be raised in the steel industry . &quot;
the IG Metall welcomed the agreement of Germany with the EU Commission on the stat@@ eh@@ ro@@ mer@@ y .
&quot; thus , the status quo of the previous regulation will be largely written . &quot;
special meaning have the successful effort of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; Steel , future &quot; &quot; is that a first step . &quot;
&quot; further need to follow . &quot;
&quot; also with the reform of the emissions trade unions , IG Metall manager , Jörg Hof@@ mann declared Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from the financial crisis in 2008 under revision capacity and a significant price print .
&quot; last year , the situation is more than the world @-@ largest producer of China in the face of its weak@@ ened domestic demand mass@@ aging steel on the world market . &quot;
European manufacturers throw Chinese steel @-@ concerts prize @-@ du@@ mp@@ ing .
in the course of this early year the situation has something relaxed .
&quot; for a show @-@ reduced one @-@ foot @-@ oil on imp@@ port@@ st@@ ahl , on the other have the economic perspectives in China . &quot;
un@@ clear how a lasting the price range is .
the German Bran@@ chen@@ pri@@ mus Th@@ yss@@ en@@ K@@ rup@@ p remained on Thursday cau@@ ti@@ ous .
recently the prices would have been more st@@ agn@@ ated .
the industry respon@@ ds to the difficult situation with further costs .
Th@@ yss@@ en@@ K@@ rup@@ p also wanted to close closing individual works for the end of several works .
&quot; in the German steel industry , the end of 2015 were around 86@@ ,000 people in the end of 2015 . &quot;
in July the German steel producer in spite of rising prices and increasing orders cau@@ ti@@ ous .
&quot; they produced with 3.4 million tonnes more than six per cent less raw materials than in the previous year of year , such as the economic union of steel on Friday . &quot;
after a short increase in May the crowd continued the second month of a row .
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the production has been reduced by two percent below the previous year . &quot;
the association expects an increasing demand in the coming months thanks to improved clients .
&quot; community , Spirit , health : singing sen@@ iors good
&quot; singing K@@ ip@@ p has been accompanied by Ur@@ sel K@@ ip@@ p already accompanied her whole life : as a young girl she was in the school@@ choir , at the teacher study , she took the F@@ ach music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old in a sen@@ iors choir . &quot;
&quot; singing me - emotional and physically , &quot; describes it . &quot;
&quot; after a sample it feels balanced , cheerful and overall living , says it . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , she does something good for her health and mind doing something good . &quot;
&quot; for singing is equal out of several perspectives a great hobby for sen@@ iors , says Er@@ hard H@@ ackl@@ er from the Deutsche sen@@ or@@ en@@ l@@ iga . &quot;
most sen@@ iors singers in choir and share with equ@@ alities the joy of music , describes H@@ ackl@@ er . &quot;
&quot; through regular inter@@ connection , sen@@ iors can make social contacts and maintain . &quot;
&quot; for often , social and familiar structures at the age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
this experience has also made Ur@@ sel K@@ ip@@ p in her choir : &quot; to address and organize themselves to the other and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of compositions .
&quot; singing may be exhau@@ sting in the positive sense , says H@@ ackl@@ er . &quot;
for there is a deep and controlled breathing .
&quot; who@@ ever calls his lungs regularly , as well as in everyday life not so fast from the pu@@ ste . &quot;
&quot; even if it comes to preserve the sound of the voice in old age , S@@ ingen is an optimal hobby . &quot;
&quot; in older people S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , Ursula L@@ enz says of the federal community of the sen@@ iors organizations . &quot;
&quot; in the older generations the common seed had a much higher importance , it belong@@ ed to everyday life , both in school and in leisure , explains it . &quot;
&quot; it is often observed that the s@@ ingen or hearing of songs in elderly people are arous@@ ed many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth . &quot;
by lyrics and especially melo@@ dies un@@ cap@@ ped people in long been preced@@ ing events .
&quot; singing in addition , the head is also demanded a special performance , explains L@@ enz . &quot;
at the same time concentrate on their own voice and on a pre @-@ given rhythm and to adapt to the other singers - this is a big cognitive challenge .
&quot; mature people who live alone , practice not only on itself . &quot;
&quot; another positive aspect is the recognition that one goes through the singing in the choir , says H@@ ackl@@ er . &quot;
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
also the self @-@ este@@ em grows through the singing in the choir .
&quot; to show yourself : when I spend long for something , I will strengthen better and w@@ axes beyond me - this experience increased . &quot;
&quot; good reasons to start with singing , so there is enough . &quot;
&quot; who wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he means , little talent to have . &quot;
&quot; you do not sing alone - with 50 sing@@ les , who heard that when a sound goes on it ? &quot;
in search of the suitable offer sen@@ iors various possibilities says H@@ ackl@@ er .
sing someone from the familiar circle in a sen@@ iors choir , you can simply join . &quot;
many cities also offer over@@ views over the choirs in the area .
&quot; who wants to sing in a cl@@ esi@@ astic choir , can turn directly to the church or the church of church . &quot;
many sen@@ iors can be found on the Internet .
&quot; if there is no access to the Internet , the family , friends or neighbours will ask for help with the Internet . &quot;
&quot; who desire to sing , should definitely join a choir , bur@@ sting H@@ ackl@@ er . &quot;
singing the soul is good and has something special - this is true for all ages .
cats react sensitive as K@@ ater to fr@@ y of the kitt@@ ens
bi@@ ologists have examined in Hanover which the effect is the ruin of Katz@@ enb@@ ab@@ ys on adult animals .
&quot; to their surprise the male did not let the males not cold , however they stopped in contrast to the females always alike . &quot;
female cats can recognize the pathogen@@ s of Katz@@ enb@@ ab@@ ys at the Mi@@ aws of the cl@@ aws .
&quot; they respond by ten percent faster to Lau@@ te of kitt@@ ens that have found himself in great distress , such as scientists from the veterinary university and the Medical University Hannover ( MH@@ H ) . &quot;
che@@ ater also react to the spec@@ im@@ ens of kitt@@ ens - but always equal .
&quot; clearly , the acoustic differences between the distr@@ ust of less and strongly arous@@ ed young for the males either not perceived or not of meaning , &quot; said the Biolog@@ ico Wie@@ b@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding by the MH@@ H . &quot;
&quot; this is published in the study , which was published on this Friday in the &quot; BM@@ C E@@ volution@@ ary Biology &quot; . &quot; &quot;
in an previous investigation the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the bi@@ b scre@@ aming is different with the ur@@ gency of their assistance .
&quot; in total , nine adult males have been observed and eight cows from the animal welfare of the MH@@ H . &quot;
they have been played for a ruin for three minutes from the throw @-@ box and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
&quot; on the other , they were confronted with scre@@ am of stronger kitt@@ ens , which were also raised up . &quot;
the researchers hold their results despite the low sample of the sample .
&quot; all the females even those who had no own offspring , re@@ ated differenti@@ ated to the horror , &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot;
they revol@@ ving faster to the loud@@ speaker when this rule played by the very arous@@ ed kitt@@ ens .
this ability may possibly be grown or developed with the sexual ri@@ pe .
&quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; said the Biolog@@ ico . &quot;
&quot; in the past , scientists have already studied the reactions of women and men on baby sound . &quot;
&quot; also , some studies showed that women more sensitive to inf@@ ants , just whether they were already m@@ others or not , the Biolog@@ ico Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann . &quot;
Po@@ dol@@ ski takes up with &quot; Gala &quot; by Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
Turkey has been issued against the influ@@ ential football star of Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ r .
he shall be deb@@ ated to be a member of a terror@@ ist group .
&quot; for the first time , the put@@ sch will be held in Turkey again an important football match . &quot;
&quot; in front of the du@@ el of the arch@@ ri@@ val between Bes@@ i@@ kt@@ as Istanbul and Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski &apos;s Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul by the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even when dec@@ ency of the acceptance , after the overthrow of law in July the government , the everyday life of norm@@ ality should not be affected by norm@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; but this does not apply to those who are sus@@ pic@@ ious , the movement of Pre@@ dig@@ ers Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the cou@@ sch@@ ist . &quot;
but also before football is not being made .
against the former Star@@ k@@ icker Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ r the citiz@@ enship ordered a sentence .
&quot; therefore , he is now thrown into the Americas in America to become a member of the terror@@ ist group . &quot;
Sü@@ k@@ r should be responsible for the tra@@ ilers of the Pre@@ dig@@ ers Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len to be held responsible for the put@@ sch Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Er@@ dog@@ an for the put@@ sch .
&quot; although the first for 90 days is valid until October , actually this has on the life of most Turks but as good as no effects . &quot;
the no@@ ct@@ urn@@ al &quot; democracy @-@ gu@@ ards &quot; on public places throughout the country Er@@ dog@@ an ended on Wednesday for finished .
sport is - like all the land - split in supporters and opponents Er@@ dog@@ an .
especially fans of the workers &quot; club meeting is traditionally not one of the friends of the President .
&quot; as the gro@@ s of the Turks , but considering dramatic experiences in history , the strictly rejection of military put@@ ties . &quot;
even the fans even agree - no matter whether you beat the heart for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ i@@ kt@@ as .
&quot; at Pok@@ al@@ sie@@ ger &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; will arrive in Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
its sporting value the Köl@@ ner presented in the exp@@ ired season under proof : with 17 gates ; and nine templates in all competitions ended the 31 @-@ year @-@ old his first game time as Top@@ o@@ aks of his association .
in the end@@ game against Fen@@ er@@ bah@@ ce he sco@@ red 1 : 0 @-@ Sieg@@ tre@@ ffer .
&quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; F@@ AN@@ A@@ TI@@ K &quot; &quot; with@@ ered him : &quot; &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot;
he has completed the season in excellent way and secured his crew to the tro@@ phy .

after the Vor@@ round @-@ K.@@ o in the Champions League take the &quot; l@@ ions &quot; also in the Europa League early .
in the south @-@ light it was just the rank six .
the season was not good .
the Pok@@ al was the only way to win something .
&quot; this is done and that is the most important , &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
for Master Bes@@ i@@ kt@@ as went better the game .
&quot; most of all thanks to Mario G@@ ome@@ z , who laid the base for the 14th season with 26 season . &quot;
this is also the reason that the fans hope for the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old hope .
&quot; in the course of the AC Florence , the G@@ ome@@ z had taken place under the contract and of Bes@@ i@@ kt@@ as only to the put@@ sch , because of the political situation in the country after its EM @-@ holiday . &quot;
&quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he just have to say it , &quot; quoted the magazine &quot; &quot; K@@ icker &quot; &quot; Club@@ chief F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man . &quot;

Bom@@ b@@ enter@@ ror in Thailand - Austrian in bre@@ ach - Sever@@ al T@@ ote
&quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is standing with the woman in contact , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ öl@@ l , Fri@@ day@@ early . &quot;
they have suffered snor@@ ers and be treated in the hospital I have already left again .
at the beginning of September it was planned for the start of September .
&quot; whether from other explos@@ ions on the holiday island of Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ on also Austrian citizen , be just un@@ clear . &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is related to local authorities , such as Schn@@ öl@@ l . &quot;
&quot; at some 200 kilometres south of the capital city of Bangkok Hua H@@ in were initially explo@@ ded on Thursday evening , two bom@@ bs . &quot;
&quot; according to police a Tha@@ il@@ änder@@ in killed and about 20 people have been viol@@ ated , including the Austri@@ ans , three Germans , three Dutch and three Ital@@ ians . &quot;
&quot; Fri@@ day@@ early then again two jum@@ ps went high , so according to the authorities a further man was killed . &quot;
also from Ph@@ u@@ ket was also reported in the morning .
at the det@@ on@@ ation near the popular Ba@@ dest@@ ran@@ ds Pat@@ ong was in@@ ju@@ red after police authorities .
&quot; in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani at the southeast coast of the country explo@@ ded a further bom@@ b , which killed an urban staff . &quot;
the spr@@ int was taken into the air according to the authorities in a flower flower .
&quot; finally , det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g at the south @-@ west coast as well as in Ch@@ um@@ on at the southeast coast several dev@@ ils . &quot;
one go from a connection with the explos@@ ions in Hua H@@ in which it was called .
&quot; the Bom@@ ben@@ attent@@ ate bear the same manus@@ cript , &quot; said armies Dan@@ ai Krit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Fri@@ ag@@ early before journalists . &quot;
we assume that it is a co @-@ ordin@@ ated attack .
&quot; it is too early to express themselves to possible mot@@ ifs - probably , however , the acts of Muslim reb@@ els . &quot;
Thai media wanted to recognize a pattern for the attacks that is typical for the Bom@@ ben@@ attent@@ ate Muslim separ@@ at@@ ists in the south of the country .
the Thai police on the other hand said the attacks do not appear in connection with the Islam@@ ist movement movement or with international terrorism .
&quot; this is only local sab@@ ot@@ age , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a speaker in Bangkok . &quot;
it is about that the bom@@ bs was laid by opponents of the ruling military j@@ unta .
&quot; however , the authorities would have been asked questions concerning upcoming attacks in the south of the country - however they do not have been informed about the exact time and places . &quot;
still be un@@ clear what group behind the attacks .
&quot; the police pointed to its officials throughout the country to strengthen security around major government buildings as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and amus@@ ement area . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand there are always smaller bom@@ b attacks , but they usually do not judge against tourists . &quot;
in Hua H@@ in is a palace that has been used over the years of Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ ib@@ ol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
&quot; according to the nation@@ wide bom@@ b explos@@ ions , the Austrian Foreign Ministry is recomm@@ ends on his homepage , the instructions of Thai security authorities necessarily . &quot;
&quot; high Security risk ( level 3 ) for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ iw@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah Vi@@ hear and surroundings . &quot;
after disputes between security and Muslim population will not be passed on demand in these provinces .
&quot; increased security risk ( level 2 ) , for the rest of the country . &quot;
the attacks on Thursday and Friday paid a few days after a contro@@ ver@@ si@@ al referendum on one of the military j@@ unta .
this spatial to the military influence also in the coming years .
&quot; Jun@@ ta @-@ chef and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Chan @-@ o @-@ cha said , the bom@@ bs were a try to bring chaos while the country toward stability , an improvement in economic situation and tourism . &quot;
&quot; military unta , which had taken power after a phase of blo@@ ody in@@ rest the power , keeping itself good , the kingdom again to stability and order . &quot;
&quot; however , it has not succeeded in the military to get a handle for years in the extreme south of the country in the extreme south of the country . &quot;
in the conflict more than 6@@ 500 people were killed .
&quot; in front of a year , Bangkok was killed in a attack on a popular Hindu @-@ cord 20 people - most of them are foreign tourists . &quot;
it was the blo@@ ody attack of the younger history of the country .
the right &quot; identity movement &quot; is used in the visor of the Federal Ministry of Const@@ it@@ utional protection .
after several intermedi@@ ary also the Const@@ it@@ utional Court have also put under observation the group under observation .
&quot; we see the &apos; Ident@@ ity movement &apos; for aspir@@ ations against the fre@@ el@@ ance @-@ democratic principles , &quot; said Const@@ it@@ utional chief Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate the German Press Agency in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; so , how to diff@@ use Islamic faith or from the Middle East in extrem@@ ist way . &quot;
&quot; therefore , we are monitoring the movement now . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot;
&quot; it turns against &quot; &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ult@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass migration &quot; and &quot; loss of own identity through abundance . &quot;
&quot; constit@@ utional in nine Länder - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , Saxony , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thuringia - observe the &quot; identity &quot; already . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ate said , his authority has worked closely with the govern@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; groups like the &apos; identity &apos; movement &apos; trying to pick up their target group as it stands , &quot; &quot; said the Const@@ it@@ utional chef . &quot;
&quot; generally trying extrem@@ ists , they work with youth@@ ful language , often with p@@ opp@@ able music . &quot;
the dece@@ ased Islam@@ ists as well as the right side @-@ trem@@ ists .
this is not a concrete advertising for the own thing .
the propaganda should be emot@@ ionally emot@@ ionally .
young people are due in a special way .
this is dangerous .
&quot; recently , there had been reports of several federal states reports on contacts of the &quot; identity &quot; of Af@@ D politicians . &quot;
&quot; said , he did not have a findings . &quot;
for the Const@@ it@@ utional protection of this species are only relevant from a certain point .
&quot; it comes to whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain people , the extrem@@ ist are changing and so extrem@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; consequently , whether such persons have to control the party on the party . &quot;
this is not recogn@@ izable .
&quot; with a view to the considerable increase in illegal crimes and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refuge@@ e accommodations said Ma@@ ate , he would not speak about new right terrorism in this context . &quot;
but we have found in recent years that there may be illegal structures in the past few years .
there were the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Fri@@ aler Group .
&quot; it can be quite true that further legitim@@ ate group@@ ings or small groups form the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refuge@@ e she@@ ime or attacks from other right @-@ right@@ istic mot@@ ifs . &quot;
a le@@ w@@ ing@@ span or across Europe @-@ wide control of sp@@ ig@@ or@@ ism is not recogn@@ izable .
the past groups have emerged at the regional level or in social networks .
&quot; concerned about it , that many flo@@ cks went on to the account of people who were previously mentioned in the right scene before . &quot;
this is the concern .
many of the di@@ gest at attacks on asylum seek@@ ers do not have been known as crimin@@ als , politically motivated offen@@ ders or adher@@ ents to the right scene . &quot;
&quot; many people have committed criminal off@@ ences , which were previously in@@ different from the hat that were perhaps politically in@@ different , or for example CD@@ U , SPD or Left , who then have radic@@ ally radic@@ ally or the example of CD@@ U , SPD or Left Opposition . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes an Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
not always determine the Olymp@@ ics or the head@@ lines on the Olympic Games .
this shows the cour@@ ageous show of RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the sum@@ mer@@ time in Rio de Janeiro .
in the Aqu@@ atics Center sw@@ am the slightly overweight swimm@@ ers from Ethiopia so slowly that he could no longer see in the TV @-@ pictures .
he disappeared just - no matter how far the cl@@ ipping was selected .
&quot; in social networks , Hab@@ te was then applied to the vir@@ al inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old with a re@@ vocation of 48 seconds has its run @-@ up , and ran@@ ked the 5@@ 9th place of 59 Star@@ ters . &quot;
but it was rather its not just sporty figure that moved the attention of international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ olds still take part in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ian has got a special start from the international swimming office .
this is distributed to make swimming in more known countries .
&quot; because in Ethiopia the majority of athletes wanted to run , Hab@@ te wanted to do something else . &quot;
preparation is all : RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
&quot; quickly , the first nickname did the lap . &quot;
some media called him as &quot; RO@@ BEL of W@@ al . &quot;

&quot; his time , he just hit with a minute and nearly five seconds over the 100 meters of Fre@@ est@@ yle , there played no role . &quot;
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
at the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney the run by Eric Mou@@ ss@@ amb@@ ani for medi@@ al attention .
&quot; unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ atorial Guinea , as he had to join in a pre@@ run over 100 meters free of charge . &quot;
fr@@ en@@ etic was re@@ generated Mou@@ ss@@ amb@@ ani back then .
at that time 22 @-@ year @-@ old he met eight months before Olympia swimming and had never completed a long distance before the competition .

accidents - Bus sli@@ ps in Kru@@ mm@@ h@@ n in Gr@@ aben : eight Ver@@ ily
in an accident of a travel agency with 43 sen@@ iors as an elevator guests are viol@@ ated on Thursday in Kru@@ mm@@ h@@ n ( district Aur@@ ich ) eight people .

&quot; the 66 years old drive from the bus of a travel company from Eisen@@ nach , had to provide their data according to an opposite side , the partly on the counter @-@ car . &quot;
the bus came to the right from the road and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch as a spokes@@ person of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; due to the location of the bus , the persons could not leave the bus not self @-@ employed , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;

six lif@@ ebo@@ ats and a not@@ aries came to the accident site on the provin@@ cial road 2 .
the un@@ last trav@@ eller were brought back by a line @-@ bus to the Kru@@ mm@@ h@@ ner district of Pe@@ w@@ sum .
there they should wait for a replacement bus to travel .
investig@@ ators urge the trucks and possible witnesses to sign up in the police .
&quot; fees per cub@@ ic meters are from 1 October 2016 for the area of the se@@ wage plant Ne@@ ud@@ orf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ahl 3,@@ 44 instead of far so far euro ; for Z@@ ult@@ enberg / Lind@@ enberg / Lop@@ p 3,@@ 36 Euro ( previously 75 Euro ) and for Az@@ t@@ 3.2 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 18 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the se@@ wage fee will then increase once again , if appropriate enhancement measures will be necessary . &quot;
after an over@@ sle@@ epy lim@@ ulation the Ab@@ ide @-@ Prize in Az@@ endorf is then located at 4.@@ 37 euros per cub@@ ic meters .
&quot; like Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( C@@ SU ) , was found in the approval of the budget by the Land@@ rat@@ ory Kul@@ mb@@ ach , that applies to these wast@@ e@@ water facilities . &quot;
Kas@@ endorf market is obliged to be legally obliged to operate as a basis of legal basis to operate the facilities .
&quot; from 1 October 2016 the citizens , as well as the workshops and industrial gear from Wel@@ d@@ ahl , Ne@@ ud@@ orf , Re@@ uth , A@@ uth , Lu@@ p , Lind@@ enberg , Lind@@ enberg , Lind@@ enberg , Lind@@ enberg , Lind@@ enberg , Lind@@ enberg , Lind@@ enberg , and Z@@ ult@@ enberg deeper into the money bag . &quot;
the dent@@ ition increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; as the board of Herbert Schmidt at the Board of Directors , was necessary for re@@ mod@@ ulation of the fees for the wast@@ e@@ water supply of the market communities . &quot;
in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 also over@@ - or sub@@ cover@@ ings from the previous calendar period .
&quot; the engra@@ ved prayer increases , Schmidt in order with all three ab@@ ide facilities to negoti@@ ate relatively small facilities with a very small se@@ wage @-@ stroke , between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cub@@ ic meters per year . &quot;
&quot; thus , due to the low distribution basis for example , for the necessary repairs of several thousand Euro engra@@ v@@ ating . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the water @-@ water is slightly decl@@ ining in all three plants . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , we were not least noticed in a considerable extent to all three systems due to their age and repar@@ ations in a considerable extent . &quot;
&quot; the plant in Az@@ endorf was nearly 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ d@@ ahl , Ne@@ ud@@ orf and Re@@ uth and Z@@ ult@@ enberg , Lind@@ enberg and Lop@@ p almost 20 years . &quot;
Schmidt En@@ cour@@ ageous that in the water @-@ water az@@ ure was to be replaced with the mechanical aer@@ ation system due to a damage .
&quot; in the p@@ ump@@ work world , the nearly 20 years old convey@@ ors had to be out@@ lined up for nearly 20 years of operation of the first sk@@ ip@@ ped up to almost 20 years in order to stop the water legal requirements even in the future . &quot;
Schmidt : &quot; at these extraordinary expenses came to take into account the advanced care and maintenance costs , which are considered to be considered in the new calcul@@ ating time . &quot;
&quot; the same applies to electricity costs , which in the previous calculation of 2011 / 2012 still significantly under the current level . &quot;
&quot; stone houses , made clear that at the low level of waste in the three plants the expenses for the operation and maintenance . &quot;
&quot; in this case , we have spar@@ ed Schmidt , the market communities of large entertainment costs in the last 20 years . &quot;
&quot; the situation for the mentioned systems will continue to stay pre@@ dic@@ ally , since the supply area of the se@@ wage @-@ purpose association Fries@@ enb@@ acht@@ al should not extend this plant because it is a def@@ ic@@ it@@ arian facilities . &quot;
Bulgaria be@@ asts for the first time in 8 months of inflation
National statistics show that inflation was in Bulgaria in July 1 % on a monthly basis .
&quot; this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year , as a positive 0.2 % . &quot;
the annual A@@ verage of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured after the CP@@ I -@@ 0.@@ 8 % .
&quot; the consumer budget in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1,0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 % . &quot;
the inclusion rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 was compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % .
&quot; in July 2016 , compared to the pre @-@ month of the following groups of consumer goods observed : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; transport ( 1.8 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 0,@@ 3 % ) ; &quot;
&quot; the prices fell on clothes and foot@@ wear ( 2.2 % ) ; Mobil@@ i@@ ar , appliances and routines ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0,1 % ) . &quot;

Snap@@ chat &quot; An@@ ime &quot; effect critic@@ ised as Asian caric@@ ature
&quot; Snap@@ chat says that this filter is An@@ ime @-@ inspired , but some ob@@ servers say that it is uns@@ ensi@@ vely compared to bre@@ eds . &quot;
&quot; with its filter tool it enables Snap@@ chat about 150 million daily users , to change reality and play with ident@@ ities such a way that already borders the Ab@@ sur@@ de . &quot;
&quot; you can turn into a pine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be made of a Roy Licht@@ enstein paintings . &quot;
&quot; the filters are ou@@ fl@@ amed , peculi@@ arity tools that generate more than 30 million improved sel@@ f@@ ies per day . &quot;
all mal@@ missions are to the public .
Snap@@ chat filters have drawn into the past criticism in which they were acc@@ used to propag@@ ate the App Black@@ face convey@@ or or white skin as a beauty deal .
&quot; as it suggested that week , a filter made a filter made of them Schl@@ itz@@ au@@ gen , false teeth and infl@@ ated che@@ eks , a rac@@ ist caric@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; Yellow s@@ ighted . &quot;
they asked whether these repeated contro@@ ver@@ sies on a larger problem that the company has with diversity .
&quot; the news and rebellion were widely spread on Wednesday , with reports of The Ver@@ ge and Mother@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat , that it would have disabled . &quot;
the company offered an exc@@ use : the filter was intended as hom@@ age to an@@ ime characters and not as a caric@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
&quot; however , out@@ si@@ ders , the rac@@ is@@ sm@@ us have experienced , rem@@ inded of the filters to hurt cl@@ ich@@ és . &quot;
other le@@ pro@@ s have decided the an@@ ime @-@ comparison .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail wrote Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student , whose twe@@ et was widely used on the photos that the filters are &quot; vulner@@ able and reason@@ ably unpleasant . &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to ar@@ gue with the counter@@ part of a very di@@ spro@@ ved Asian caric@@ ature and the filter effects .
&quot; it shows that the filters are not rot@@ ated , but that the money has been drawn into the final extre@@ m . &quot;
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crossed this cultural out@@ flow .
&quot; the American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration process , of conference rooms up to Hollywood and the devices that we all keep in hand . &quot;
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats great audience young people - who in matters were di@@ vers@@ er than their older counter@@ players - could be more likely to expect to expect sensitivity .
&quot; if one of snap@@ shots is an image generated , so it is much more difficult that such things remain un@@ noticed than it was earlier the case , &quot; &quot; said the 25 @-@ year old Kat@@ ie Zh@@ u in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday there was Zh@@ u , who works as a product management and Ingenie@@ ur@@ in for Medium , to delete their Snap@@ chat account for others to do the same . &quot;
in an essay by medium and in a telephone interview they said that rac@@ ial contro@@ ver@@ sies reflect a lack of diversity at Snap@@ chat .
&quot; Zh@@ u critic@@ ized the great part of white , only male leaders and ended up their attachment with a h@@ as@@ ht@@ ag : # Del@@ ete@@ Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; either have they no diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their work@@ force , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Zh@@ u , &quot; &quot; or they have people with other skin colours , who are working there , but not in positions where they are safe or feeling to say about it . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinion , a complaint that the Snap@@ chat is largely un@@ answered . &quot;
the company has not published a numbers regarding the diversity of its work@@ force and points to its status as a private company .
&quot; on Thursday , there are Snap@@ chat about to discuss the cultural background of his employees , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company has recently set a personnel responsible who focused on under@@ mines population groups and in internal integration . &quot;
&quot; Zh@@ u said , in turn , that she will be closed to her Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that that is not o.@@ c . &quot;
military @-@ leadership of ISIS &apos; intelligence information is established on the Congress of Congress
&quot; milit@@ ants belonging to the United States Central Command changing news , in order to draw an optim@@ ist picture of the war against the so called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria as it has allowed the actual conditions on site , mel@@ ted a temporary Committee of the Congress in a report on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the provis@@ ional report , created by a Task Force the re@@ publ@@ ican members of the armed forces , secre@@ cy and the Wehr@@ bud@@ get@@ fulness , reported by great diss@@ atis@@ faction under Central Command Intelligence an@@ alysts , reported how prefab@@ ric@@ ated their sub@@ missions to the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; the Central Command , short C@@ enc@@ om , is the military headquarters in Tampa , Florida , which controls the American Mil@@ iti@@ as in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; post@@ al service provided by high @-@ ranking Cent@@ Com Kom@@ man@@ de@@ uren , signed a positive image of the American efforts against terrorism as it has allowed the actual conditions on site and were consistently positive than analyses of other surname services , &quot; quoted a newspaper article . &quot;
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers are suffering when bad analyses of our political leaders are presented , &quot; Ken Cal@@ ver@@ t , re@@ publ@@ ican member of the Represent@@ ative . &quot;
the leaders in the Cent@@ Com range up to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ sided report presents detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the formation of the Ira@@ qi armed forces .
&quot; although there is no direct reference to that governmental tips given under Obama statements to change reports , shows how an@@ alysts are exposed to pressure from their accus@@ ation , an optim@@ ist@@ ically picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as ISIS or IS@@ IL . &quot;
&quot; during the first half year 2015 many Central Command Press Rele@@ ases , statements and statements from the congress clearly positive as it corresponds to the facts . &quot;
&quot; for example , a Cent@@ Com chron@@ ous had publicly known that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s have already been started in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ sul , the second largest city of Iraq , continues to be under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months from Er@@ mitt@@ ing , is so much clear . &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , re@@ publ@@ ican Congress of K@@ ansas , in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; from the middle of the year 2014 until the middle of the year 2015 , the points of central command changed the news reports to the danger of ISIS in Iraq . &quot;
Re@@ public@@ ans rie@@ ve the Task Force in life after them was played that an@@ alysts are concerned with regard to the man@@ ipulation of reports on the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday report will be completed by detailed knowledge while the in@@ quiries are continued .
&quot; in addition , further investig@@ ators of Cent@@ Com reports are given by the General Assembly of the Ministry of Defence in G@@ ange . &quot;
&quot; democratic members of the news , published by its own findings on Thursday its own findings , which coinc@@ ided with some of the conclusions of the re@@ publ@@ ican Task Force . &quot;
&quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 the Cent@@ Com approved the Cent@@ Com at IS@@ IL and the Ira@@ qi security services , &quot; the highest Dem@@ oc@@ rat took place in the com@@ mander , member of the Represent@@ ative House Adam B. ship , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; this process , so Mr. ship , &quot; delay the publication of news reports , &quot; p@@ ests the mor@@ ality under an@@ alysts and &apos; have a little space for devi@@ ating opinions . &quot;
&quot; but Mr. ship and the Democrats gave no references to an intervention of the White House with the Cent@@ Com an@@ alysts regarding a &quot; &quot; certain political opinion &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the provis@@ ional results of the Congress of the Congress were published on Tuesday through &quot; The Daily Beast &quot; .
&quot; last August the New York Times reported the Pent@@ agon of the Pent@@ agon , which were recorded after complaints from Cent@@ Com an@@ alysts . &quot;
&quot; Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a spokes@@ person of the Pent@@ agon , given in an opinion that the Defence Policy would have no reports of con@@ gresses , while the in@@ quiries of the general manager would be still in progress . &quot;
&quot; but he also gave it that &quot; experts sometimes quite di@@ verg@@ ent opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data , and that the mer@@ its services and the Defense Secretary of this important topics of national defense . &quot;
the investig@@ ators have passed on the question of successful avi@@ ation campaign led by American guidance in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that now being made by an increasing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) .
&quot; however , the alleg@@ ations of the past year have raised the question to what President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest cap@@ tion of the military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; the criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State will remember any more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory H@@ ook@@ er , a writer about the recommendations of many an@@ alysts just a small occup@@ ying stru@@ ger in Iraq and take a little time on the consequences of the invasion of 2003 thoughts . &quot;
Mr. H@@ ook@@ er also played a key role in insur@@ rection against the current reporting on the Islamic State .
&quot; last year , the team led by Mr. H@@ ook@@ er according to providing government proposals that have no significant impact on the financial situation of the ter@@ rac@@ ers because these provis@@ ional refin@@ eries had no significant impact on the financial situation of the ter@@ rac@@ ers because these provis@@ ional refin@@ eries have had taken place in order to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; however , this recognition was not released , the Times reported in September . &quot;
&quot; Cent@@ com@@ s then , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the leg@@ islat@@ ure because of its excessive positive assessment of the war position at a hearing before the Senate . &quot;
general Austin went to retirement in April and was replaced by the Central Command through Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the US win fourth match in the field @-@ h@@ ockey of women who is a show@@ down with great Britain before
&quot; one day after they had shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 t@@ gs over Japan , Kat@@ ie B@@ am also made the first two gates for American Feld@@ h@@ ockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India , that the Americ@@ an@@ resses with 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five gates in two games should actually represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said , they could not remember that ever did . &quot;
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; said she . &quot;
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their gates in memory .
&quot; however , the white she knows : the Americas are at 4 @-@ 0 in the ol@@ ymp@@ ic competition , and are equal in their group with the Brit@@ ons on the first place that will remain un@@ struck after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan . &quot;
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday last game of the first round .
&quot; both teams have already been qualified for the quarter @-@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which the two will gain the first and second place within their group . &quot;
the first @-@ placed will walk a bit longer out of the path that the other group will lead .
&quot; as always the play may go out on Saturday the Americas have been trig@@ ger@@ ed by their success story , four years after she went over the last London games on the last of 12 places . &quot;
BA@@ M was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years of a Hoc@@ key@@ schlä@@ ger in hands ( their two older sisters also played the sport at Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years , she became the National Park of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team . &quot;
they missed the Olympi@@ ad in 2008 since they could not qualify for the cad@@ res .
&quot; then came the year 2012 , in which for her and her team went all wrong . &quot;
&quot; in the next year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , a Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the National Team and thus began to turn things for better . &quot;
&quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am . &quot;
we did not have the work of work in London that we now have .
we have the her@@ ds fully ro@@ uting .
&quot; on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the Torre@@ ady in the first half of the game with a set@@ back from the Middle area . &quot;
India was gone without victory in the tournament into the game but the team showed itself surprisingly tough and held the player from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am the game took into their hands .
&quot; she finished one Sprint with the flat ball over the left fl@@ ank , then moved into the middle and lu@@ pf@@ te the ball into the gate to get the American guidance a 2 @-@ 0 lead . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ zal@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of all the tournament for the door@@ keepers of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , which previously made an door in each of the previous games . &quot;
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position &quot; &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the result of the next game on Saturday . &quot;
amongst the R@@ age of the Olympic Games to the Zen of the trampoline
&quot; wherever you are , how late it is , it is the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; the events in Rio de Janeiro will feel resistant and in@@ escap@@ able , a rapid res@@ iding place between competition and br@@ aces . &quot;
&quot; it is , as if the ol@@ ymp@@ ic tor@@ ch itself is a burning bul@@ let , which will protect from the br@@ acelets for swimm@@ ers to the tri@@ athl@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; you cannot listen to the television or listen to a newspaper or listen to the talk of your neighbours in the morning , without having Simone Bil@@ es , Kat@@ ie Le@@ ading y or the battle between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there is a log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time in the Olympic Games and a women black with dimples , could certainly be sent under this known name that would be sent to Prime Time through sponsors and feel @-@ TV advertising , if he would be a sw@@ immer , tur@@ ner or even fe@@ eder . &quot;
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fought in the ol@@ ymp@@ ic trampoline of gold . &quot;
the ol@@ ymp@@ ic flame does not illumin@@ ates every event equal .
&quot; further from the center , partly in the shadow are the sports , which are not generally recognized : air@@ brush shoot , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the breast swimming and let it reign for a long time .
&quot; but if I would like to make the arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , then let me bring the attention to the discre@@ te charm of the trampoline . &quot;
&quot; although the trampoline have already been a ol@@ ymp@@ ic event since 2000 , when it had been in Sydney , the last 16 years , it was so helpful that many whom I had asked , did not know that it is at all a Olymp@@ ics . &quot;
this could also be regional ignor@@ ance .
&quot; although the US athletes sent to competition , it has never won a med@@ al in the trampoline and had never had a athl@@ ete who made it up to the end . &quot;
the Chinese and Russian people tend to share the prices for men and the Chinese and the Can@@ adi@@ ans who share the women .
Dong Dong from China and Ros@@ ie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend its gold med@@ al from London this year .
the trampoline has a certain outdoor swimming pool , partly because it sounds an enlight@@ ened ear for a cl@@ own@@ ing school than that sounds like for the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; at this point I should ad@@ mit that I am not an expert , but only an inher@@ ent enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; it has hum@@ orous potential - the cart@@ oon@@ ing trem@@ bling of his never too end clou@@ d@@ iness - but also the grace of the tournament , and diving , the two sports , which is essentially united . &quot;
the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline which means as much as &quot; spr@@ ing@@ board . &quot;
&quot; rising winner jump on a gig@@ antic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and have to end a number of falling movements ( rotating , p@@ ushing and s@@ alt@@ os ) before they land on the feet . &quot;
&quot; according to official Olympi@@ ap@@ ro@@ ram , according to execution , difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; two @-@ eight athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women are going to compete in Rio . &quot;
the common ol@@ ymp@@ ic vector is straight out .
&quot; we must continue in their quest for gold , faster , to top and above , sometimes up to the target , sometimes down and back , to the top and down on the playground . &quot;
they are not only the Zi@@ ell@@ in@@ ie or the output of the output but also in the television transfer : that of the world or the Olymp@@ ics .
&quot; purpos@@ eful pursuit is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ at@@ ical - and it is enough to even stir@@ ring a spect@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; but it is also what I feel at the spect@@ ing of these games as a little we@@ ight@@ less . &quot;
this is the trampoline a re@@ pri@@ eve .
the vector of the trampoline is above .
a for@@ wards movement is not the goal .
&quot; he or she pr@@ it off , seem@@ ingly serious as an ast@@ ron@@ aut , goes to the top , then down to the bottom , then effort@@ lessly back up . &quot;
&quot; there is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during exercise there is no hect@@ ic attack on the target , no wol@@ ves in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity . &quot;
it is as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games only can be .
&quot; qualifying and du@@ ck of women will be held on Friday morning , during streaming by 13.00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13.00 . &quot;
N@@ BC will show the du@@ ck as part of a afternoon @-@ blocks on both days from 14.00 .
&quot; in the midst of Olympia Man@@ ie they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is likely to over@@ looked in general tum@@ ult . &quot;
if the level of consciousness can only be achieved through the ang@@ ids and the objective of male athletes - as it is the male US Tur@@ ner according to The Wall Street Journal recently forward to Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expected his way to air ring@@ ing , new fan@@ atic . &quot;

violent protests in Ethiopia
prot@@ esters the political changes in Ethiopia they call on violent resistance of the government .
witnesses say that tens of prot@@ esters were killed during cl@@ ashes with the police were killed .
is Ethiopia straight to break down ?
&quot; in the last ten years it was one of the most sturdy countries of Africa , a solid allies of the West with a fast growing economy . &quot;
but in recent months protests against the government the country and spread itself more and more areas .
last week stor@@ my thousands of people on the streets and slow@@ ed fundamental political changes .
the answer of the government was mer@@ cif@@ ul according to human rights organisations .
witnesses gave to that polic@@ emen were shot on zig in@@ armed prot@@ esters and killed .
&quot; in re@@ sume videos about the protests , probably from the last or beginning of this year , they show young people with sticks while these were forced to make a hand@@ stand against a wall . &quot;
the head of the UN @-@ authority for human rights now demands an in@@ coming investigation .
&quot; it has always been difficult to hold this country and will even become more difficult , &quot; said R@@ ash@@ id Ab@@ di , the project manager of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ated country of Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West .
&quot; American military and secret services are closely related to Ethiopia , to fight terror@@ ist over the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , get so much Western help . &quot;
Ethiopia economy expanded in considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new p@@ endant in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
&quot; roads are usually quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; even if Ethiopia was anything but a role model for democracy - human rights organisations , the op@@ pression led by the government - the opposition in the country was limited , whereby di@@ chair was effective to silence . &quot;
&quot; many were sent to exile or to the prison , killed or driven into the expan@@ se of the desert . &quot;
but that could change .
&quot; if you under@@ press people and do not have any other options except to prot@@ est@@ ing it breaks it out , &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lect@@ urer in Central @-@ Ethiop@@ ien . &quot;
the entire youth prot@@ est@@ ates .
a generation prot@@ est@@ ates .
there are numerous complaints that everything from the ground util@@ ization up to the wor@@ r@@ ity with respect to the power of the ruling coalition .
&quot; after a further critical election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of Parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the tensions rise along the border with Er@@ it@@ rea ; a struggle for this jag@@ ged , contro@@ ver@@ si@@ al line demanded in June hundreds of life . &quot;
&quot; analy@@ st advoc@@ ates that separ@@ at@@ ists like the Oro@@ mo Liber@@ ation front or the National Liber@@ ation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , which were more or less conf@@ isc@@ ated in recent years , the tur@@ mo@@ il sequences . &quot;
several factors explain why feelings of the bit@@ tern@@ ess after years of age before himself is hidden under the surface now explo@@ ding .
the first appears harmless : smartphones .
&quot; only in recent years , many Ethiopia were able to communicate via social media , since bill@@ ig@@ ible smartphones have become more and more common and the internet services were improved . &quot;
&quot; even if the government keeps access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do at regular inter@@ vals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate via Internet @-@ Pro@@ x@@ ies , who conce@@ al them . &quot;
several young Ethiop@@ ian gave them that they gathered themselves to proteins .
&quot; the second factor is that there are more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ n@@ ies in Ethiopia . &quot;
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not a natural enemies .
&quot; for e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from ether mainly Christian highlands , in politics and economy , while they exploited the Oro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are living and living in flat landscape . &quot;
but even this is changing .
&quot; we are there to co @-@ ordin@@ ate under a screen , said Mul@@ atus Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot;
the biggest protests took place in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
&quot; many am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , which are about 6 percent of the population and that is dominant in the military , in the secret services , trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for the rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; Mr. Mel@@ es , a former vine leader , was up to his death in a non @-@ condition of the disease in 2012 17 years in Ethiopia . &quot;
&quot; he was regarded as tact@@ ical gen@@ ius , a man who could think about corners . &quot;
an@@ alysts say that he was particularly vers@@ ed to un@@ ify the signs of diss@@ atis@@ faction and ass@@ ign@@ ation to make opponents and make them un@@ harmful .
&quot; the current regime is lacking in this fundamental event , &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; Ethiopia , new Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen to take the position of Mr Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of Nord@@ ä@@ th@@ iop@@ iens , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south . &quot;
analy@@ st say that he does not enjoy the trust of the Tig@@ ray controlled security services .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; the last time that Ethiopia was able to have such a rebellion , 2005 , after thousands of elections were prot@@ ested , according to the fact of analy@@ st apparently by the government and subsequently st@@ olen . &quot;
&quot; during the following ra@@ ins , many prot@@ esters were killed , even if there were less than in the last months and that time of the un@@ rest went relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; evolutionary Ethiopia , leader for their vision@@ ary infrastructure plans , such as the new pen@@ dl@@ ers , as well as for their meas@@ urable advances in the poverty ab@@ at@@ ement . &quot;
but obviously this does not prevent the intensi@@ f@@ ication of the internal Miss@@ ionary Government of the Ethiop@@ ical government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
&quot; in the last month , prot@@ esters in G@@ ond@@ ar , an am@@ har@@ ian city , of Tig@@ ray @-@ managed businesses and the hate toward the Tig@@ ray is becoming increasingly active in social media . &quot;
analy@@ st say that protests are the US and other western allies in a peculi@@ ar position .
&quot; the American government used Ethiopia as a basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights over the neighboring Somalia , even though she recently told that she has closed this base . &quot;
&quot; during the West clearly wants to support democracy , he will not want his allies in an already vol@@ at@@ ile area . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; is a very thin @-@ con@@ walk . &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp explains his argument Obama has been founded in ISIS &apos; Sar@@ cas@@ m .
&quot; Donald J. Tru@@ mp was trying to dis@@ integrate his campaign by sending his campaign that his multiple repet@@ itive asser@@ tion , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the ter@@ rac@@ er Islamic State , not seriously meant . &quot;
this clar@@ ification cast new questions about the communication skills of the pres@@ idential data of the Re@@ public@@ ans whether he is able to communicate clearly and understand@@ able with the American public .
&quot; it also brings his fellow leaders , who ende@@ av@@ our to take him during an event@@ ful stage to protect him into the peculi@@ ar position to explain that it could not be commun@@ icated . &quot;
&quot; after having made the cle@@ aring in a vot@@ ing meeting on the Sunday evening , Mr. Tru@@ mp was back to the asser@@ tion on Thursday and cons@@ isted in interviews that he really did not intend to interpre@@ t the President and Mrs. Clinton ISIS . &quot;
&quot; but in an early morning twe@@ et on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp , he is simply s@@ ark@@ astic . &quot;
&quot; the twe@@ et was opposed to the previous day , where Mr. Tru@@ mp was told in a number of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation perfectly seriously . &quot;
&quot; as the conservative Radi@@ om@@ oder@@ ator Hug@@ h H@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tru@@ mp wanted to help him to destroy him that Mr. Obama will destroy him , wanted to know the re@@ publ@@ ican Presidency . &quot;
&quot; the last storm of criticism pr@@ as@@ sel@@ t on Mr. Tru@@ mp , while he attempts to direct the focus of his campaign on economic situation . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp and Mrs. Clinton stopped spe@@ e@@ ches on economic situation in Michigan at this week .
on Friday Mr. Tru@@ mp was again to return to this subject .
&quot; using Twitter , he war@@ ned that Mrs. Clin@@ tons proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp has brought to his defense already to its defence .
&quot; at the end of July he passed strong criticism , when he said the Russi@@ ans should Mrs. Clin@@ tons em@@ ails , but he said later &quot; &quot; Of course I said the s@@ ark@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tru@@ mp to move the lingu@@ istic borders in politics and then back as needed .
&quot; I think it is one of its methods to test , like certain messages from his fans , as they arrive , and then if necessary , &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sherman , a communication @-@ sex@@ ist , which observed the language of both candidates . &quot;
&quot; but I also think he is clever enough to keep his statements enough , so that they can be interpreted in different ways . &quot;
&quot; instead of the sound for the pres@@ idential elections , Mr. Tru@@ mp has adopted an even more important sound since its survey@@ ing values . &quot;
&quot; a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist who was published on Friday , showed a guided tour with great lead in the federal states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ on head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; during Mr. Tru@@ mp , generally tried to ap@@ olog@@ ize his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often sinn@@ ed his critics , or understand his statements or hum@@ our . &quot;
&quot; but while he is reinforced in the focus of attention in the last months of his pres@@ idential campaign , Mr. Tru@@ m@@ ps Scher@@ ze have brought his loyal influence into the un@@ comfortable situation , regardless of them , as pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may also be . &quot;
Rudol@@ ph W. Giul@@ iani , former Mayor of New York and one of Tru@@ m@@ ps prominent inter@@ cess@@ ors , gave great effort to defend the candidates today in a CN@@ N interview from Thursday . &quot;
&quot; I believe what he says are legitim@@ ate , political comments &quot; said Mr. Giul@@ iani , so he was asking to the accuracy of Mr. Tru@@ m@@ ps , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is true in that sense true that Obama was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them back , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he moved the troops from Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most of the ma@@ instre@@ am @-@ Re@@ public@@ ans try to ar@@ gues that the government served under Obama , in Mrs. Clinton as an external minist@@ ered to spread the situation in the Middle East aggressi@@ vely under control . &quot;
&quot; before the elect@@ oral leaders in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp continued his attacks on the media and cast them before , on each of his words . &quot;
&quot; he burned the &quot; poor , j@@ or@@ able &quot; television experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; You can &apos;t ! . &quot;
some of the Democrats sp@@ otting about Mr. Tru@@ m@@ ps exc@@ use as only another proof that he was un@@ suitable for the pres@@ idential office .
&quot; once more about the price of the market , Café is back in Green@@ point &quot;
&quot; verb Cafe was a sh@@ atter@@ y café in William@@ sburg , where one could only pay cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi , but 15 years of good coffee serv@@ iced . &quot;
&quot; naturally , thanks to the prices of his Bedford Avenue Laden@@ front . &quot;
&quot; the business So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , the verb in summer 2014 replaced , sold soap in the form of Cup@@ cakes . &quot;
indigenous under@@ lined it as the last loss in a gent@@ rif@@ ying city .
&quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is change , but I still cannot believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel and Ver@@ b is now a soap . &quot;
&quot; but if New York change is , it is also new . &quot;
a revi@@ ved Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similar atmosphere . &quot;
the coffee is still good .
&quot; the new owner of Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodr@@ igu@@ ez , a long @-@ term staff of the old cafés , the owner and managing director of the new cafés . &quot;
he began to work in 2001 by Ver@@ b and stayed there until the end .
&quot; when he offered a customer to make money for a new out@@ set , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodr@@ igu@@ ez , 36 , can be found many . &quot;
&quot; connected , the same distributor for the Bag@@ els bought the same es@@ presso model . &quot;
it even uses the same lamps from the old Ver@@ b .
but Rodr@@ igu@@ ez said that he also wanted to experiment .
he led new ingredients .
on the menu you are sand@@ wiches with b@@ acon and cheese and there are pra@@ is@@ ations like cap@@ ers and s@@ aut@@ ed onions .
there is natural bowls .
&quot; the café serves no beer more , there are fresh ju@@ ices . &quot;
after nine months Rodr@@ igu@@ ez said that he has noticed a stream stream of old tri@@ but@@ aries .
&quot; many old customers were also p@@ ushing by prizes from William@@ sburg , &quot; he said . &quot;
recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ ve@@ ira was such a customer .
&quot; Oli@@ ve@@ ira , 34 , lived before in William@@ sburg and visited the verb regularly . &quot;
&quot; even after she moved to Green@@ point , she would take the way forward . &quot;
&quot; after the verb had closed , she gave a while the coffee table , she said . &quot;
&quot; I became clear that it was on the coffee and the culture of the verb that I liked , &quot; &quot; said them . &quot;
&quot; now they drink coffee , even if they ordered on that day instead of their usual I@@ ced coff@@ ees have a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea , who is another new addition . &quot;
Tom Ros@@ enthal since the beginning of the verb in 2003 another long @-@ term and faithful customer .
he went there before the work and turned infinite always the same .
&quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss sun@@ dial and prepare my Every@@ thing @-@ Bag@@ el with butter , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
Foto Rodr@@ igu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and record new ingredients in the menu .
&quot; nowadays Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes its Every@@ thing @-@ bag@@ el with b@@ acon , egg and cheese . &quot;
Rodr@@ igu@@ ez said that he did not have a groove about it that the soap @-@ store has taken the old business room .
&quot; in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , to produce a special soap for Ver@@ b with the cold coffee of the café as ingredient . &quot;
&quot; I think we will go into their offer , &quot; said Rodr@@ igu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; and the traditional , Polish inhabitants Green@@ points have also accepted the café . &quot;
a new customer has translated the menu to the Polish and Rodr@@ igu@@ ez said that he has pre @-@ fold it soon so that his new neighbours are welcome .
the site also has other benefits .
a local Saf@@ t@@ locally wants to fill the cold coffee in bottles and sell them .
there is a chance that the café is expanded to a not@@ ified building .
for many customers a new ver@@ b is sufficient to get their old favorites .
Joseph W@@ itt was stem cell and said that he was destroyed at the ground as the café closed .
&quot; when the new cafe opened , Wh@@ itt said that the super@@ visor of the Lok@@ als and the Order has felt a new coffee like a home@@ coming . &quot;
&quot; I had to rie@@ k , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the de@@ pressed food of the economic crisis in &quot; an abundant meal &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his climb to the President , Franklin Del@@ ano Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt took lunch at the O@@ val Office . &quot;
as fine gour@@ mets had President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt a Fa@@ ible for refined Del@@ ic@@ at@@ essen on Fifth Avenue such as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland water @-@ tort@@ ie @-@ soup .
&quot; his menu on this day was something modest : filled eggs in T@@ omat@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , pot@@ ato p@@ ü@@ ree and as dessert a pl@@ ums . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; said Jane Br@@ gel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ E added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans , as they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both grocery stores .
&quot; Co@@ es last book &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; acted by the Chinese cuisine in the USA , while Zie@@ gel@@ man told in her book &quot; 97 Orchard &quot; about life in a residential building at the Lower East Side of the food perspective . &quot;
&quot; your latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustr@@ ates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a re@@ porter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s sand@@ wich shop for dinner , a small , schn@@ ör@@ k@@ ell@@ os@@ em Im@@ bis@@ s in Flat@@ iron district , which has already been in the store since the stock crash in 1929 . &quot;
&quot; br@@ ick@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh che@@ eses with olive oil , while Co@@ E , 57 , Tru@@ th@@ ahn with pot@@ ato bread and vegetables . &quot;
&quot; as the re@@ porter , this found the couple for discussion about the food at the era of the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; rich food were very popular , &quot; said Zie@@ gel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; pe@@ uss@@ iness , liver , and B@@ ohn@@ enb@@ rot . &quot;
they were made up of a ingredient and some bil@@ li@@ que cooked that the ingredient .
imagine so many pe@@ an@@ uts to eat that they serve them as dinner .
enco@@ ding .
&quot; it has to be placed in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; said he . &quot;
&quot; in the years before the Great Depression was the table in a American household , especially in rural areas , a All @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at @-@ Buffet . &quot;
&quot; teams of women co@@ ats for male dirt @-@ workers and it became fres@@ hly baked past@@ ry for breakfast , lunch and dinner served . &quot;
&quot; there were the Americans who sent food to star@@ de Europeans . &quot; &quot; a Square meal &quot; &quot; marks the paths that the land went with it , no longer the batt@@ ar@@ ming land . &quot;
&quot; it was a time when eating for the Americans was a central , t@@ ense topic , &quot; beg@@ ged Co@@ E , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; the new bud@@ get@@ y was the new bud@@ get@@ y : mysterious food such as lo@@ aves and K@@ asser@@ ol@@ len were res@@ ent@@ ing to basic nutrit@@ ious , such br@@ asser@@ tions as a &quot; wonderful way , eating remains , as c@@ ooks un@@ appet@@ izing ingredients below a cre@@ amy sauce . &quot;
fresh fruit was replaced by bill@@ ig@@ eres drying .
&quot; meat , the lon@@ gl@@ asting of the American cuisine was , became a rarely served luxury . &quot;
&quot; peculi@@ ar mix@@ tures have been tried , as a cal@@ orie and nutrit@@ ious satisfaction before taste or even healthy kitchen . &quot;
&quot; during their research for the book that includes recipes , prepared a dish from this epoch , baked onions with pe@@ eling butter . &quot;
&quot; it was not any popular addit@@ ive on mid@@ day , &quot; says Co@@ E . &quot;
br@@ icks goes on : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
ground @-@ butter and baked onions do not fit each other .
it was typical for many of the farm recipes .
&quot; as never before or since then , tri@@ um@@ erable appliances - including Louise Stanley , Director of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 up to 1943 - the eating habits of the country like . &quot;
&quot; by sending them recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , encouraging women to become &quot; households &quot; and the challenge , p@@ amp@@ e as cre@@ amy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rots in delicious meals . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Square meal &quot; &quot; is a celebration of historical delicacies . &quot;
&quot; in particular tasty , the reports of the response of the government to the hungry citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ vers L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ Essen @-@ Essen . &quot;
&quot; as he pra@@ ised the simple Iowa peasant cuisine of his kitchen , he p@@ iste like the mill@@ ion@@ ity man of the world , to which he has become . &quot;
&quot; he liked continental kitchen like fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; said Co@@ E . &quot;
he ate in an almost g@@ ild@@ ed menu and carried a Smo@@ king .
he was wonder@@ fully realistic .
President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt might not be committed to the same mistakes if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or was asked him to stat@@ ate with his stomach .
&quot; as described in the book the appeal of a bud@@ get@@ ary led with no interest in flav@@ ours by Mrs Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt , that the wh@@ ale house brought the bo@@ il@@ ful food in Washington , but also one of the most comfortable . &quot;
&quot; many of the species from the era of the Great Depression , with food was rejected , as soon as the land came back to the legs . &quot;
&quot; the Legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food , said Zie@@ gel@@ man , as well as science is applied to food . &quot;
the couple gave them better understood when writing the book the essay by Zie@@ gel@@ mans @-@ in @-@ law - for example how they could not throw food .
&quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; said Co@@ E . &quot;
&quot; br@@ icks , people really did sick . &quot;
there was the wind@@ surf case .
&quot; after the plate at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s dism@@ iss@@ ed , they moved and Co@@ E had a dessert which they were prepared at home : the pav@@ ement , the president Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt at noon . &quot;
&quot; it is called pr@@ une Wh@@ ip called &quot; , &quot; said Zie@@ gel@@ man and added that it was a pure trick to miss a fancy recipes . &quot;
&quot; there was no cat@@ chy cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon . &quot;
&quot; everybody has something hard to mount a sp@@ oon in the t@@ ame , brown Gli@@ b@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; amaz@@ ingly , it is not bad . &quot;
Co@@ E set out three times a night .
&quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ get@@ ier said to his wife , &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
in bom@@ bs attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ pp@@ o
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed Omar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ pp@@ o : Khal@@ ed Omar dedicated his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ky everything to save others the lives .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old itself has died at a &apos; bom@@ b attack of the Assad regime .
&quot; Omar was a member of the &quot; &quot; White Helm@@ ets &quot; , &quot; a civilian group who saved his life according to the Bild @-@ Zeitung until now almost 6@@ 0,000 people . &quot;
29@@ 00 Volunte@@ ers set her own life to play in order to draw people out of a bom@@ bing houses and to afford the first aid in the war .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
&quot; Omar was the face of the group : a video of civilians , which shows him at a 11 @-@ hour saving of inf@@ ants out of the ruins of a house , went around the world . &quot;
it made the Syri@@ ans to illumin@@ ating the symbol@@ ism in the Gre@@ ys of the war .
&quot; but as a hero he has never seen himself , &quot; &quot; said to picture : &quot; &quot; for me this is the real Ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; when I die to save lives , I think that God sees to me a mart@@ yr . &quot;
&quot; shortly before Omar he fell to the victim himself , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b attacks in Syria . &quot;
the hel@@ icopter did four fac@@ om@@ bs above the Al@@ adia district . it was filled with Ch@@ l@@ org@@ as .
a woman and two children died ; seven people suffer from breathing .
&quot; we now eliminate the poison@@ ous rem@@ n@@ ants of the bom@@ b , so that not children can play , c@@ ited the picture of his last words before he died . &quot;
the fatal bom@@ b of the Assad regime had to meet terrorists .
Grön@@ land@@ hai : the oldest verteb@@ tier is nearly 400 years old
rare sight .
Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie mostly come in winter to finish .
this sh@@ ark was allowed to return after an investigation on board the boat S@@ anna into the sea .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and sw@@ ims with a 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to the present day .
Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie have only been received with 150 years of offspring .
&quot; the Greenland attack on the ground of the North Atlantic , in an hour it comes on average just 1,@@ 220 meters wide . &quot;
&quot; only when it comes up , acceler@@ ates the five meters long animal on sat@@ te 2,@@ 6 km / h - and is half as fast as a ro@@ b . &quot;
this of long @-@ term lifestyle seems to be a sponsor@@ ship for a high age .
&quot; Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science &quot; in any case of a Greenland , the 392 years old . &quot;
&quot; ins@@ an@@ ity , Alexander Sch@@ eu@@ erle@@ in from Max @-@ Planck @-@ Institute for demo@@ graphic research in Rostock , this lifest@@ y@@ les , which means for verteb@@ rates a world record . &quot;
&quot; although the evolution@@ s@@ bi@@ ologist has already assumed for long , that Greenland are old . &quot;
only lacking the evidence .
&quot; Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie are difficult to observe , finally they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the thin popul@@ ated coast of Canada , Greenland , Norway and Sp@@ it@@ s@@ bergen . &quot;
&quot; because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually dive at the surface mostly only in winter . &quot;
about the lifest@@ y@@ les of Greenland do researchers know accordingly .
&quot; your time emp@@ ower@@ ment , when they fly six animals to six animals with a transmitter . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ y make this shar@@ ks nevertheless : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a ro@@ b , another had the j@@ aw@@ bone of a young iron . &quot;
possibly j@@ ars they sleep animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the Iron and seek Kad@@ aver which are tor@@ n from higher water flow down .
&quot; Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues were now examined 28 Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in Greenland as well as Be@@ if@@ ang from the depth of the North Atlantic . &quot;
the smallest sh@@ ark was just 81 cent@@ imeters long while the largest 502 cent@@ imeters .
&quot; to determine the age of the animals , analys@@ ed them with the carbon @-@ 14 method the lin@@ ers of the Ha@@ ie . &quot;
&quot; this centre of the eyel@@ ash is already created before the birth of the shar@@ ks , which contained in the proteins are no longer renewed . &quot;
the two smallest shar@@ ks had stri@@ k@@ ingly much carbon @-@ 14 in the lin@@ ers .
their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s than nuclear weapons try larger quantities of this radio@@ active carbohydrates in the atmosphere .
&quot; in the case of 220 cent@@ imeters in the third @-@ smallest animal , the lin@@ ers contained a low excess of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons , it is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; all major Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie had normal carbon @-@ 14 @-@ quantities , which arises in the atmosphere through cosmic radiation in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ clock showed a 4@@ 93 cent@@ imeters long Greenland an age of 335 years , during the record sh@@ ark with 502 cent@@ imeters even 392 years old . &quot;
&quot; that Greenland @-@ females get only when it grew up when they are longer than four meters , was known . &quot;
&quot; now , the researchers of the length could arrange an age . &quot;
&quot; as one of the animals with 392 cent@@ imeters , probably at the thres@@ hold of intercourse and his age was determined with 156 years , Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie with the multipl@@ ication obviously at least one and a half centuries . &quot;
also this is likely to be cat@@ ch@@ ord for verteb@@ rates .
&quot; that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme live mainly in icy waters , is no co@@ incidence . &quot;
&quot; also the previous record @-@ holder , a 211 years old Grön@@ land@@ wal , in whose b@@ acon at the neck was a 120 years old Har@@ pun@@ en@@ spitze , was caught before Alaska . &quot;
through the low temperatures often the body of the living animals runs on austerity .
they are mature later - and they sl@@ ower .
&quot; to keep in cold water warm , the animals are often particularly large . &quot;
&quot; because the volume grows much faster than its surface , through which the animal heat . &quot;
the heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much greater than with one gram of elephant .
a further advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should focus on that as early as possible as many descendants , &quot; explains the evolution@@ s@@ bi@@ ologist Sch@@ eu@@ erle@@ in . &quot;
a very big animal should only invest his resources more likely to invest in a long life .
structure in double @-@ pack
with topics around bro@@ ws the common session has been involved in the most recent session .
&quot; with relief the board took the communication of Mayor Robert P@@ utz , that &quot; finally the marketing of the youngest homes can begin . &quot;
&quot; after the bas@@ ics , par@@ cell@@ ular and final questions were resolved , the sale of the plots in the residential areas of &quot; street road &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( Sub@@ scription section 1 ) is nothing more interested in those ways . &quot;

&quot; as it was called , Bau@@ will@@ ige will be able to report as immediately in the city hall , on the hand@@ over of the plots , the community is expected to be advised in his September session . &quot;
&quot; to obtain further en@@ quiries , connected to the job creation , connected to the creation of jobs , decided to change the common sense plan in the spring of this year . &quot;
thus in the area of sub@@ time the area is already designated area around two plots direction state @-@ road 2112 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
&quot; the town on the Main has therefore decided in competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg to attract the best opportunities in London with Paris , Dublin and companies . &quot;
&quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt am most from Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um profits , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ rade , Head of the Expert &apos;s financial markets and real estate market in I@@ W . &quot;
after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum it is un@@ certain whether money houses can continue to operate from finance to the entire EU .
for the so @-@ called EU pas@@ sport has so far enough approval in the UK .
this is precisely using big US banks .
several banks have already announced to shift jobs .
the lob@@ by@@ unification &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; right with 10000 new jobs at the Main bin@@ nen five years .
&quot; for Frankfurt , the I@@ W speak the headquarters of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , united responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks of the euro zone , as well as other important authorities like the European insurance ex@@ position of EI@@ OP@@ A and the risk of ES@@ RB . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , the organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) have their headquarters in Paris , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB . &quot;
&quot; the proximity to the notation database is important for banks , as it can communicate so directly with the supervision of the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ rade . &quot;
&quot; in Luxembourg , a large f@@ ond@@ s@@ ement sector , snow@@ y but also like Dublin in the infrastructure of the infrastructure . &quot;
Frankfurt is much easier to reach the great airport thanks to the great airport .
&quot; furthermore , the city points with easily available transportation . &quot;
&quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ rade . &quot;

&quot; in a claw , Donald Tru@@ mp was hidden behind false dis@@ agreements and retreat in relation to its previous promises to publish his control . &quot;
&quot; it is common for US pres@@ idential data to publish their tax states , although they are not obliged by law because of this . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp , a New York business@@ man , and its lawyers have stated as a reason for its gener@@ alization a tax check by the tax authorities . &quot;
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; &quot; wrote elect@@ ron &apos;s election campaign in Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , in relation to the publication of the pres@@ idential election . &quot;

&quot; he ref@@ used to do what any other pres@@ idential elections has done in the last decades and to release his tax states . &quot; &quot; said to the crowd . &quot;

state control has become a subject in the election campaign .
&quot; Clinton supports a regulation that is named after the bill@@ ion@@ aire and Investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett , which would ensure that people cost more than USD 1 million earn a tax rate of at least 30 % . &quot;
President Obama supports the proposal also .

Jewish director and propos@@ es Berlin hotel because Israeli pre@@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; challenge - RT News
&quot; a French director with Jewish roots un@@ explo@@ ded a medi@@ um@@ hr , after it had betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel has no Israeli pre@@ election listed as the Arabic guests would have requested according to a employee . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust &quot; &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; &quot; left his trouble in the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by putting an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
during his last stay Lanz@@ mann Israel tried to find Lanz@@ mann Israel on the site of the hotel .
&quot; however , the country had not listed between the countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; how is it in the year 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel was eliminated and deleted ? &quot;
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
&quot; instead , the Kemp@@ ink@@ si Bristol has a possibility to choose Israel via its own call center . &quot;
&quot; after an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception . &quot;
&quot; the answer he received there , &quot; cried him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot;
the hotel ordered that the measure is a &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot;
&quot; the reason , behind it was , sol@@ dered in the director even more anger . &quot;
&quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs and they demanded that the pre @-@ election is er@@ ased , the employee was c@@ ited by Lanz@@ mann . &quot;
the Israeli amb@@ assador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov H@@ adas Ac@@ sman called this a &quot; great shame &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung reports .
we were short@@ ened by this event and trou@@ bled .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this has gathered in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even greater shame .
this does not require an explanation .
&quot; we expect the hotel &quot; &quot; the right conclusions &quot; , &quot; said the ministers . &quot;
the inc@@ ident proce@@ eds quite a great reson@@ ance on the internet from which the people saw the whole a sc@@ and@@ al .
&quot; some under@@ taken the Kemp@@ inski Hotel , that it would have given the con@@ genital Arab guests &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sham@@ eful you , it was referred to in another article , in which it was noted that the hotel which is located at the class@@ y Kur@@ für@@ stend@@ amm , near a synagogue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel quickly pointed out all alleg@@ ations of themselves and called the inc@@ ident &quot; &quot; seeing &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; ap@@ olog@@ ised &quot; &quot; with Lanz@@ mann , reports The mirror . &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct directive , &quot; Israel did not enter into the quick @-@ list , quoted the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung a spokes@@ man of Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot;
it adds that the country code was now added .

the police put Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and Gum@@ mig@@ esch@@ fin against the prot@@ esters .
the difficulties began to trace the students as a police force that led to the students to read the police rubber @-@ fin and tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations in order to express their const@@ ern@@ ation over the plans .
&quot; according to the proposals of the Gover@@ nor of Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300,000 students are implemented to save money . &quot;
some of the Protest@@ ants saw Gra@@ ff@@ it@@ its against the provis@@ ional President Michel Tem@@ er on walls .

trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly increases to 71 % - RT Business
&quot; with the abolition of the sanctions , according to the Russian Ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trade fair between Moscow and T@@ ehr@@ an in the year at 7@@ 0,@@ 9 percent . &quot;
&quot; since the international sanctions against Iran , the interest in the Russian company grew strong in businesses in the country , divided the amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; Russian companies take existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to get access to the market . &quot;
&quot; of course , the further commercial construction is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan . &quot;
&quot; he mer@@ ged that the exchange rate between Russia and Iran in the first five months of the year 2016 at 7@@ 0,@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 will increase the increase of $ 8@@ 56 million . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the Russian im@@ ports in Iran increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent compared to $ 697 million . &quot;
Russian im@@ ports from Iran clim@@ bs 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; trade boom was reached by deliveries of machines , farmers and weapons , &quot; said the amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors . &quot;
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan is going on this year from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
&quot; last year the Russian foreign representatives were about 3@@ 5,000 vis@@ as , primarily of travel ev@@ is@@ as , an Iranian citizens . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries , which affects the tourist destinations in Russia . &quot;
&quot; one could say that the record number of tourists in Russia will be broken from the last year , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time only relatively few Russi@@ ans visit Iran , something from which the amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors hopes that it will change . &quot;
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Sh@@ ir@@ az and Y@@ az@@ d , the monuments of ancient Persian Civil@@ ization in good condition . &quot;

Sch@@ otte Call@@ um Sk@@ inner stor@@ ing home as Br@@ ite Gold for Rad@@ sport
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner &apos;s last night in the male team in Rio to glory than the British team def@@ ended the title of London 2012 .
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the lead role , who had done his compat@@ ri@@ ot of Sir Chris Ho@@ y . the J@@ ure and made the legend proud when he rus@@ hed to a victory from the favorites of New Zealand . &quot;
England took a sh@@ ocking victory for four years ago during Ho@@ y the fifth of six Olymp@@ ics med@@ als .
&quot; they repet@@ itive the trick , after they start in March at the railway world championship in London despite the withdrawal of Ho@@ ys , only one hum@@ ble sixth place . &quot;
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the trailer Jamie Staff .
they did this time as Hin@@ dus .
Ho@@ ys retirement generated a gap to close the K@@ ian Em@@ adi and Matt cr@@ ampton .
Sk@@ inner was the man when she stayed there when they saw potential in the vill@@ i that has now un@@ folded .
&quot; Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - the first four years ago with Ho@@ y sie@@ ves - and Sk@@ inner continued into the qualifying round a Olympi@@ are@@ k@@ ord , but in the stand @-@ wo@@ unds the new one @-@ handed in the first round . &quot;
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
&quot; Hin@@ der was barely back after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team to the front and Sk@@ inner . &quot;
a Strategic change made a large part of transformation from where the execution of a higher gear to slow him to slow and it Kenn@@ y and above all sk@@ inner to hold the pace .
Ho@@ y saw it out of his position as the BBC @-@ expert and fell Sk@@ inner &apos;s , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ dus , when this appeared on the podium . &quot;
&quot; the 23 @-@ year old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot;
I am only here to do my best and make me a name .
we have set up a Olympi@@ are@@ k@@ ord and defe@@ ated the world champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph 2012 at the site Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys gave rise to that he dropped off after a weak start on the railway .
he later returned this statement later and there was no obje@@ ction of England Riv@@ als .
&quot; with such a phenomen@@ al victory , this time there was no such problem . &quot;
&quot; Hin@@ dus said : &quot; &quot; it feels with all the GB flags on the tri@@ b@@ une like London . &quot;
we have joined the last three months as a team .
&quot; we have come so badly away with so many world titles , that it was amazing to win again at the Olympi@@ ad . &quot;
&quot; this is an event , a gold med@@ al for the nation , which were seven of 10 titles both in Beijing and London . &quot;
&quot; if the bar@@ ometer of our progress has been in the last five months , that we expect successful five days in Vel@@ od@@ rom . &quot;
&quot; with the form ident@@ ifier , it is in the realm of possible that he has repeated Ho@@ ys victory of three ol@@ ymp@@ ic gold med@@ als in a competition . &quot;
&quot; this would mean exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was born in March 23 ( a apparently healing date for British sport ; at the day were Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger B@@ ann@@ ister was born ) - a yield of six gold med@@ als and a silver med@@ al . &quot;
the che@@ eses of Ho@@ y are the same .
Kenn@@ y takes place next in the Sprint that starts today and go through three days .
&quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels something lonely and alone to win .
&quot; she said , &quot; If he wins two more gold med@@ als , he ought to become a kn@@ ight . &quot;
&quot; it was the only podium competition , but there were more good news for England . &quot;
&quot; Sir Bra@@ e@@ W@@ iggins , Ed Clan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified themselves with the fastest performance in the four @-@ four od@@ ometer . &quot;
they came in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 at the finish .
&quot; the World Record , which won in London Gold , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,6@@ 59 . &quot;
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will be held today on the second day of the competition at the W@@ iggins with safety in the focus .
&quot; he had gone yesterday with be@@ ats before the qualification , when it smells its functioning to measure his body size . &quot;
&quot; in the appropriate women &apos;s contest , the tomorrow continued and ended , av@@ anc@@ ered Laura Tr@@ ott , Jo@@ anna Row@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and Kat@@ ie Arch@@ ib@@ ald of Mil@@ ng@@ av@@ ie in Wel@@ tre@@ k@@ ord@@ era in 4 : 13,@@ 260 . &quot;
the GB team can rely on its strong train team to domin@@ ate the average period of the Olympic Games and to bring a flock to med@@ als .
after a truly exceptional representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London were driven to the expectations for Rio .
&quot; we played pres@@ amas in the background , so the withdrawal of the technical Leit@@ ers Sh@@ ane Sut@@ ton in April in the midst of sex@@ is@@ mus@@ - and mob@@ scene , as well as the retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pen@@ dl@@ eton . &quot;
&quot; however , if one sees the first night of competition in Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks quite afterwards , when the legendary reputation is GB@@ s , who has reached the perfect moment its height to be repeated again . &quot;
future of mel@@ ting from Portland due to lifting the energy contract .
&quot; the future of the aluminum mel@@ ts of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs from workers - stand on the game , since the plant operators have termin@@ ate the energy supply contract and thus contributing to all delivery applications such as the supplier of energy companies . &quot;
&quot; this step was followed by the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsi@@ dies to the operation of the system . &quot;
one for 20 years of fixed sub@@ missions runs in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the facility of Al@@ ways in Portland are standing on the game .
no less than 2000 work@@ places direct as well as indirect - could be at risk with closure .
&quot; in addition , it could come to Domin@@ ic effects , since the mel@@ t@@ it is about 10 per cent of the total electricity of Vic@@ tor@@ ias . &quot;
2014 closed Al@@ ways the Point Henry Sch@@ mel@@ zer@@ ei which led last year to a closure of the An@@ gles@@ ea power@@ train .
the mel@@ amine of Al@@ lies in Portland loses money and risk a closure .
&quot; this step follows the years of long spec@@ ulation with respect to the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian Dollars and last due to the electricity price for the system . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminum mel@@ ting with his Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , shared that three other owners will termin@@ ate their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the complex is owned by a joint venture of Al@@ ster and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company CI@@ TIC and Japanese Mar@@ u@@ ben@@ i Cor@@ p smaller shares . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L continues to continue the plant in Portland , which means a further physical demand for electricity through the mel@@ ting , divided the company with . &quot;
AG@@ L continue to say that the treat@@ ies called &quot; f@@ ish@@ mon@@ gers &apos; will have to come into force since November 2016 .
&quot; the contracts have a 12 @-@ month of cancellation , so that they will end 2017 . &quot;
&quot; therefore AG@@ L is from that the contracts of the fis@@ cal year will contribute to the revenue , &quot; &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot;

more than just one K@@ ard@@ ash@@ ian Reality @-@ TV @-@ Star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the new issue of Vo@@ gue . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the K@@ ard@@ ash@@ ian @-@ J@@ ator Clan@@ s Kr@@ is is on the cover of the cov@@ eted Sept@@ ember@@ ment of the US Vo@@ gue . &quot;

&quot; in a room full of people I love , brought me the sight of this co@@ vers for crying , &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all . &quot;
the un@@ ve@@ iling of the Co@@ vers was followed by a bizarre ( or simply keeping Up with the K@@ ard@@ ash@@ ians like a family ( except for the most popular Show@@ biz @-@ On@@ k@@ els and producers of keeping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) as she ends the cover of her sister and ends with a classic bed@@ time : they all have a surprise party .
&quot; this makes the cl@@ ich@@ eb@@ eh@@ af@@ tete action nearly every birthday party , brought the proposition , &quot; You d@@ acht@@ est that we would forget to forget about 8 am in the morning , but Kr@@ is had to be able to participate in this Publ@@ icity . &quot;
with a view to the new issue of Vo@@ gue has started a new era of K@@ ard@@ ash@@ ians .
&quot; K@@ end@@ anger big sister Kim likes it to have be@@ aten what the Vo@@ gue cover , be@@ aten ( she and her husband Kan@@ ye West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the new issue of the magazine is a le@@ ague for itself . &quot;
the sept@@ ember issue is for Vo@@ gue which most sold the most sold issue of the year .
&quot; with a circum@@ ference , which is rather similar to a sculpture than a Mode@@ magazine , the output draws a large number of advertis@@ ers ( L@@ aut Fash@@ ion@@ ista were from the 8@@ 32 pages of the Bear@@ er 615 pages advertising ) . &quot;
the un@@ ve@@ iling of his Cover@@ series is so long@@ ingly expected that in the last two years images of the magazine is still per@@ me@@ ated before the official announcement .
&quot; women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , more &quot; &quot; celeb@@ rities &quot; &quot; were more &quot; &quot; celeb@@ rities &quot; &quot; as &quot; &quot; Models , the celeb@@ rities &quot; &quot; on the cover . &quot;
Oscar Award winner and Di@@ or @-@ Trade@@ marks Jennifer Lawrence was 2013 on the cover for a year after Lady G@@ aga .
&quot; but even in the small chance that Mrs. J@@ enner - that is described by the magazine as the &quot; &quot; breakthrough model &quot; &quot; of their generation - under the previous category , it is in good company . &quot;
&quot; this celeb@@ rities are not related to the famous people or Reality Stars or young people of today , who know how to get a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if it &apos;s all on discipl@@ in@@ ator ) . &quot;
they are really talented women who are involved in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once appeared in the last cover with the publication of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of her career .
&quot; of course , Jenn@@ ers do success not everyone . &quot;
with her Reality @-@ TV history was Jenn@@ ers stand in the fashion world always somewhat t@@ ense .
&quot; in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ model Stephanie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ enner &quot; and her colleague Gig@@ i H@@ adi@@ d , and called them &quot; &quot; Mist@@ ress des Augen@@ bl@@ icks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these feelings were again high when the message with the show Jenn@@ ers came out on the Vo@@ gue cover .
but on the Mis@@ sm@@ ut there is going to ride on the point .
K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner is on the cover of the sept@@ ember issue of Vo@@ gue .
it is in the tru@@ est sense of the word a super@@ model .
it runs for Marc Jacobs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
you and all their sisters sell you images of their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
they sold by her painted pictures from C@@ indy Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in their leisure time it is to be seen at Reality TV . probably only to see their sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .

&quot; the director of the Common centers of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last survey of the National Association of Community centres revealed that already thousands of people will be rejected each year . &quot;
Far@@ rell said that the situation without abolition of the decision of the federal government would only become worse .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ lands , centers are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , what is meant to thousands of people of important services that you need , &quot; &quot; said he . &quot;
&quot; people who leave violent relationships , people with un@@ man@@ age@@ able and op@@ pressing deb@@ ts , families , which have been released by divi@@ ders , workers , the ung@@ od@@ ds , and this collection shows that they may not receive the help they need . &quot;
&quot; the federal government will be forced from June 2017 the means by 30 percent , which means that thousands of hel@@ ds must be forced from Que@@ ens@@ land to deal with their legal problems without any help . &quot;
&quot; we demand the General Assembly and Federal Minister as well as transm@@ it@@ ators from Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis , to raise these mid@@ mar@@ ches immediately , so the people who need help they need to receive legal problems . &quot;
&quot; last year , the provin@@ cial government began to lift their commitment to the national average . &quot;
&quot; it is now at the time to see the needs of local data centers and their clients , as well as that the government Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k is invested in these important work . &quot;

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey before countries elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
&quot; in the upcoming elections in Mecklenburg @-@ Vor@@ p@@ ommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) , considerable losses for the government of the SPD and CD@@ U . &quot;
these erg@@ ents have a representative of the dis@@ research institutions IN@@ SA for the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
&quot; while the red @-@ black government Co@@ alition on the north could continue , this is not possible after the envelop@@ ing in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; the SPD in both federal states would be the SPD but the strongest party , and would thus have good chances , continue to place the government . &quot;
the SPD in Mecklenburg @-@ Vor@@ p@@ ommern ans the SPD of 35.@@ 6 percent in five years ago .
the party bl@@ ackl@@ ed according to survey conducted only just before the CD@@ U that could come back to 23 percent .
the third place is contro@@ ver@@ si@@ al between the left and the Af@@ D .
&quot; in 19 percent ( previously 18,@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented with 19 percent for the first time in the country . &quot;
&quot; in spite of more difficult losses , with 6 percent ( previously 8,@@ 7 percent ) again in the Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag . &quot;
N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not be represented by 3 percent in the country .
&quot; according to the Berlin Dep@@ ut@@ ies of the survey , the SPD in the survey of the survey is only subject to 23 percent ( choice of 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) . &quot;
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent to 23.@@ 4 percent .
&quot; it is still behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17,@@ 6 percent ) , but in front of the left with 15 percent ( previously 11,@@ 7 percent ) . &quot;
Af@@ D was represented by 14 percent for the first time in the member of Dep@@ ut@@ ies .
&quot; with 5 percent the F@@ DP could hope for a return , the pir@@ ate would be missed against it in contrast to 2011 . &quot;
Nokia 9000 Commun@@ ic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ mail and internet in Zeit@@ lu@@ pe : 20 years ago the Nokia Commun@@ ic@@ ator came to the market .
the success@@ ors today domin@@ ate the world - his producer lived a disaster .
the device weigh@@ ed almost half a kil@@ ograms and was more than four times as hard as an iPhone 5 .
&quot; it was thick@@ er and bigger , it was therefore not good in the hand . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was quite cau@@ fi@@ antly . &quot;
the built @-@ in memory was initially eight meg@@ ab@@ y@@ tes that would be today for about two Sel@@ f@@ ies with high resolution .
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gig@@ ab@@ yte .
&quot; Nokia 9000 Commun@@ ic@@ ator was just 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , into the shops - and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a few euros , lovers can buy the equipment still on the internet , but they are somehow from the st@@ one@@ age of the internet era . &quot;
but 20 years ago the Commun@@ ic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier on the computer exhibition C@@ ebit in Hannover as &quot; office in the West@@ ent@@ ric format . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the new cell phone could be sent and received a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , also by fax was the Commun@@ ic@@ ator . &quot;
even the access to web pages was possible by HTML browser as well as qu@@ it slow .
a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar . &quot;
there was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be similar as a laptop .
then we found a small keyboard and a Black @-@ White @-@ screen .
&quot; quite proud was the price : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , so about 1400 Euros . &quot;
the average price price of a smartphone in Germany was at 392 euros .
nobody could be noticed in August 1996 that the Commun@@ ic@@ ator would become the beginning of the Smartphone @-@ era .
&quot; since then , everything is different . &quot;
&quot; the clever tele@@ phones are a success story , if not for Nokia . &quot;
&quot; the mobile @-@ card of the fin@@ s survived a un@@ preced@@ ented disaster , was finally sold to Microsoft . &quot;
&quot; today &apos;s market today , which went all much later than Nokia . &quot;
always and everywhere that is today for a lot of people today .
in 2015 there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
&quot; some 1.4 billion devices have been sold , on Samsung and Apple are alone 555 million pieces . &quot;
worldwide sales with the equipment is about 400 billion euros .
&quot; in addition , the well running shops of the numer@@ ical app providers and tele@@ communication companies . &quot;
around the smartphone a whole industry has been created .
&quot; the decisive breakthrough on the mass market was only early in 2007 , then announced Apple @-@ boss Steve Jobs on the Mac @-@ World the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; he promised three devices in one : a musical player , a telephone and an internet communication , all by touch @-@ screen easy to use . &quot;
&quot; the winner of Apple started , even today the iPhone is the most important product of the Group . &quot;
&quot; Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , which dominated the market . &quot;
&quot; finally , it disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight . &quot;
the s@@ ages now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is 20 years after its invention .
&quot; in the cut , each German now looks for 88 times a day on his cell phone . &quot;
&quot; we need to learn all , the smartphone also take away , &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina &apos;s ball , in the Siemens @-@ Board of personnel . &quot;
permanent accessibility is now regarded as a cur@@ se and blessing simultaneously .
England must strengthen the ol@@ ymp@@ ic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row is not only bringing in our local community and in all London but throughout the country of renewal and prosperity .
&quot; for me this set the biggest attraction He@@ ath@@ rows , just as in 2012 in London , when we had a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions prof@@ ited . &quot;
the Olympi@@ ad brought great advantages for Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be back by setting up new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ ath@@ row &apos;s new opportunities .
&quot; for our local communities we will already create 10,000 new educational , 4@@ 0,000 new jobs and prepare the youth unemployment in the flight environment . &quot;
&quot; as they were ahead in London in 2012 , there will be such that the challenge of expansion He@@ ath@@ rows is too big . &quot;
I told me that England will never be ready for the games and that we will bl@@ am@@ ate ourselves on the world stage .
the two @-@ lifts were wrong with 2012 and they are also wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to over@@ head but He@@ ath@@ row answers any question asked .
like the Olympic Games He@@ ath@@ row is He@@ ath@@ row for many and not for a single infra@@ structures .
&quot; extension is a way to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion in ev@@ oc@@ ative growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and in the whole of UK . &quot;
&quot; we have implemented a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 billion in a period of time and budget , from the T5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s largest airport enter@@ min@@ al was built up to T2 , which was built in the middle of the two frequ@@ ented walks around the world . &quot;
now they are ready to supply a third run@@ time what is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment .
London games from 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row will also be one .
it is time that we can expand this ol@@ ymp@@ ic spirit and create He@@ ath@@ row as well as our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment to be proud of England .

Ad@@ Block Plus , Facebook in &quot; K@@ atz @-@ and mouse game &quot; regarding display @-@ block@@ ing &quot;
&quot; for companies who earn money with Onlin@@ e@@ wer@@ bung &apos;s money , according to one of the software &apos;s attempts to handle , a &quot; &quot; cat and mouse game &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that there were advertisement lo@@ osen up on his desktop page , published Ad@@ block Plus a blog@@ post where users could update their filters in the program to block advertising in the social network . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook with that his Des@@ kt@@ op@@ page would change the co@@ ding on its advertis@@ ements , to display it sco@@ re@@ alis@@ ations the detection of which part of the site advertising is to create . &quot;
&quot; but Ad@@ block announced that there has found a new way to handle the new codes . &quot;
in a blog@@ post the speaker of Ad@@ block Ben Williams is that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ H@@ er @-@ battle between the an@@ ze@@ al@@ izing Open Source Community and the envelop@@ s have already been possible for the invention of sco@@ oters lock@@ ers in the way , and that it is possible to get Facebook soon with a new solution . &quot;
&quot; the fact that the world @-@ largest company has left for social media in the fight is a strong Indi@@ z , such as wor@@ rying sco@@ oters have become for the industry . &quot;
&quot; according to a study on the last year from Pag@@ ef@@ air and Adobe about 200 million people sco@@ oters casual , almost four times as much of 2013 . &quot;
&quot; with 1.03 billion daily active users who access Facebook over their mobile devices , hand@@ y@@ wer@@ bung 84 percent of advertis@@ ers received fac@@ ebook . &quot;
the company has to set it on advertis@@ ers on Desktop PCs that mobile advertis@@ ers have no effect on fac@@ ebook mobil@@ er App for the social network and inst@@ ag@@ ram shared a speaker .
&quot; advertisement on Desktop PC makes a sufficient amount of revenue , so on Facebook is the investment of such a stri@@ de appears . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook with that it would be to update his &quot; sco@@ re@@ mark tool &quot; &quot; to have more control over them paid . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday claimed Facebook , that Ad@@ blocks would be new filters to block the site , because they are also able to block content on the page that are no advertising . &quot;
&quot; for the user this does not constitute a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem a spokes@@ man shared by Facebook in an e @-@ mail communication . &quot;
&quot; advertis@@ ers are a stup@@ id means , which is why we concentrated on development tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences , to put more control into the hands of people . &quot;
women with suspe@@ cted su@@ icide on Swiss highway
the sacrifice was right in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police calls witnesses after a woman in the early morning on Thursday at an suspe@@ cted su@@ icide of several vehicles on a highway .
the inc@@ ident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the Canton de V@@ aud shortly after midnight .
&quot; a woman laid down in the Dark On@@ es &quot; in an act of desp@@ air &quot; on the road and were hit by several cars , said the police in V@@ aud . &quot;

&quot; this is something that the Pro@@ secut@@ or must decide , &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot;
two similar cases over the last five years show that the drivers are not to be held responsible .
&quot; in each of the two cases , in which a person ran in the Dark On@@ es on the highway - was decided that the drivers does not go from it in the middle of the night on the highway , as it was in the newspaper . &quot;

NASA Klim@@ amo@@ del : Venus was once li@@ vable
Venus was probably still inhab@@ itable according to the proje@@ ctions of a new NASA climate .
scientists at the God@@ d@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus on the basis of tools and algorithms that resem@@ ble those of climate research .
&quot; the model was designed to determine whether the Venus with their hot , water @-@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere once used to inv@@ oked conditions . &quot;
scientists have previously pointed out that the slow turn of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
&quot; but the newest simulation indicates that Venus have had a thin , d@@ similar atmosphere could have had and still slow down . &quot;
the model illuminated also the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; the planet probably pointed out more dry regions than the earth , but once had enough water and geographic vari@@ ability to host life and before faster ev@@ ap@@ oration . &quot;
early Venus also benef@@ ited from one Sun which was 30 percent of Zermatt .
&quot; in the GIS@@ TR@@ S model simulation exp@@ on@@ ates the slow turn of the Venus in the sun almost two months long , &quot; said TRAN@@ S scientists Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this war@@ med the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer clouds , which affects the surface of a large part of the sun &apos;s heat . &quot;
the result are average temperatures that are some degree cooler than that of the earth today are .
&quot; the model brought a history of Venus that was similar to evolution , which was suspe@@ cted previously of Plan@@ etary research@@ es . &quot;
though they once probably was li@@ vable was the Venus -- in the course of several bill@@ ions years --@@ for a lot of heat and ul@@ tra@@ violet light .
your oceans dar@@ ed and their water d@@ amp@@ f was removed from the ul@@ tra@@ violet light .
as its hydro@@ gen I only remained a thick atmosphere of carbon di@@ oxide with a deadly greenhouse @-@ effect -- the Venus that we know them today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate in the Ge@@ oph@@ ys@@ ical Research Letters .

&quot; we hope that we experience the compar@@ isons of our results with other observ@@ ations , more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; said Luisa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ Tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a Short news . &quot;
the star@@ ry of the Ple@@ j@@ ades lies 445 light @-@ years from the earth .
&quot; many stars in this star@@ fish , which emerged in some 125 million years ago , now the adult @-@ old . &quot;
you now turn on the fastest .
leads to top rot@@ ary rates these stri@@ pped star large amounts of star@@ ters .
&quot; as these win@@ ch travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a bre@@ aker effect on the stars . &quot;
&quot; when a star age , its rotation begins to slow down . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation of each star@@ ved by using the time between the appearance of a disc@@ ern@@ ible star @-@ life -- like sun@@ spots -- det@@ ects .
the newest catalogue of Rot@@ ations@@ advise points out that massive stars are sl@@ ower than less massive stars .
&quot; Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , the larger stars sl@@ ower Pi@@ rou@@ ettes are turning smaller than smaller . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the Ple@@ j@@ ades , we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , well @-@ resistant rot@@ ors to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; as the constellation of the Ple@@ j@@ ades so close is , it serves as an ideal cos@@ m@@ ical laboratory to compare adjustment qualities such as rot@@ ary rates . &quot;
&quot; the star@@ base of the Ple@@ j@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; it is still much ahead of us what we would like to know more about how the How , W@@ ann and Why stars slow@@ down their rot@@ ary rates and so to speak their &quot; dance gloves . &quot; &quot;
re@@ ull and their colleagues in three periods are reported in detail about their latest analysis of the rot@@ ary rates of the Ple@@ j@@ aden which will soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a contro@@ ver@@ si@@ ener Baseball @-@ Star enters into

&quot; after his emotional res@@ ign@@ ation announcement , the 41 years old pro will carry on the Tampa Bay R@@ ays for the last time the Tri@@ k@@ ot of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es . &quot;
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &apos; Goo@@ gle@@ &apos; at both &apos; , the 14 @-@ Mal@@ ige All @-@ Star @-@ Game participants of the Major League Baseball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; three times Rodr@@ igu@@ ez was elected to the most valuable player of the League , 2009 he won the Yan@@ ke@@ es the World Series . &quot;
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract agreed to him since 2007 every 27 million US dollars .
&quot; until the end of the contra@@ ctor on 31 December 2017 , he will serve as a consultant and youth coach - at full sal@@ ary . &quot;
as a player you pay Rodr@@ igu@@ ez for a long time with performance .
&quot; with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; &quot; R@@ uns &quot; &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 until 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es took some mil@@ estones . &quot;

&quot; in 2009 , the super@@ star at &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; was added to the &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; between 2001 and 2003 . &quot;
in August 2013 he was locked under the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis @-@ Sk@@ and@@ al until the end of 2014 for 211 games .
Rodr@@ igu@@ ez is regarded as the principal dam@@ aging for years to have a anti @-@ aging clinic in South @-@ Florida high @-@ promoting funds .
after a dispute the lock was still reduced to 162 encounters .
&quot; the League could even have done a vessel for 2014 , because I have played 20 years without a break , &quot; said Rodr@@ igu@@ ez back in the south @-@ time . &quot;
also his de@@ port@@ ations were not no@@ is@@ eless .
&quot; while many bas@@ eball legends in their last games once again received the big stage , Rodr@@ igu@@ ez often had to sit on the bank . &quot;

&quot; Olympia 2016 : Chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ w@@ ia Dan@@ ek@@ owa and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are first D@@ op@@ ing@@ res &quot;
I may not start from Poland in Rio because of a positive D@@ op@@ ing@@ probe .
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 will be over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed by the first official D@@ op@@ ing@@ es .
a proved athl@@ ete could have won almost a med@@ al .
in front of the seventh competition the first official d@@ op@@ ters have become known as the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; the Chinese swimming pool Chen X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meters ste@@ e@@ ons in Sil@@ w@@ ia Dan@@ ek@@ owa from Bulgaria and the Polish we@@ ight@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were posit@@ ively tested and excluded - immediately before the beginning of the already critic@@ ized Athlet@@ ics competitions come these messages to the time . &quot;
&quot; at Chen , the last Sunday has been detected by hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ ia@@ zi@@ d that will be used as a mas@@ king means for sealing subst@@ it@@ ances . &quot;
the International Sport@@ court CAS confirmed its exp@@ ul@@ sion from the Olympic Games .
&quot; on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old took the fourth place in the fin@@ als over 100 m butter@@ fly , just around 0.3 seconds , she missed the Bron@@ z@@ em@@ ed@@ aille . &quot;
on Friday I would have to participate in the fo@@ oth@@ s over 50 m Fre@@ est@@ yle .
Chen was requested at the International Olympic Committee ( I@@ OC ) opening the opening of the B sample and a hearing requested .
&quot; the national association accepts the matter &quot; very seriously and demands of Chen full cooperation with the studies , &quot; quoted X@@ in@@ hua from a communication : &quot; we are working together with the International Sport@@ Tribun@@ al CAS and will accept the judgment . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in history is no longer the I@@ OC , but the CAS for the san@@ ction@@ ing of athletes with positive cases . &quot;
&quot; also in the night of Rio sick@@ ens the news about the positive sample at Dan@@ ek@@ owa by , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went into the off@@ ensive . &quot;
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; this was an incredible shock , &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV channel B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; it may be in@@ no@@ cent , &quot; the only declaration could be nutritional supplements , &quot; explained the athlet@@ ics . &quot;
&quot; according to the report , it is meant to act upon the constit@@ uted substance around the blood of blood Ep@@ o . &quot;
&quot; Dan@@ ek@@ owa has been susp@@ ended , according to B@@ NT , the B sample is to have a positive effect . &quot;
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ w announces immediately with criticism of Athlet@@ es in Word .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes do not draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; said , &quot; &quot; We are also under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot;
the nation should not be able to take part in Rio for about all we@@ ight@@ lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically d@@ op@@ ing@@ loaded nation .
&quot; on Friday the case &quot; &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &apos; , the London @-@ Olymp@@ ics in Class up to 85 kg was posit@@ ively tested on the an@@ ab@@ ole ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ rol@@ on . &quot;
&quot; both cont@@ ests the intake , both must not start in class up to 94 kg . &quot;
before the start of athletes is especially the case Dan@@ ek@@ owa a further heavy blow for the Rep@@ utation of the entire sport .
&quot; the IA@@ AF had the complete Russian team until one exception because of the systematic di@@ op@@ ings of the start , even the L@@ äu@@ ge@@ nation Kenya produces numerous bad news in Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the swimming pool , the earlier publishers had also taken care of the former disputes between the athletes . &quot;
the Fr@@ ench@@ man C@@ amil@@ le Lac@@ our@@ t was added to the Chinese Olymp@@ ics Sun Yang resin .
&quot; sun @-@ yang p@@ elt , purple . &quot;
&quot; if I see the podium more than 200 m Fre@@ est@@ yle I want to pass , I said var@@ our@@ t in the French radio . &quot;
sun was also at the centre of a conflict with the Austral@@ ians Hort@@ on .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for D@@ oping sc@@ amm@@ ers , &quot; said this . &quot;
&quot; sun was positive in 2014 with the Chinese champion@@ ships positive on the stimul@@ ant Tri@@ met@@ ac@@ id@@ ine , but had to sit down only one tri@@ im@@ on@@ ous locks . &quot;
Dat@@ ashe@@ et : so per@@ fi@@ de st@@ pres@@ sen H@@ acker her rans@@ om
programmers of Er@@ press@@ ant m@@ alware on current targeted companies - and are successful .
&quot; according to a current survey of m@@ alware @-@ defense , Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes under 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany were 40 percent of respond@@ ents companies over the past twelve months at least once , partly several victims of an attack with Er@@ press@@ er software . &quot;
in Germany almost 20 percent of companies were already the aim of a R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware @-@ ext@@ ortion .
&quot; 40 per cent of the victims paid by the perpet@@ rators , to be able to use the systems and data to be used again . &quot;
the perpet@@ rators special@@ ize their Er@@ press@@ er software according to the observ@@ ations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes on ass@@ ign@@ ments in software network .
&quot; they are successful there , the potential of avo@@ iding rans@@ om is clearly higher than in private users . &quot;
&quot; we are currently watching a fr@@ ight@@ ening fast evolution of poll@@ ut@@ ors , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ boss Marc@@ in Kle@@ cz@@ yn@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , most Mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs were still designed to send advertising to advertising . &quot;
then we discovered the perpet@@ rators Er@@ press@@ ant software for themselves .
&quot; first , private us@@ eless the goal , but the change to company attacks was fr@@ ight@@ ening quickly in the past few months . &quot;
&quot; R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware works for a simple pattern : once on the computer of a O@@ pf@@ ers , they search for un@@ long changed files such as Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files as well as for archives of pictures and videos . &quot;
these files enco@@ des R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware and Del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
then the software presents the demands of the pressors .
&quot; to get the end @-@ key code to the files , the victims must be money - mostly in the form of Cr@@ ypt@@ o@@ nutrition bit@@ coin . &quot;
&quot; but where private use is the personal photo database on the game , it goes for companies to make sensitive customers data or project databases without which the production breastfeeding . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , higher , the damage caused by a r@@ ans@@ om@@ ware . &quot;
&quot; 22 percent of the German firms in German companies established by R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware , 13 percent , even had to inter@@ v@@ om@@ iting the business activity , in case of a case were people in life . &quot;
&quot; in Germany already several hospitals were victims of attacks , whose patients may be threatened by the loss of nurs@@ es . &quot;
&quot; we always tell the victims always : pays not , it promotes only the problem , &quot; explains Kle@@ cz@@ yn@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; but 80 to 90 percent of companies who pay , get their data again . &quot;
for managers it is difficult to reject the demand for perpet@@ rators in the operation of perpet@@ rators .
the h@@ acker again know this and try to build a good reputation .
&quot; in a current study , the Security for@@ scher of F @-@ Secure uses the user interfaces and contact the result : the perpet@@ rators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money . &quot;
&quot; you declare your sacrifice by chat , as they can pay by Bit@@ coin , free access websites or de@@ cryp@@ t for example files . &quot;
&quot; and , individuals after payments of a few hundred euros , businesses have to pay hard to negoti@@ ate and five @-@ dig@@ s su@@ ms to get their data un@@ encrypted . &quot;
&quot; in view of the potential high and relatively ris@@ kl@@ ess profits from the R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware @-@ ext@@ ortion , the h@@ acker become more professional and share the work , explains the concept@@ u@@ per@@ te Che@@ ster Wis@@ nie@@ wski from the An@@ tiv@@ irus provider Sophos : &quot; a single person can write a r@@ ans@@ om@@ ware about within a week . &quot;
&quot; however , it is prob@@ able that it is three or four people . &quot;
the programmers sell their poll@@ ut@@ ors then in the form of a software building on the actual Er@@ press@@ ers .
&quot; the existing m@@ alware kits created by the m@@ alware , consulting and additional tools for a unique , firm price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars . &quot;
&quot; included in delivery is an adaptation tool such as smaller configurations , appearance and bran@@ ding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ nie@@ wski . &quot;
the Er@@ press@@ ers are then looking for further h@@ acker to spread the fresh purchased software under the victims .
we live in a service sector .
&quot; thus , one of the forums in the underground , buy the set of a crimin@@ als and comm@@ issions , to install the software on as many PCs as possible . &quot;
payment is made per inf@@ iz@@ ated calcul@@ ator .
&quot; usually to bear the crimin@@ als , then sp@@ amm@@ ers with the spread , &quot; says Wis@@ nie@@ wski . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the risk of R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware is now known by many companies that ensure their data better . &quot;
more than 50 per cent of companies in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey will trust in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey with a file @-@ back @-@ ups and sc@@ ann@@ er@@ software .
&quot; accordingly , the perpet@@ rators are already pursu@@ ing new strategies . &quot;
&quot; when the encryption of data alone is not sufficient threat to successful revenue , the perpet@@ rators instead , with the release of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ Chef Marc@@ in Kle@@ cz@@ yn@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; with this , the potential potenti@@ als depending on the type of data is still a lot higher than before . &quot;
&quot; in future , the perpet@@ rators will now take entirely new goals in the internet of things on the grain . &quot;
&quot; at the Hack@@ er@@ conference Def@@ con demonstrated safety , as they could have received the thermo@@ stat on the Internet . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of winter , the activation of such a block of heating could be quite worth a rans@@ om . &quot;
&quot; if the perpet@@ rators then instead of heating in the future block the whole manufacturing road in a factory , R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware could also be a theme in Industry 4.0 . &quot;
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and all @-@ day
&quot; in the small HR @-@ V Honda wants to pack all : a little SU@@ V , a little coup@@ é , and even the versatility of a min@@ iv@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; sounds pretty over@@ load , but the HR @-@ V that was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; although the only 1.60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers both in the first row and in the f@@ ond lot of space , it works in no place . &quot;
the materials of the interior are well processed and have comfortable to only use the c@@ ockpit top .
versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V during the storage space .
&quot; there is not only a trunk of 45@@ 3 l , at high @-@ made and 10@@ 26 l with sp@@ otted back , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is less magical than it sounds : the seat of the back@@ seat can be polished like Kin@@ os@@ hes and thereby offer storage space that is up from the floor up to the blank@@ ets 1,@@ 24 m high . &quot;
&quot; the trunk can be well ventil@@ ated , however the charging level with 650 mm is higher than in the compar@@ ative Peugeot 2008 . &quot;
the tested 1.6 @-@ l @-@ Diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
he is likely to judge his work but a bit quiet@@ er .
encouraging the everyday consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km .
there is another motor@@ ization : a 1.5 @-@ l gas@@ oline with 96 kW / 130 HP .
an all @-@ wheel@@ drive is not offered .
&quot; the driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort . &quot;
but the steering is likely to be a bit more direct .
the equipment leaves in the tested top variant &quot; Executive &quot; no wishes un@@ fulfilled .
the security @-@ systems is owned by City @-@ Not@@ bre@@ ms@@ ass@@ ass@@ ina ( works up to speed 32 ) , the coll@@ ision system and the track @-@ resistant . &quot;
&quot; the coll@@ is@@ ions@@ war@@ ner sometimes , because he har@@ dened many obstacles as &quot; her@@ ann@@ ah@@ ende objects &quot; . &quot; &quot;
very reliable works by the teles@@ cope .
and the intelligent Tem@@ po@@ re@@ gler is respond@@ ing to the traffic detection and d@@ ros@@ sel@@ t when needed the speed .
&quot; but the full connectivity is only available for top quality : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , Nav@@ i , App @-@ Integration and More . &quot;
two US@@ B@@ - and an HDMI socket can be found under the arm@@ rest and therefore are somewhat aw@@ k@@ ward .
the around 29@@ 000 Euro for the well equipped top @-@ Diesel are fine .
&quot; who does not want to invest so much , receives the gas@@ oline from 200@@ 00 Euro , the Diesel from 23@@ ,000 Euro . &quot;
the engines meet the Euro @-@ 6 @-@ gas @-@ norm .
with the HR @-@ V Honda offers a multi@@ fac@@ eted and all @-@ day @-@ day car .
Air@@ line is not liable : crash on flight bridge
an Air@@ line is not liable for the overthrow of a passenger on the flight bridge .
&quot; for a liability is only possible with haz@@ ards , which are typical for air traffic , argu@@ ed the Ober@@ land@@ es@@ Court Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) . &quot;
the cl@@ amp had broken down in the overthrow of a Kn@@ ies@@ ch@@ ei@@ be .
&quot; but the accident would have never happen everywhere - it is a general way of life , so the judgment . &quot;
the airline had to pay no damages for the guy .
disease : when paid the organis@@ er
vac@@ ation@@ ers get away after their journey only then money back if the cause of the disease is dou@@ bles @-@ free in the hotel .
but this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests were shown to show the same symptoms .
in the case the family was a family on the second day of their door@@ man &apos;s hard to di@@ ar@@ rhe@@ a and v@@ om@@ iting .
it spent almost the whole holiday in the room .
&quot; your condition led the vac@@ ation@@ ers back on a defe@@ ctive gap , which was sup@@ pos@@ edly dirty the se@@ a@@ water . &quot;
&quot; the family was the view , the journey was so poor - and har@@ dened against the organis@@ er . &quot;
in court the pl@@ ain@@ ant had no success .
&quot; though , the chin @-@ situation was in fact faul@@ ty . &quot;
but the promot@@ er took only just before departure of the r@@ acket .
he had to go out until then that the se@@ a@@ water was fine .
&quot; so he did not viol@@ ated his information , so the judgment . &quot;
especially since the samples of the water no im@@ pur@@ ities were found .
the disease of several hotel guests - wom@@ ens through an@@ ec@@ ity among each other - belonging to the general life risk .
of 6@@ 91 guests were only 38 cranes .
de Ma@@ iz@@ ière said after the refugees of violence in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July had many people worry about further proposals .
the state k@@ isses and decided to react at the same time to counter @-@ terrorism .
&quot; sure , our country will not answer the violence of the perpet@@ rators with hat@@ red and split . &quot;
this triumph we will not get the terrorists .
&quot; if a perpet@@ rators would have to leave the country more quickly , increased the safety and the approval of the population for the refuge@@ e policy . &quot;
de Ma@@ iz@@ ière wants to achieve implementing proposals to the Bundestag in 2017 .
&quot; he also announced another person@@ ification support for security forces , namely &quot; in medium @-@ dig@@ it sizes over several years . &quot;
sympath@@ etic for terrorism is back under punishment .
&quot; video surveillance should be improved , the ce@@ ase@@ fire is so nov@@ ell@@ ed so that mainly the purchase of weapons will be sc@@ ared on the internet . &quot;
the last much discussed silence for doctors should remain intact after de Ma@@ iz@@ i@@ ères words .
&quot; however , he wants to seek solutions in dialogue with the doctor t@@ esch@@ af@@ t according to solutions , as the haz@@ ard of citizens can be reduced , he said with a view of psych@@ ic ab@@ normal@@ ities . &quot;
&quot; to counter a radi@@ cal@@ ization of refugees , the Minister holds a better social support for necessary . &quot;
&quot; teachers must be better prepared for dealing with trau@@ mat@@ ised people . &quot;
to the persecution of crimin@@ als in special areas of the Internet ( Dar@@ k@@ net ) is planning de Ma@@ iz@@ ière .
&quot; SPD chief Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything about what to contribute to security . &quot;
it is important that the Minister of Minister clearly have been clearly against shar@@ eholder .
&quot; this was an ear@@ liest for the sn@@ iper in the CD@@ U / C@@ SU , &quot; Gabriel told the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Medi@@ group ( Friday ) . &quot;
de Ma@@ iz@@ ière had changed a rule from the Union to a Bur@@ ka ban and the abolition of double citiz@@ enship before .
a generic ban on completion may be proble@@ matic for constit@@ ution@@ ally proble@@ matic .
&quot; one can not offer everything you reject , and I am the wearing of the bur@@ ka . &quot;
talk about rules about road traffic or for witnesses in court .

better traffic flow on the motorway exit
it st@@ owed regularly on the reverse road - here is a picture of November .
&quot; however , this should change : the right turn is to be extended . &quot;
&quot; this is good news for all cars , drivers who stand on the environmental road every night in the St@@ au when they drive over the highway &quot; &quot; Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) . &quot;
&quot; inland , road construction extends to the upcoming Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between the Hammer road and the exit Wes@@ eler road the right turn to 700 meters . &quot;
driving can then turn directly from the Hammer road to the right .
the great advantage : the traffic is divided early @-@ time while the total of the Total is improved on the multiple section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U Group in the district of the representative of Münster @-@ West .
the trail con@@ strict@@ ion on the Zu@@ br@@ inger N@@ ER@@ VT the drivers in front of all between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
week@@ days dates back to the bridge over the Alber@@ s@@ lo@@ her way and sometimes beyond .
reason is the N@@ adel@@ ö@@ hr on the B 51 shortly before the exit Wes@@ eler street .
from here the traffic is only reduced via the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be rebuilt in front of a well @-@ three years ago .
&quot; the reason : static calculations had result that the bridge no longer has the required power , to record especially the heavy @-@ duty traffic . &quot;
how long this Eng@@ pass and the associated St@@ au will last , the competent country can not say . &quot;
&quot; however , with years to count : for the bridge has an official res@@ ort@@ ment to the year 2034 . &quot;
&quot; for the extension of the right turn , the country has been aware of the traffic @-@ weak@@ ens time in the school holidays , because with disabilities is expected . &quot;
the traffic is carried out on Tuesday and on Wednesday at the job@@ site .
intercultural journey : cultural offers for schools
the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the theater &quot; The In@@ visible House . &quot;
the Association N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theatre are now planning a musical project .
&quot; the Association N@@ ima &apos;s Club enables young people to visit mig@@ ration@@ - and refuge@@ e , cultural institutions in Münster . &quot;
the &quot; class International &quot; der Wald@@ schule Kinder@@ haus has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; The In@@ visible House of the Young Theat@@ res Münster .
in the context of the Association N@@ ima &apos;s initi@@ ates &quot; Inter@@ cultural journey &quot; visited 19 students between eleven and 15 years the st@@ aging in a little house .
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the association dedicated to the cultural integration of young people with mig@@ ration@@ - and refuge@@ e inter@@ ference to aim to visit schools with welcome classes , as part of this project cultural institutions in Münster . &quot;
&quot; most of the young people of the class were between September 2015 and March 2016 among other things from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria to Münster , and spr@@ inkl@@ ing little German . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the chore@@ ograph@@ ies , the s@@ zen@@ ish images and video animations , it may have been possible to follow the action of action , so the press release of the Young Theat@@ res Münster . &quot;
&quot; the Association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az Wester@@ berg , and the Young Theater will work together in the coming season as part of a musician project . &quot;
&quot; from October to December youth@@ s , with and without fluor@@ ide and migrants inter@@ ference between 14 and 20 years the possibility received , professional adv@@ ancing courses in the areas of singing , dance , acting and music . &quot;

the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural journey &quot; continues .
&quot; given the increased refuge@@ e reserves the association with many classes , who want to participate . &quot;
rain instead of star@@ fish : hope on weather @-@ better
the weather has made the Star@@ car@@ ver Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the south @-@ west of Germany during the night to Friday a shr@@ ich by the invoice - but there is still hope .
&quot; the night may have been suited for clouds due to clouds and rain to observe the heavenly spect@@ acle , said the Chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Fri@@ day@@ tomorrow . &quot;
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
&quot; the weather is to be good , then we definitely see many ast@@ ring@@ es at the sky . &quot;
&quot; at the star@@ fish , these are Per@@ se@@ iden , which belong to 216@@ 000 kilometers per hour to the quick@@ est stars . &quot;
&quot; your name have they because they apparently comes from the constellation Per@@ se@@ us , which goes up in the north @-@ east . &quot;

&quot; in the evening , one gets forever around , at night you just sit down , in the morning it is far from the tw@@ eck@@ er@@ ring to think not to sleep . &quot;
this is anything but relaxing .
&quot; after all , one is with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute has approximately one quarter of adults sleep and more than ten percent emp@@ irical their sleep often or permanently as not rest@@ ful . &quot;
how do you do sleep problems or ins@@ om@@ nia ?
&quot; there are several forms of ins@@ om@@ nia , and there may be many causes of underlying causes , Hans @-@ Günter We@@ e@@ ß , Member of the Board of Directors of the German Society for sleeping research and sleep medicine . &quot;
&quot; what one understands land@@ ed below , but is the in@@ som@@ ite , thus a sing@@ le@@ - and sleeping @-@ inter@@ ruption . &quot;
&quot; just sleeping a lot of people as uns@@ atis@@ factory , or in@@ adequate , says Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , Member of the Executive Board in the German home@@ y association with practice in the lower Sax@@ on Var@@ el . &quot;
what is behind ins@@ om@@ nia ?
the causes of ins@@ om@@ nia are complex .
&quot; behind it , organic , mental or non @-@ conditional factors , but also drugs are stuck . &quot;
not rarely is the ins@@ ign@@ ing expression of another illness .
&quot; very early aw@@ aken is mainly in depression frequently , &quot; says We@@ e@@ ß . &quot;
and it can be that various factors exist .
&quot; for example , who has an op@@ aque inc@@ ident can be bad , w@@ acht every two to three hours and begins to greet you about all @-@ day problems and take care of sal@@ ute , there is a example . &quot;
&quot; this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible . &quot;
from when to go to a doctor ?
&quot; if you do not sleep well over a period of a month at least three nights per week , and on the day the doctor should go to the doctor . &quot;
&quot; impair@@ ment can look quite different : one is down@@ cast , tired , we@@ ar@@ row@@ ed , has difficulty with attention and concentration , is slightly irrit@@ able , has voice fluctu@@ ations or physical disorders such as stomach or head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; to relie@@ ve the sleep , it is important to find their cause . &quot;
&quot; as a treatment options include behavi@@ oral behavi@@ ors , a cognitive behavi@@ oral therapy or drugs - classical dor@@ ms , only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ ask . &quot;
&quot; Nieder@@ uber@@ ant Sle@@ eve is available in Germany , emphas@@ ises Prof. Ingo Fi@@ etze , Director of the interdisciplinary dormitory in the Char@@ ité Univers@@ ität@@ smedi@@ zin Berlin . &quot;
&quot; that is why you should feel at bed@@ time at bed@@ time , first of the house@@ keeper . &quot;
this can be clar@@ ified with studies whether the problems have a physical cause .
&quot; who should go to sleep , and what happens then ? &quot;
&quot; for exam@@ ining in the sleep laboratories , for example with snor@@ ing with respiratory suffer@@ ings , in sleep @-@ w@@ aking or if one does not find the cause of a di@@ zz@@ ling , explains Fi@@ etze . &quot;
to prepare for the examination you should not have to prepare .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; only please do not make menus , &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot;
after c@@ abling you go to bed in bed .
&quot; besides the electro@@ des in the body there is a nas@@ al br@@ ace , a chest strap , and a fro@@ sted at the finger . &quot;
it also features a camera on the ceiling .
how can suffer@@ ers get the problems in the handle ?
there are quite many positions on which one can put for better sleep .
&quot; We@@ e@@ ß count on : regular ins@@ ens@@ - and asc@@ ension times , not too long in bed , on the day do not sleep , not remote to sleep , alcohol me@@ iden and at night do not start at the watch - then you immediately start to count , and that is quite and not con@@ duc@@ ive . &quot;

&quot; in a country where a Olymp@@ ics gets 20,000 € award and a jungle can be aston@@ ished 15@@ 0.000 € , nobody should wonder about missing medall@@ ions , wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old at night on his Facebook page . &quot;
the convey@@ or system in the swimming @-@ sport be bad , the d@@ op@@ ing@@ debate is very good . &quot;
&quot; thus , we cannot compete with countries that can take very much and do it in the issue of d@@ oping , or even operate . &quot;

airport : Ban@@ de of baggage fixed
professional th@@ ie@@ ves at the airport Düsseldorf
civil@@ izations of Düssel@@ dor@@ fer Police succeeded on Thursday the capture of two women and two men aged 50 to 61 years .
the equ@@ est@@ ial were committed as ban@@ de several flash@@ light and baggage convey@@ ors .
&quot; at 21.@@ 30 , there was civilian officials in the field of the airport Düsseldorf a ban@@ de again , which was known to the polic@@ emen from past theft . &quot;
&quot; the two women and two men had committed several Deli@@ ver@@ ed since mid July of this year , and were particularly professional , skilled and especially professional . &quot;
&quot; the specialists of the crimin@@ als of 34 may have the th@@ ie@@ ves that were submitted to the inspection of criminal off@@ ence to Germany , four acts . &quot;
&quot; they had a total of over 15,000 Euros . &quot;
&quot; Alt@@ built , a few Lind@@ enb@@ äum@@ chen , with a few Lind@@ ner@@ ve @-@ buttons : the Riga road in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sha@@ in works on the first sight not so , but the police counts it to the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; one passes the road from the east to the west , one passes playing games , a fres@@ hly painted children &apos;s garden and a bi@@ ol@@ ades . &quot;
to the fac@@ ade of a gray house someone has &quot; ugly ! &quot; spra@@ yed .
&quot; opposite of a Lid@@ l , which should soon be demol@@ ished : until 2017 there is a house with high windows and 133 new rented apartments . &quot;
&quot; article about this &quot; &quot; trendy neighborhood &quot; , &quot; as the competent real estate company Friedrich@@ sha@@ in is called in the last weeks however preferred by burning cars . &quot;
&quot; reason for this is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents have been occupied , but on the ground floor there are still spaces occupied and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; especially the Berlin Inn@@ ens@@ ator H@@ enkel had been in the beginning of the year for a hard drive to the police against the project , the area as &quot; No @-@ Go @-@ Zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonom@@ ous violence . &quot;
&quot; after on 22 June the rooms were vac@@ ated on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schm@@ ie@@ de , with 300 police troops , pat@@ rolling over 30 to 40 officials and three teams on site , block parts of the street and held visitors to enter the house with the number 94 . &quot;
meanwhile remo@@ del@@ ed construction workers on behalf of the unknown land@@ owners the rooms .
&quot; on 13 July , the Berlin Board Court ruled that the cle@@ aring was illegal , and a day later went to police and building workers under the che@@ ering of sympath@@ izers and residents . &quot;
&quot; in this summer afternoon , the road peaceful : parents go with children walk , people sit on the pav@@ ement in front of the houses in the sun , others are talking about advance Sp@@ ät@@ i . &quot;
in the immediate vicinity of the building projects are a primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens .
&quot; left force is not the main concern of many inhabitants : Kerstin Neu@@ geb@@ auer who lives in the Kiev , and Jana * who generate three children mainly from the police presence . &quot;
&quot; with the inhabitants of the house @-@ projects , they divide the concern ahead of rising rolling and gent@@ rif@@ ication . &quot;
it does not sound after a lap@@ se which wished to ban a massive police protection against v@@ andal@@ ous left .
&quot; the dit@@ ch , which of the Berlin Inn@@ ens@@ en@@ ator and the police between land@@ lords and their neighbours , does not exist as apparently no . &quot;
&quot; Friedrich@@ sha@@ in in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional work@@ wear , which is also today compared to the rest of the city a low average pace and high degree of poverty . &quot;
&quot; also home@@ homes and the native residential projects are already occupied for a long time to Kiev : 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former G@@ DR , including nearly the entire Main@@ zer street very close to the Riga . &quot;
&quot; while the main@@ line had been vac@@ ated among large police , many of the projects in the Rig@@ aer were still inhabited today by people who were occupied for 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the district in recent years has become increasingly becoming the magnet for tourists and vot@@ ber@@ liner from all over the world : with them now divide the inhabitants of G@@ DR times and former home@@ work of their pine trees . &quot;
&quot; this also makes itself noticeable in the rent , which has risen since 2009 at New York by nearly 60 percent . &quot;
&quot; many of the new buildings in the Riga are attacked as symbols for this development : one recogn@@ izes them in min@@ ished disks or fres@@ hly painted fac@@ ades , which were raised with shades . &quot;
&quot; no other road was mentioned this year so often together with the words &quot; &quot; left @-@ autonom@@ ous violence &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; one reason is that not all neighbours that are seen as problem , could be that they are not necessarily affected by the crime : crimes such as body vulner@@ abilities are according to almost exclusively against polic@@ emen . &quot;
most of the crimes make obje@@ ctions from which tend to be more likely to meet the new buildings and newly renovated houses .
&quot; for Kerstin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lived for 17 years in a le@@ ague next to the contro@@ ver@@ si@@ al 94 years , can be no talk of uncertainty . &quot;
&quot; what non @-@ violence , it is important : the people in the 94 are their neighbours , which are not meant to be . &quot;
even the famous burning cars put it right in the Rig@@ aer longer .
&quot; for the studied architect@@ ures , her street is not a crime foc@@ al point , on the contrary , &quot; here you can find each other , lives together on the road and gets more each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is deliber@@ ately drawn into the Riga street - and remained .
&quot; therefore , it was so important that the inhabitants of the inhabitants have returned their road : from the police , politics and the media , which in July all suddenly claim the German @-@ sho@@ ots over the district . &quot;
&quot; however , in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road will continue to be taken away : due to s@@ ighting buildings in former construction , which p@@ ushing the old residents . &quot;
&quot; these are ultimately con@@ domin@@ iums , which are not interesting for many here - here are more people who are not so well toler@@ ated , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; violence and destruction , I can absolutely not gu@@ ards . &quot;
&quot; but what is to do , if someone else is listening ? &quot;
&quot; it goes on all sides fru@@ stration , even in the police and the inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; for a det@@ ri@@ fied who enjoys himself over dy@@ bom@@ bs , Kerstin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the skin projects and the left scene belong@@ ed to the Kie@@ z . &quot;
&quot; who draws , should be aware of this - just like someone who moves into a tavern , there can be bad about noise . &quot;
&quot; all , only with pre @-@ names mentioned persons have therefore asked not to be called by their right name . &quot;
Ur@@ bach : Ann@@ ika De@@ usch@@ le is new refugees
Ann@@ ika De@@ usch@@ le is the contact person in terms of integration and organisation .
&quot; moreover , it is social @-@ workers on site . &quot;
since July Ann@@ ika De@@ usch@@ le is the refuge@@ e officers for Ur@@ bach .
the social ped@@ agog@@ y supports the team of managing Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
&quot; it sees itself as the contact person for all players : refugees , labour re@@ is refuge@@ e aid , administration , authorities and who else . &quot;
&quot; reg@@ ine customer from working re@@ is indicates that the honor@@ ary more than grateful that De@@ usch@@ le is now , that De@@ fe@@ le is now that De@@ fe@@ eb@@ ch@@ sau , which is primarily a problem . &quot;
&quot; so , some - less sp@@ otted than rather on the variety of erw@@ ays are targeted , as the management wanted to write the spot . &quot;
&quot; sought a management system with a talent for languages and people , connected with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , even an e@@ ier@@ le@@ ase wool . &quot;
&quot; yet administrative work was not their central area , says Ann@@ ika De@@ usch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it is about organization , work with the people on site and also behind the scenes as well as networks . &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been here for about six weeks .
it has a 50 @-@ percent place on three years .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer that Ann@@ ika De@@ usch@@ le ehr@@ - and full @-@ time actors supported . &quot;
&quot; there are large and small problems , organizational , human and understanding . &quot;
soon there are new containers in the water@@ way
&quot; a serious problem is it for some time , apartments have been recognized for the connection of connection . &quot;
for the connection with municipalities are responsible .
they must bring the refugees in their own or rented residential areas .
&quot; the cost of construction , the rent or renovation of these accommodations must carry the municipalities themselves . &quot;
the responsibility changes from the coun@@ cils on municipalities and job center .
&quot; problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer its accommodation . &quot;
the search has been designed and very difficult for some time .
de fac@@ to finds the management of no private apartments .
&quot; it has not been working so far , you should rely on private apartments so de@@ br@@ usch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; therefore , all the apartments must be sound@@ ed , as it is so beautiful . &quot;
so soon new containers are placed in the water@@ way .
but only with apartments it is not done .
&quot; perspective is the keyword , are Reg@@ ine customer and Ann@@ ika De@@ usch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a fixed bar@@ wear , there are tra@@ inees , training courses , training courses , one @-@ euro jobs and ex@@ hil@@ ar@@ activities for refugees and migrants , who have to be fil@@ med or established . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reported Reg@@ ine customer . &quot;
&quot; many work in the building or help car@@ et@@ ist@@ ern , do non @-@ profit work - and the motiv@@ ates and very neat , as Ann@@ ika De@@ usch@@ le reported . &quot;
they hop@@ ed that the work for the simil@@ arities leads to a positive effect .
&quot; this is &quot; &quot; no employment therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; yet , work means not only work . &quot;
&quot; the day do a solid structure , say De@@ usch@@ le and customer . &quot;
people would have to develop a belonging .
&quot; so we need offers such as sports , contacts with locals and above all courses . &quot;
professional courses are rare .
so you can also jump to administration and volunteers .
&quot; it is central that the refugees get the feeling , they are welcome in Germany and welcome . &quot;
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; you must explain the refugees that it takes time and it can only be able to cross the time , for example with language courses . &quot;
&quot; if we could get the feeling of developing , he could not work in Ur@@ bach , do not want to work and be un@@ n@@ ütz , who will never integrate themselves . &quot;
the significant majority is motivated .
&quot; however , we also say , says customer honest@@ ly , &quot; people who do nothing at all . &quot; the work of De@@ usch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot;
all that is a &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot;
&quot; a difficult question : have the two survi@@ ving fear of radic@@ alisation , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; no , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer quite clearly , &quot; which might call it &quot; . &quot; a res@@ risk could be and would not be closing them . &quot;
&quot; sensit@@ ised , the hel@@ pers were already . &quot;
these inc@@ idents may also be subject to refugees .
they would have the fear that the Att@@ ach@@ ers bring them completely into dece@@ it .
&quot; they want to show that they do nothing to do with that , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer . &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so you have to hold main and volunteers on the spot and in the region according to activities .
they always have in the background that soon a new impact on refugees and migrants will come to Ur@@ bach .
needs Germany a upper limit ?
&quot; this question is clear to answer , fail to politics . &quot;
actually it is unfair to place them hel@@ pers on site .
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we are not yet arrived , where we want to go , &quot; says Ann@@ ika De@@ usch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; no new refugees , that would be able to relax . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that the Urb@@ ane is even better to integrate , the past people have reasonable . &quot;
&quot; these are currently about 100 people , mostly young men . &quot;
&quot; but when people in need are , they are helping them , both women are un@@ anim@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; the political world situation is so complex , since there is no simple answers . &quot;
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : bre@@ aker with hel@@ icopter

two un@@ known men are charged on Fri@@ day@@ tomorrow at 8.@@ 50 o &apos;clock in an apartment in a apartment house in the Lind@@ en@@ weg .

they fle@@ eting the direction of downtown .

the flag ran without success .
&quot; eventually , the unknown was in fact close to the apartment and on their escape . &quot;
