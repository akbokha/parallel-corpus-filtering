<seg id="1">Clintons and Trumps economic policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Invest in infrastructure and prevent the trade agreement TTP - they want both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">"however, the two US presidential elections are to be found in the control and energy policy as well as in a basic question."</seg>
<seg id="4">"differences between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental, rather philosophical difference."</seg>
<seg id="5">The report on the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep the doubt rather small and warns before that as the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to control the economy to death and regulate to death.</seg>
<seg id="8">"he himself would be quite different, claims Trump."</seg>
<seg id="9">"he will continue to regulating regulator, and he makes for a wide range of tax density with lower tax movements - for individuals and for businesses."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Clinton says: the state has certain tasks to fulfil, he has disadvantaged opportunities and needs money."</seg>
<seg id="11">"therefore, the taxes would increase for the rich, says it."</seg>
<seg id="12">"interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in the nuts, Trump and Clinton are almost wortense."</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State Investments in the infrastructure are classical democratic policy and are rejected about the state-critical Teaparty-wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">"thus, on Trump, we could send you a partial discussions on Trump."</seg>
<seg id="17">Significant are the differences in the energy and climate policy.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal power plants and to drive the coal-production in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil production is also possible to announce the Paris climate agreement in so far protected areas.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Clinton does not want to build and calls for renewable energies with its investment program," "a country will create the superpower of clean energies and millions of jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will be either China, Germany or America - I want that we are."</seg>
<seg id="22">"however, not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far away from each other."</seg>
<seg id="23">"TPP, the transpazical trade agreement, they both do not want to sign."</seg>
<seg id="24">"at the same time, both of the US do not wish to isolate international trade, but simply protect American jobs better."</seg>
<seg id="25">Which should then be paid even better, demands about Clinton. "</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum rewarding of 7,25 US dollars is a hunger rewarding.</seg>
<seg id="27">She wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"what Trump will do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum rewarding must be rightly, then he says, he may not be changed."</seg>
<seg id="29">But the great discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the control policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the one hand, Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth."</seg>
<seg id="31">"his critics keep him off, so that the household deficit would be even greater."</seg>
<seg id="32">"at the other side, Clinton, who wants to ask at least by the rich that they pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are also not the solution."</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: a "alliance of external pages"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended up a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give herself the hands and to proclaim a official end of the eight months of the permanent war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>

<seg id="8">I could no longer count it.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also spoke that relations with Russia will not only return to their old level before the crisis, but even better."</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day a newspaper that Erdogan would have been so daze than never happened before.</seg>
<seg id="11">I seemed to indicate his enthusiasm rather to interpret the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin exradiant, sustainable radile showed that the state of Russia had nothing forgotten."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rather, the cause of the crisis was the first to mention what he mentioned in his introductory words: the shot of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="14">Moskaus's reaction at the time was wutribranded.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin divided up and accused Ankara to be like to have fallen into the back.</seg>
<seg id="16">The verb was even greater since it was committed by a deficent friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">It will be rebuilding up again if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"months, the state of controlled media led to a heavy, unlimited attack on Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="20">At once it seemed to be the Turks for everything to blame.</seg>
<seg id="21">"most of the test were the allegations of conductive officials, that Erdogan's own family has benefited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria, which are controlled by the so-called Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="22">He has taken this vehement.</seg>
<seg id="23">"but in St.Petersburg, the official message was that there is time to look forward."</seg>
<seg id="24">"finally, this meeting took place only because Putin was given by the President Erdogan the sorry who he wanted to hear."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could make a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara the benefits of a ceasefire are clear on hand.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Erdogan needs to be primarily all friends who can get, after spending last month at a failed coup nearly his ministry."</seg>
<seg id="28">Repetitive terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken it.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Russian sanctions have taken Turkey hard - especially the ban on charters, which usually bring several millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year."</seg>
<seg id="31">The number is returned by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia will be easier to be carried out in Russia and Chartercompanies when the flights are taken up again.</seg>

<seg id="34">This week prognostically the courier can be cheap fruits and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agrimports are allowed again.</seg>
<seg id="35">"a report in Vedemosti set it as follows:" tourists there long, tomatoes here long. "</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry to the West as it was in response to the tried power of power as a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">"in addition, the ongoing Groll come across the snail accession negotiations and Putin - the enlightening to pull out of the coolly benefits and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the west."</seg>
<seg id="39">"the Russian state won in Ankara with certainty a bonus for this, that he called for the tried coup support for the chosen state organs."</seg>
<seg id="40">This is a prosperous fear for Moscow which even has a deeper fear of regimation.</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit meeting in this bright palace at the sea made it possible Russia and Turkey, one as it used to build me an analyst once called" "Alliance of external pages". ""</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still big differences between the two still."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave the role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey are supporting lepers."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it could be indicative that after nearly three hours at first, both presidents appeared on the press conference, that they could not even striped the subject."</seg>
<seg id="45">President of Turkey suspect it clearly on a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize this. "</seg>
<seg id="46">"it is not a clear consensus on it, where a common denominator can be found to Syria."</seg>
<seg id="47">"but after months of open subtleties - and given the potentials for a complete disinfection, as NATO-member of Turkey the Russian martial jet - it is certainly better that the two leaders at least talk together."</seg>

<seg id="4">The SPD proposes to the next installer of a "action concept."</seg>
<seg id="5">But conflict is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">In first line it is about the question: who is supposed to build the cheap apartments actually?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing.</seg>
<seg id="8">"SPD leader Christoph Bratmann says:" "we are going to build up with the Greens: who wants to build up to urban areas in the future of 20 percent of all the apartments as a social housing."</seg>
<seg id="9">The favorable apartments can also occur in stock.</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, the great dispute in the Town Hall is however, so Bratmann:" how to build up with investors who want to build on private areas? "</seg>
<seg id="11">"we want to build, that investors have at least 10 percent, but as possible as 20 percent of the apartments as a social housing."</seg>

<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we get the specialists.</seg>
<seg id="20">"yet, the program is not entirely: because the approximately 1260 new apartments that should be built anyway."</seg>
<seg id="21">"however, how is the loss of other about 1300 cheap apartments which will run in the coming years?"</seg>
<seg id="22">Only until the year 2020 it will be 500 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="23">"to prevent this, so the planatory spokesperson Nicole Palm, should now be sold out-running ties from the city."</seg>

<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments you could get there to the price connections for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: these are the owners who do not want to use the property companies.</seg>
<seg id="30">"for, the number of social housing is raised in the Western city again drastically, one can be removed from the purpose of so-called interference."</seg>
<seg id="31">A concentration of social weak in just a few neighborhoods should not give it more.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination plates: who cheys actually sound-plates?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men middle aged records.</seg>
<seg id="3">"before you go to the commentary piece, to extraced him under the pseudonym of non-avenues with rinsults, this statement is derived from the current data."</seg>
<seg id="4">"according to YouGov, the multiplying of sound records is not attributed to a boom in millennial specials who wish to welcome the novelty of physical objects but on midlife nostalgia."</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have recently bought a record are of all prediction according to the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact the age group of 18-24 is the most inmost vulnerable.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a hordes by hobbies - it has an emotional meaning: older butaries retain their feelings rather for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it alone time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">"if this blog is a news report on television would follow me the camera would follow me in the midst of a busy street in Soho, a modest gray clage and wild."</seg>
<seg id="10">"so, let us take a look at that."</seg>
<seg id="11">"even though the heart is slowly moving to its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where once independent seller has been residents - there are still a handful fantastic record-stores."</seg>
<seg id="12">"I would probably ask the cameramann, the camera will stand out for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to assess their age and minds through observation."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Stuart from Glasgow, 55, which I visited by Sister Ray (data number: eight men middle aged) into the Reckless Records (data number: eight men middle aged), a woman, probably around the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and through the shops to fill the few hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">"is he a collector, ask me?"</seg>
<seg id="15">"I appreciate," says he. "</seg>
<seg id="16">"I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates."</seg>
<seg id="17">"these sound plates, shown above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I am not followed to him home), clides the walls of his living room."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles, the result of his available income: it is now able to buy panels which he could not afford when they appeared and again to buy items when he sold young and plet."</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I bought, are from the late 60th, early 70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things where I was probably something to buy it," "says he."</seg>
<seg id="20">"he is true that those who buy records, rather introverted and would like to spend time, and adds:" I do not smoke and I drink not very much. "</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my lungs.</seg>
<seg id="22">"WEZ, 25 who works by Sister Ray works, also believes many customers that he meets to the YouGov profile."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, he has also noticed a new wave of people who have heard about the Medienhpe, people who have heard about the comeback and allow yourself to purchase their old records."</seg>
<seg id="24">"from the conversations that I have led, people are usually inherent in 1998 or in 1999 of their collection."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers who once bought their records, to buy CDs now, sell their CDs to buy their records once again."</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom of trailers of the record of a particular age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the congenital emotional meaning of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a shop like Phonica to recognize that turntables offers a soothing community of equalities.</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to WEZ, some of the older customers participated in the contactless payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">Some turntables are overwhelmed by the digital world and want to draw back to the stability of confidential sound-noise from objects that give happier jewels.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the colt of a void or possession of the owner as a kind of comfort," says WEZ. "</seg>
<seg id="32">This is for me as a collector and I think that it is so many people with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "we are like their social worker!" "kills an employee of a flat stack."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a survey of ICM in April revealed that nearly 50% of the people who bought the last month a record, they have not yet been mixed."</seg>
<seg id="36">"the survey found also that 41% have a record player that never use, while 7% of those who buy a record, have no record player."</seg>
<seg id="37">"at this time of post office, I would probably be very concerned while I blaze through a stack to Bossa Nova compilations blaze."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Jonny, 42, who works with Sounds of the Universe (data number: three men middle ages) has noticed a" "Trophy's aspects". ""</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone arrived only recently here and said," "I had no record player, but I would like to buy a radiohead record, so I would put them into the shelf," "says he."</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens."</seg>
<seg id="41">"more product-lasty, less musiklasty."</seg>
<seg id="42">"we have people who say," I have no turntables. "</seg>
<seg id="43">"these are younger people, not older who come to slow."</seg>
<seg id="44">"stop that has dedicated to the record almost an entire floor, has a bail audience when I travelled."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, Teenagejungs and Women middle age."</seg>
<seg id="46">"even though the atmosphere is something less relaxed than in the aforementioned shops - Wild Beasts neuester synthetic and sextecter pop instead of experimental jazz, from the loudspeakers - it is good to see such a diversity among customers."</seg>
<seg id="47">"none of them looks strange, but nagging psychological grapmata are hard to conceivable if one stands in addition to someone 30 seconds long."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Elanora, 27, has been around for a few minutes in the store and considers the Varietes on the sale of the panels."</seg>
<seg id="49">It more makes a mannequin as a big one.</seg>
<seg id="50">"it does not deserve much, so the collection of sheets is not a real option, says it."</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs much.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it is easy to listen to music from a computer or to another way, but the beauty of plates is..." she is driving with a dearable sigh. "</seg>
<seg id="53">I do not know how to explain it - it is really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">"my last stop is a business, from which it is said that a new generation of turntables have inspired: urban Outfitters."</seg>
<seg id="55">"while I give the pretension to sample the jeans Hotpants, I watched a group of young teenager, which grouped for a moment to buy polaroid cameras before a father and daughter to think a crosley turntables."</seg>
<seg id="56">"on the left is a staircase, a wall full of panels of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential records for an average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"nobody looks like it - maybe because they are only purely decorative, some as far above that it is impossible to drive them."</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "turntables."</seg>
<seg id="59">"but considering that any attraction for these objects could mean more money for the industry and to send some customers to the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain."</seg>
<seg id="60">"it is not a surprise that a population group, which has more time and money than others, even the one that is most of the most luxury items such as plates."</seg>
<seg id="61">"also, if my replication were able to agree that the results of YouGov, let them, at least in turntables in Soho, the large number of female collectors and turntables, which exist in reality, turntables and in Onlineforen."</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">"they spend their Thursday morning with certainty not with the strolling through turntables of the Berwick Street and the leaves by plates, while they solidified the middle of a uncanny, 30-year-old moderator, who is on the shoulders nothing of the middle aged men."</seg>

<seg id="1">Amongst the Rage of the Olympic Games to the Zen of the trampoline</seg>
<seg id="2">"wherever you are, how late it is, it is the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the events in Rio de Janeiro will feel resistant and inescapable, a rapid residing place between competition and braces."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is, as if the olympic torch itself is a burning bullet, which will protect from the bracelets for swimmers to the triathlete."</seg>
<seg id="5">"you cannot listen to the television or listen to a newspaper or listen to the talk of your neighbours in the morning, without having Simone Biles, Katie Leading y or the battle between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos."</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is a logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Dooley, who is for the first time in the Olympic Games and a women black with dimples, could certainly be sent under this known name that would be sent to Prime Time through sponsors and feel-TV advertising, if he would be a swimmer, turner or even feeder."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fought in the olympic trampoline of gold."</seg>
<seg id="9">The olympic flame does not illuminates every event equal.</seg>
<seg id="10">"further from the center, partly in the shadow are the sports, which are not generally recognized: airbrush shoot, archery, badminton, Taekwondo."</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast swimming and let it reign for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but if I would like to make the arguments for my particular darling, then let me bring the attention to the discrete charm of the trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="13">"although the trampoline have already been a olympic event since 2000, when it had been in Sydney, the last 16 years, it was so helpful that many whom I had asked, did not know that it is at all a Olympics."</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">"although the US athletes sent to competition, it has never won a medal in the trampoline and had never had a athlete who made it up to the end."</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and Russian people tend to share the prices for men and the Chinese and the Canadians who share the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend its gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline has a certain outdoor swimming pool, partly because it sounds an enlightened ear for a clowning school than that sounds like for the Olympic Games. "</seg>
<seg id="19">"at this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only an inherent enthusiast."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it has humorous potential - the cartooning trembling of his never too end cloudiness - but also the grace of the tournament, and diving, the two sports, which is essentially united."</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El trampoline which means as much as "springboard."</seg>
<seg id="22">"rising winner jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and have to end a number of falling movements (rotating, pushing and saltos) before they land on the feet."</seg>
<seg id="23">"according to official Olympiaproram, according to execution, difficulty and" flight time. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"two-eight athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women are going to compete in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="25">The common olympic vector is straight out.</seg>
<seg id="26">"we must continue in their quest for gold, faster, to top and above, sometimes up to the target, sometimes down and back, to the top and down on the playground."</seg>
<seg id="27">They are not only the Ziellinie or the output of the output but also in the television transfer: that of the world or the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="28">"purposeful pursuit is nobel, admirable, even fanatical - and it is enough to even stirring a spectator."</seg>
<seg id="29">"but it is also what I feel at the specting of these games as a little weightless."</seg>
<seg id="30">This is the trampoline a reprieve.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forwards movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">"he or she prit off, seemingly serious as an astronaut, goes to the top, then down to the bottom, then effortlessly back up."</seg>
<seg id="34">"there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during exercise there is no hectic attack on the target, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity."</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games only can be.</seg>
<seg id="36">"qualifying and duck of women will be held on Friday morning, during streaming by 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00."</seg>

<seg id="4">Witnesses say that tens of protesters were killed during clashes with the police were killed.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia straight to break down?</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the last ten years it was one of the most sturdy countries of Africa, a solid allies of the West with a fast growing economy."</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months protests against the government the country and spread itself more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week stormy thousands of people on the streets and slowed fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The answer of the government was merciful according to human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses gave to that policemen were shot on zig inarmed protesters and killed.</seg>
<seg id="11">"in resume videos about the protests, probably from the last or beginning of this year, they show young people with sticks while these were forced to make a handstand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN-authority for human rights now demands an incoming investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to hold this country and will even become more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project manager of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group. "</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populated country of Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and secret services are closely related to Ethiopia, to fight terrorist over the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, get so much Western help."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia economy expanded in considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new pendant in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">"roads are usually quiet, safe and clean."</seg>
<seg id="19">"even if Ethiopia was anything but a role model for democracy - human rights organisations, the oppression led by the government - the opposition in the country was limited, whereby dichair was effective to silence."</seg>
<seg id="20">"many were sent to exile or to the prison, killed or driven into the expanse of the desert."</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you underpress people and do not have any other options except to protesting it breaks it out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central-Ethiopien. "</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protestates.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protestates.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that everything from the ground utilization up to the worrity with respect to the power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">"after a further critical election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of Parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time, the tensions rise along the border with Eritrea; a struggle for this jagged, controversial line demanded in June hundreds of life."</seg>
<seg id="28">"analyst advocates that separatists like the Oromo Liberation front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which were more or less confiscated in recent years, the turmoil sequences."</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of the bitterness after years of age before himself is hidden under the surface now exploding.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first appears harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only in recent years, many Ethiopia were able to communicate via social media, since billigible smartphones have become more and more common and the internet services were improved."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government keeps access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via Internet-Proxies, who conceal them."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopian gave them that they gathered themselves to proteins.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there are more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnies in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not a natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"for eons, the Amharas, who come from ether mainly Christian highlands, in politics and economy, while they exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims are living and living in flat landscape."</seg>
<seg id="37">But even this is changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are there to co-ordinate under a screen, said Mulatus Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos."</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests took place in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which are about 6 percent of the population and that is dominant in the military, in the secret services, trade and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the rest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr. Meles, a former vine leader, was up to his death in a non-condition of the disease in 2012 17 years in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was regarded as tactical genius, a man who could think about corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly versed to unify the signs of dissatisfaction and assignation to make opponents and make them unharmful.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the current regime is lacking in this fundamental event," said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst. "</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ethiopia, new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen to take the position of Mr Meles."</seg>
<seg id="47">"unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of Nordäthiopiens, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analyst say that he does not enjoy the trust of the Tigray controlled security services.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time that Ethiopia was able to have such a rebellion, 2005, after thousands of elections were protested, according to the fact of analyst apparently by the government and subsequently stolen."</seg>
<seg id="51">"during the following rains, many protesters were killed, even if there were less than in the last months and that time of the unrest went relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"evolutionary Ethiopia, leader for their visionary infrastructure plans, such as the new pendlers, as well as for their measurable advances in the poverty abatement."</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this does not prevent the intensification of the internal Missionary Government of the Ethiopical government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"in the last month, protesters in Gondar, an amharian city, of Tigray-managed businesses and the hate toward the Tigray is becoming increasingly active in social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analyst say that protests are the US and other western allies in a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American government used Ethiopia as a basis for Dronenflights over the neighboring Somalia, even though she recently told that she has closed this base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"during the West clearly wants to support democracy, he will not want his allies in an already volatile area."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," "said Mr. Abdi," "is a very thin-conwalk."</seg>

<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Grönlandhaie mostly come in winter to finish.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return after an investigation on board the boat Sanna into the sea.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and swims with a 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to the present day.</seg>
<seg id="6">Grönlandhaie have only been received with 150 years of offspring.</seg>

<seg id="8">"only when it comes up, accelerates the five meters long animal on satte 2,6 km / h - and is half as fast as a rob."</seg>
<seg id="9">This of long-term lifestyle seems to be a sponsorship for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal" Science "in any case of a Greenland, the 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="11">"insanity, Alexander Scheuerlein from Max-Planck-Institute for demographic research in Rostock, this lifestyles, which means for vertebrates a world record."</seg>
<seg id="12">"although the evolutionsbiologist has already assumed for long, that Greenland are old."</seg>
<seg id="13">Only lacking the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Grönlandhaie are difficult to observe, finally they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the thin populated coast of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen."</seg>
<seg id="15">"because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually dive at the surface mostly only in winter."</seg>
<seg id="16">About the lifestyles of Greenland do researchers know accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="17">"your time empowerment, when they fly six animals to six animals with a transmitter."</seg>
<seg id="18">"prey make this sharks nevertheless: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a rob, another had the jawbone of a young iron."</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly jars they sleep animals or patrol at the bottom of the Iron and seek Kadaver which are torn from higher water flow down.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Julius Nielsen and his colleagues were now examined 28 Grönlandhaie, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in Greenland as well as Beifang from the depth of the North Atlantic."</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long while the largest 502 centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="22">"to determine the age of the animals, analysed them with the carbon-14 method the liners of the Haie."</seg>
<seg id="23">"this centre of the eyelash is already created before the birth of the sharks, which contained in the proteins are no longer renewed."</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had strikingly much carbon-14 in the liners.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s than nuclear weapons try larger quantities of this radioactive carbohydrates in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">"in the case of 220 centimeters in the third-smallest animal, the liners contained a low excess of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons, it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="27">"all major Grönlandhaie had normal carbon-14-quantities, which arises in the atmosphere through cosmic radiation in the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in fact, the carbon-14-clock showed a 493 centimeters long Greenland an age of 335 years, during the record shark with 502 centimeters even 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that Greenland-females get only when it grew up when they are longer than four meters, was known."</seg>
<seg id="30">"now, the researchers of the length could arrange an age."</seg>
<seg id="31">"as one of the animals with 392 centimeters, probably at the threshold of intercourse and his age was determined with 156 years, Grönlandhaie with the multiplication obviously at least one and a half centuries."</seg>
<seg id="32">Also this is likely to be catchord for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">"that such methusaleme live mainly in icy waters, is no coincidence."</seg>
<seg id="34">"also the previous record-holder, a 211 years old Grönlandwal, in whose bacon at the neck was a 120 years old Harpunenspitze, was caught before Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="35">Through the low temperatures often the body of the living animals runs on austerity.</seg>
<seg id="36">They are mature later - and they slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">"to keep in cold water warm, the animals are often particularly large."</seg>
<seg id="38">"because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal heat."</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much greater than with one gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">A further advantage: you have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should focus on that as early as possible as many descendants," explains the evolutionsbiologist Scheuerlein. "</seg>

<seg id="3">"according to a current survey of malware-defense, Malwarebytes under 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany were 40 percent of respondents companies over the past twelve months at least once, partly several victims of an attack with Erpresser software."</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany almost 20 percent of companies were already the aim of a Ransomware-extortion.</seg>
<seg id="5">"40 per cent of the victims paid by the perpetrators, to be able to use the systems and data to be used again."</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize their Erpresser software according to the observations of Malwarebytes on assignments in software network.</seg>
<seg id="7">"they are successful there, the potential of avoiding ransom is clearly higher than in private users."</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a frightening fast evolution of pollutors," explains Malwarebytes-boss Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world." "</seg>
<seg id="9">"in 2008, most Malwareprograms were still designed to send advertising to advertising."</seg>
<seg id="10">Then we discovered the perpetrators Erpressant software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">"first, private useless the goal, but the change to company attacks was frightening quickly in the past few months."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Ransomware works for a simple pattern: once on the computer of a Opfers, they search for unlong changed files such as Word-, Excel- or database files as well as for archives of pictures and videos."</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encodes Ransomware and Deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then the software presents the demands of the pressors.</seg>
<seg id="15">"to get the end-key code to the files, the victims must be money - mostly in the form of Cryptonutrition bitcoin."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but where private use is the personal photo database on the game, it goes for companies to make sensitive customers data or project databases without which the production breastfeeding."</seg>
<seg id="17">"accordingly, higher, the damage caused by a ransomware."</seg>
<seg id="18">"22 percent of the German firms in German companies established by Ransomware, 13 percent, even had to intervomiting the business activity, in case of a case were people in life."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Germany already several hospitals were victims of attacks, whose patients may be threatened by the loss of nurses."</seg>
<seg id="20">"we always tell the victims always: pays not, it promotes only the problem," explains Kleczynski. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"but 80 to 90 percent of companies who pay, get their data again."</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers it is difficult to reject the demand for perpetrators in the operation of perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hacker again know this and try to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">"in a current study, the Security forscher of F-Secure uses the user interfaces and contact the result: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money."</seg>
<seg id="25">"you declare your sacrifice by chat, as they can pay by Bitcoin, free access websites or decrypt for example files."</seg>
<seg id="26">"and, individuals after payments of a few hundred euros, businesses have to pay hard to negotiate and five-digs sums to get their data unencrypted."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in view of the potential high and relatively riskless profits from the Ransomware-extortion, the hacker become more professional and share the work, explains the conceptuperte Chester Wisniewski from the Antivirus provider Sophos:" a single person can write a ransomware about within a week. "</seg>
<seg id="28">"however, it is probable that it is three or four people."</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their pollutors then in the form of a software building on the actual Erpressers.</seg>
<seg id="30">"the existing malware kits created by the malware, consulting and additional tools for a unique, firm price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars."</seg>
<seg id="31">"included in delivery is an adaptation tool such as smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski. "</seg>
<seg id="32">The Erpressers are then looking for further hacker to spread the fresh purchased software under the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">"thus, one of the forums in the underground, buy the set of a criminals and commissions, to install the software on as many PCs as possible."</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is made per infizated calculator.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually to bear the criminals, then spammers with the spread," says Wisniewski. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"meanwhile, the risk of Ransomware is now known by many companies that ensure their data better."</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 per cent of companies in the Malwarebytes survey will trust in the Malwarebytes survey with a file-back-ups and scannersoftware.</seg>
<seg id="39">"accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies."</seg>
<seg id="40">"when the encryption of data alone is not sufficient threat to successful revenue, the perpetrators instead, with the release of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing," explains Malwarebytes-Chef Marcin Kleczynski. "</seg>
<seg id="41">"with this, the potential potentials depending on the type of data is still a lot higher than before."</seg>
<seg id="42">"in future, the perpetrators will now take entirely new goals in the internet of things on the grain."</seg>
<seg id="43">"at the Hackerconference Defcon demonstrated safety, as they could have received the thermostat on the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="44">"in the middle of winter, the activation of such a block of heating could be quite worth a ransom."</seg>

<seg id="2">"in the evening, one gets forever around, at night you just sit down, in the morning it is far from the tweckerring to think not to sleep."</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>

<seg id="5">How do you do sleep problems or insomnia?</seg>
<seg id="6">"there are several forms of insomnia, and there may be many causes of underlying causes, Hans-Günter Weeß, Member of the Board of Directors of the German Society for sleeping research and sleep medicine."</seg>

<seg id="8">"just sleeping a lot of people as unsatisfactory, or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, Member of the Executive Board in the German homey association with practice in the lower Saxon Varel."</seg>

<seg id="12">Not rarely is the insigning expression of another illness.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early awaken is mainly in depression frequently," says Weeß. "</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that various factors exist.</seg>
<seg id="15">"for example, who has an opaque incident can be bad, wacht every two to three hours and begins to greet you about all-day problems and take care of salute, there is a example."</seg>
<seg id="16">"this leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible."</seg>
<seg id="17">From when to go to a doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">"if you do not sleep well over a period of a month at least three nights per week, and on the day the doctor should go to the doctor."</seg>

<seg id="26">"for examining in the sleep laboratories, for example with snoring with respiratory sufferings, in sleep-waking or if one does not find the cause of a dizzling, explains Fietze."</seg>
<seg id="27">To prepare for the examination you should not have to prepare.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only please do not make menus," "says Fietze."</seg>
<seg id="30">After cabling you go to bed in bed.</seg>
<seg id="31">"besides the electrodes in the body there is a nasal brace, a chest strap, and a frosted at the finger."</seg>

<seg id="34">There are quite many positions on which one can put for better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Weeß count on: regular insens- and ascension times, not too long in bed, on the day do not sleep, not remote to sleep, alcohol meiden and at night do not start at the watch - then you immediately start to count, and that is quite and not conducive."</seg>

<seg id="8">"after on 22 June the rooms were vacated on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police troops, patrolling over 30 to 40 officials and three teams on site, block parts of the street and held visitors to enter the house with the number 94."</seg>

<seg id="37">People would have to develop a belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">"so we need offers such as sports, contacts with locals and above all courses."</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So you can also jump to administration and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="41">"it is central that the refugees get the feeling, they are welcome in Germany and welcome."</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"you must explain the refugees that it takes time and it can only be able to cross the time, for example with language courses."</seg>

<seg id="57">Needs Germany a upper limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">"this question is clear to answer, fail to politics."</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually it is unfair to place them helpers on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we are not yet arrived, where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle. "</seg>
<seg id="61">"no new refugees, that would be able to relax."</seg>
<seg id="62">"Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbane is even better to integrate, the past people have reasonable."</seg>
