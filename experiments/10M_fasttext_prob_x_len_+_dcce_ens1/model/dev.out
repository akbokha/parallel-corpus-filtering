the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not very friendly .
the two wanted to discuss the implementation of the international agreement as well as via T@@ eher@@ an dest@@ abil@@ ising activities in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the sake , it should also be a conflict with the Palestinians and discussed two @-@ state solution . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is e@@ ager for years .
Washington critic@@ ises the continual settlement of Israel and th@@ rows Net@@ any@@ ahu def@@ ending the desire in the peace process .
through the success of Obama &apos;s deal with the Iranian nuclear program has deteri@@ or@@ ated the relationship of the two deteri@@ or@@ ated .
in March Net@@ any@@ ahu was on invitation of the Re@@ public@@ ans at the invitation of the Re@@ public@@ ans in front of the US Congress which was evaluated partly as an aff@@ ront to Obama .
&quot; the speech was not talking with Obama , a meeting had been rejected this with regard to the forthcoming election in Israel . &quot;
with a call is Professor to have shot his girlfriend
he &apos;s said in a cl@@ amation Professor Sh@@ annon &apos;s character with a somewhat more trem@@ ble voice of the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house .
&quot; he &apos;s it &apos;s important to emphas@@ ize that his &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; is still living and probably excited , and he said , The family contacts of dead woman could be found on the mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; inside the house the officers took the corp@@ se of Amy Pr@@ ent@@ iss and a hand @-@ written note , I wanted to do it back , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who loved me ever . &quot;
&quot; he was no indication of the fact that he had travel@@ ed in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland , Mississippi , taught , already 300 miles to the school grounds , E@@ than Schmidt , who was shot at the door to his office and killed . &quot;
Delta State University Pol@@ i@@ Bran@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that he made the lust@@ ful emergency room at some point .
&quot; until the end of the day there was another death : Lamb , where the police took him away . &quot;
&quot; having a day after the shooting in the university , students and teachers , to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what he &apos;s motivated . &quot;
&quot; the details published by the investig@@ ators in both ends of the state , as well as what students and staff who knew him , helped him to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teachers . &quot;
students said that they were based on their teaching .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where he died , he did not tell the story of violence or a criminal country . &quot;
Schmidt himself had mentioned himself in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
&quot; both @-@ taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose teacher has 17 members , and many students attended courses of both . &quot;
at the same time there were some incl@@ inations to proble@@ matic behavi@@ ors .
&quot; he &apos;s pra@@ ised a student , Bran@@ don Be@@ a@@ vers , who &apos;s pra@@ ised , he also seemed a little excited and nervous , as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that the Lamb has told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
he &apos;s previously asked the Delta State University in order to pro@@ claim for health reasons and said that it has some health problem .
in this year he only taught two online courses .
&quot; recent changes in the employment policy of the university important that the promotion , for the Lamb so hard , for him would be no guarantee for an automatic way of creating as Assistant Professor . &quot;
&quot; university President William La@@ For@@ ge said , he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs . &quot;
these are questions that &apos;s no longer able to answer .
&quot; after the flight from the campus , the police took later on Lam@@ bs as he returned to Mississippi from Ark@@ ansas . &quot;
&quot; before he could be arrested , command@@ ing himself with a .@@ 38 Kal@@ iber , in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile in the south of his parents &quot; on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , said Washington County Cor@@ ons Meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car was still going on in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that he knew that he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
Lamb grew up in the area .
&quot; he &apos;s started his work at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a town with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught geography and ped@@ agog@@ y . &quot;
he gradu@@ ated in the spring in ped@@ agog@@ y .
&quot; one of the many years of friends in Lam@@ bs drew him as a smart , charis@@ matic and funny . &quot;
Carla H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when she met through joint friends .
&quot; she and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool older guy who tried a few years to teach her the guitar lu@@ de . &quot;
he was back at that time of women &apos;s black .
&quot; all the girls sh@@ ells when he was , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson subur@@ ban of Bran@@ don . &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ ent@@ iss were obviously a few time together .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; but there was no dipl@@ oma from a marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house , which is adjacent to a Ba@@ it in Gau@@ tier . &quot;
police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ ent@@ iss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were destroyed 15 years ago , but friends stayed there and had one daughter who was now 19 years old . &quot;
&quot; it was totally destroyed in the ground , &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en over his daughter . &quot;
her and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he did never meet , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that he was interested in music and played blues . &quot;
he &apos;s hit pr@@ un@@ iss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail raised three years ago both at a summer of year .
later they played together with one or another G@@ ig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings their own music .
Pr@@ ent@@ iss was a nur@@ se who worked for various companies .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a b@@ art@@ ender and sometimes amus@@ ement @-@ ordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak illuminated bar close to Gau@@ tier , said that he &apos;s Lamb and Pr@@ ent@@ iss Night at night 5 for the last time after he made his guitar@@ - and harmon@@ ica ac@@ king ended up in front of a shar@@ pen@@ ing audience . &quot;
there was no signs of that anything un@@ anim@@ ously agreed .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said . &quot;
we were in the fr@@ aming and j@@ ok@@ ing with each other .
I mean they both had a good sense of she@@ ar .

&quot; UN @-@ boss , there is no military solution in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Secretary General B@@ an K@@ i @-@ Moon says , his answer to Russia has increased military support for Syria : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; &quot; of nearly five years in conflict , and more weapons are consumed violence and mis@@ ery for millions of people . &quot;

&quot; B@@ an told a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to discuss the foreign ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , the United Kingdom and France - at the end of the session of the General Assembly still to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
he de@@ pl@@ ed that the rebellion in the Council and the regional powers and the regional powers to make this situation in@@ solu@@ ble .

8 envelop@@ ing values that show that Donald Tru@@ mp is seriously to take .
some have tried to cast him as a flop to fire mark .
others have taken him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
&quot; however , no matter how some re@@ public@@ ans attempt to drag Donald Tru@@ mp from the upper ran@@ ces in survey@@ s , it has not worked . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national actors showed Donald Tru@@ mp in the two @-@ dig@@ it area , and some start to serious about what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of real estate Mog@@ adi@@ s . &quot;
of course it is too early in the election period .
no claims that Tru@@ mp will probably gain the re@@ publ@@ ican nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts say that at that time in 2011 Rick Per@@ r@@ ys had been given a tour at the rising Herman C@@ ain , and was one of whom also won the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he might fight in a general election .
&quot; but foreign groups such as Je@@ b Bus@@ hs Super P@@ AC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth can now recognize tru@@ m@@ ps per@@ sever@@ ance and begin to flow their dollars to cr@@ ashing it . &quot;
here are some current engines which indicate that the real estate site Mo@@ gu@@ l is not only a temporary phase :
Tru@@ m@@ ps Anim@@ ations have been around 180 degrees .
&quot; shortly before Donald Tru@@ mp has announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University showed that only two of ten re@@ public@@ ans saw the real estate site mo@@ l posit@@ ively . &quot;
until the middle of July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
&quot; now , six of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tru@@ mp . &quot;
some three out of ten are saying they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in the early states .
a qu@@ ag@@ ile @-@ vot@@ ing in Iowa has found last week that 60 percent of re@@ public@@ ans have a good opinion of Tru@@ mp .
two thir@@ ds of the GO@@ P @-@ voters would be happy with Tru@@ mp as candidates .
&quot; in a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the Re@@ public@@ ans , they would either be &quot; &quot; thrilled &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; satisfied &quot; &quot; if Tru@@ mp was nominated . &quot;
&quot; only two of them say they would be &quot; angry , &quot; if he would be the cont@@ est@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm such as Tru@@ mp ( 43 percent say they were &quot; &quot; enthusiastic &quot; &quot; vs. 40 percent , who say the same about Tru@@ mp ) . &quot;
the next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of the re@@ publ@@ ican voters said that they were &quot; &quot; diss@@ atis@@ fied &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; angry , &quot; &quot; if Je@@ b Bush , the favorite of the Est@@ abl@@ ishment , was the candidate . &quot;
a majority of the Re@@ public@@ ans sees Tru@@ m@@ ps temper@@ ament as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tru@@ mp is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and off@@ ensive statements , 52 percent of those containing the Re@@ public@@ ans of Irish voters , that the real temper@@ ament was the right temper@@ ament to a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number is in the first sel@@ ector of the nation , which contains the same 52 percent of the Re@@ public@@ ans , that he has the same 52 percent of the Re@@ public@@ ans , that he has the personality for a command@@ ing , according to the Qu@@ inn@@ ip@@ iac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , 44 percent that he did not have the personality to lead effectively his duty , and almost six out of 10 Independent saying that his temper@@ ament is not in the White House P@@ asse , so ABC / post . &quot;
Re@@ publ@@ ican voters get into the idea .
&quot; when they set up their money , re@@ publ@@ ican voters for real . &quot;
&quot; if they are asked to all who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , say after a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C , last week , four out of ten that Tru@@ mp is the best bet . &quot;
that &apos;s a change from the time when four out of ten end of July did their money to Je@@ b Bush .
complete re@@ publication : GO@@ P voters in the past had not the clear@@ est crystal ball .
&quot; at this time last cycle , four out of ten re@@ public@@ ans had thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination over only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , a variety of GO@@ P @-@ voters &apos;s Tru@@ m@@ ps campaign can be impl@@ au@@ sible . &quot;
&quot; even if the Re@@ publ@@ ican have gathered around another candidate , Tru@@ mp is still taking almost every day . &quot;
&quot; some experts point out that the sh@@ attered field is likely to be guided to Tru@@ m@@ ps leadership , while the anti @-@ Tru@@ mp support is distributed to more than a dozen of other candidates . &quot;
&quot; but a survey of the Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September indicates that in a hyp@@ oth@@ et@@ ical head @-@ on @-@ head @-@ race between Tru@@ mp and most other re@@ publ@@ ican candidates , Tru@@ mp was the majority of res@@ ur@@ istic support . &quot;
&quot; in front of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points lead , prior to Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , front of Je@@ b Bush 19 points and finally before the border Paul , John Kas@@ ich and Chris Christ@@ ie 33 points . &quot;
there is a head @-@ to @-@ head @-@ race with Ted Cruz .
the only cont@@ est@@ ant that strikes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would overt@@ ake the business@@ man with 19 points in a hyp@@ oth@@ et@@ ical head @-@ to @-@ race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald @-@ Tru@@ mp fans says that they have made their opinion .
&quot; a new survey of CB@@ S / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters , they support Tru@@ mp , say that they have made their votes . &quot;
&quot; of course , a lot of happen to change this , and no one can truly say , never change the mind . &quot;
46 percent said that they leave the door open to other candidates .
&quot; yet Tru@@ m@@ ps is most powerful competition at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon , Ben Car@@ son , but voters said that they have made their opinion , are twice as common for Tru@@ mp . &quot;
six of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans say that they agree with Tru@@ mp on the subject of immigration .
&quot; since then Donald Tru@@ mp was in his election campaign against two months immig@@ rants from Mexico &quot; Ver@@ gewalt@@ iger , &quot; was the immigration and ful@@ crum at the public discour@@ se at 2016 . &quot;
some are worried that the bom@@ b@@ astic expressions of Tru@@ mp are crucial H@@ isp@@ ano @-@ Americans from the Re@@ publ@@ ican party and is cor@@ rupted the re@@ orientation efforts .
but after the new ABC / post survey conducted by Monday six of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans that they agree with Tru@@ mp for questions of immigration .
&quot; so long as immigration on the lim@@ el@@ ight remains , there will also be Donald Tru@@ mp , apparently . &quot;
the fru@@ stration of the government clim@@ bs up new high@@ s .
&quot; by Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son , about half of the support of re@@ publ@@ ican voters , mainly due to their out@@ sider @-@ status . &quot;
six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days survey of ABC / Post ; they prefer to have a political out@@ sider for someone with government experience .
and they are also angry to Washington .
&quot; a survey of Des Mo@@ ines Register / Bloom@@ berg in Iowa two weeks shows that three of four Iowa party re@@ public@@ ans are frustr@@ ated about the re@@ public@@ ans in the Congress , 54 percent &quot; diss@@ atis@@ fied &quot; and 21 percent . &quot;
Munich , Sylt and Co . : the five exclusive residential areas in Germany &quot;
&quot; here in the Hob@@ o mountain road , there is the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the North Sea . &quot;
in the street there is a square meter of a riding @-@ poster in the average 7@@ 3.@@ 300 euros .
&quot; in Sylt the offer of objects is naturally limited , therefore it is said in the study - so that is why the high price . &quot;
a new study shows in which particular runs a square meter most cost .
&quot; of course , 18,@@ 70 Euro per square metres for a student dig@@ de in Munich are not really enough . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to Germany top residential areas , one of the prices comes like pe@@ an@@ uts . &quot;
the real Estate service provider Angel &amp; Völ@@ s has published a top @-@ ran@@ ked of the most exclusive German living sites - with square met@@ er@@ ors in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .

Champions League : Bavaria @-@ Trau@@ m@@ start thanks to Müller and Götz@@ e
execut@@ ables in Piraeus . Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller just has a run .
a happy hit by Thomas Müller gave the FC Bayern the way to a served 3 : 0 at the Pi@@ ak@@ os Piraeus - then ran it .
a sovereig@@ n start of the Champions League season .
the World Champion Thomas Müller and Mario Götz@@ e have taken the FC Bayern in the Hex@@ enk@@ ler of Piraeus a dream start into the &quot; mission of Milan . &quot;
the team of Trainer P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won her no@@ ct@@ urn@@ al in the Champions League at the Greek record Master Olympi@@ ak@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Mü@@ ll@@ ers Double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and id@@ ols ( 8@@ 9 ) worthy with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ f@@ th Star@@ ter@@ fol@@ g in Serie is to be the first step towards the fin@@ als on 28 May 2016 in Italy where Guardi@@ ola is finally to bring home to the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich .
Müller received from his 28@@ th Birth@@ day in the Champions League for Bavaria &apos;s gu@@ er@@ ous help from Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Tor@@ sten Roberto , who would pass one as a fl@@ ank sound@@ ing of the world &apos;s master . &quot;
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate it , &quot; had Bavaria @-@ captain Philipp L@@ ah@@ m in front of the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ akis @-@ stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ blood@@ ed fans - and the mun@@ ich held word . &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated idea without sh@@ iny .
&quot; Pi@@ re@@ aus had won his most recent six festivals in the Royal Club , including renowned clubs like Manchester United , At@@ lé@@ t@@ ico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
2011 Mar@@ bled here also Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
&quot; however , Bavaria , in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up @-@ Du@@ els with Greek teams did not want to be the next victim . &quot;
&quot; they went mut@@ ig ran , with their off@@ ensive effort but often to einf@@ all works . &quot;
the attacks have often been guided by playing on Link@@ ed@@ os Douglas Costa Rica who came against the former Br@@ uns@@ wick Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
&quot; Müller made more fortunate enough to the right , than his fl@@ ank from the right hemisph@@ ere in the upper left corner of To@@ re@@ ck . &quot;
in the 6@@ 7th minute the world champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities in half one had Robert Le@@ wand@@ owski .
&quot; first , as Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ St@@ ür@@ ler Ide@@ ye Brown hit the head of Poland from the line ( 26 ) . &quot;
&quot; then by director , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto with the knee par@@ ed ( 35@@ th ) . &quot;

&quot; recently , Guardi@@ ola served a ball@@ ett with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng who made it well . &quot;
Mario Hum@@ e , after mus@@ cular problems back in the box , sat out there . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ WC has only given light after the finish building , Sport@@ pre @-@ standing Matthias S@@ ammer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; who wants to make something else out of it , this is bad . &quot;
&quot; also on the first change , Guardi@@ ola was decided against him when he brought K@@ ings@@ ley Com@@ an for the int@@ ens@@ ile Le@@ wand@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) . &quot;
&quot; id@@ ols came late to Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( 7@@ 6 ) , and made 13 minutes later everything clear , by El@@ f@@ metres Müller made a dr@@ unk . &quot;
in front of the game the stadium was come to Kra@@ w@@ allen .
&quot; after a smaller group of some of some pre@@ mi@@ ums of Bavaria &apos;s fans in their audience @-@ blo@@ ated , the p@@ endants were apparently faced with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces stood out and went with stro@@ kes against the Munich &apos;s followers . &quot;

it is not clar@@ ified how far smoking is also increased the risk of car@@ ies .
&quot; people who heard with smoking could reduce their risk but within a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot;

the contro@@ ver@@ si@@ al private appl@@ iance for disputes between companies and states are supposed to be replaced by a more transparent system which corresponds significantly more traditional dishes in its functioning .
&quot; we want to furn@@ ish a system to trust the citizens , &quot; declared the competent EU Commissioner Cec@@ ilia Malm@@ ström during the performance . &quot;
the Swe@@ de has pre @-@ order the proposal as European negoti@@ ating positions in the free trade agreements with the USA .
the German government announced support .
&quot; by TTI@@ P , the largest free @-@ trade area of the world will arise at 800 million people . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the plans to re@@ forming the current arbit@@ ration proceedings are specifically held that the EU states and the US have shared independent judges for a new investment court . &quot;
&quot; they are supposed to come from the EU , the US and third countries . &quot;
it is for the first time also a second instance .
it would allow it to rise against jud@@ g@@ ments .
&quot; up to date , the proce@@ eds contain among each other to arbit@@ rators , an advoc@@ ate possibility of their jud@@ g@@ ments against their jud@@ gements . &quot;
&quot; in the discussion of the past months , it became clear that citizen of the old IS@@ DS system in terms of fair@@ ness and justice does not trust , commented Malm@@ ström . &quot;
she wants to continue on an Internation@@ ales Area Court dedicated long @-@ term .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there could then also be clar@@ ified in the example of any dispute between Chinese companies and EU states . &quot;
the most important part of large @-@ concer@@ tos ( IS@@ DS ) are considered one of the main reasons for the big resistance in Europe against TTI@@ P .
&quot; the traditional arbit@@ ration signs are critic@@ ised by oppos@@ ers as a way of parallel just@@ ifications of the tax@@ pay@@ ers , to di@@ vor@@ ced national laws , or low@@ ering a reduction of consumer and environmental standards . &quot;
in first comments anti @-@ TTI@@ P organisations such as Camp@@ act reported the proposals of the European Commission as in@@ adequate .
&quot; most importantly , it is not intended to apply for the trade @-@ free trade agreement with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) . &quot;
German Economic State Secretary Matthias Mach@@ n@@ ig ( SPD ) signed the plans on the other as great progress .
the Commission considered important points to reform the Federal Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel in the spring with other EU retailers .
the old system of private bit@@ ration may be from the table .
also the French government greeted the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European business @-@ band Business@@ Europe war@@ ned that exam@@ ining the cl@@ erg@@ ents of the economy by too many new rules .
especially small and medium companies could be dis@@ advant@@ aged .
&quot; when talking about free trade agreements TTI@@ P ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be completed , remained un@@ clear on Wednesday . &quot;
the negotiations will run since mid 2013 .
but the issue of Invest@@ or@@ protection has not yet been discussed with the US .
&quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year . &quot;
this date is considered no longer acceptable .
Del@@ ik@@ ater Folk from Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens in Hamburg
&quot; eleven years ago , Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens on the stage at the Köl@@ ner Prime Club ( today : Luxor ) . &quot;
&quot; next to him there is a fli@@ p@@ chart , which is the tran@@ spl@@ ant model@@ ed on the picturesque US @-@ state Michigan with felt @-@ pen . &quot;
&quot; the entire audience , about 40 persons , is almost taken for Stev@@ ens presentation . &quot;
&quot; he tells the basis of various places that he records and again on the map , which he talks about his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ously and tender @-@ arranged songs . &quot;
where they came from and how it looks there in his homeland .
since then Stev@@ ens proves to be very wonder@@ fully creative mistakes .
&quot; with the 2003 published and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State &quot; appear cle@@ ver@@ ly compos@@ ing songs that can turn out harmon@@ iously very close to American folk in the late six@@ ties , but at any time went to mad at their time . &quot;
&quot; it arises in the smells , &quot; Michigan &quot; would be the first part of a dar@@ ing series : each of the 50 U.S. states should be discussed . &quot;
&quot; however , there appeared in 2004 and near the &quot; &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; and it breaks a positive certain expectations . &quot;

&quot; without a word to set up the audience , the group plays an excellent musician through the wide shared album . &quot;
&quot; from the audience you hear : the talk is &quot; &quot; op@@ ul@@ enter &quot; , &quot; and you can thus throw away the &quot; record &quot; at the same time . &quot;

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns Deb@@ ate at the Prime Minister of the Prime Minister
since his election Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns de@@ debut at the Prime Minister of the Prime Minister with voltage
the new Labour Chairman Jerem@@ y Cor@@ b@@ yn is meant to give his debut at the Prime Minister of the Prime Minister and came to David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn will rise up in order to ask for the first of his six pre @-@ given questions just after noon but his performance from the media is likely to be checked and the labor market is checked .
he called for &quot; less theater and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could sk@@ ip some meetings to leave them to the colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr Cor@@ by@@ te &apos;s leadership as she comes to his appointment as a member of the Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ ab@@ inet@@ ts and after his speech at the TU@@ C @-@ Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
&quot; meanwhile , the decision of the Labour President , on Tuesday during the singing of the National hy@@ m@@ ne during a commem@@ oration ceremony , the 75@@ th anniversary of the Battle of Britain is pro@@ vo@@ iced in silence , crit@@ ique of a number of T@@ ory &apos;s pro@@ vo@@ ys and is at the centre of several chan@@ sons @-@ stories in the newspapers . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ no decision , not to sing the National hy@@ m@@ n , has drawn attention to himself &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn said he had &quot; &quot; respect@@ ful of silence &quot; &quot; and he tried the &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of Royal Air Force in the air stroll around England &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ ab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told in the BBC Two @-@ night program , he said to sing the Labour Office , the National hy@@ m@@ ne , &quot; independently &quot; of his belief that the monarchy could be abol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; nearly a dozen of shadow ministers have changed to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ te &apos;s top team , and they were called on differences in the economy , defense and foreign policy , while less than a six@@ teenth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as a leader . &quot;
&quot; the British correspond@@ ent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also within the Labour &quot; &quot; st@@ acking &quot; &quot; while Mr Cor@@ by@@ no utter@@ ances at the position of the European Union and the bo@@ unds in winn@@ ings . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn said the TU@@ C @-@ Conference that Labour Ch@@ ur said to remove the whole idea of a limitation total .
&quot; later Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ working and pensions Minister that the Party &quot; became very clear , &quot; that it is only opposed to block com@@ part@@ ition@@ ers to reduce the limitation of 26.@@ 000 £ to 23,@@ 000 £ . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn is going to be the fifth labor leader , David Cameron , since he has joined the T@@ ory boss , over the last decade over the Disp@@ atch box . &quot;
&quot; the Labour Chair which promised another polit@@ ician , says that he gave the &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ s@@ our@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr. Cameron and gave him more than 3@@ 0,000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; the Isl@@ ington North MP told that the question of the Prime Minister is too con@@ front , and that he will perform both &quot; &quot; skill &quot; &quot; and the fight with counter@@ hooks , and to concentrate on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and challenges for young people . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn said that Angela Eagle , the shadow of economic Ministers has represented him if he is not participating - for example when Mr Cameron comes abroad . &quot;
&quot; he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues sometimes gr@@ asp the word and that he did John Ber@@ cow , the spokes@@ person of the home country , to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he was leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron that he wanted to remove himself from the policy in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le The@@ Theatre , &quot; which is often linked to the conversation of the Prime Minister . but a few years later he fe@@ ared that he failed to him . &quot;
&quot; when they first sent in the year 1990 in the television , the question@@ er was considered with the Prime Minister as the ruler of a driver and his position among its parliamentary sc@@ ep@@ ic , although critics have become a caric@@ ature and require further reforms . &quot;

cash cash starts floor @-@ stand campaign for com@@ bating al@@ di@@ - di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea
Met@@ ering is trying to protect the i@@ GA branches in front of an Al@@ di @-@ essay in South Australia and Western Australia .
foods @-@ wholes@@ alers Met@@ cash has started a floor stand campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; while Al@@ di prepared the opening of two sales centers and first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year , Met@@ als and I@@ GA super@@ markt@@ es their relations with local food suppliers and build the brand I@@ GA by ma@@ instre@@ am marketing and marketing over the social media , as well as events such as Adelaide @-@ Show . &quot;
&quot; I@@ GA dealer and suppliers jump on board , with brands like ice manufacturers S@@ immo from D@@ uns@@ borough , who distributed in I@@ GA &apos;s stores and Laden@@ burg , the discounted tickets for the South Australian Football l@@ iga are sold to loyal clients . &quot;
&quot; it is expected to be a substitute for further details of its defence strategy on 29 September , when the wholesale distributor for food , alcohol and devices through its annual investors strategy . &quot;
there is a lot in the game since South Australia and Western Australia can take nearly 30 percent of Met@@ cas@@ hs I@@ GA profiles and generate higher earnings than Met@@ cas@@ hs I@@ GA network in the East states .
&quot; shopping in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ or@@ able provin@@ cial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in Western Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia in comparison to around 14 percent in East countries . &quot;
&quot; however , an@@ alysts such as Morgan Stanley that Al@@ di twelve months after opening its first markets around five percent of the food market in these two states is cut away and all existing artists , but mainly independently from purchases . &quot;
&quot; according to a report published in this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stanley that I@@ GA retailers will have to get $ million sales per year and will cash up to $ 250 million in the end of 2016 . &quot;
the pre@@ diction is based on the assumption that al@@ di in the next year 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA are opened and had a turnover of 500 million $ and 600 million in each market .
&quot; the loss in food and food store and at the amounts on Met@@ cas@@ hs , high fix@@ ture can be around 13 million dollars at interest and taxes , said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Met@@ ering Market shares in the east states , mainly of Al@@ di and CO@@ LES , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan gave that I@@ GA purch@@ as@@ ers are the most loyal . &quot;
Morgan Stanley assumes that Met@@ cas@@ hs are down sales and food shop at 3.8 per cent in 2016 and 2.9 percent in 2018 continues to reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 % by 2020 .
&quot; last week the leading Fond@@ manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , at a business dinner in Melbourne , that normally will take cash out of a decade . &quot;
pre @-@ cash loans to respond publicly to the comments by Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a committee member of Met@@ cash has been in contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
&quot; IG@@ As Market has been reduced by 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and income from Met@@ cas@@ hs , and food stores that has been powered by 43 percent , which is reflected by the operating level of training in equal pressure on sales and mar@@ gins . &quot;
&quot; however , the wholes@@ aler w@@ akes up and investing over 150 million $ , the prices of CO@@ LES and Wo@@ ol@@ in@@ ths about hundreds of products each week att@@ ug@@ g@@ hed and I@@ GA retailers in improving their stores by quick@@ er growing fresh foods and to provide better choice of private @-@ label foods . &quot;
&quot; Met@@ cas@@ hs main managing director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adap@@ tion and loading of charge to vig@@ or will be added and hop@@ ed that the wholes@@ aler may return in 2017 for the first time in four years back to another economic growth . &quot;
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis was supported by the President of the Australian Fr@@ ent Steve Heal@@ y
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis was rather praise as criticism for his behaviour .
&quot; Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis was one of the &quot; &quot; Kol@@ lat@@ er@@ al@@ sh@@ den &quot; &quot; in the shortest storm around his friend Nick Kir@@ gi@@ os and deserves to view the President of the Australian tennis b@@ ab , Steve Heal@@ y rather praise as criticism for his own behavior . &quot;
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ akis , the younger brother of the talented Du@@ os , is repeatedly called &quot; &quot; Special KS &quot; , &quot; by the inf@@ am@@ ous examination of Kyr@@ gi@@ os with St@@ an W@@ aw@@ r@@ ka at the Montreal Masters into the spot@@ light . &quot;
&quot; in a fier@@ y sequ@@ encer in Cincinnati &quot; &quot; Kok@@ kin@@ akis and his opponents Ryan Harrison would have to be separated from the refer@@ ee which Harrison was ex@@ ited : &quot; W@@ aw@@ rin@@ ka would have had fol@@ i@@ os , and I should propose the child . &quot;
&quot; as he recently seen , as he was recently seen a tennis sl@@ ay@@ er , after a cr@@ amp@@ f failed to have had a potential US Open victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , and was def@@ ended by Heal@@ y . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , compete with Sam Gr@@ oth to second place in the single case behind Bernard Tom@@ ic , the Davis Cup fin@@ als against the UK . &quot;
&quot; one thing about which I rather simply un@@ ere@@ ere , is the fact that after my view Than@@ asi a little into the dispute , &quot; &quot; said Heal@@ y . &quot;
&quot; he has broken off a bat , when he lost because of a cr@@ ack in the US Open , but he is not the first player who have broken off with herself , and I know Than@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of that . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he has in the US Open extremely well beh@@ ave , even among the quite pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Harrison , and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around it , he has a great family around it , and I believe he was treated a little too strict . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he fits into the team and so on , he has never trained a problem with the other players , he is working well in form , he is a very sturdy and mature young guy , and I believe he deserves to be judged by his own ear@@ ners . &quot;
&quot; Heal@@ y also supported the decision , Kyr@@ gi@@ os at the important decision @-@ decision that begins on Friday and he describes the &quot; &quot; sharing decision &quot; &quot; as the right one for all , but he saves the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term fixed part of the team . &quot;
&quot; firstly , we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition and not all the contro@@ ver@@ si@@ ders ( Kir@@ gi@@ os &#93; , &quot; said Heal@@ y . &quot;
&quot; I think that Nick felt very fast approaching how fe@@ ather and Murray . he asc@@ ends in the eyes of the public , and he gets a lot of bad mistakes and he deserves to give him the consequences of his action , where he can only think about it , and it is best for the crew and it is best for him . &quot;
European refuge@@ e crisis : Hungary explains the border and closes refugees back
&quot; Hungary explains the not@@ ions and bol@@ ted the South border with Serbia on Tuesday and kept all firmly , tried to stop illegal in the country . all with its purpose , to stop the infl@@ ux of migrants . &quot;
chaos followed by the border when hundreds of migrants were made up in an Niem@@ and@@ s@@ land and Serb@@ ian cler@@ k with rebellion .
people who fled before violence had escap@@ ed for a unknown time at a highway on the road between the two check@@ points of the countries and built themselves there .
but fru@@ itations went up .
&quot; the police hel@@ icopter above them sh@@ oven , sc@@ ented the migrants &quot; Op@@ ens the border ! &quot; and sm@@ elled ins@@ ults against Hungarian polic@@ eman . &quot;
some assigned food and water back .
&quot; Serbia Foreign Minister explained , it is &quot; unacceptable , &quot; that migrants would be returned from Hungary , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a colon@@ al sch@@ ades .
&quot; it will need to be held talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days , &quot; said Iv@@ ica Dac@@ ic in Prague . &quot;
the turbul@@ ence of the Hungarian @-@ Serb@@ ian border came a day after 28 @-@ Nations @-@ block at a contro@@ ver@@ si@@ al meeting in Brussels to make a common immigration policy in Brussels .
&quot; however , the ministers agreed to divide the responsibility for 4@@ 0,000 people who finally sought out their hope that finally - next month or until the end of the year - an agreement would suggest that the EU states would capture another 120@@ .@@ 000 refugees , among them also some from Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on Tuesday to discuss a special summit of the European Union to discuss the immig@@ rating crisis of the continent .
but Hungary however does not put its hopes for a balanced promotion of Brussels or its neighbours .
&quot; on Tuesday , there were more compet@@ ences in two southern regions authorities to cope more compet@@ ences to get out of the crisis , so that they could acceler@@ ate roads and asylum @-@ procedures . &quot;
&quot; the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country was also supporting the construction of a thorn @-@ wiring , along its border to Romania , to stop the infl@@ ux of migrants by the country - having finished a fence at the Serb@@ ian border . &quot;
&quot; CB@@ S News @-@ correspond@@ ent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even pris@@ ons were reported on the race , the sp@@ ine @-@ wire fence between Hungary and Serbia . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a significant Eng@@ pas@@ sport from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East for the entrance to the European Union . &quot;
&quot; Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban has passed on that most of the coming business people are looking for a better life and not war hel@@ pers which are entitled to protection - a view that is greatly in contradiction with other EU states , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws , which appeared around midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or damage the 4 @-@ meters ( 13 feet ) high fence to build the government along the southern border with Serbia , to a crime . these laws also lay up higher im@@ prison@@ ment for human traff@@ ick@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation caused by the mass migration , the Hungarian Government explains the emergency &quot; , &quot; said Government Zol@@ tan Kov@@ acs Re@@ porter in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal bound@@ ary limits is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must still tune up to the deployment of the military , who will be expected for next week , but re@@ porters from Associ@@ ated Press reported on the border with heavy armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs already day @-@ to @-@ day . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ org@@ y Bak@@ on@@ di , country &apos;s Security Council for Or@@ ban , said that authorities would cross 45 people when trying to cross the border , 15 others were already deeper into the country . &quot;
&quot; they come across , doing the fence , they are now in police attitudes and are acc@@ ustom@@ ed to the re@@ cting of criminal off@@ ences according to the new laws . &quot;
authorities are doing the fence quick to fix .
&quot; Hungarian officials closed two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia , after a draw p@@ agg@@ on with bar@@ bed @-@ wire to close the borders . &quot;
chaos conver@@ ts the most important bor@@ derland close to Ros@@ z@@ ke Hungary when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container to deal with the data of people and put on a crow@@ ds to move around there .
&quot; around 20 managed to come down , but thousands remained outside . &quot;
another group of migrants are block@@ ing the main motorway connection between Serbia and Hungary and told that they would be denied food and water until they arrive to Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s prot@@ agonist in front of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey
&quot; the former US Secretary of Hill@@ ary Clinton continues to hold a two @-@ dig@@ it lead in the democratic race at the nom@@ ination at the national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders is winning their opposite ground . &quot;
&quot; Clinton had the support of 47 percent of the democratic voters in the elections , while S@@ anders is in second place , with 27 percent increase ( increase by 17 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; Vice President Joe B@@ iden , who has not yet proclaimed whether for the pres@@ idential office , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic voters of the elections . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the start of the elections , most of the democratic voters said it is too early to say that their opinion is ab@@ iding what candidates they are supported . &quot;
but Clin@@ t supporters are more widespread in their choice than those of the other candidates .
&quot; since the CB@@ S @-@ News survey , Clinton had lost in a number of demo@@ graphic groups while S@@ anders achieved some wins . &quot;
Clinton is holding a great advantage in both women and moder@@ ates but this accus@@ ation is reduced .
your support in the men is considerably lower today and it is only with 5 points back .
&quot; Clinton &apos;s advantage with democratic voters less than 50 years has h@@ ated , and they are now at the same level . &quot;
Clinton had a big advantage through the older voters .
&quot; in the last month Clinton had Clinton had two @-@ day control at the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group . &quot;
&quot; about half of the democratic voters of the elections that they would like to support Clinton , if they were nominated by the Party . &quot;
&quot; a quarter would support them with some assistance , and another 15 percent would only support them because they are the can@@ did@@ acy . &quot;
six percent would not support them .
maybe not surprising that Clin@@ t new supporters are especially inspired by her .
&quot; the views are more mixed with those who do not support Clinton at the moment - only about a quarter would it insp@@ ire us . &quot;
&quot; as 48 per cent of the democratic voters said , Clinton had Clinton with enthusiasm , say less re@@ publ@@ ican voters regarding their nickname de@@ co@@ by Donald Tru@@ mp ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; if Clin@@ t sup@@ porter asked in an open question why they want them to be the nom@@ inee ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is a woman president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s supporters will also be mentioned in connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
approval to deal with problems and voters are also c@@ ited .
&quot; since the Vice President raises an potential for the pres@@ idential office to the Wa@@ ag@@ ony , 57 per cent of the democratic voters of the elections will see him in the race - although a third believes it should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic voters would be asked about who for the party would be their second election , B@@ iden is at the top . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s followers say more than half , that B@@ iden would not have their second choice right before S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; if B@@ iden is decided not to can@@ did not for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s lead to jump in front of S@@ anders in the race start to 30 points without taking it in the race . &quot;
&quot; five @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as can@@ did@@ acy with the best opportunities to vote , but this number is reduced by 78 per cent in the last month . &quot;
&quot; B@@ iden is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage of which he sees it as the &quot; select@@ able &quot; is asc@@ ended . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , on the question of what is more important for a candidate , call the voters questions about the voters . &quot;
&quot; similar to that last month , not a single democratic candidate or potential candidate to become acceptable to these voters of the def@@ ender as unacceptable . &quot;
&quot; the Democratic candidates or potential candidates bring good results to some major characteristics of the def@@ enders of the def@@ ences of their party . &quot;
&quot; we regard Clinton , S@@ anders and B@@ iden as honest and trust@@ worthy and trust@@ worthy with strong gu@@ esses . &quot;
&quot; B@@ iden is best shot at the three candidates at the best of honesty , while Clin@@ ash strength is the lead . &quot;
&quot; thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not think about him . &quot;
&quot; democratic voters in general are Clinton , S@@ anders and B@@ iden ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views . &quot;
with all these measurements about one quarter of the democratic voters no opinion of S@@ anders .
&quot; as questions concerning Hill@@ ary Clinton , to consent to a personal E @-@ mail address and a server during the term as the Secretary of the Customer are happy with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not affected their opinions overall . &quot;
but it is another story in the American public altogether .
&quot; half of the Americans now is diss@@ atis@@ fied with their explanation , as only about a third . &quot;
&quot; public opinion was in March , just after the problem came to light , split . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the e @-@ mail contro@@ vers@@ y had no impact on their overall opinions of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion of her still deteri@@ or@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; there are mainly Re@@ public@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say so their views of Clinton have been worse . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is regarded by the voters of their party as honest and trust@@ worthy , this is a problem for them among registered voters of a total : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May . &quot;
62 percent of those entitled to vote do not hold them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
&quot; at the same time , 55 percent of those entitled to vote have also been viewed Tru@@ mp as not honest and not trust@@ worthy . &quot;
Clinton and Tru@@ mp are also good notes for leadership .
&quot; from the six tested Candi@@ date , B@@ iden , Car@@ son and Bush are best with honesty . &quot;
&quot; a majority looks quite different from fran@@ k , but as with Car@@ son many do not think about him . &quot;
the mean ratio for the sample of 351 Democratic trans@@ duc@@ ers with the elections are 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves near Donald Tru@@ mp on
Ben Car@@ son is located in the latest survey of CB@@ S News / New York Times correctly behind Donald Tru@@ mp
&quot; upon the two candidates , half of the support of voters in the new survey , and others lose dramatically . &quot;
Re@@ publ@@ ican voters continued to support Tru@@ mp in big numbers . the support grows by 23 % in the last CB@@ S survey conducted by Fox News debate last month to 27 % in the survey of Tuesday .
but Car@@ son sp@@ ends in the same period from 6 % to 23 % .
the survey was also revealed that Car@@ son meets demo@@ graphic groups well and Tru@@ mp has over re@@ publ@@ ican voters with university education .
&quot; the rest of the field , except for Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Kas@@ ich , is available with Wiscons@@ ins or Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , which is at lowest rating of 10 % of the last month at now 2 % . &quot;
the former Florida Gover@@ nor Je@@ b Bush , former govern@@ or of Ark@@ ansas Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida @-@ Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio are located 6 % on the third place . &quot;
the bug@@ fix for the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Re@@ publ@@ ican voters in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was conducted in September .
&quot; the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey conducted last week , shows that Car@@ son increases in survey@@ s - he launch at 19 % support for the Re@@ public@@ ans , behind the Tru@@ mp with 32 % support . &quot;
the recent survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tru@@ mp significantly in front of Car@@ son .
&quot; with a look at one of the last week rising Car@@ son , Tru@@ mp found some tri@@ pl@@ ets for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ olog@@ ised to question tru@@ m@@ ps of faith in question . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tru@@ mp last Saturday during a campaigns in Iowa . &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the Eastern Mediterranean is currently warm up to 29 degrees warm .
&quot; if top thickness can be measured only in the distance , there is already a Trip on the Mediterranean Sea to find even more warm water . &quot;
a bathroom in the north or Baltic Sea is likely to be a more short pleasure with a maximum of 17 degrees .
&quot; some more go down into the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees , the water is in the North and Baltic Sea in this week , shares the Deutsche Wetter@@ dienst ( DW@@ D ) . &quot;
&quot; bathing temperatures , on the other hand , continues the Mediterranean : in the East it comes even up to 29 degrees . &quot;
&quot; in the Adriatic sea there are 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees . &quot;
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Br@@ otherhood has been charged with the death of a visit College .
&quot; almost two years , after a student was filed during a student ritual of a student network in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , M@@ ord@@ an may be filed against five people . &quot;
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College Pi @-@ Delta @-@ psi @-@ Br@@ otherhood &apos; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during a launch ritual in September 2013 brutal and hes@@ it@@ ated his transport to hospital which has contributed to his death to his death .
&quot; officials said that he had been loaded with a 30 @-@ pounds of back@@ pack full of sand , and att@@ empt@@ ed , while he tried to deal with a frozen field on a target . &quot;
Mr. Den@@ g compl@@ ained about head@@ aches ; then he fell unconscious around .
the members of the Pi @-@ Delta @-@ psi @-@ Br@@ otherhood does not smell the emergency number 911 while Den@@ g was impot@@ ent and wa@@ ited for an hour before they brought him into a hospital as the police .
&quot; however , they had the time to switch d@@ oves clothing to alle@@ vi@@ ate his symptoms at goo@@ g and Andy Men@@ g to catch the national president of the Br@@ otherhood , in order to bring advice , Br@@ ic@@ ef Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point the members began to hide @-@ utensils and set the welfare of the Br@@ otherhood , basically about the &quot; &quot; Michael Den@@ g &quot; , &quot; said Pol@@ i@@ ut@@ ef Wagner . &quot;
&quot; he could not revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning at his wo@@ unds . &quot;
&quot; according to an aut@@ op@@ al report , Den@@ g have repeatedly been filled with bl@@ unter power injury on head , h@@ ull and th@@ igh@@ s . &quot;
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the chic@@ ory of the Br@@ otherhood . at least a student die since 1970 each year at the chic@@ ane , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , who represents D@@ eng@@ s family , in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held ac@@ coun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe received an indi@@ ct@@ ment for the first five members for the first five members .
&quot; two @-@ und@@ und@@ thirty members of the Br@@ otherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with sham@@ an@@ ous attacks and formation of a criminal association . &quot;
&quot; we do not only want to be responsible for the parties involved , but if there is an organisation that is - officially or indirect - this is what we will also draw to account , &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the Baroque College is forbidden by the Br@@ otherhood , and the national Br@@ otherhood has ref@@ uted its affili@@ ation to the city group . &quot;
this will happen when the F@@ ed increases the interest rates
&quot; ev@@ as@@ ion can come , and the house will move to the rent , return for bonds and the economy will slide into a re@@ cession . &quot;
we know that .
what we do not know is how long it takes to last and how long it will stop .
&quot; in particular , the history of the economy has only minimal access to the process . &quot;
a re@@ cession came to the first interest rate within just 11 months and lasted for 86 months .
&quot; the Ag@@ gressi@@ veness of the Federal Reserve at the upl@@ ift of interest rates is often , even though not always , a factor in how the economy and financial systems respond . &quot;
&quot; therefore , representatives of the U.S. central bank have st@@ resses so strong that investors should not focus on when it starts to increase the interest rates , but rather on the period that is needed for normal@@ ization . &quot;
in fact several variables plays a role .
&quot; at the end , market participants could tell that all the excitement because of a ev@@ as@@ ion may possibly be ex@@ agger@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inev@@ it@@ ably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of the &quot; cheap money &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jess@@ op , Che@@ f@@ ö@@ con@@ om at Capital Economics , in a Communication to client . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradu@@ al return of the US interest to normal heights , but still at low level to lead to se@@ is@@ mic shock , which seem to fear . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that there will be no re@@ percuss@@ ions . &quot;
&quot; here &apos;s a look at historical trends , based on how some areas of the business could react : &quot;
&quot; as the market has seen in the last month , the anticip@@ ation of z@@ ays can make things for a while vol@@ at@@ ile . &quot;
once the increase occurs , the influence is not as dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there seems to be a tendency that imm@@ eas@@ iness were claimed by 12 to 24 months after the first raise , what perhaps re@@ reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank @-@ An@@ alyst@@ s- in a recent study to what happens to the inser@@ ts of the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; more specifically , the market is usually mentioned in the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the way to the ev@@ as@@ ion , rather shallow within the 250 days after an average yield of 2.9 % according to a current analysis that Bob Dol@@ l , chef plant @-@ Strateg@@ e at Nu@@ v@@ een Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s published . &quot;
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tend to appear later in the Enh@@ ance cycle and return them to decrease .
&quot; re@@ ess@@ ions are a fact of economic activity , but z@@ inser@@ ts convey it often . &quot;
in the current case the F@@ ed is faced with some conditions that were not present before and could acceler@@ ate a re@@ cession before .
extremely remarkable is that the gross domestic product is close to its lowest point at a ev@@ as@@ ion of the F@@ ed .
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 factor was only twice the nominal amount of GDP since 1950 , only twice the nominal voltage of 4.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; although the second quarter of 2015 stood at 3,@@ 6 percent , only few that this will last and expect the third quarter of the Atlanta F@@ ed only 1.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; inser@@ ts in such a frag@@ ile economic back@@ drop could be ris@@ ky and raise the question , &quot; whether this time is different , &quot; said Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; forex market participants adopted throughout the year on a ev@@ as@@ ion of the F@@ ed , and all the eyes were aimed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in this week which ends on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many str@@ at@@ ios and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could have an increase in this session , the Fut@@ ures trade gives only a chance of 25 percent . &quot;
&quot; in our study all enh@@ anc@@ ients from 1950 to now present in a Super cycle with increasing sw@@ elling while B@@ IP took place and on @-@ re@@ cession , very fast after the start of recovery in the shadow &quot; , &quot; thus the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst re@@ cession in the observed phase . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest , the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last re@@ cession ; the record was 35 months , and this is so far 74 months . &quot;
&quot; the firm income was also vol@@ at@@ ile , since the market is a ev@@ as@@ ion of income , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market . &quot;
the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than with shares when they change its strategic rate .
&quot; in bonds , the yield seem to change the direction as soon as the first increase / reduction in the cycle is done . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the increased cycle , the bond costs immediately , said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
the str@@ at@@ ification of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase in the interest rates will lead to lead closer and shorter lead to a de@@ fl@@ apping of curve .
&quot; high @-@ standing bonds often result in such a climate better income , even though &quot; we are still careful to expect higher y@@ ields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come @-@ an@@ alysts in Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; interesting is , Jones , that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed Strategy expectations . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decrease in inflation expectations , there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of more strict policy . &quot; &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest have risen , the re@@ membran@@ ce is fl@@ atter , credit@@ ors have wid@@ ened out and the vol@@ at@@ ility have increased - all the characteristics of the market , when the F@@ ed take its strategy . &quot;
&quot; in large and whole , companies who wrap around the greater part of their business operations in the United States , benefit from it , if interest rates are increasing and local products more attractive . &quot;
multin@@ ational companies with high debt will be worse since an increasing number of products is more expensive on the global market and the financing of their deb@@ ts .
&quot; the story shows that &quot; quality &quot; shares will respond very positive to three months after an initial cement being extremely positive , &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s @-@ an@@ alysts in a report for the customers . &quot;
&quot; companies with strong balance sheet have under@@ sur@@ passed companies with weak results in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 on average by 5 percentage points . &quot;
company with high capital yield and low vol@@ at@@ ility at their shares also out@@ lined its chip@@ sets with lower quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt is a big problem .
&quot; companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will most lose , said Gold@@ man . &quot;
&quot; out of pure stock games , consumers will also benefit from rising dollars . &quot;
&quot; frequency could see earnings by higher earnings , even if experts are different opinion as soon as that will take place . &quot;
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM Records &quot; says Par@@ a member Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; the conserv@@ atives of the Parliament critic@@ ized the transmitter because of its &quot; &quot; sealing &quot; &quot; &quot;
it argu@@ ed that he is increasingly differenti@@ ated by commercial ri@@ vals .
he focused on the BBC Music Awards and said that only The Br@@ its im@@ it@@ ated
Parliament &apos;s colleague Kn@@ ien Collins with the sending The Voice and said that this is not very original .
&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; conver@@ ts &quot; to Classic FM , holding a leading parliamentary system and increases new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does something to do what the privacy is not doing . &quot;
the conserv@@ atives Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC @-@ bos@@ ses that the public legal radio stations was sil@@ ly sil@@ ly and increasingly no longer be distinguished from his commercial ri@@ vals .
&quot; radio 3 seems - I didn &apos;t use the word &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; he said . &quot;
he focused on the BBC Music Awards who started last December .
&quot; the BBC Music Awards , who started last year , The Br@@ its seem to be just under another name . &quot;
&quot; so if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneous examples , where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham . &quot;
BBC @-@ General director firmly rejected the accus@@ ations and argu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of their commercial ri@@ vals when it comes to live music and education .
&quot; what I learn from Radio 3 , I will learn about classical music anywhere . &quot;
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 , to find new music and to order new works , I consider it really important , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey , that her t@@ oug@@ her to engage the audience when it was doing so in the past , because the British are less informed about classical music . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC @-@ production , while hearing the committee in the Committee for the selection of culture , media and sport to come under fire to step the commercial ri@@ vals . &quot;
the T@@ ory @-@ member Dam@@ ien Collins &apos; The Voice &apos; - the musical talent @-@ show of the BBC , which was bought by the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for cher@@ ished costs of 22 million £ . &quot;
&quot; see why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not especially distinctive ? &quot;
Lord Hall cons@@ isted that BBC 1 @-@ show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced in a special BBC @-@ way .
&quot; he added , he wishes that the company &quot; &quot; hit a hit in our house @-@ house &quot; &quot; pen , &quot; &quot; when the next time was a entertain@@ er . &quot;
&quot; however , he ref@@ used to ex@@ clude the order of other ranks of The Voice in the future or to give money to the im@@ it@@ ators for other entertainment formats . &quot;
the internet b@@ oul@@ ders up in August on the sl@@ ower and the Black Friday can be responsible for this .
in the first three months of 2015 there were seven percent increase in online sale .
last month there was the lowest result since the beginning of records in 2000
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones to shop
experts believe that the Black Friday has bra@@ ked in November in November
&quot; for over a decade , the virtual shop has dr@@ illed , and many of the main shopping streets of Great Britain have turned in spirit . &quot;
&quot; however , experts say that there are now signs that sales are st@@ agn@@ ate now that new numbers were only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 . &quot;
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say that there are signs that online sales st@@ agn@@ ate after the new numbers were only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for the years and see until 2000 , it has always developed over time , &quot; Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , &quot; said Editor of the IM@@ RG @-@ St@@ icks of the Guardian . &quot;
&quot; he explained that the online purchases are increased by three years ago , as buyer , with their cell@@ ys purchases . &quot;
&quot; it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do so in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa . &quot;
&quot; but now , the one , and we might experience that the growth will be reduced . &quot;
&quot; the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon , which was imported from America as a reason for the refle@@ ctive envelop@@ es . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that buyers will hold their sh@@ opp@@ ings before this event , which will take place on the last Friday of November . &quot;
&quot; last year , the average number of buyers to make their computer to make their bar@@ gain , and some dealer sites st@@ oves . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that Black Friday , in which the buyers have to fight against bar@@ gain , buyers of whom could hold the purchases . &quot;
a study of the British retail cons@@ or@@ tium found that from 5 £ issues a bit more than 1 £ are spent online .
in some products such as TV and wash@@ ers are carried out more than one third of the purchases on web@@ shops .
at the same time you buy more than a quarter of the people clothing and shoes online instead of the mo@@ ons in the cities .

&quot; British are increasingly employ craft@@ sman , says Ver@@ on@@ ique Lau@@ ry &quot;
the number of qualified craft@@ smen from Eastern Europe has rise behind
&quot; this leads to that 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix stores , which are listed on art@@ is@@ ans , will be opened &quot;
at the same time King@@ f@@ isher 60 B &amp; Q retail out@@ lets close
&quot; by Ru@@ pert Steiner , City Chief @-@ correspond@@ ent of the Daily Mail &quot;
&quot; it is argu@@ ed that British alle@@ ged their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favour of the use of skilled workers by skilled workers who carry out the works in their home . &quot;
if you are sent with a hammer or a brush to b@@ ail out of walls you apparently belong to a minority .
&quot; for Britain are increasingly doing craft@@ smen , to carry out @-@ jobs jobs in their homes , as the leader of the company behind B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new chair@@ men of King@@ f@@ isher who has the hom@@ ely chain in Eastern Europe , said that a big increase in the number of qualified professionals from Eastern Europe , which offer services to draft prices has now over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
&quot; therefore we plans to open King@@ f@@ isher , 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops who set up a hand@@ craft@@ sman and 60 retail outlet of B &amp; Q . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said to take more women in B &amp; Q shops because eight of ten buying decisions in the store are made by women .
at the moment the people we@@ igh the men .
&quot; she said it is necessary to set up the growing demo@@ graphic trends , the more female single households , which make more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our stores .
we must move it stronger to a balance .
&quot; in principle , half of our clients consist of women with 80 percent of decisions on the purchase of articles by women . &quot;
women play a big role in the making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry which is one of only five women represented at the top of a British in FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index of leading companies in order to reflect their top team in order to reflect a equal number of men and women in management positions .
&quot; King@@ f@@ isher is almost the only company that has occupied 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and financial level . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ f@@ isher announces a decline in half of the half @-@ year size and parag@@ raph@@ s after the group had the cost of closing the shut@@ ters .
&quot; at the end of the trends King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q has to open 200 new branches . &quot;
work from A@@ I / D@@ ob because of inf@@ idel@@ ity in court
at the Landes@@ court Kl@@ agen@@ furt will have to answer two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball @-@ V@@ iz@@ em@@ e@@ isters A@@ I / D@@ ob because of inf@@ idel@@ ity and hand@@ over education .
the def@@ endants are not guilty .
one of them had also been charged with Am@@ t@@ sm@@ iss@@ ors .
from this accus@@ ation he is acqu@@ itted in May timely manner .
the current process has been post@@ pon@@ ed .
&quot; according to the Pro@@ state Pro@@ secut@@ or Robert Rif@@ le had solidi@@ fied in the pre @-@ examination , that the def@@ endants in the years 2006 to 2011 Governing of association accounts , on which they were able to use in their functions , for private purposes . &quot;
&quot; the damage has become more than 400,000 Euros . &quot;
the sport @-@ dys@@ functions are also charged with finance .
&quot; this fact was the Chairman of the Sch@@ op@@ ens@@ ats , Rich@@ er Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot;
it should be negoti@@ ated at a future date .
for the failure of the inf@@ idel@@ ity placed the defense that the association was at no point in time .
&quot; the sport@@ sman could have had only administration damages and the sports club , which they had been operating from 1982 to 2011 and invested in the p@@ assi@@ vity of time - the p@@ assi@@ va amo@@ unted to the year 2001 around 600,000 Sch@@ illing ( around 44.@@ 000 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; at that time we were standing in front of the situation , &quot; &quot; We carry on or un@@ lock the Club , &quot; &quot; told one of the def@@ endants , in the Brot@@ un@@ ner wholesale exec@@ utions of the financial part . &quot;
he then chose to take this task with his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ endants .
with all risks .
&quot; we have advanced money to our life @-@ insur@@ ances as the security of the bank , &quot; he said in the in@@ corporation . &quot;
&quot; with the association it was agreed : you can manage the money , there can only be no deb@@ ts . &quot;
furthermore - with an appropriate financial success the payout of the administration fee is backward to 1991 .
&quot; so you have become some of the administration fee only years later , namely since 2003 , when a plus had been put forward to the account . &quot;
&quot; therefore , there are also l@@ aces and not detailed finishes , explained the former tro@@ phy of the processes . &quot;
&quot; the accounts and as@@ parag@@ us were acc@@ used the two def@@ endants together , the second def@@ endant . &quot;
why the withdraw@@ als have not been exposed in detail were the judges .
&quot; the association has not been interested in detail for the financial aid , which was important only to the press freedom , so the answer . &quot;
&quot; when in 2011 against the one function@@ aries began , there was an account of 120,000 systems received because of Am@@ t@@ sm@@ iss@@ ors , an amount was transferred from 120@@ .@@ 000 Euro to the association . &quot;
that was acc@@ used to be declared the def@@ endants .
&quot; this secur@@ ities account for the name of the second def@@ endants , and was not known according to the association &apos;s statement . &quot;
why ? &quot; he wanted to know the judges .
I did not know the answer for a long time .
&quot; then he finally said , he believed that this is the best for the club . &quot;
&quot; if it would be something like him , nobody would have won anything of that money , the pro@@ secut@@ or ordered in the room . &quot;
&quot; the compl@@ ained was kept informed , just@@ ify the function@@ ary . &quot;
this bank transfer was formulated as &quot; dem@@ nity . &quot;
why in@@ dem@@ nity ? you wanted to know Jud@@ ge and Pro@@ secut@@ or .
&quot; after that , the first def@@ endant , he did not agree with this wor@@ ding , because the association had never caused a damage . &quot;
&quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; With that you are all out of the cutter . &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representatives ? , &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the function@@ ary said he has never turned one c@@ ents of sal@@ ary , he just retain@@ ed od@@ ometer and di@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; for di@@ ets he has put an amount of 1,000 Euros per month , but the actual expend@@ itu@@ res may have been a lot higher , he added . &quot;
precise documents for the early years could not ass@@ ign the def@@ endants .
&quot; they have been tested according to an operation , in which it has been checked as correct , no longer has been preserved , explained . &quot;
od@@ ometer had also referred to the second def@@ endant .
&quot; all corre@@ ctions are done in cash , in addition to his home international market he had to go to the bank for Ble@@ ib@@ urg , he stated in his statement . &quot;
the main negoti@@ ation is continued on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .

time of decision on interest rates for the U.S. database
&quot; the world ob@@ serves as the US comm@@ a has two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , in order to meet the important decision whether for the first time around a decade or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey of 80 econom@@ ists , asking from Reu@@ ters , found out that a little more than half , the last week of view was that the F@@ ed will do this , now thinks that the F@@ ed will continue to keep on the present state of 0 - 0.25 percent . &quot;
&quot; it is a historical event , because it has seven years ago since the F@@ ed interest on N@@ ULL sat down . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , we approach the situation in which a great central bank may move the zero sector and starts a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ b@@ ide , leading employees at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. economy is on a relatively good performance level , tr@@ illion dollars to add a balance sheet and generate only a low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less thr@@ ill view of global conditions . &quot;
&quot; it war@@ ned the markets to appeal to an increase , but the signs suggest that the chances for such a step are good . &quot;
the decision is to be announced at 20.00 CET on Thursday
penalty at the Delta State University leaving un@@ pre@@ school
&quot; after the shoot and killing of his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning , and before he saw his colleagues on the day and killed Sh@@ annon for him to say that he could make him &quot; sorry , &quot; gave authorities on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , Mississippi , said that he &apos;s , lect@@ urer for Ge@@ ography and Soci@@ ology Education at the Delta State University , called Not@@ icing at number 10 : 00 on the Monday morning . &quot;
and he said he was shot on someone and someone killed .
he &apos;s said to the employee of the emergency that the police officer shall send to his home .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I really loved my wife Eve evening &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; is in the house , but he will no one distur@@ b , but probably will be up@@ set . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the c@@ aller for his name , but he did not give him . &quot;
he &apos;s no explanation for his shots .
&quot; he said the scene of Amy Pre@@ ent@@ iss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note of Lamb , 45 , said , &quot; I do so sorry , I could do it back . &quot;
&quot; I loved Amy , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
&quot; after writing the note , 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he received E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , when he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; university President William La@@ For@@ ge said , he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday , he said sup@@ pos@@ edly believed that Pr@@ ent@@ iss also had a relationship with Schmidt , said authorities on Tuesday , there was no information , no evidence of &quot; &quot; tri@@ angular relationships . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pre@@ ent@@ iss was described by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who told them that they were married about seven years as a &quot; good man . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were made 15 years ago , but remained friends . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ ent@@ iss would have had a daughter who is 19 , and it was &quot; &quot; on the ground &quot; . &quot; &quot;
he said that Pr@@ ent@@ iss was their daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ ent@@ iss was working online from home , according to statement by Lin@@ s@@ day Kn@@ ow@@ les that was identified by Sun Herald as a close friend of Pr@@ ent@@ iss . &quot;
&quot; Kn@@ ow@@ les said that Pr@@ ent@@ iss , who has had a dog called Light@@ ning , who has been playing with he for about three years . &quot;
she always wanted to help other people &quot; said Kn@@ ow@@ les
he said that he said about at any particular point in the Monday to say to them &quot; he did not go in prison .
&quot; when polic@@ emen him on the Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later on that night he depart@@ ed his car to the side , flew to foot , ran into the woods and sle@@ w yourself with a shot . &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United can not play mon@@ atel@@ ang because of dou@@ bled fre@@ ighter
Luke Sha@@ w suffered at the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PS@@ V Eindhoven a double fra@@ cture of his right leg .
&quot; while this is the left For@@ te@@ idi@@ ger to wee@@ ping , and ex@@ clude him for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al will not let the hope that Sha@@ w is able to play in this season . &quot;
this injury was caused by a rec@@ kl@@ ess attack by Hé@@ ctor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20 years old Sha@@ w was in the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the field and required oxygen before it was taken into the hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double body and is located in the hospital . &quot;
he will be transferred tomorrow or maybe a day later and then performed in Manchester .
&quot; it is terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it is very heavy and then is fantastic , and then it happens . &quot;
in the sl@@ immer he had an oxygen @-@ mask .
he we@@ pt .
&quot; I am not a doctor , but if you have a double fre@@ el@@ ance , then the six months , and he will not play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope he can play this season again .
&quot; Moreno seemed to be happy , an Red card and the im@@ position of a sl@@ ump . &quot;
Nicola R@@ izz@@ oli who is refer@@ ee that has not pun@@ ished the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al fe@@ ared that the Italian arbit@@ er had fallen down .
they can judge for themselves when I say that a mo@@ f@@ meter and a red card were st@@ icker .
it was a very worse attack with both legs .
&quot; a twe@@ et to Sha@@ ws Account : &quot; &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words cannot be described how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I will get stronger back . &quot;
herein : Manchester United d@@ ressed the loss of Luke Sha@@ w in the defeat at PS@@ V
the England @-@ Ver@@ te@@ idi@@ ger has an extra incent@@ ive to recover in France until the coming June .
Phil@@ lip Coc@@ u the PS@@ V trainers said : &quot; it is a very hard@@ est injury .
if a player leaves this type of injury the place are all very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt a opponent .
Moreno has suffered a firm break as Mexico against Van Ga@@ als Holland team at the World Cup 2014 .
&quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear that it is a very bad injury is that not good , &quot; said Coc@@ u . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball , who had been in another direction , so if he looked upon him as if he had touched him , but I could not see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; with S@@ BS@@ 6 said Moreno : &quot; I know how it feels like , I know how difficult it can be . &quot;
I feel very bad there . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V @-@ Player Andr@@ és Guard@@ ado was also brought to hospital - after a f@@ oul@@ der by Chris Sm@@ ago .
surely David Cameron The Lor@@ ax better ?
&quot; it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child love a book , it will not last long until you know it almost . &quot;
unless you are perhaps David Cameron .
&quot; asked as he requested by a provider of child care system to call his favorite n@@ &apos;s book , he chose the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , the 1971 ex@@ alt@@ ed environ@@ ment@@ ers by Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , Cameron writes in a message on the site of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , ag@@ ile , creative , and with a powerful message , it is a book that I like to read my children , because it seems to have always been a picture or a message that we have ever missed . &quot;
&quot; everything nice and well except that the subsequent sales , in which Cameron sup@@ pos@@ edly describes the action of the book , instead a summar@@ izing of the film version of 2012 returns to extend the new characteristics and details to add the fairly short original text . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the wall@@ ed city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature is gone and even the air a commodity is , hopes to see a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of Au@@ dre@@ y , who reads like a true tree , whose right name Theod@@ or Se@@ uss Ge@@ is@@ el l@@ tete and the 1991 passed , but completely unknown . &quot;
&quot; if this is not di@@ gre@@ ased enough that by Cameron presented text reads like the abstract of the Lor@@ ax movie , which is presented on the website of the Internet Movie Database , and thus begins : &quot; in the wall@@ ed city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , hopes to win a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; though he s@@ ells a pr@@ ag@@ matic father seems to be a pr@@ ag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely to get acquain@@ ted with the action of the book as little . here is an Un@@ named Lor@@ ax , a bright , schn@@ ur@@ r@@ endous Being , &quot; which speaks in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely that such a relatively low pr @-@ task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per @-@ job which The Lor@@ ax has not had 20 times a row of a child .
a Down@@ ing Street @-@ Spe@@ aker said that the text probably has been removed from Camer@@ ons .
&quot; Super@@ camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Camer@@ ons employees , but there were no further immediate comments . &quot;
&quot; Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion of England , but it is still hard &quot;
&quot; to encounter Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , is a difficult job , but if one has chosen the cad@@ res , the England for the tour , is a repet@@ ition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series not on my map . &quot;
I would not close a foreign victory .
&quot; Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ ooks page may experience less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the Batt@@ ing machine layout and the commun@@ al spirit is strong ; they will not bear any sc@@ ars of 2012 , only a youth@@ ful positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; Mo@@ een Ali has been developed by Mo@@ een Ali as a spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l R@@ ash@@ id , even if it represents an unknown size on the test level , an option for the attack . &quot;
so this news : Adam Ly@@ th is going to leave from the England @-@ test K@@ ader and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
&quot; making the decision to allow Adam Ly@@ th , is of course to be analys@@ ed for me as his chec@@ ks@@ trainer in Yor@@ k@@ shire . &quot;
&quot; with its seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but harsh reality is that cr@@ ick@@ ers are on results . &quot;
&quot; there was no question mark for Joe R@@ oot , for example , and this led to nom@@ ination , there - and I said this - players are their own best choices . &quot;
&quot; a long time ago , it would have extended the run of Ly@@ th , but it had control over his own dest@@ iny . &quot;
&quot; if he hopefully bring more runs to Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance is coming . &quot;
&quot; the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss pra@@ ised his attitude , even if he did not turn such good performances , and that was not surprising me ; he is primarily a team @-@ man . &quot;
the question how much time has a test stroke will get to get his character is difficult .
&quot; he got seven chances - as Sam Rob@@ son before him , &quot; &quot; during Nick Com@@ pt@@ on nine . &quot;
only Com@@ pt@@ on got the chance to exercise home and reverse .
&quot; the only accus@@ ation that one can raise , that England was first put into the Caribbean at first - as Ly@@ th is in peak , but this lost chance is now in the past . &quot;
alex H@@ ales comes in and he is a stroke that I was set up high .
he is a X @-@ factor Cr@@ ick@@ et@@ ate which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he visited 236 for us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge which was very met .
&quot; he must at least get the same chances as the before him , but of course this depends on the team effort in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea to make Mo@@ een in addition to Cook , what would bring an extra @-@ spin Bow@@ ler and get four Qu@@ icks , appeared on , and I have nothing against it . &quot;
I don &apos;t see why a stroke will not suggest there and this left @-@ handed has already shown that he is a vic@@ ious circle of cr@@ icket player .
&quot; Mo@@ een maybe not have his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference . &quot;
&quot; my early team @-@ col@@ lage Just@@ in Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests on the first drop , before it started in 2001 as Open@@ er . &quot;
he made three hundred years away and did not look back .
Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ re as Back @-@ up sle@@ igh and in my limited treatment with him he impressed me as a young man .
people might see his statistics - an average of 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it is a p@@ unt ; but there is no large number of Backup Sp@@ inn@@ ards who rise their hands and the coach have decided for young people .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the squ@@ ad England has made a few Smart additions to the trainer .
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ a , the Bat@@ sman from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master cou@@ p . &quot;
&quot; it is one of the nic@@ est blo@@ kes of the game , which will bring an abundance of experiences , since it has played under all conditions and against all the attacks . &quot;
Paul Col@@ ling@@ wood comes for the white ball stage of the tour and brings energy and a powerful job into the setup .

&quot; some will not agree , but co@@ aches and team @-@ exhibitors are not going to be a schedule . &quot;
and you must remember that as with players their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not easy to take .

&quot; David Camer@@ ons un@@ broken new strategy to keep Britain in the EU , with every day deeper into trouble , even without the choice of brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ b@@ yn to guide Labour or the TU@@ C , which broke down in due to Europe on Tuesday . &quot;
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Nig@@ el Far@@ ages .
&quot; as a European diplom@@ acy , a European diplom@@ acy said , &quot; &quot; recently , that some member states , so deeply ent@@ angl@@ ed in different crises how the EU is now and not always out of own debt , UK itself , which they mostly do not want to be filled . &quot;
&quot; in Brighton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual General Assembly because it does not like that even if they end@@ anger the social protection . &quot;
we could also call Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
&quot; Prime Minister and Finance Minister carries on summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they prev@@ ailed to reforms . &quot;
it is always about me .
&quot; my European friend , who wants to look at the &quot; &quot; UK &quot; &quot; inside the EU @-@ tent - &quot; L@@ ass us does not come alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and leaves much more short @-@ term ministers and officials in some major cities to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we remain or going . &quot;
&quot; cau@@ ti@@ ous ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel is a allies , but she has been on power for 10 years before it looks bad for them as it looks for the ex@@ agger@@ ated long ex@@ hil@@ ar@@ ating like Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
French François Hollande looks on his re @-@ election or its implementation in 2017 .
it is also a f@@ ading power .
Poland probably soon has a nation@@ alist right government to Spain a left @-@ le@@ dge .
&quot; it falls heavily , to imagine that it should be a bite to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ British to prevent the energy from the UK - something that they do not want , because most of them have a separ@@ at@@ ist tend@@ encies . &quot;
&quot; therefore , some such ministers are even not intent@@ ional notes , especially in the SN@@ Ps @-@ style , during Britain &apos;s referendum in 2017 , to acceler@@ ate the Bre@@ x@@ it process , is suspe@@ cted my boy@@ friend . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a ple@@ ite &quot; and &quot; UK has won &apos;t won any number of value from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; Europeans know how r@@ pur@@ ified the Fle@@ et Street to be at their expense and what EU @-@ sce@@ pt@@ ics can be the olig@@ archy of the press bar@@ one , as they were inspired by Tony Ben@@ n insp@@ ire referendum in 1975 but they had our entry in 1973 with a relationship of 2 : 1 . &quot;
&quot; you can only remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ Opportun@@ ity , who made himself a name as an &quot; EU @-@ Tr@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels @-@ correspond@@ ent in the early 90 @-@ s . &quot;
&quot; with all his mad@@ ness , Ed Mil@@ ib@@ and who knew his enemies . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fe@@ iting sl@@ ur@@ ks , telephone @-@ h@@ ack@@ ishing sp@@ inning and the pseud@@ o non @-@ empire , who own most of our great newspapers . &quot;
&quot; actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought much about them , but found that when one sitting with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage rop@@ es better ban@@ anas in order to diver@@ t him instead of having lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact Mil@@ ib@@ and was more Bla@@ i@@ ri@@ ans than Bla@@ ir himself , when he was transferred Camer@@ oon@@ ians refer@@ en@@ du@@ ms , for Bla@@ ir had ref@@ used by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , opened a back@@ door by him . &quot;
the press has never denied him .
&quot; but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ b@@ yn , who gave me a friendly fl@@ aps on your back - I said to him that he doesn &apos;t have time for me to waste it - seems to repeat in danger , Ne@@ il Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cott of the 80 @-@ er years , a mistake at that time and today . &quot;
&quot; it may take , but he has to develop a coh@@ er@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ seat he left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ ns official position to Europe is - I really want to be friendly - in the development .
he says that we should remain in a re@@ formed EU .
&quot; now , most people outside of U@@ k@@ ips traditional leaves and the wild ge@@ cin@@ der of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can probably say yes to any of them . &quot;
&quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but not a b@@ enn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on TV this week said , did not ad@@ mit that Cor@@ by@@ ns appointment of the pro@@ vo@@ z@@ izing John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell was a bad idea . &quot;
&quot; it rem@@ inded me of the 70 @-@ he years , when his old father was painted on television to be loyal to his Labour cabinet , to go far too far and lose his cabinet job . &quot;
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
&quot; but to fight , in order to remain &quot; under all circumstances - B@@ enn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , still what J@@ C told his comrades and the Members of all reports on their cl@@ ing@@ day schedule at the Monday night . &quot;
what always wants to convey the tou@@ red bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ b@@ yn - remember that he even has stir@@ red me - news Dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ ine stays in the age of TV around the clock and above all things in the spiral of social media , a breeding station of Par@@ ano@@ ia and Ver@@ betra@@ y . &quot;
&quot; it is correct to give Cameron no Fre@@ ik@@ or for Europe which allows him to hold down support in the referendum for a course of self @-@ evident , such as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins think for sure .
&quot; but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns basic ambig@@ u@@ ities regarding EU membership - in tune with their B@@ enn@@ ite Bel@@ ag@@ er@@ r Economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left dis@@ sident , for which the Nar@@ c@@ is@@ sm@@ us of small differences is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes . &quot;
&quot; as with its ambig@@ u@@ ities to N@@ ato - Tom Wat@@ son is also convinced that J@@ C will not start any campaign to res@@ ign@@ ation , foreign diplom@@ ats shall be committed to find in all a sense of their super@@ visor to be at home . &quot;
why should we waste Paris or Berlin political capital - they have also mist@@ rust@@ ful voters to make con@@ cess@@ ions to the British when all this can be meaning@@ less ?
&quot; the U.S. is already rather disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq , in Libya and Syria , even with a cost @-@ reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was rem@@ inded at the start on Monday of something that British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum . &quot;
experts critic@@ ize the report of Public Health England via e @-@ cigarettes
&quot; alleg@@ ations of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigarettes are less harmful than smoking was produced from a meeting of 12 persons , partly with connections to the tobacco industry , and said researchers . &quot;
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , Lanc@@ et to critic@@ ize the message used by Public Health England ( p@@ he ) in their report about e @-@ cigarettes . &quot;
he published the &quot; Third Annual Report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers have asked the res@@ il@@ ience of the data subject , and pointed to the connections between several experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
&quot; an Editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month , the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily wind@@ y base &quot; on the p@@ he founded his most important conclusion . &quot;
&quot; two further researchers write to BM@@ J and have asked if the data is based on stone , or sand . &quot;
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor for European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor for Clinical Ep@@ ide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the proof of effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; they said that the public expected that the claim of p@@ he that &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes about 95 % less harmful are based as smoking &quot; on a detailed review of repl@@ ication and model@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 persons who were called to develop a model for multiple criteria @-@ making analysis ( multi @-@ Crit@@ eria Decision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to lead their opinions on the damage caused by different nic@@ otine she@@ eting products ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ised in a research report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well told that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose Managing director has previously been received by British American Tob@@ acco means ( BA@@ T ) . &quot;
&quot; he also wrote the references of BA@@ T to public health in a sustainability report , said it . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants at the meeting declared to get funds from an e @-@ off manufacturer , but not the financing , who will have received according to reports before the Tab@@ ac@@ companies Philip Morris International , they added . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for selecting the members of the Gre@@ mi@@ ums are not supplied , but they include several known E @-@ cigarettes Champions , some of which also provide a branch of funding on the paper . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in the field of tobacco .
at the session also did the tobacco @-@ led of p@@ he .
&quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; bl@@ oss@@ ed &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; tough ass@@ ign@@ ments to the damages of most products in most criteria &quot; , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot;
&quot; however , none of these links or restrictions are discussed in the p@@ he report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well told that the asser@@ tions of p@@ he said that &quot; &quot; there has so far no evidence that e @-@ cigarettes as a way to qu@@ it smoking for children or non @-@ smoking . &quot;
&quot; Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , Director of Health and Wellness at p@@ he , said that respond@@ ing to the asser@@ tions of BM@@ J was already respond@@ ing before . &quot;
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot;
each second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies in his ad@@ diction .
&quot; all evidence show that the health risks of e @-@ cigarettes in comparison can be low , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term impact . &quot;
&quot; he has a clear duty to provide information on what is evidence , and what is not , above all , if there is so much public confusion about relative dangers compared to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; nearly 8@@ 0,000 people die annually at a disease with respect to smoking , and smoking will cost the National health care system two billion euros per year . &quot;
&quot; by the clear set of current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes is not without risk , but only a fra@@ ction of the poll@@ ut@@ ant caused by smoking , we fulfill our national jurisdiction . &quot;
&quot; UK should also give up East@@ man , &quot; she says former CEO of Channel 4 . &quot;
&quot; the former chair of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said that BBC should stop to send programs such as East@@ er@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial Riv@@ als would give her right arm , &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said that the broad@@ cast@@ ers should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK transm@@ it@@ ters .
&quot; he critic@@ ized the BBC for reve@@ aling the BBC for publicly @-@ legal programs , which probably can be seen from a smaller audience to place the most popular shows of its ri@@ vals and transm@@ it@@ ters like BB@@ C4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC @-@ General director , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations , said Johnson , that he tried to contact with Channel 4 for six years in his time with Channel 4 . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are on behalf or sends them , which clearly showed clearly from non @-@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson the Ober@@ haus @-@ communication @-@ Committee within his investigation about the future of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you would like to hold a broadcast fee , what I do - or do not consider a good idea for the long @-@ term , one should do at least for programs , others do not do or on behalf . &quot;
they send The Voice in a prime time window because they want to achieve as far as possible support for their future .
&quot; the idea that otherwise no one would display this is a joke , it is ridicul@@ ous ; it is obviously non@@ sense . &quot;
Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax programs will be financed without subsi@@ dies .
the Voice is such an programme which East@@ er@@ ders is another program belonging to both re@@ productions .
honest@@ ly other channels would give your right arm for it .
I am trying to see how this is going to be public @-@ free television .
I don &apos;t believe that this would reduce the BBC at all .
&quot; Johnson , an entre@@ pren@@ eur for series , the Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC has been working on the hunt for reviews &quot; &quot; because of the ambit@@ ions of the people who work there and because they think this is the best way to secure a long term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on the most popular shows of the BBC will give this again what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ diary presentation made in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows how East@@ man should sell . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal n@@ iche programs should not measure to BB@@ C4 , but they perform their duties , and they can ar@@ gue when they have created their duties , and they can ar@@ gue when they have created all these ob@@ sc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window where no one they ever wanted to see .
&quot; he said to the radio station at Johnson : &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system with respect to conditions that can obtain the best value here . &quot;
&quot; of course you think all , think that one gets a great value for 150 pounds per year here , but for people who is for 150 £ a lot of money , ask me whether that &apos;s right , because they consume not much of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 @-@ boss David El@@ stein , who also said before the Committee on Tuesday , called on BBC their char@@ ith@@ ian mission to provide , to form and enter@@ tain . &quot;
he said that only little of the BBC @-@ production would now officially classified as education - he said that there is 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and it should change one example in public @-@ legal television stations in Australia and Canada - they should change and talk about .
&quot; to the question of partnerships said El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a hand@@ ful on television will show , and with the commercial transm@@ it@@ ters , to make all available online . &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ ogen@@ etics &apos; can control brain cells by sound @-@ waves
&quot; the video shows how the N@@ emat@@ odes are changing the direction in the moment , in which they are lab@@ eled with sound impul@@ ses . &quot;
scientists have breed the wor@@ ms with gen@@ etically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by mu@@ ff@@ y of sound @-@ waves .
&quot; little n@@ emat@@ odes change the direction in the moment , in which they are with sound impul@@ ses that have to be heard for human hearing and high frequencies in order to be filled , radi@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; the im@@ pet@@ us are working by the activ@@ ating Mot@@ one@@ ur@@ on cells , which are gen@@ etically modified to bear the membrane channels that react to ultras@@ ound . &quot;
further on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; researchers said that the wor@@ ms showed the power of a new procedure , called Son@@ ogen@@ etics , which can be used in ultras@@ ound , to activate a number of brain , cardi@@ ac and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researchers at the Sal@@ k Institute in La Jol@@ la , California , told the Guardian that the proceedings of one day the depths of one day would under@@ take the electric impul@@ ses into the brain from men to treat symptoms of Park@@ in@@ son &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; aden@@ itis respon@@ ds usually not to ultras@@ ound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani found that they did it if they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic bub@@ bles . &quot;
&quot; bub@@ bles , he found out , strengthen the ultras@@ ound waves , which then penet@@ rate into the wor@@ ms . &quot;
the reinforced ultras@@ ound effect function on structures that can be called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ I@@ on@@ enk@@ an@@ als and are found in the membran@@ es of some of the wor@@ ms .
the sound @-@ waves create the opening of the I@@ on@@ enk@@ ins and activate the cells where they are assigned to such a report Nature communications .
&quot; to create ultras@@ ound @-@ controlled N@@ emat@@ odes , the Chal@@ as@@ ani gen@@ etically modified is that some of their Mot@@ one@@ ur@@ s TR@@ P @-@ 4 channels . &quot;
&quot; when he turns ultras@@ ound on the changing creatures , the sound @-@ waves are ampl@@ ified through the micro@@ bl@@ owers and into the wor@@ ms , where they turn off the changed mot@@ one@@ age . &quot;
the process has some simil@@ arities with opt@@ ogen@@ etics and a pione@@ ering tool that allows scientists to implement neur@@ ons with stimul@@ i of light and over@@ lay .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ ogen@@ etics could have some advantages compared to this technique .
&quot; unlike light , that must be sent in the brain in an optical fiber to the desired place in the brain , Low @-@ frequency vibrations can happen and can thus be sent in the brain from above on the sk@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily work temporarily for the ultras@@ ound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
other applications could focus on muscle cells and ins@@ ulin @-@ producing cells he added .

eight Golden rules for living in students
&quot; eleven years ago I moved as a self @-@ mann@@ ered 19 year old , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral Rel@@ ativ@@ ism but only now I remember the t@@ ense smile of those who I have anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , long @-@ pet@@ ious complaints over others . &quot;
most of what I learned can be dist@@ illed in eight simple rules .
the im@@ suit in student resid@@ ences reaches from slightly ner@@ ve @-@ wr@@ acking up to absolutely sh@@ ock@@ ingly .
&quot; it is tempt@@ ing to sp@@ atzen : people wh@@ ence you come from where and where you have taken sab@@ bat@@ age , where you stand in terms of Cor@@ b@@ yn and why you were &quot; frank@@ ly marble , not love nor hate , because in ear@@ nest , guys , it is just one hot @-@ extra@@ kt Ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
&quot; it &apos;s the conversation and helps you find out the people find out which you like in contrast to those with which you would not speak , even if your eyelashes would rent into fire and ext@@ ingu@@ ishers . &quot;
let people .
&quot; the rooms of people often transform themselves into drinks , film @-@ night venues and commun@@ al meetings , but they are also the places where people draw and to face their under@@ wear . &quot;
referred to : do not remember the university with a relationship
intro@@ vert@@ ed receive a cru@@ de treatment at the university .
&quot; your room should be a refuge , but many student resid@@ ences form a space @-@ to @-@ room @-@ bo@@ mel culture that can be friendly and socially and can lead to life @-@ long friendship . &quot;
&quot; this can be hell for someone who is trying to recover . &quot;
&quot; nothing in the culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want to go beyond our friendship , but you have to go away so that I get the energy I get back for interaction with you . &quot;
try to sense when a milit@@ ant is exhausted from soci@@ al@@ izing - and send it an SMS instead of character .
speaking of kno@@ ck : do it .
a guy in my students had the idea that a short sealed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close by b@@ aking .
&quot; since you start the Uni at the height of Back Man@@ ie , the cl@@ amps is at the doors of people to present themselves with a plate of brow@@ n@@ ies , less strange when the welcome of the 1950 @-@ he &apos;s welcome in the neighborhood , I give you anything . so , and now please smile , when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to close friend@@ ships .
your ro@@ omm@@ ates feel obliged to enter@@ tain to enter@@ tain you and will end up your face with a delicious surprise .
&quot; of course , this depends on whether you are an decent b@@ aker . &quot;
&quot; poor mis@@ erable cl@@ um@@ ps from flour , sugar and fat guides that people are as@@ le@@ ep when you kno@@ ck . &quot;
food to ste@@ al is a major crime in student lives .
&quot; of course , the cl@@ aws of chicken is an ou@@ tr@@ age , but is it taking a drop @-@ drop for your tea also ? &quot;
ver@@ ify this with the mil@@ ion@@ owner .
&quot; the chances are good , that they say to use themselves , even when they cook in the inside . &quot;
&quot; when someone takes your things , it is anno@@ ying , and you have my emp@@ athy - but try to go with a balanced deal with my ro@@ omm@@ ate , added to her milk to pun@@ ish th@@ ie@@ ves . &quot;
it is now in prison .
&quot; they should not make any noise , the people from sleep or labour . &quot;
&quot; it is not just about being a decent human being , but that in the tru@@ est sense of the rich@@ ness to man belong to the people who are in the Glass . &quot;
&quot; a girl on my cor@@ ridor asked her neighb@@ ors , whether there will be some au@@ ditions , drum &amp; bass , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had an ex@@ am in the morning . &quot;
they re@@ acted to you with much fol@@ i@@ y music .
&quot; when they finally stopped at 5 am , she gave her neighb@@ ors to sleep two hours before they ended their own music , she finished her door and commit to her three @-@ hour trial . &quot;
would it not be romantic if your future spouse would happen random@@ ly to the same student dormitory ?
&quot; conver@@ sely , it would not be ab@@ normal embarrass@@ ed when you stick to a ro@@ omm@@ ate for your future ad@@ ress , to get back to them and then you will have to see how to bring all common friends to themselves ? &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart covers his own paths , but when a hot ro@@ omm@@ ate is definitely not your future ad@@ ress , try to enter at least , your sub@@ hab@@ b a little reason . &quot;
&quot; in the exciting moment , in which you notice that someone left its key in its not closed room , is the border between a Ul@@ k and bul@@ lying f@@ og@@ ram as it seems . &quot;
&quot; a good distance is funny , but it only takes eye @-@ seeing , until it gets the bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
&quot; ins@@ of@@ ar as a valuable and am@@ using le@@ ction on safety - but you never make someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sh@@ ampoo . &quot;
&quot; close their door , and place their keys into a glass of water , which you will then put in the freezer - but t@@ ack@@ ern their property at the ceiling , not more than twice . &quot;
&quot; ter@@ houses for refugees , rocky , pl@@ anner &quot;
the Immobilien@@ company Markus G@@ ild@@ ner is building on the Fran@@ con@@ ian Eck@@ ental town@@ houses for people who have not much money .
&quot; for example , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; not only refugees need living space , but also the only mother @-@ leading mother and the scent ear@@ ners . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll show how to still use it today and well , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in the interview &quot;
thousands of refugees will be meeting on the market of residence .
entre@@ pren@@ eur Markus G@@ ild@@ ner you have to know how rapidly it can become more favourable position : it builds in a project ste@@ ter@@ houses for refugees .
&quot; Mr Ga@@ el@@ ner , many refugees will be meeting in the apartment . &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : mass accommodation in containers or Turn@@ h@@ allen has no sustainability .
because human beings remain to a big part here .
&quot; in the light of the refuge@@ e current , we also need to have sufficient space in the coming decades . &quot;
&quot; a very big , three @-@ sto@@ rey town@@ house is the solution . &quot;
G@@ ild@@ ner : a row @-@ house needs the least place .
it facilit@@ ates the integration .
this is different when people sub@@ ordin@@ ate people in homes .
&quot; each of the six houses , which are just built in the pilot project , consists of three dwelling units for each four asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; each apartment has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room . &quot;
&quot; it may be that many refugees will say , it is back peace , I go back . &quot;
then the houses can easily be converted to the respective needs .
how high are the costs ?
total : the price of 160 square meters of living space per house ap@@ ass@@ ed to 184 000 Euro .
this is man@@ age@@ able .
six months the construction continues .
this is appropriate .
do the regulations have their plans un@@ complicated ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : how did I have correctly carried out my project correctly .
it is very complicated that it always makes the dro@@ pping d@@ amo@@ cl@@ ine value and the foot@@ print .
gr@@ us@@ el@@ essly .
&quot; it will still under@@ go , who creates in a town@@ house three apartments , needs at least three pitches . &quot;
only in the cities is lacking in the square .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers do not have cars .
how did the residents react to their Sem@@ i @-@ project ?
cher@@ ner : there were others who took me to establish super@@ structure for asylum seek@@ ers .
what definitely not true .
but do not waste your competition in the fight for pay@@ able apartments ?
&quot; G@@ ild@@ ner : true it is : we had a building boom in Germany over the last five years , but one of the luxury apartments , which can hardly afford a wider audience . &quot;
&quot; my project has the message , including ordinary people need living space . &quot;
&quot; not only refugees , but also the alone @-@ giving mother or the righteous . &quot;
I &apos;ll show how to prev@@ ail today even today and well .
this is why it goes .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone OS to be released if Apple update will be released
&quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the application app , click &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; and then &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install . &quot;
&quot; some are un@@ locking after installation to problems , as they receive a error message that the &quot; &quot; software update &quot; &quot; failed . &quot;
&quot; to handle the problem , users recommended to wait either to wait until the rush is back or trying to update via iTunes . &quot;
the phone itself takes you through the rest of the process .
&quot; this might mean the delet@@ ion of apps to create space - but Apple has done this through the sl@@ imming down of all updates . likewise , it will be easier to do this when you put a special tool displays to delete apps and then re @-@ install it as soon as the process is completed . &quot;
&quot; it is worth to make sure your cell phone is loaded during the update or is located near a charge machine , so the battery loaded . &quot;
&quot; if the cargo is too low , Apple does not allow the update to be continued , as the phone possibly can be stored half@@ way and this may lead to an out@@ break of the updates . &quot;

&quot; besides advis@@ ory services , one can also take part in the courses . &quot;
the social foundation moves away from the mountain to the city center .
&quot; more exactly , said to the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz . &quot;
there was recently opened a new quarter office .
&quot; here , immediately next to the shopping market , from now on for sen@@ iors and advice information on questions like care insurance or for the services of nursing and nursing care . &quot;
&quot; for years we have been firmly established with our out@@ patient care , that often wor@@ s@@ wal@@ ing members are left alone . &quot;
there are infin@@ it@@ ely many questions .
&quot; too many services of the cas@@ ks are not yet avail@@ ed in demand because the complexity of insur@@ ances will hardly be understood , &quot; explained the new households in Jutta We@@ ig@@ and , responsible for the Anton@@ ist@@ ift as well as for the patient care and the patient &apos;s service &quot; &quot; Amadeus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; besides the advis@@ ory services , the new design office offers also prevention , health conditions and wellness . &quot;
so the sal@@ udi@@ s was taken with the boat .
&quot; therefore , you can use additional offers such as Stur@@ dy invention , memory training or a physi@@ otherap@@ ist treatment . &quot;
the offers of the sen@@ iors and the Sal@@ udi@@ s complement one another in an ideal manner .
&quot; sal@@ udi@@ s stands for prevention , prec@@ aution and re@@ hab . &quot;

&quot; moreover , Mayor Wolfgang Metzner ( SPD ) has focused on initiation ceremony , where there are many events and offers on the program and these invite to a regular soci@@ alis@@ ing . &quot;

Dr. Frank Müller takes on practice Fel@@ ic@@ ausen and investing 3@@ 10000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) under@@ take the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ ausen .
&quot; about the same time about Bernd Bor@@ mann , business aid at Uta Se@@ im @-@ Schw@@ art@@ z and As@@ endor@@ fs Mayor Hein@@ fried cab@@ bert . &quot;
in many places in the country we are missing doctors - As@@ endorf . against it was lucky : Dr. Frank Müller gave the practice kart@@ ing .
&quot; during Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ er in retirement , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich had his successor to the next months with half a place to go . &quot;
&quot; after a re@@ building phase Müller opened the practice on 12 October , until then it invested 3@@ 10000 euros in the premises at St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 . &quot;
&quot; it was sympathy upon first sight , than the field @-@ standing ago by Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , who currently met her professional mill@@ ing at the cor@@ rid@@ ors hospital and come into practice at present . &quot;
&quot; we always had in mind , that the gar@@ bage dump would fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ gen@@ ausen and laughs . &quot;
&quot; when it was done , I simply inv@@ oked them . &quot;
&quot; couple Müller liked the idea , in the future in As@@ endorf , to operate your own practice . &quot;
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot;
&quot; we would like to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as an advantage , he also see his own boss . &quot;
so it became detached and the gar@@ bage to the house with practice .
still they will continue in Land@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
&quot; there is the two @-@ day family @-@ father Frank Müller also raised , his Medi@@ z@@ inst@@ udi@@ um in Hannover followed by several doctors and hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , N@@ ien@@ burg and Rot@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; currently , he has served as a pri@@ mer in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed to the leit@@ ric@@ ian in the district Die@@ ph@@ olz and is engaged in the DR@@ K @-@ willingness for fra@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen in 2009 . &quot;
&quot; from September 19 , the practice will be prepared for the new Chief . &quot;
&quot; during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ gen@@ burg is working as an instructor , his wife has specialised in Ur@@ sel ( Bo@@ ist ) to Gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; the gar@@ bage , both intern@@ ists , want to settle in house . &quot;
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy therefore comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll . &quot;
after the re@@ building the rooms will be modern .
we will offer more ultras@@ ound exam@@ inations as well as long @-@ term and stress @-@ EK@@ GS and need a balloon @-@ room .
the ED@@ V is also completely renewed .
&quot; from a total of 50@@ 000 Euro , the gar@@ bage dump is received within a framework of a promot@@ er range ( 25@@ ,000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; this shows how proud and pleased we are , the practice proce@@ eded , &quot; says Dr. Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; about 2000 patients come according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll of every quarter in the practice of field , in the north @-@ German practice , it is about 500 . &quot;
in As@@ å@@ n there is another general practition@@ er practice .
a positive side @-@ effect of the pract@@ ise by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ gen@@ ausen in As@@ endorf .
if no successor would have found it would have gone .
&quot; but those who are visiting Mü@@ ll@@ man &apos;s talk , is by the way also mainly in trusted faces : takes over the seven medical professional and the cleaning power of the field . &quot;
&quot; at their part@@ ing , in As@@ endorf an era , the medic@@ s have worked there for 30 years . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot;
a little sad@@ ness so@@ aring them after the long time already .
&quot; but we still live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and many patients are still able to see &quot; , &quot; says the Res@@ ist . &quot;
her husband are added l@@ ach@@ ingly : &quot; we have a 6000 square meters plot . &quot;
&quot; so far I have always pressed myself to gardening , now it could be different . &quot;
she also has two grand@@ children and travels .
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees
&quot; the border is also being raised to our South border , &quot; &quot; said Interior Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remains to be u@@ pright .
&quot; however , it is clear that everyone who wants to ask for an asylum , can also make this &quot; &quot; of course &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of the people can be emphas@@ ised .
&quot; but it is clear that there is clear signals , &quot; &quot; said the minist@@ ries . &quot;
people must know that we don &apos;t accept unlimited migration flows but also not about the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it needs a controlled operation .
Croatia is looking forward &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia has denied
&quot; the Croatian government had previously announced , also Slovenia wants to stop coming refugees towards Austria and Germany and under certain circumstances also cor@@ rid@@ den cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees . &quot;
exactly this was not the case of the Secretary of Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ n@@ id@@ ar in La@@ ib@@ ach .
&quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; absolutely in@@ akzeptabel , &quot; &quot; Slovenia will rather dev@@ ise the monitoring of the border - especially to Hungary - step up . &quot;
the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as the outside of the Schengen area .
&quot; as the minister stressed , Slovenia will have to die out its borders to refugees but not . &quot;
&quot; every EU member needs to fill his commitments , otherwise the system may not work , &quot; commented Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ n@@ id@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; as the Croatian Government involved , the first refugees were already tried in the night hours to Tuesday , in eastern Croatia at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id , to do the registration . &quot;
the Croatian police could en@@ force them in the near Ma@@ is@@ fel@@ dern .
according to local media since the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik have ever been a police drive through new refugees in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik .
&quot; it is primarily about Sy@@ rer and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children . &quot;
Res@@ idential services and the Red Cross are already in operation .
&quot; in the days ahead he will be circum@@ cis@@ ed its country with about 4,000 refugees , said Minister of Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; also buses from Pre@@ se@@ vo to the ma@@ z@@ ed@@ onian border , which so far went to the Hungarian border leading to Croatia , reported Croatian and Serb@@ ian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the government in Belgrade are de@@ priv@@ ation , however , that they may include people , which include certain routes : &quot; neither can we do , nor do we want to do this , it was . &quot;
&quot; according to the media report , a first bus with about 50 refugees in the Serb@@ ian border town of S@@ id arrived , in the course of the day would further buses expected . &quot;
&quot; about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
the occup@@ ants were on the way the whole night of the approximately 500 kilometres to the remote border through Serbia .
&quot; we have heard that Hungary changed , so the police said that we are supposed to go here . &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany . &quot;
&quot; with this , it actually became a predi@@ cted shift in the former Balkans route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a somewhat further west track . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive opportunities for bound@@ ary control &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia &apos;s Minister of O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had pointed out that his country has prepared for the fall of a strong state of refugees with appropriate plans for possible out@@ flow properties . &quot;
&quot; he didn &apos;t refer to it , but he pointed out that Croatia considered non @-@ Schengen member &quot; &quot; comprehensive opportunities for mar@@ gin@@ alisation &quot; . &quot; &quot;
follow @-@ up controls to qualify for the membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 and as a result since 2007 the EU @-@ partners stand a good witness to what has been contro@@ ver@@ si@@ al in the country .
on a Serb@@ ian page , behind the Hungarian border fence continued to continue around 300 refugees . &quot;
&quot; according to the grave of the media , they would have spent the past night at the border crossing Am@@ org@@ os , who is to Roman . &quot;
the information of the Hungarian authorities remain completely bar@@ red on the two border cross@@ ings H@@ org@@ os and Back@@ i Bre@@ g .
whether the remaining refugees now want to reach the Croatian border is still un@@ clear .
&quot; the Serb@@ ian Minister for N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic tried to so@@ jour@@ n at a local press at H@@ org@@ os : he ruled the debates about aging off@@ ence of refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed for early . &quot;
it would not currently act in a very high refuge@@ e deal .
&quot; people should not say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot;
hel@@ pers and migrants to - hazardous - alternative methods
&quot; although private Hungarian refuge@@ e shel@@ ters have already begun to spread to the refugees country maps , on which alternative routes are marked through Croatia . &quot;
&quot; but the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not harmless : in parts of the border area , there are also 20 years after the end of the Croat@@ ia.@@ there still not yet more spacious min@@ e@@ fields . &quot;
at the end of the morning the Croatian police became known that a team of mine clear@@ ance was sent in the bor@@ der@@ region .

&quot; therefore , the public @-@ effective action to be 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; that not everyone wanted to inform each of the tables , however , be understand@@ able , ultimately it were a very personal thing . &quot;

an@@ alysts are waiting according to a survey of Bach Set 10.@@ 84 $ .
&quot; the lower prospect is in spite of the price increases , which are average 4.9 percent and will be effective on 4 January , and despite higher sur@@ charges for Bo@@ dent@@ ran@@ spor@@ te of heavy and large packages , which will be charged from November . &quot;
&quot; the company said that it is still waiting that the result from the previous year was increased by cost reduction , higher earnings and due to the growth in online trading . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company will bring solid revenue , when reaching the we@@ aker as expected economic conditions , especially in production and global trade . &quot;
&quot; plans for the holiday employment were announced a day later than those of the Rival UPS , which is plans to introduce 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional work@@ force , for example the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , Fed@@ Ex 6@@ 92 million $ , 6 percent more than last year . &quot;
&quot; the earnings per share stood at an TS $ per share , just behind the 2,@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of Z@@ acks Investment Research advert@@ ised an@@ alysts . &quot;
sales rose by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion .

Fed@@ Ex has received a decline in the last few years to disp@@ oss@@ ed its sales in its unit Express disp@@ atch .
but the boom in online @-@ shopping has increased the results on Fed@@ Ex Ground .
&quot; in the last quarter sales rose by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for bigger par@@ c@@ els and insurance . &quot;
&quot; the Express Unit made higher earnings due to higher prices , while the result is due to higher work@@ force in the cargo shop . &quot;
&quot; in the market trading , about an hour prior to opening , san@@ to the Fed@@ Ex @-@ shares by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2,5 percent , to 15@@ 0.15 $ . &quot;
on Tuesday they closed 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11th .
&quot; at their most expected meeting in the year of the Federal Reserve Strat@@ are to se@@ ater two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot @-@ mah@@ og@@ any table to decide if it is time for the first time in nearly one decade of the le@@ itz@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; above them at one end of the dist@@ orted seat , it is a picture of the United States . &quot;
the map is a remin@@ der that the F@@ ed @-@ Chair Jan@@ et L. Y@@ D and their colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the Central Bank has a two @-@ fold order from the congress : maxim@@ izing US employment and prices are stable here .
&quot; but since the large re@@ cession , the F@@ ed leader has recognized that there is an un@@ even third mandate - financial stability . &quot;
&quot; and this third mandate could be the X @-@ factor in a decision that is too tight for them to predi@@ ct . it is announced on Thursday , whether the U.S. economy is ready to un@@ ve@@ iled from the un@@ preced@@ ented incent@@ ive of the near zero @-@ short interest rate since the end of 2008 . &quot;
&quot; though most data of the economy show that it grows solid , the most recent turbul@@ ence can increase the global financial markets already con@@ spic@@ uous these vol@@ at@@ ility by lifting the z@@ ins@@ es for federal states - and be it only about a quarter percentage . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation is primarily the most important thing you observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pie@@ g@@ za , cheer@@ leader in the macro@@ company founder &quot; &quot; Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text that interest rates do not increase , the increased in@@ security around the global market has enough just@@ ification , continues to wait , &quot; she said . &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do what is in itself the financial market itself .
&quot; about half of the econom@@ ists , which were recently agreed by Bloom@@ berg , have predi@@ cted a ev@@ as@@ ion of this week . &quot;
&quot; however , financial markets are expecting a wait of the F@@ ed , with a key indic@@ ator who only displays a 30 % chance of an increase . &quot;
&quot; this points to a decline in the stock market , in case the F@@ ed increases the sentence , unless the str@@ at@@ izing of the blow they promise that an additional increase is far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage score around 2@@ 28.@@ 89 points or around 1.4 % to 16.@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the campaign was trig@@ ger@@ ed by expectations that the F@@ ed government holds the sentence in this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Che@@ f@@ ö@@ con@@ om at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would lift the propositions at that time , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if she is doing it , &quot; she would have to put her very far in her statement to re@@ assure the financial markets , so that they do not panic into panic . &quot;
&quot; other experts ar@@ gues that an advert@@ ise impact the financial markets would be cal@@ med , because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the f@@ ed act . &quot;
&quot; still a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed to increase the set by 0.25 percent@@ ages in this month , the first small step in a slow tight@@ ening of the mon@@ et@@ ical conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the United States . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ D had stated in the spring and in early summer , that in this year , despite the complaints from liber@@ als that more economical progress would be required , an increase in the proposition . &quot;
&quot; although the job creation in August slow@@ ed , improving on the labour market this year is solid . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate decre@@ ased on 5,@@ 1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and close to the level which the F@@ ed as full employment . &quot;
sub@@ missions have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; and although inflation was constantly displac@@ ed at the end of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of much lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can overcome higher interest rates , and takes them because of tension in the labour market , &quot; said Ian She@@ pher@@ d@@ son , Che@@ f@@ ö@@ con@@ om at Pan@@ theon Macro@@ economics . &quot;
&quot; but financial markets all over the world gathered together at the end of the last month , after China had infl@@ ated his currency . &quot;
&quot; the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage fell in May by more than 16 % among his highest levels , as investors afraid that a sl@@ owing of the Chinese economy would be global growth thr@@ ott@@ le . &quot;
&quot; the market is somewhat rest@@ ra@@ ined in this month , the Dow is now around 10 % under the H@@ och . &quot;
&quot; for the F@@ ed representatives , the market @-@ te@@ em@@ ing influence the complex calcul@@ ating when you should increase interest rates . &quot;
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news about weakness of the Chinese economy would not have occurred in recent weeks , Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at the U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the U.S. database . &quot;
&quot; now he says that she will be waiting for at least a month to get the impact on it better . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot of in@@ security on what will be the impact on U.S. economy , and there is almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot;
&quot; the health of the global economy is none of the main concern of the F@@ ed , so it should not be involved in making their decision making . &quot;
&quot; but in the end , the F@@ ed Monetary Fund has become the world . &quot;
the influence of the Central Bank was enormous in the last few years .
&quot; the mere note of the former Leit@@ ner Ben S. Bern@@ anke in the year 2013 , that the F@@ ed could cause their mon@@ et@@ ory expansion &quot; , &quot; trig@@ ger@@ ed confusion around the globe . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly hop@@ ed , can be monitored by the F@@ ed representatives , but also provide support with other central banks , but also with other central banks and experts to provide better understanding of the global economy . &quot;
&quot; decision making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , leader of the global strategy for the imm@@ eas@@ ing management of the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeffrey l@@ acker , Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month , that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of over @-@ actions on financial market movements , which apparently cannot be linked to economic fundament@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; l@@ acker , agreed , member of the Federal Open Market Committee , which requires a ev@@ as@@ ion of inser@@ tion , quoted decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce their lessons in three sessions , despite limited recogn@@ izable effects on growth in the US , &quot; said l@@ acker . &quot;
a year later the F@@ ed @-@ representatives took this short@@ cuts .
&quot; F@@ ed should put on the first place aspects of financial stability as to the first place in 2008 , said Adam S. Poznań , former member of the Committee on the Z@@ ins@@ fir@@ ing of the Bank of England . &quot;
&quot; the most recent turbul@@ ence do not come near this plane , he said . &quot;
&quot; it certainly does not want to worry about the situation in which it is afraid of a ev@@ as@@ ion , because the markets are exciting , &quot; said Poznań , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until that is changed , I do not think that they should look forward . &quot;

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Leben@@ sh@@ ilfe for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
&quot; welcome to prepare a warm welcome , not without the commitment of un@@ volunteers . &quot;
&quot; also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people , the un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seek@@ ers in the city support . &quot;
among them are Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is with her body and soul teacher .
even with their 74 lungs it is still teaching .
every Thursday they are doing it in the asylum seek@@ ers at the D@@ ill@@ inger Street .
&quot; it helps refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German language . &quot;
naturally this is quite different from the right school than at a correct school .
Bras@@ il@@ iens European diat@@ ric company Rio Grande promotes diet for healthy breastfeeding
&quot; Brazilian pe@@ diat@@ ric organization Spr@@ S tries to el@@ uc@@ id@@ ate how important good diet during breast feeding is . it does this with the presentation of pictures of babies , who are painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy foods . &quot;
&quot; formula consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates , which provide for all nutrients they require to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnancy and young m@@ others will increase their daily cal@@ orie intake to increase about 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research results suggest that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adjustment to the m@@ others . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ ine College of Medicine in Texas , showed that healthy eating pregnant women actually protects the genes of their babies , and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , a un@@ healthy diet of the child can have a negative impact on the immune system . &quot;
exceptions for the New Bern@@ rie@@ der Sp@@ orth@@ all
&quot; Bern@@ ried approved the contract for the 2,3 million Euros of expensive courses . &quot;
and he made an exception .
the roof may be fl@@ atter for activ@@ ism .
the planning for the long @-@ thir@@ dly turn@@ scape at the amber fre@@ ight is step by step forward : in the recent municipal council session was caught up with the extended construction motion without large discussions .
&quot; previously , the panel had decided on an application to build a legal &quot; exception @-@ &quot; &quot; ex@@ empt &quot; &quot; from valid cultures . &quot;
&quot; with the &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; it went to the permission for a special design with respect to the umbrella . &quot;
dem@@ on is planned to be a &quot; semi @-@ comp@@ artment with non @-@ middle first and roof level .
&quot; background of the planning is the un@@ seen use of the umbrella group for solar properties : &quot; thus we get a wonderful great South comp@@ artment along , &quot; &quot; said Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting . &quot;
&quot; during the &quot; liberation , &quot; it was again around the roof , which is intended for energetic reasons - other than in the Beb@@ ob plan - below ten degrees . &quot;
the volume of the hall is thereby significantly reduced .
&quot; a &quot; liberation &quot; was therefore necessary because of the site there was no exception as &quot; exceptions &quot; for the scope of the assembly with respect to the par@@ ish@@ ness in general in the act of liberation . &quot;
&quot; however , it is not a re@@ curr@@ ing project , &quot; we do not create preced@@ ence , such as St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the turn@@ ate building at the sports centre is a joint project of the community and the SV Bern@@ ried .
at the expense of costs are around 2.3 million Euros .
grants are expected from school@@ ing and Bre@@ iten@@ sports .
&quot; in the next process , the application will be submitted for the 18 x 36 meters large hall now with the objective of the examination . &quot;
clinic . Pe@@ i@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital Pe@@ i@@ ßen@@ berg is scheduled to be closed before as planned - namely 2016 .
&quot; simultaneously , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) became the new doctor &apos;s director at the hospital Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot;
the station as well as the majority of employees attract by Pe@@ i@@ issen@@ berg with to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this striking plans of the Hospital GmbH of the county is confirmed by the Man@@ agers in Andrea Jo@@ chner @-@ White .
&quot; however , a decision on the course of the Supervisory Board , and of the accounts on the next Wednesday , 23 September . &quot;
&quot; if plans are implemented , all of the nearly 50 employees would continue to work at the hospital in Pe@@ i@@ ßen@@ berg . &quot;
the vast majority can move with fishermen and the further existing inner station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
&quot; employees who can not do with after Sch@@ ong@@ au , is to be offered a job at We@@ il@@ heim , so Jo@@ chner @-@ White . &quot;
the employees were informed about their plans .
&quot; caused by changing the cancellation of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been the director of the director of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been the director of the Sch@@ ong@@ y clinic for the beginning of the year and now changes to a private office near the hospital . &quot;
&quot; when the question of who the success@@ ion should take , came according to Jo@@ chner @-@ wh@@ ites , the name &quot; &quot; Fischer &quot; into the game , who declared himself to take over the management and to move with his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot;
&quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this is in every case a &quot; &quot; enum@@ er@@ ating &quot; &quot; and a f@@ ender of the offer in the area &quot; interior medicine &quot; , &quot; says Jo@@ chner @-@ White . &quot;
Fischer is a specialist in the @-@ step @-@ by @-@ step @-@ makers and def@@ ib@@ r@@ ill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized in the internal station on gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
&quot; seam@@ less for the next two years Fischer should drive with his team , when the Supervisory Board expresses that both houses will lead until then next year the former hospital of Kn@@ apping , which has more than 35 beds to be reviewed in Pe@@ i@@ ßen@@ berg , after nearly 140 years . &quot;
&quot; until now , the Land@@ kreis confirmed this for 2018 , when the current rehabilitation is completed at the hospital We@@ il@@ heim . &quot;
&quot; land@@ owner Jo@@ chner @-@ White , which is also chair of the board of directors occurred to what the house , which is in possession of the federal capital , in which it should be used as an accommodation for asylum moving . &quot;
&quot; I close it out . like it go on with the real estate , Jo@@ chner @-@ White could not say , there were several refle@@ ctions . &quot;
currently there are a short @-@ time care of the Car@@ itas and a di@@ op@@ sych@@ omet@@ ry .
&quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity comes not again , &quot; so Fischer talks about the Qu@@ asi @-@ Move to the Le@@ ch , which has been a positive and very understanding . &quot;
&quot; a real perspective for the house , in which fishermen works for over 30 years as a chec@@ kers , have not given it . &quot;
he has been asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleague to attend the item of the physician director .
&quot; the hospital Pe@@ i@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was again threatened with closure , including the surgery were closed , for example the surgery and the birth . &quot;

&quot; one since Saturday , 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palatinate has fallen to the victim of a non @-@ violent crime . &quot;
&quot; the corp@@ se of the young woman was found on the Tuesday night in Roc@@ ken@@ hausen near Kaiser@@ slau@@ tern , such as pro@@ secution and police on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; and he also considered to act on the Tuesday evening pro@@ gen@@ ome 20 @-@ year @-@ old , who in fact led the statement , and the investig@@ ators had led to the location of the corp@@ se . &quot;
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported on Sunday morning after they had returned home after a visit to a autumn day in Roc@@ ken@@ hausen .
in search of the young woman the investig@@ ators look first at personal objects from the victim .

refugees need accommodations : study warning before typ@@ l@@ ücke
the situation on the German apartment is charming .
more and more refugees are looking for a pay @-@ paid work .
the pressure on the market is growing .
the social housing is facing a challenge .
the distributor on the German market has long been begun .
&quot; with the coming refugees and job@@ seek@@ ers from the EU , more and more people are p@@ ushing towards a market that is already over@@ loaded in many big cities . &quot;
they compete with in@@ corporate citizens around the last two @-@ paid apartments .
&quot; to cover the demand for the paid apartments , up to 2020 every year 400,000 new units would be built . &quot;
&quot; the result is a study on behalf of the association &quot; &quot; social housing &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to compare , in Germany 26@@ 0,000 units are finished . &quot;
&quot; thus , 14@@ 0.000 apartments are missing . &quot;
refugees are no longer obliged after the first three months of their stay than to live asylum seek@@ ers in a first @-@ month accommodation .
&quot; many then drive into the arkt , and put them in the long sn@@ akes in front of the rent . &quot;
&quot; according to the statistics of the Federal Office , in the last year there were less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers to rent . &quot;
but the negative development of the residential complex lies not only on the increasing refuge@@ e figures .
the study also makes substantial om@@ issions in the housing policy of the last years .
&quot; Germany , a reservations def@@ icit can be found before coming from year to year . &quot;
&quot; currently there were already some 77@@ 0,000 units , Matthias Günther , author of the study . &quot;
many experienced facilities were therefore staying in large cities and apartments in the apartment .
&quot; young adults stayed in the &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama . &quot; because of the boarding on the housing market . &quot;
in the cities the number of square meters per head over the past few years were dropped again .
&quot; to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; &quot; social housing &quot; &quot; creates a rest@@ art . &quot;
&quot; thereby , new incentives should boost social housing again . &quot;
&quot; so , on the tre@@ ad tax could be destroyed and the fundamental tax for sponsored apartments are exposed to @-@ fri@@ ars . &quot;
&quot; in addition , they are necessary to be an attractive tax det@@ ach@@ ment options . &quot;
the funding programme for the refuge@@ e ports of the state K@@ f@@ W is now coming up in towns and villages .
a good week after the start was started on the Monday evening with 184 million euros more than half of the available approximately 300 million euros .
&quot; now , the project could even be increased . &quot;
refugees having free gifts : Croatia and Slovenia @-@ ridor
&quot; according to Hungary , practically no en@@ vi@@ us , there are more and more refugees choose from Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb announces that crossing over Slovenia to north without hur@@ dles .
but the route is dangerous but still .
Croatia aim@@ ing to do country with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees
&quot; I have spoken with the Sloven@@ ian inner court , and if it is necessary we will organize a cor@@ ridor , &quot; said the Croatian Minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
Slovenia is between Croatia and Austria and belongs to the Schengen area .
the EU @-@ country Croatia is not a Schengen area .
&quot; after the launch of the Serb@@ ian Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees crossing from Croatia to reach from there to Western Europe . &quot;
500 people were over the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , the Croatian TV @-@ member RT@@ L reports . &quot;
Hungary had a border for refugees at the day before its border for refugees .
&quot; new laws , which performed on the same day into force , do so ord@@ ained asylum @-@ procedures in Hungary practically over@@ flowing . &quot;
Croatia wants to happen the refugees .
&quot; the Croatian Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic said , &quot; You can go through , and we are preparing for this possibility . &quot;
&quot; these people are there , are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something . &quot;
&quot; however , people who did not want to live in Croatia . &quot;
the Croatian police had taken up the first refugees at the border of Serbia in Croatia on the morning .
&quot; according to most of the news reports according to Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they came by bus as well as with taxi to the Serb@@ ian border town of S@@ id .
immediately after their arrival they had tried to walk across the green border to Croatia .
on the Croatian @-@ Serb@@ ian border the refugees do not come across to bound@@ ary .
&quot; for this , the border @-@ strip of other dangers : there are still sharp tri@@ but@@ aries from the Yugos@@ lav civil war in the 90 &apos;s . &quot;
mines must now make a safe passage .
in Hungary the closure of the border is not more refugees .
&quot; on Tuesday , the police have been upgra@@ ded by the local people . &quot;
before the exp@@ ul@@ sion on Monday there were still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws regul@@ ating the over@@ coming and damage of the border rem@@ inds us as offen@@ ders .
the south @-@ Hungarian border district Sz@@ eg@@ ed were therefore introduced to 35 criminal procedures .

among the applic@@ ants are 13 families with small children and two older people .
at the end of the morning there were 40 refugees left there .
&quot; however , no one has more views to get in Hungary asylum . &quot;
&quot; in Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; secure Third country . &quot; &quot;
the dis@@ owned asylum seek@@ ers should be de@@ ported to it .
in front of the &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ one &quot; in Rö@@ sz@@ ke gathered only a few hundred refugees .

&quot; they gathered the tr@@ ash , the tens of thousands of people in the past few weeks left in the road@@ side . &quot;
Block@@ houses were dra@@ ined and one of the recording centres in the bor@@ derland was rebuilt .
&quot; for the purpose of this structure , nobody wanted to express themselves . &quot;
Austria : after the closing of the border between Serbia and Hungary only a few refugees .
the country also has its border @-@ controls .
&quot; around the 20,000 migrants were held by government officials but still in the country . &quot;
in Salzburg about 1400 people are waiting for the transmission to Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped by the German authorities in the morning .

&quot; because Germany on Sunday however , because of the refuge@@ e of electricity in the railway traffic in Austria was surprising with Austria , the city was reduced by its help and the bases went together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border to the Middle River . &quot;
before we did the un@@ expect@@ edly only res@@ har@@ ed at once with j@@ ause and drinks .
&quot; we have said the same , we bring them to Passau . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a matter of course for us , &quot; &quot; Stad@@ ler in O@@ Ö@@ N conversation . &quot;
they were very grateful .
&quot; a man did not let itself to pass a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire @-@ fighting . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she was very happy about this , &quot; &quot; Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; the st@@ amped pan@@ es came to Passau from a ICE in Wels by a ICE in a regional train line to Passau , to make it possible after the short term pro@@ cl@@ amation that the rail transport was set to Germany yet even over the border . &quot;
the regional train was put down before the border in Wer@@ n@@ stein am Inn .
in Wer@@ n@@ stein crossing the border @-@ border in general is high on the course .
&quot; the Br@@ ücken@@ firm was soci@@ able with the Bav@@ arian neighb@@ ors on Sunday , days before a twin @-@ re@@ curr@@ iculum , organized by the Union Wer@@ n@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen . &quot;
&quot; Viktor Or@@ b@@ án now sent other gyp@@ sy , is a logical result of a apparent policy : &quot;
&quot; instead of helping in the camp of Roman law , Human@@ ity , our Chancellor , state high officially and publicly declar@@ es the position of the Hungarian government in the dark circle of national socialism . &quot;
suff@@ erer of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with the border areas with cha@@ otic conditions .
&quot; the Refu@@ ge@@ es will find that the &quot; Pro@@ mis@@ ed Land &quot; , &quot; which they invited and welcome , has nothing but a refuge@@ e camps . &quot;
&quot; it will become a big challenge , given the continuing refugees stream and the se@@ per@@ ing winter , with us to establish decent conditions for prot@@ ect@@ ives . &quot;
&quot; and there will be an even greater one - peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;
Konrad in search of 3@@ 5,000 hard@@ y ball@@ ing &quot;
Konrad did all hands to do with the refuge@@ e attachment of all hands .
Christian Konrad is in the term for his word .
the government has applied the former massive Rai@@ ffe@@ isen Ban@@ ker to hire lod@@ g@@ ings for the thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first @-@ month centre Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already been awarded to the handle .
&quot; we have no hom@@ eless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he told his first success . &quot;
&quot; the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday -- be without great vor@@ tex , &quot; said Konrad , and pra@@ ised the organisational . &quot;
the Ministry of the Interior was marked by a &quot; ris@@ ky situation . &quot;
&quot; overall , Konrad with a requirement of 8@@ 5,000 lod@@ ding in the fier@@ y year . &quot;
&quot; to fulfil the number must be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 should provide the countries , 15.@@ 000 of the covenant . &quot;
&quot; should there be more refugees , we can do it . &quot;
&quot; but there is no f@@ ass without ground , &quot; said Konrad . &quot;
with the Gover@@ nor he has started discussions .
&quot; they would have promised him , even for the coming refugees lod@@ ges . &quot;
&quot; in Ober@@ österreich it works fine , &quot; said Ferry Ma@@ ier . &quot;
the former VP @-@ Al@@ atar does not support Konrad .
&quot; in the morning , there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , that will be cle@@ ared as the church will help . &quot;
&quot; great expectations , the Asyl@@ um coordin@@ ator also in the OR@@ F action &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ps like us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform you can offer private and un@@ complicated accommodations .
&quot; in addition , you were hop@@ ed for hotels that are empty during the winter . &quot;
&quot; Konrad , and Ma@@ ier critic@@ ized the standards for accommodation as &quot; &quot; very high &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in emergency , it could not be that neighbour@@ os@@ ampl@@ ers have to hold a certain amount of tow@@ el @-@ pen@@ holders or the size of the tops . &quot;
for one @-@ term time required &quot; cle@@ us &quot; apply .
&quot; that he was successful in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior of the accommodation , established Konrad with his experience . &quot;
I am an older gentle@@ man who is not told without further into the face the fal@@ seh@@ ood .
convict@@ ion is his most important weapon .
&quot; Konrad , and Ma@@ ier do not cause any cost , as they declared themselves . &quot;
their employees want to increase them from three to four .
the custom lod@@ g@@ ings had not yet been successful .
Konrad wanted to set up a container at the Steph@@ an@@ splatz .
but there is clearly problems with the permission .
Linz calls for better break@@ down
no opening municipal spas and other buildings such as Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for lodging of refugees plans the City of Linz .
&quot; this is not therefore not necessary , since it is possible to present those affected without these measures , &quot; says Mayor Klaus Lug@@ er ( SP ) . &quot;
&quot; however , for emergency purposes , further locations should be checked on their do@@ d@@ ability . &quot;
criticism of the chief advis@@ es on the division of refugees within the federal state .
even other fields must make their contribution .
Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er : &quot; boundaries are not re@@ mun@@ eration &quot;
in a longer telephone call with the Bav@@ arian Prime Minister Horst Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er ( C@@ SU ) on Monday the further proceedings of the refuge@@ e question .
Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er gave me certain that the German borders are not sealed .
the far@@ ction of refugees in the Federal Republic of Germany shall continue to be possible .
&quot; however , there should now be the appropriate limits . &quot;
special agreements with refugees in Germany will not give it any more .
but the seek@@ ers would have come to Germany with regular journeys to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; by the other EU member states , P@@ toll is once more enhanced solidarity in the refuge@@ e question . &quot;
&quot; that now Austria will again offer controls to its borders too , is a logical consequence for &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; in the proceedings of the Germans . &quot;
the next R@@ unt@@ astic is a question of time
the General Manager of the &quot; New Wer@@ der &quot; in the Lin@@ zer Industrial bar is officially completed .
&quot; in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the center sen@@ ated IT @-@ Group B &amp; T took over , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative enterprises out of the technology sector . &quot;
&quot; in the IT the clever valves are our raw material and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T @-@ Chef Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
he could imagine to invest in start@@ up companies of the new ship@@ yard and later continue to accumul@@ ate .
&quot; right from the start , S &amp; T he wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - which would have promised some precip@@ itation : &quot; the next R@@ unt@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; close to 1.7 million were invested by S &amp; T in the site , 3 million euros from the Tech@@ center that belong to a third of the city of Linz , the country Ober@@ österreich and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building is se@@ ated by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ center .
&quot; 30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square meters in the building are rented , for more than 40 percent do it give requests . &quot;
L@@ ia @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ er opened second shop in the Ark@@ ade
in the new shop Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are at the centre of attention .
&quot; actually , Jutta Bre@@ it wanted to put a dog . &quot;
&quot; this project had to shift the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of L@@ ia Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade curve : finally , she has now swee@@ p them in the form of another business location . &quot;
&quot; in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop in front of the business , in which it sold pockets , suitcases , shoes and gar@@ ment of various manufacturers , now everything turns around dam@@ p pockets for the brand Fur@@ la , w@@ allet are starting from 75 euros . &quot;
&quot; larger bags and accessories are up to 500 euros . &quot;
since yesterday the new shop is in operation .
previously several weeks was rebuilt .
&quot; but I have covered a long time if I want to open a shop , &quot; &quot; says Bre@@ it . &quot;
&quot; decisive factors for the decision was among other things that the Fur@@ la @-@ producers who are at home in Bologna , from the idea of an own location , where only their hand@@ bags were sold , were encountered . &quot;
&quot; we are the t@@ ense in the Gre@@ ater Linz , which sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters , who has even Italian roots . &quot;
her fashion interest has placed Bre@@ it from her mother to the cradle .
&quot; even though , most when developing something and I can show new trends at performance prices . &quot;
why so some woman could not answer the sight of a fine hand@@ bag in rap@@ ture , the specialist may not be answered with absolute security . &quot;
perhaps it is because a beautiful bag can be evaluated every out@@ fit .
the Br@@ ull@@ jes@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
&quot; the dist@@ ort@@ ing ancestors of Donald Tru@@ mp came from a place , whose inhabitants are def@@ ender . &quot;
&quot; this property also connects man@@ holes with the bill@@ ion@@ aire , the U.S. president . &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp ( 69 ) is always good for isolation .
&quot; whether he has manifest@@ ed alien@@ ated , journalists , or knowledge of knowledge in the international crisis policy - the applic@@ ants for the U.S. pres@@ enter urge the election campaign power@@ fully . &quot;
and cuts well off .
this is also recorded in the P@@ äl@@ z@@ ian K@@ all@@ stadt in where the grand@@ parents of the property @-@ milk li@@ ard came .
the New Yorker with the F@@ öhn@@ fr@@ is@@ ur is a concept many in the Win@@ zer@@ dorf near the wine road .
man@@ holes in the 1200 @-@ inhabitants @-@ village is about -@@ zig corners of it related .
&quot; his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Palatinate : Donald Tru@@ mp , here in elect@@ oral mode . &quot;
the h@@ ub@@ ator Simone Wen@@ del turned out a movie about Tru@@ mp .
and what do vill@@ agers think about his goal is to become more powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think that are somehow exciting , but are not so impressed in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot;
the native fire@@ man has turned a am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous jumping sho@@ oth@@ es on which next to Tru@@ mp are also the Ket@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
&quot; Tru@@ mp , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) too word - so with the statement that he would be sure also when he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
at the heart of the heart he did not put it there .
&quot; while he respect the performance of the family , but tend to be the opinion that Tru@@ mp has already been a bit like a &quot; &quot; Mau@@ l &quot; , &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; acc@@ identally , the nickname , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the radius , &quot; &quot; the Br@@ ull@@ jes@@ macher &quot; &quot; - to High @-@ German : the Acc@@ ad , says it . &quot;
&quot; thus , Tru@@ mp comes from the village of the employees . &quot;
the Tru@@ mp &apos;s success story began in 1885 . when the later grandfather was immig@@ rated and opened to the US a pub for gold @-@ gr@@ ders .
cor@@ ner@@ stone of the real estate concert were first property sales in New York .
&quot; but life of grand@@ parents was not free of Trag@@ ic : your desire to return to the way back to the country , hor@@ failed at the Bav@@ arian State , which belong@@ ed to the Palatinate . &quot;
&quot; he did not record Tru@@ mp , because he was once heard without permission , he had declared the Director of the Institute for P@@ äl@@ z@@ ical History and Folklore , Roland Paul , to Film@@ start . &quot;
Tru@@ mp is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
this is in contrast to the mit@@ ig@@ uous statements of the follow @-@ up .
&quot; he was repeatedly talked to over Mexican immig@@ rants in the US and called for the construction of a bor@@ der@@ wall , to prevent illegal immig@@ rants . &quot;
&quot; as the pole , it is not so person@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a ran@@ ced relationship of Tru@@ m@@ ps ( &quot; The O@@ ma was born @-@ born Tru@@ mp , The pa was born @-@ born Heinz &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the win@@ eg@@ rower in retirement sees the American more dist@@ ancing , &quot; he is always so rising . &quot;
believes that Tru@@ mp is coming from ?
&quot; I cannot imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
he never fought around K@@ all@@ stadt .
&quot; the Pens@@ ione performed in Ver@@ on@@ ika Sch@@ ramm is talking like some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters , that a desc@@ endant of the Heinz with a visit to something for the church rule came , which was generally well written . &quot;
&quot; I cannot imagine it by Donald Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; it is better to make it better , because &quot; that has such radical views , I do not know whether that is good . &quot;
&quot; if those who had at the time of his grandfather in the US had had the saying , would have been like him , &quot; he had never arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ ken Sarah Stage . &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; my president is not &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; and : &quot; the grapes are also ri@@ pe without the President Tru@@ mp . &quot;

seven &apos;s Sunrise domin@@ ates the votes in spite of the attempts of Nine in order to take loss of leadership at the Today show
&quot; Karl Stef@@ ano@@ vic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son came to Can@@ ber@@ ra , to report on the loss of leadership of the liber@@ alism , but it has no large shif@@ ts in the reviews for today . &quot;
the breakfast show of Nine was issued by the Federal capital of Germany as Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull received the overthrow of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .

&quot; this dis@@ advantage of the board seemed to play a part in the Australian TV viewer , since Sunrise at an average of 39@@ 7.@@ 000 spect@@ ators compared to the five capitals in comparison with today 33@@ 9.@@ 000 . &quot;
&quot; today , an easy increase compared to the ratings on Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but their number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3.000 ) . &quot;
today has closed the gap of sunrise in the last few months .
&quot; in August Today looks at an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to the 33@@ 0.000 of Sunrise . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , the distance between 4@@ 0,000 and 50.000 . &quot;
&quot; up to now in September 2015 , Sunrise at an average of 34@@ 9.@@ 000 spect@@ ators become 3@@ 14.@@ 000 in today . &quot;
this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
the win@@ ch of the change concern this dawn more than the parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine ; thanks for the review !

the last three voices : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secret revealed ? ...
&quot; Lana Al@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fell@@ ows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki , maybe have un@@ kn@@ ow@@ ingly , who wins The Bachelor . &quot;
&quot; the woman , at the Sam Wood was finally launched in The Bachelor &apos;s degree , was revealed in the greatest secret . &quot;
&quot; and none of the three left @-@ loving girls will certainly not award , whether she is the one that has received the last rose . &quot;
&quot; but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , Sne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and Lana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fell@@ ows on the day before you check out three two , you may possibly give an indication of who the winner will be . &quot;
Sam Wood holds its lips until finale on Thursday on Thursday
&quot; all three women have been behind a lyr@@ ical way above , why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of hum@@ our , amb@@ ition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is posed , &quot; If not you , who was the Woods &apos;s last rose ? &quot; &quot; could their answers to the player who won the heart of the torrent . &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fell@@ ows and Mark@@ os@@ ki t@@ ense both quickly - except itself - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from the first day .
&quot; from the moment when I went to the house and ( Sar@@ ah ) and Sam@@ s energies re@@ marked , I noticed that they were quite compatible and I have thought that the full course of the show &quot; , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fell@@ ows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah is standing with both feet on earth , it is so much fun to be together with her , &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot;
I have seen them together and they have the correct chemistry .
they feel pleasant and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a pair .
&quot; from her point of view M@@ ack@@ ay said , that the landlord met last week her clearly that Wood was &quot; &quot; One . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; once I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this obviously is not just a game - I am un@@ condition@@ ally set to him , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when she was asked to choose whom Wood was to drink , if not she , she was en@@ ig@@ matic . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the left @-@ loved girls alike - it is a draw between Sne@@ z@@ ana and Lana .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the U.S. - and there were many other teams working after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
&quot; but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and Trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula , and it looks like a clever decision . &quot;
&quot; some trainers could have b@@ anned Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bank , as he lost an angel record , as it was the Aussie @-@ Rug@@ by @-@ League con@@ versions at his first P@@ unt @-@ Return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minnesota . &quot;
but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to a P@@ unt @-@ Return and also into the ongoing game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula still showed his true face in the changing cabin after the game .
&quot; instead of the ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team led by the mill to m@@ ole , he encouraged them . &quot;
Tom@@ s@@ ula strengthened Hay@@ ne also openly in his press conference after the match .
&quot; the 49@@ ers Spor@@ re@@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special teams @-@ ordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ g@@ he@@ y , who spoke to him to forget his pat@@ ched F@@ ang and to take care of the next game . &quot;
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne pat@@ ched at a P@@ unt which was restored in the first quarter of the Minnesota Vik@@ ings
&quot; certainly it was not the start , the Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian coun@@ sel@@ or had hop@@ ed for his N@@ FL Deb@@ ate . &quot;
Hay@@ ne left after the um@@ ble flu@@ ently the game field and told later the Australian Radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not imagine a bad start into his N@@ FL career .
&quot; it was an item that is now available , you just takes care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot;
Hay@@ ne settled the car@@ ver with his Orig@@ in Deb@@ ir at that time in 2007 when a pass was carried out in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
&quot; overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;

&quot; the FW @-@ Chief critic@@ ized that several states were not consistently : &quot; we are a nation@@ wide , uniform standards of the Bundesländer . &quot;

20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were wo@@ unded ; he said .

Google will start dou@@ bling donations to collect 11 million $ for refugees
&quot; Google Inc ( GO@@ O@@ GL . O ) announced a dou@@ bling donations campaign that aims to bring 11 million US $ for humanitarian organization , bringing the thousands of refugees to escape from the war of tor@@ n and ver@@ ished countries . &quot;
Google has an un@@ common personal approach in promoting the donations of their blog .
&quot; instead of leaving a manager to make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who had fled to her family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old , about her personal experiences . &quot;
&quot; our trip belong@@ ed many dark train and bus trips , so hungry , thir@@ st , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; but since it grew to the refuge@@ e and migrants crisis in Europe , many people are looking for help as my family des@@ perate after help . &quot;
&quot; donations go to four char@@ itable organisations that provide help for refugees and migrants : doctors With@@ out Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Com@@ miss@@ ar for refugees . &quot;
Google said that the first global funds collected up to 5.5 million will be dou@@ bled at $ 5.5 million on google@@ .com / while at 11 million $ .
&quot; Europe is faced with its worst refuge@@ e crisis since World War II , largely dominated by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , who has driven more than 4 million people this year . &quot;

for slightly overweight di@@ ab@@ etics can be useful loss surgery helpful .
the advantages of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last for a new trial at least five years .
it is still too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery longer live than those that do not receive surgical treatments .
&quot; the mort@@ ality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of the weight loss surgery that has written an editorial to the new study in J@@ ama Surgery . &quot;
&quot; weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use different methods to res@@ ize the size of the stomach . &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the bodi@@ ly ability to absor@@ b food .
obesity has proven obesity operations to treat type @-@ 2 diabetes as efficient but most studies were conducted with people who are path@@ y with a body @-@ Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
&quot; BM@@ I , a degree of weight regarding size , is regarded as normal between 18,@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 . &quot;
a BM@@ I of 25 or more shows that someone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I about 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ gov / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v
&quot; for the new study , researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital Data , which they have collected since 2007 and compare two types of obesity Surgery - Mag@@ enb@@ yp@@ ass and Mag@@ y@@ tu@@ b@@ ular to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight . &quot;
&quot; the average BM@@ I among those who under@@ go this operation , decre@@ ased from 31 to 24,@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the BM@@ I remained with those who did non @-@ surgical diabetes @-@ treatments were approximately the same at 29 . &quot;
&quot; with those who subje@@ cted themselves to surgical procedure , det@@ est with 36 % the diabetes disease , and at 28 % in part . &quot;
in the medic@@ ally @-@ treated group it proved to be fully only about two percent in the comparison of diabetes and sometimes only about two percent .
&quot; in addition , the results were on the controls of blood pressure , the trigger cer@@ ide and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL Chol@@ ester@@ ols &quot; in general better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , &quot; found the authors . &quot;
the researchers also alert the patient blood levels of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
&quot; C@@ 1@@ c lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , do not write the researchers . &quot;
after the operation the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level of roughly 9 percent to around 6 percent .
&quot; however , in the medical therapy Group however it remains stable with about 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - how you reflects in the improved h@@ ull @-@ glob@@ als A@@ 1@@ c level - decre@@ ased not the mort@@ ality in five years , so the introdu@@ ctory researcher Dr. chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also offers average results at the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year the b@@ yp@@ ass surgery @-@ group had lost more weight ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14,@@ 2 kg ) , reached larger back@@ drop in BM@@ I ( 7,@@ 4 % vs. 2.6 % ) and adjusted more into a complete over@@ coming the diabetes ( 46.@@ 9 % vs. 16,@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study is not a survival of the surgery after five years , there are evidence from a study hard @-@ based people in Sweden , that surgery will lead to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study it was involved in obes@@ e people who drew to an obesity , about 29 percent less likely in the course of 15 years - compared to a group , the un@@ conventional methods tried . &quot;
&quot; although the new study has no advantage for survival in the surgery @-@ patient , said Black@@ stone , it is soothing for people with a BM@@ I under 35 , which are interested in the process . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation is lower in the lower BM@@ I group , without raised risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot;
&quot; Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start to take weight seriously , as soon as the patient lies with its BM@@ I between 27 and 30 . &quot;
&quot; I think we are waiting too long until we take people to take it seriously , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
I think that as soon as they accumul@@ ated this genetic changes that have glu@@ ed their bodies with obesity and diabetes is a revers@@ al really hard .

it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; Europe could not take all refugees said , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution of the refuge@@ e crisis in the Middle East . &quot;
the Tibetan @-@ Buddhist guide invited to end the violence in the home countries of the refugees .
&quot; the Dalai Lama spoke the problem of the ongoing refuge@@ e crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford , which is dedicated to eth@@ ics studies . &quot;
he ur@@ ged that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; he also stressed that the reaction of the Western European countries is ad@@ mi@@ red to the refuge@@ e crisis , but the situation is not adequate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dalai Lama , Germany and Austrian efforts to get out of addressing the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think over long @-@ term solutions such as true peace and real development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries . &quot;
in the end we must think about the killing in their countries .
we have to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the application of force never has this problem , &quot; he added . &quot;
the Dalai Lama said the problem of violence and commented George Bush &apos;s actions after the terror@@ ist attack from 11 September and asked that the violent reaction of the US moved a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
&quot; after September 11 I expressed my cond@@ ol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him , the way to resol@@ ving this problem lies in non@@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his mot@@ ives were good , but he made force one , and this has caused false consequences , &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
four @-@ fold increase from in@@ gest@@ ion of hand@@ some infe@@ ct@@ ants by children in the past 4 years
&quot; tox@@ ins in the US report on an almost 400 % increase in the number of children under twelve years of age , which are heavily alcoholic and infectious diseases , such as Georgia Po@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , clim@@ bs the cases of revenues of hand@@ craft tools in children under 12 years of age , from 3,@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children are getting closer to these products , and unfortunately , a percentage of them are going in notes , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot;
he said that some children dis@@ infe@@ ct@@ ants are vis@@ ib@@ ly drinking during some of it to impress their friends or try because of a transformation of social media .
videos on YouTube show how young people dis@@ infe@@ ct@@ ants just because of a cheap experience .
young people have sup@@ pos@@ edly dis@@ infe@@ ct@@ ant with non @-@ alcoholic mouth@@ wash in order to keep a harder drink .
younger children can be removed from attractive frag@@ ran@@ ces of dis@@ infe@@ ct@@ ants .
&quot; a child doesn &apos;t think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand @-@ dis@@ infe@@ ct@@ ants ) are those that are par@@ ked .
there are dis@@ infe@@ ct@@ ants with straw@@ berry and orange ships that are very appe@@ aling for children .
hand@@ dis@@ infe@@ ct@@ ant included anywhere between 45 and 95 percent of alcohol .
especially with inf@@ ants few spl@@ ash can lead to alcohol @-@ poison@@ ing .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; told Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the ven@@ ous centre at the University of K@@ ansas , the radio Fox 4 in H@@ ansa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you would leave no si@@ p whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand dis@@ infe@@ ct@@ ant within reach of children , and if children come on it then it is a quick way to consume much of alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ ij@@ ah Russell , a six @-@ year girl , which recently taken four spl@@ ash of straw@@ berry sc@@ rub@@ bing de@@ dis@@ infe@@ ct@@ ant in school , was brought into a shelter . &quot;
&quot; your blood @-@ alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the thres@@ hold that goes by an adult legally as dr@@ unk , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , a shelter doctor who treated it at the G@@ winn@@ et Medical Center outside of Atlanta . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ ij@@ ah got their words and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency .
doctors over@@ grown them over night in a separate children &apos;s clinic on signs of deer trau@@ ma as the girl had fallen because of the alcohol and had the head up@@ wards , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey . &quot;
&quot; this was very wor@@ ris@@ ome , &quot; said Or@@ d Scott , N@@ ha@@ ij@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has parents and teachers advised to use non @-@ free products or dis@@ infe@@ ct@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
via alcoh@@ ols in addition were some dis@@ infe@@ ct@@ ants with deaths .
&quot; in 2013 , two women in Ontario , for the slau@@ gh@@ ter@@ ings of the slopes , which contained an toxic , non @-@ clear ingredient . &quot;
&quot; health authorities assume that the product eth@@ anol is contained , a mort@@ al solution , rather than eth@@ yl@@ al@@ alcohol , which has been noted as a drug . &quot;
&quot; in January scheduled three students in the fourth class in the state New York , their &quot; &quot; teacher tra@@ ded &quot; &quot; to po@@ ached by anti @-@ bacterial products in round the class@@ room , it is a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly anti @-@ oxid@@ ant allergic to hand@@ dis@@ infe@@ ct@@ ants and not@@ ified them out of their space .
the police observed the failed plan as &quot; bo@@ iling &quot; and lab@@ ies discipl@@ ined policies to the debt authority .

we often lau@@ gh a lot when we speak .
&quot; the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen in order to record what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma griev@@ ed me on Twitter , my im@@ part@@ iality . &quot;
here is the lesson .
&quot; tell the story of the in@@ mate , how he wants it , and you get access . &quot;
I compl@@ icate on her .
&quot; they faces that they could &quot; &quot; it could have better wor@@ ding , &quot; &quot; but it still thinks that it is wrong , what I do . &quot;
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and written .
&quot; he does not tell me what I have to write , and I would not do it even if he would do it . &quot;
&quot; I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time . &quot;
&quot; however , he wants that an international re@@ porter is present to write there . &quot;
&quot; when he dies , he thinks that the publ@@ icity work of movement against the death penalty . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ porter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the event , please hear the series of pod@@ casts that I have done . &quot;
I will not go here again for all the details .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is in@@ no@@ cent .
his actions after the ass@@ ass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would do him guilty to be an benefici@@ ary of action .
&quot; but I believe that a strong li@@ kel@@ ih@@ ood exists , that he is not guilty of the mor@@ ality . &quot;
I believe that there is no enough evidence to just@@ ify a fat@@ ness .
I believe that its execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will die .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porters to which you can turn for them .
&quot; what you will get from me is , what it is said to see a man a un@@ necessary death . &quot;
male after fe@@ igned police Per@@ ch@@ ase hunt @-@ per@@ su@@ aded to come from the C@@ anning River
c@@ anning V@@ ale polic@@ eman was dry when he sp@@ ake the man from the C@@ anning River .
&quot; an attempt to prevent a man from Perth to the police were un@@ successful , as he found himself in the s@@ ighting and sw@@ amp@@ y water , a few meters from a police officer &apos; tried , tried to over@@ ride him soft to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was founded on Tuesday to a cem@@ ented life in pel@@ vic .
&quot; when she discovered the suspe@@ cts , he tried to escape them towards C@@ anning River . &quot;
but he did not come too far .
&quot; he stood in the water@@ - and said &apos; I do not come out , come and get me , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Sh@@ and@@ ell Cast@@ le@@ dine . &quot;
&quot; const@@ able Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too excited to make his uniform , therefore he turned a reliable t@@ actic to - &quot; a good polic@@ eman . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ le@@ dine . &quot;
painting @-@ foot@@ ball@@ ers Ben Cous@@ in offers an unforgettable example .
&quot; in 2006 cous@@ ins went into the dit@@ ch , to escape a alcohol control and then tried to swim through the Swan river . &quot;
his efforts were un@@ successful but inspired immig@@ rants to the hum@@ orous plan of a Ben Cous@@ in Bi@@ athlon .
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards att@@ empt@@ ed to send it off and thre@@ aten to end the racing .
&quot; Peter Moo@@ dy says that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a sp@@ y in its st@@ ables , and turned off the race immediately . &quot;
&quot; he focused on the ste@@ wards and the integrity Department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they carried out a personal campaign against him with the Late Sc@@ rat@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai due to a racing day , the last Stro@@ h@@ hal@@ m on Wednesday . &quot;
Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for the racing sport and he has found himself under difficult circumstances when it comes to the positive cob@@ alt @-@ Tup@@ fer@@ probe at Lid@@ aris which he is not able to explain .
he had given birth back 18 months due to the esp@@ ion@@ age accus@@ ations and did not want to see it as too high the grapes .
&quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I have long forgotten it , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything gets out at once , &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot;
you know that it will go on .
&quot; sometimes people are respond@@ ing , and you have to live with the consequences , and I must live with it what I said . &quot;
I will go home ton@@ ight and sleep well today .
&quot; I would like to move about the world , and I want to think that my owners think that I am trying to do my best for them . &quot;
&quot; when they begin to think , I do not do that , then I should not be more trainers . &quot;
I have to think about what I do with my license .
&quot; previously , Moo@@ dy had the bom@@ b in an interview with rac@@ ing.com so I tried to let the integrity of the integrity in Germany . &quot;
&quot; just eight@@ een months season@@ ing Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart in a room with a man - I will call to give him information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy on Rac@@ ing.com . &quot;
they said that I am a sc@@ amm@@ ers .
&quot; if that is the case , they should certainly believe in their n@@ oses , because in the attempt to believe me . &quot;
&quot; President of RV@@ L , David Moo@@ dy , President of RV@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ und@@ ry , later CEO of RV@@ L , were aware of this at the time and are still today . &quot;
should I bring this to the view that it personally becomes ?
&quot; if the RV@@ L has turned and makes people outside of trainers responsible for what is going on in the industry ? &quot;
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
perhaps people think out there that I am .
&quot; perhaps they must take me my license and do me , and I have no doubt that what I say , will now think about it . &quot;
&quot; but I am now at the point where I do no matter , and that makes me sad . &quot;
this really makes me sad .
I will put pressure on them and p@@ ushing them to make a decision .
I have got the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the fru@@ ct@@ ations of the trainer have built up with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt test at Lid@@ ari , and the Late Sc@@ rat@@ ching began to say that he could &quot; &quot; throw his license through the table . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Moo@@ dy , best known for its preparation of the dis@@ continued Me@@ isters Black C@@ avi@@ ar , called after a pack of mud or sound on the horse deb@@ ated , was pushed into the rules concerning the rules . &quot;
&quot; it is opposed to the rules of racing .
&quot; I must take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
one of my employees has mist@@ aken mud on the leg .
it could have been that evening before .
it could have been the whole day yesterday so that was .
it also had such a race day .
Moo@@ dy might be faced with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the pack of the race . an examination of this matter has been opened .
it is a joke .
&quot; people who set up these rules , know nothing about the horse . &quot;
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here one has gone too far , &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot;
man to Ch@@ est

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy is fighting against ri@@ vals due to flo@@ od@@ ing
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has criticism of the tr@@ ackl@@ ing of his players as &quot; Agenda @-@ Sett@@ ing &quot; by two prime League Champion of the NR@@ L .
Sydney Roo@@ sters Trainer gest@@ ent Robinson says that the arbit@@ rators of the Storm &apos;s winners will be allowed with his team during the High Storm victory in Sydney on Friday evening .
&quot; Brisbane Bron@@ cos Trainer Wayne Ben@@ nett made a hard @-@ del@@ ayed comment to the Storm team , after his crew achieved the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday evening . he called the game a &quot; para@@ dig@@ m &quot; of Rug@@ by League and said that the two of Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; good . &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy def@@ ended the Tac@@ clim@@ bs of his crew and said that in the tr@@ ackl@@ ing only on their &quot; contact . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading coach on his team agree with him , because it was wor@@ rying that they did not worry about the storm @-@ team . &quot;
&quot; this always emerg@@ es - I have not heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson via E@@ ring battles , when she had struck us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; I can guarantee that in all year we have changed in our def@@ ensive system or techniques . but in the past six weeks , we have done our contact with tr@@ ackl@@ es to a real focus , and that has demonstrated for us the turning point . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to exercise . he is therefore probably not acc@@ ustom@@ ed to lose , so it was a bit a shock for him . &quot;
it is funny just as it appeared at this time of year .
Bell@@ amy has attacked the idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and rem@@ inded that Ben@@ net@@ ts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dragons the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; bo@@ red &quot; football won .
Wayne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; he &apos;s playing his game on the Saturday evening with our on Fri@@ day@@ night and how exciting their game was , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was considered a boring team , and Wayne stated that he will take care of a sh@@ it . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team who can play this and watch this as exciting , especially his young players with their speed . &quot;
that is the ball game that you want to play when you have these kinds of players .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt , making them as they can play . &quot;
&quot; I build a stronger confidence , because they say these things because they are a bit worried to play against us . &quot;
six weeks ago they have probably not thought of us when it went to the big games .
Bell@@ amy pointed out that the game Storm against Roo@@ sters had a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against Cow@@ boys .
&quot; the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I have not yet viewed it , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two other attempts at our game , but is it an exciting game ? &quot;
or are breaks and no points are a thr@@ illing ?
for me it is the sched@@ ules .
&quot; when they mention , it means that we will meet in one step into it . &quot;
&quot; the Storm team has been free on this weekend , as they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks at the next Saturday evening at the A@@ AMI &apos;s park . ticket sales starts from the next morning morning . &quot;
Serb@@ ian with 200@@ .@@ 000 $ deposit to Ad@@ mission
&quot; a man who could suffer a li@@ fel@@ ong sentence because of his lot@@ us , in the possession of 40 kil@@ ograms of Kok@@ ain , was acqu@@ ered for Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a deposit of 200@@ .@@ 000 $ . &quot;
&quot; Marko Mak@@ sim@@ ovic , 29 , was one of the five men , arrested last month after the Bundes@@ pol@@ ize@@ dek took place 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , and placed in August in Co@@ om@@ era . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ sim@@ ovic was observed , as he met his fellow def@@ endants in the course of the morning and later at the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police took 40 kil@@ ograms of the drug in a Toyota echo . &quot;
&quot; despite a possibly viable penalty for att@@ empt@@ ing to own a commercial crowd of Kok@@ ain , that there was no evidence showing that he tried to own the whole multitude and that in the café could have been harmless of an harmless reason . &quot;
&quot; the judge on the Supreme Court , Peter F@@ ag@@ an , was worried about the flu@@ ence of Mak@@ sim@@ ovic . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he often travelled to Serbia , &quot; he declared the judgment on Wednesday . &quot;
in the Stra@@ p he put the police over his where@@ ab@@ outs .
&quot; Mak@@ sim@@ ov@@ ics mother and ste@@ pf@@ ather had a caution of 200@@ .@@ 000 dollars as a security for being offered together in order to achieve its freedom . &quot;
&quot; after reading the hum@@ ble explanations for the two persons it is clear that the edition of a security of 200@@ .@@ 000 dollars a real financial load , &quot; said Justice fl@@ ag@@ an . &quot;
&quot; but that alone will not be sufficient to hold him away , not to appear , war@@ ned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ sim@@ ovic was released against damage , under the conditions that he ab@@ bey his Australian and his Serb@@ ian pass , and joined the police on a daily basis and stick to a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;

Schle@@ izer soft to small border trans@@ itions to Germany

the mass makes it : every two years the car@@ makers have shown their novel@@ ties .
&quot; in 2015 , there is mainly movement on comfort , which are currently very well sell . &quot;
cars from the comp@@ actor are currently wonder@@ ed : approximately 28.@@ 1 percent of new certifications passed according to Kraft@@ werk @-@ Federal Office ( KBA ) only in August on this segment .
this is also reflected on the I@@ AA ( public stage 17 to 27 September ) .
between all the fut@@ ur@@ istic concepts and new world @-@ class vehicles and super@@ cars are presented this year mainly many new compact models .
&quot; one of the biggest premium for the German auto@@ buses is the Opel Astra , which will stand in the autumn by the dealers . &quot;
&quot; it is an extremely important model for us , &quot; &quot; R@@ üssel@@ sheim . &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; in order to make the volume model as well , the new Astra will not be much more expensive . &quot;
Opel represents an entry below the largest ri@@ vals VW Golf in view that starts at 17 650 Euros .
the current Astra is from 16 990 Euro .
the Astra is with a new 1.4 @-@ Liter @-@ engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; in addition , the Hes@@ sia also provide additional diesel engines and gas@@ oline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 PS , for which the first time also three @-@ cylinder gas@@ oline engines . &quot;
unlike the most important compet@@ itor VW Golf and Ford Focus there are the Opel Astra only as five thousand .
as a second variant will follow in the spring of the com@@ bi that is already shown on the I@@ AA .
and what will then be used in addition to the Astra on the I@@ AA ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sent the fourth generation of his Astra Mé@@ gan@@ e in the race .
at the fair the Mé@@ gan@@ e only has to be seen as a five @-@ five straps in a conventional and a stressed active GT version .
&quot; to trade marks the beginning of next year , then also as a com@@ bi . &quot;
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan berry wants to find his position in the strong growing segment with the new model .
here the compact Infin@@ iti contains the compact Infin@@ iti with its curved lines fully integrated into the design line of the brand .
the main model is used for a gas@@ oline engine with a power of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
but also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also celeb@@ rating the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno in Frankfurt its world premiere .
&quot; the model is offered with gas@@ oline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ Liter @-@ Tur@@ bom@@ ot@@ or and a power of 82 kW / 111 hp . &quot;
the maximum torque is up to 170 Nm ³ ( Nm ) .
sales of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
&quot; DS 4 : not completely new , but completely renewed the compact class dell DS 4 , which is based on the I@@ AA . &quot;
outside the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n @-@ offsprings and all hand on the front@@ parts : here was the Gras@@ shop@@ per newly drawn and the continued head@@ light equipped with LED technology .
&quot; in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system was updated , the number of buttons is reduced by a touch@@ screen and is used for the first time Ap@@ ples Car@@ play . &quot;
added singing at the I@@ AA in the comp@@ actor is a series of cap@@ tures and new varieties like the refres@@ hed Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 308 GT@@ I .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square metres of cell are deser@@ ted
the Federal Const@@ it@@ onal Court is entitled to an ex @-@ prisoners of the pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary Te@@ gel which was accommod@@ ated for a small cell in a small cell .
&quot; because of the injury of its human dignity , prisoners are generally claim to financial compensation , when they are located in small cells . &quot;
this is the Federal Const@@ it@@ onal Court in an on Wednesday published decision .
suffer@@ ers may even hope to the judges even then to the money if they were locked within walking distance of a few days ( A@@ z . : 1 Bv@@ R 112@@ 7 / 14 ) .
&quot; this was an ex @-@ mate with its Const@@ it@@ utional Court in Karlsruhe , he was divided in the Just@@ it@@ enti@@ ary Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel between June and November 2009 , and the toilet was spacious . &quot;
&quot; after that , the man , who has been back on the foot after his pen@@ e@@ wald , has been published on an open cell , has been displac@@ ed into a bigger cell . &quot;
his official advoc@@ ates because of the un@@ worthy question of im@@ prison@@ ment against the land of Berlin is illegal .
&quot; however , the constit@@ utional refer@@ ee took place the judgment of the Chamber of Berlin on and transferred to the event to ren@@ ew consideration . &quot;
you will see the man &apos;s dignity .
Kammer@@ chor now decides on the amount of compensation
&quot; even if for legal reasons , only a few days left for compensation for compensation , be a result of dis@@ claim , was it meant . &quot;
otherwise it would be a bl@@ ind@@ les of the legal protection of the personality .
the chamber court must now clarify the amount of money .
the constit@@ utional order have often strengthened the rights of prisoners of law in the past .
&quot; thus they spoke to the beginning of April a men , because he was naked in a cell . &quot;
human un@@ worthy is subje@@ cted to a decision of 2011 according to the majority of a cell without separate toilet .
&quot; in addition , I confirm the Berlin Const@@ it@@ utional Court on Wednesday and had a decent accommodation in November 2009 . &quot;
the former r@@ acket was divided over three months every day from 15 to 21 hours in a similar cell like in Karlsruhe .
the Berlin pris@@ ons were in the last few weeks also because of missing staff in the head@@ lines .
&quot; prisoners are therefore again included 23 hours including Ag@@ gressi@@ veness , even to be pun@@ ct@@ ured for the t@@ ense situation . &quot;
&quot; after information of the judi@@ cial service , 21 places in Te@@ gel for need@@ ling @-@ dogs are not occupied , 19 should be away . &quot;
Angela Merkel and the refuge@@ e policy : &quot; we are doing it &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the German Chancellor is decided to take them away .
what is coming to Germany ?
&quot; around 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers , according to forecasts of the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs will come to Germany after the statement of vice @-@ ch@@ anc@@ ellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany even in the position to accommodate a million refugees . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated in the light of the unusual challenge resolution : &quot; I say again and again : we can do it and we are able to create that . &quot;
what matters to Germany is provided with the following view .
&quot; according to different forecasts of 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el @-@ Institut ) apartments annually , and the next five years . &quot;
&quot; it is almost twice as much as it has been built ( 250@@ ,000 houses ) . &quot;
&quot; dramatic is the lack of housing , but especially in paying ten@@ ants : annually fall 60@@ 000 to 80@@ 000 @-@ wine apartments from the rental price @-@ binding , and around these particularly favourable apartments are also to apply refugees too . &quot;
&quot; Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ric@@ ks ( SPD ) is therefore intended to double the promotion , from € 518 million to one billion euros . &quot;
&quot; much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el @-@ Institute : 80 000 @-@ wing carpet annually , the federal government would have to invest in the amount of 6.4 billion euros a year . &quot;
scientists and federal minist@@ ries in this respect that there are also more tax benefits for investments in the housing .
estimates of the Institute of labour market research and occupational research is to assume that 55 percent of the refugees can be reduced in Germany over the long term .
&quot; however , the refugees in Germany were not systemat@@ ically asked about their qualification to help them , critic@@ ise Claudia Walter , project management for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation . &quot;
but for the integration of refugees is crucial as to whether they work in Germany .
&quot; work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the decision area , but also for self este@@ em of the immig@@ rants , says Mig@@ rations Diet@@ rich Thr@@ ush@@ hardt . &quot;
in Germany it has been a political change according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt - from the working prohib@@ ition of refugees for the recognition of labor .
&quot; while it used to be an labour market for asylum seek@@ ers for up to five years , this was reduced in November 2014 on three months , as well as the resid@@ ences that reserve asylum seek@@ ers on a residence . &quot;
&quot; in society itself , also because of the lack of qualified labour @-@ labour , the view of which should be made possible more quickly access to the labour market . &quot;
a great hur@@ dle for access to the labour market are missing German .
until now there is still no sufficient offer of general and career @-@ related courses .
studies also show that jobs are often given to personal contact .
the structure of networks therefore is certified by Thr@@ ush@@ hardt the roy@@ s@@ way for working @-@ integration .
&quot; the Berlin office management has found that only a few vacc@@ inated parents can enter their children in the kit@@ ten , estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the ent@@ ro@@ oted parents , it is only once important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ schem@@ bar , Spe@@ aker for Youth and family in the Berlin council . &quot;
&quot; to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration is distributed in different languages . &quot;
&quot; should the demand for educ@@ ators increase shar@@ ply by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate try to increase the training capacity - about to appro@@ ve more medical schools . &quot;
in the countries a student is prepared without a German knowledge of will in the lessons .
&quot; however , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also of teachers , who have only a qualification in German as secondary . &quot;
&quot; there is no short@@ coming , says Be@@ ate St@@ offers from the Berlin school administration . &quot;
the German Stud@@ enten@@ werk is estimated that about 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study .
&quot; in principle no federal and asylum seek@@ ers or , the study - the only exception was Berlin , Inn@@ ens@@ en@@ ator Frank H@@ enkel ( CD@@ U ) has now returned its position now . &quot;
student refugees could become facilit@@ ating access to the university .
&quot; for refugees with a residence permit or Dul@@ ing do not receive any services according to the asylum @-@ Law , if they begin a study . &quot;
&quot; the latter is generally not a BA@@ f@@ ö@@ G , as it does not fall under the circle of b@@ af@@ aring persons . &quot;
&quot; the refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be eligible for BA@@ f@@ ö@@ G , on 1 January 2016 , this sp@@ ying on 15 months . &quot;
&quot; but this funding representation must also be closed , calling Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s Secretary for Science , and the German Stud@@ enten@@ werk . &quot;
the students should now get BA@@ f@@ ö@@ G .
&quot; Islam will in future play a more important role , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should suc@@ ces@@ si@@ vely the same rights as they have the churches , and the existing state @-@ churches @-@ right to develop a new state of religion . &quot;
&quot; it would also be important for the establishment of an Islamic @-@ welfare state , which is profession@@ ally taking care of the new@@ com@@ ers . &quot;
the rights are also obligations .
&quot; so , the representatives of Islam will have to face a clear point of contact and be ready to work with the state in many areas and to get some check @-@ ups . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the willingness to act in religious fundament@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , commented on Thursday the concern , religious conflicts can also be registered to Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted to turn such conflicts in Germany , &quot; immediately have their right to stay here in Germany , &quot; he said in the Bay@@ rische Broad@@ casting . &quot;
he suggested to translate the principles on Arabic to Arabic .
integration will now be much more than a subject of the whole society in the future .
&quot; thus , the majority of society will also have to change the elimination of discrimination and seg@@ reg@@ ism . &quot;
Germany has - as a result of European decisions - a anti @-@ discrimination place and a general equilib@@ rium .
&quot; but it lear@@ ns very slowly that the N@@ SU @-@ M@@ ord@@ on showed that the police and authorities were systemat@@ ically ignor@@ ant . &quot;
equal opportunities for all : what migrants organizations and stakeholders are already calling for international agreements such as anti @-@ terrorism in Germany and to take advantage of the country &apos;s anti @-@ terrorism law to remain peaceful in the coming years and to take advantage of its new citizens - for the benefit of all .
&quot; in general , Germany is capable of supply the expected refugees in medic@@ ally , &quot; says physicians president Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; regarding Man@@ - Power and capacities , we create that , &quot; he said the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
&quot; however , there must be additional money to flow in the system . &quot;
&quot; to avoid eng@@ ul@@ ment , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery , calls for all travellers to match the registration of health cards . &quot;
it could be settled later with the Länder .
&quot; and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able ; so many people in the field must ad@@ here to the extent that the asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
otherwise we have to create the doctors in particular to create language barriers .
&quot; hi@@ ther@@ to , so far the Berlin health care has been proven by a Bor@@ de , they are worse worse about their diseases than other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in clinics , also in doctor &apos;s practices or you would have to be taken over . &quot;
&quot; however , many refugees would also be attended by many refugees as well as with more general health problems in the emergency . &quot;
and with a different diagnostic look .
&quot; under refuge@@ e sc@@ ars , for instance , there was significantly more un@@ treated disabilities ; and in the youth it is about HIV @-@ intelligence . &quot;
&quot; with some other path@@ ological subjects , German doctors che@@ ers away from their training are clear , says Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; paras@@ it@@ ousness or tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis are not as difficult to recognize , &quot; and what the doctor &apos;s lack is concerned , either by the refugees or even relief in sight . &quot;
Syri@@ ans would have developed a high @-@ developed education system ; several refugees were even doctors .
&quot; to under@@ take the use , but they would have to prove their qualifications and would possibly have a call for tests . &quot;
at least half of the refugees in Germany Abstract after estimates of psych@@ otherap@@ eut@@ ics ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) psych@@ ologically sick : most of the suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or de@@ pressions .
&quot; Den@@ der@@ sk@@ inder , explains Diet@@ rich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ k . &quot;
recently published study of the TU München illustr@@ ates that every fifth sy@@ ric refuge@@ e camp is trau@@ mat@@ ised in Germany .
&quot; who is contamin@@ ated in a post@@ trau@@ matic stress @-@ disorder , suffer from the so called Flash@@ backs with air@@ not , vert@@ igo , cardi@@ ac and death @-@ fr@@ ight@@ ening . &quot;
&quot; symptoms are sleeping and concentration , strong shr@@ inking and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; to prevent that symptoms are chron@@ ically , an early treatment is necessary , explained Mun@@ z . &quot;
&quot; however , only four percent of psych@@ ologically @-@ sick refugees has received refugees from psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; although psych@@ ic disease asylum seek@@ ers can make an application for psych@@ otherap@@ ist , but it usually takes several months . &quot;
&quot; moreover , in the social @-@ offices , most of the experts are not educated or doctors who are not trained for psych@@ ic diseases , whether therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this is often used to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z . &quot;

missions in the attitude of Circus are just too often theme with various animal protection organisations .
&quot; Stephanie Pro@@ bst does not take a position on this position , &quot; &quot; How do our animals do not speak well , does not make us good . &quot;
some 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; four @-@ legged rid@@ ists &quot; , &quot; as they are lovingly called , is according to the possibility of every wish from the eyes . &quot;

Hewlett @-@ Packard will build up to 30.000 jobs
Hewlett @-@ Packard is expected to build 25.@@ 000 to 30.000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and savings activity in the services of the company .
HP will later divide it into two parts listed companies and separate the computer and printer businesses from its fast growing company hardware and its service activities .
&quot; expected value results will lead to a burden of more than 2,@@ 7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; this restructuring measures will become a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett @-@ Packard Company , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chair and Chief Executive that should lead the unit after the separation . &quot;
Hewlett @-@ Packard Enterprise is less and more focused than it is today and we have a wide and dee@@ pen@@ ed portfolio of businesses that support companies when transition to a new style of business . &quot;
&quot; as a stand alone , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world . &quot;
&quot; Hewlett @-@ Packard Company has more than 50 billion annual revenue , and is to be focused on providing previously un@@ achieved technology solutions for companies &quot; such an explanation of the company . &quot;
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s by the gradu@@ ates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hewlett and Dave . it was founded in order to establish elect@@ ro @-@ systems and in their Palo Alto garage you called the birth@@ place of Sil@@ icon Valley .
HP has a massive restructuring measures to run the conversion of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
&quot; the measure of HP , the world @-@ largest PC @-@ manufacturers and one of the largest American tech companies , is the newest in this area based on the belief that cr@@ amped businesses get better performance . &quot;
FC Arsen@@ al captain Mich@@ el Art@@ eta says that teamwork is to be placed against the game against dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the lat@@ ent Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; for Wil@@ sh@@ ere , compared to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was first September and where his rehabilitation after schedule , there is no reason why he cannot play before Christmas . &quot;
&quot; this optim@@ istic scenario means already that Wil@@ sh@@ ere must be dropped at least the next four games for England and in view of its history , his participation will surely keep his stake in the next summer at the European Championships for sure . &quot;
the great shame on this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended up the last season after a separate kn@@ otting hur@@ ting and then found back to his old swing during the pre@@ season .
&quot; this kind of injury is not threat@@ ens the career , &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot;
&quot; it is a bone , who does not heal well . &quot;
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it did not stand in connection with his kn@@ uc@@ kl@@ es or with inj@@ uries that he had previously .
&quot; this may be true from purely medical view , but as well as well recognized , there are the related risk of further violations , always when a player attempts to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops a uncomfortable pattern .
the study of Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd has had 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut in six years .
he also played in only 65 of Arsen@@ als 157 Lig@@ ue in the last five game times .
the broader picture of sen@@ al is that in six of eight gam@@ ers since 2007 / 08 one of the two Premier League clubs have been to record most vulner@@ able stage .
&quot; W@@ enger accepts the potential of a vic@@ ious circle , but sen@@ al believes that an improvement in the off@@ ensive employment will last during the last season . &quot;
&quot; sometimes if you come back from injury , you have a chance time period , a time when you have to strengthen your body and gain combat power , &quot; &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope his body stabil@@ izes , I am confident that he will do it and he will run a career of the way he deserves . &quot;
ar@@ sen@@ al begins his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb before playing against Chelsea on Saturday and against T@@ ott@@ en@@ ham Hot@@ sp@@ ur on the next Wednesday and W@@ enger is a rotation within the team .
&quot; Hé@@ ctor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey did not go to Croatia , which means Math@@ ieu Deb@@ uch@@ y and Art@@ eta should start . &quot;
W@@ enger may also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ ro@@ ud instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and the players who need it to have a small off @-@ off , &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot;
&quot; although ar@@ sen@@ al clear people are to go through group F to go to the Mak@@ sim@@ ir stadium in Zagreb , one of the rules with the largest intim@@ idation effect in Europe . &quot;
&quot; dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten after 41 games after the &quot; &quot; inv@@ inc@@ ible &quot; &quot; campaign launched in the last season . &quot;
&quot; the stadium was shot on Tuesday evening by a earthquake , where Rich@@ ter@@ sk@@ ala 3,@@ 2 were measured . &quot;
this year it was the 10th of Zagreb .
&quot; W@@ enger is the opinion that ar@@ sen@@ al has drawn up the lesson from the past season with the Champions League &apos;s capit@@ ulation against Monaco , and remains committed to the distant hope to lead the association to his first Europ@@ ap@@ oc@@ al triumph . &quot;
&quot; this drive is imm@@ en@@ sely , &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot;
it has never worked in ar@@ sen@@ al .
&quot; we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic . &quot;
we are ambitious but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
friendly feast : the com@@ edy @-@ show that gave us serious lessons of co@@ asts
&quot; the absence of similar lay@@ outs in shows is obvious , especially with regard to what needs for men to open , now even more dou@@ bt@@ ter than ever before , such as su@@ icide advise amongst young men on a 15 @-@ year @-@ high . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important deaths in men aged 20 to 45 in Britain , and there is three times more common in men than women . &quot;
&quot; to tackle the problem , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - campaign against an ab@@ ject life ) 2015 to ask the goal to ask the culture to seek the help if they need these . &quot;
friendship is the heart of the heart to tackle this challenge .
&quot; a recent study with more than 2.000 high @-@ school students with de@@ pressive symptoms proved that , if the suff@@ erer had a sufficient high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood &quot; , &quot; his chances of con@@ val@@ idation . &quot;
for those who are not de@@ pressed form a circle of mental healthy friends the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends for a friendship with a friendship .
&quot; in the age of social media , communication with its focus on style about substance is often more important than a significant contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital life have the need to appear strong , life @-@ funny and successful , dou@@ bles , even if in reality the isolation is domin@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; its su@@ perf@@ icial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists about extr@@ in@@ ic values , money , image , social status , all at costs intr@@ in@@ sic values - our inner long@@ ing for personal development and friendship that affects our spiritual health a lot . &quot;
and like a vide@@ og@@ ame invent@@ ors and bill@@ ion@@ aire recently declared that money can really not be bought .
the Beautiful at Friends was that this focus was put on the head .
&quot; each character was not determined by his labour , but by its personality that gl@@ owed by the interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler , most frequent h@@ ugs , moments in the foot@@ prints and the year@@ ning from Ross to Rachel - all this came out of the knowledge that men can defin@@ ately keep them back , even if they often go back , completely their feelings . &quot;
&quot; as an employee of telephone call it stated : ... &quot; &quot; my audi@@ ences for people who feel de@@ pressed and su@@ icide in danger , has shown me a lot clearly , as even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
&quot; the men who contact us , often feel not able to talk with friends . &quot;
&quot; the old re @-@ dev@@ otion &quot; &quot; I come to the right &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , like the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when one talks about problems openly . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to my mind when I try to offer a long @-@ term ir@@ dest mechanism .
you are clearly presenting the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
&quot; so much my objective out@@ sider @-@ state can also help people look in moments of desp@@ air , who &apos;s long term assistance comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
&quot; and so , when you visit this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the celebration of the day completely re@@ designed scenery , why do not take your friends to have a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or , even better if you want to sit around at Star@@ bu@@ cks someone alone , give him a smile and say Hello . &quot;
one never knows which difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent to com@@ edy Central from the beginning until the end - the total 236 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
&quot; Mary meets to help PS@@ G to help , Malmö to zer@@ mal@@ ice &quot;
angel Di Maria celeb@@ rates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ idi and Ed@@ in@@ son Cav@@ ani after his hit against Malmö .
di Maria meets his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to prevent PS@@ G to Malmö .
here are the gameplay and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ in@@ son Cav@@ ani stopped course as Paris Saint @-@ Germain presents his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malmö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park stadium on Tuesday started .
&quot; di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his champion League Deb@@ it than PS@@ G &apos;s players who brought the French Master on his way , but afterwards she has increased a series of occasions , before they finally increased their lead , as Cav@@ ani in the 6@@ 1st minute a head gate . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and chess j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k in group A needed Paris a strong start to the Swedish masters since they are not only to strive for the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ ions , but an improvement on the way to the quarter @-@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they got the points , there was no winner of Laurent Blan@@ cs Team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ him@@ ov@@ ics missed chance in front of the gate . he was later in the game against his home town team and against the association , with whom he began his illustr@@ ating career already in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it is not easy to win at home or in@@ ward in the Champions League . therefore , it is a good start to win 2 : 0 , to cause our enemies , even if there are certain things that we have to develop in the course of season , &quot; said Blanc . &quot;
&quot; this is a good sign .
we wanted to win and we won yet although I regret that we did not have achieved one or two other gates .
&quot; I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic returned to his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , that could last a 2 : 2 Un@@ decided on own place against Bordeaux in the first League , but he was aired in the fourth minute by Di Maria . &quot;
&quot; Argentin@@ ian T@@ ing@@ get@@ away was then referred to as the man who took the PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe when he was transferred to Manchester United States when he went in Marco Ver@@ r@@ att@@ is Pass behind the Malmö defence , and passed into the long corner of the network . &quot;
&quot; however , someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , which was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malmö , Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach this level , entered into the field with nine national players on the field and was charged with a five @-@ man defence and two deep in mid @-@ field , a heavy opponent . &quot;
&quot; but apart from a shot of Nik@@ ola Dj@@ ur@@ dj@@ ic , who contributed far to Kevin Tr@@ apps P@@ fo@@ g in the 34@@ th minute , they offered little in the attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G himself did sometimes relate to , with some mis@@ demon@@ s and poor ending , not least of I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic , who were in no less than five sins alone in the first half pat@@ ched and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had appointed him after rest@@ art@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; yet he had much more skill when he brought his fellow @-@ players to the game , and it was a pass away from I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic , the Di Maria in a revol@@ t shot , which was contributed by Wil@@ ot in the 56@@ th minute on the P@@ fo@@ g ... &quot;
&quot; the second gate finally fell short after the hour &apos;s mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the number of ay@@ er achieved his sixth Sa@@ is@@ ont@@ or , after I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic had a left fl@@ ank of Max@@ well . &quot;
&quot; ended up all thought that Malmö can come back to the game , and only an excellent intervention of Wil@@ and from shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , before the final result was w@@ aking out , before condu@@ ctors player E@@ ze@@ qu@@ iel Lav@@ e@@ zzi was a gate at the end . &quot;
&quot; the coach of Malmö , Age H@@ are@@ ide , gave later that PS@@ G played a class about his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; &quot; our last Champions League game was last year . &quot;
since then we played only in the Kur@@ dish League which did not have the same level .
&quot; qualifying , we did not reach qualifying . &quot;
hut in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ avi : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 change to FC Bayern
cosmos and Europ@@ ap@@ ister X@@ avi is playing in summer 2015 for the al @-@ S@@ ort Sport Club in Qatar
the FC Bayern was obviously a few years ago just before the commitment of Spain Super@@ star X@@ avi , which was then played for FC Barcelona . &quot;
&quot; eight times more Spanish champion , three times of poker players , four times champion @-@ le@@ champion , two times champion @-@ champion , two times champion , one time world champion - the title list of X@@ avi is breathtaking . &quot;
in summer the now 35 @-@ year @-@ olds after 24 years left the FC Barcelona and changed to al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar .
&quot; yet , in an interview with the Mar@@ ca X@@ avi , he discovered that he had already stood before the say goodbye to Barcelona before the F@@ act of Barcelona . &quot;
they said me that Bar@@ ça sell me to mount .
&quot; Madrid at that time was all , we do nothing . &quot;
and that was registered also the FC Bayern .
&quot; X@@ avi : &quot; &quot; there was a offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted to have me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann was adopted the FC Bayern . &quot;
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi was not variable
the transition did not come about .
and the decisive man for this is still working for the German record : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; X@@ avi said , why &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça have reached Guardi@@ ola from Lisbon and I have played a great way . &quot;
PE@@ P said to me that I would not change the team without doubt .
&quot; thus , he cast me off . &quot;
who knows how Bay@@ erns play &apos;s game in 2008 / 2009 with X@@ avi .
&quot; X@@ avi stand@@ ings for Bar@@ ca in the quarter @-@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the whole distance on the lawn , the reds ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated at the end of the roy@@ alty triumph . &quot;
matt Dam@@ on plays diversity in film
matt Dam@@ on confronted the af@@ ro@@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about the diversity and said they will not need behind the scenes .
&quot; during a result of Sunday Night of H@@ B@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown , recognized as this the need for alternative perspectives , with regard to a black prot@@ agon@@ ists in the chosen screen@@ play of the project . &quot;
&quot; when we talk about variety , then do so in the occupation of the film and not the occupation of the show &quot; &quot; insur@@ te Dam@@ on . &quot;
Brown re@@ acted sh@@ ocked with off@@ ended un@@ belief and called &quot; ho@@ o ! Wow . okay . &quot; when the comments of the actor came from The Mart@@ ian .
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the production of Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to ask people to think about it - who will always be the director - how to treat the figure of Harmony , &quot; Brown first said . &quot;
the only black person and she is a Nut@@ shell that is be@@ aten by her white Zu@@ h@@ age .
&quot; the producer of De@@ ar White People sat down for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for direct@@ ing the right to the film ; Dam@@ on argu@@ ed that their director , at the end of us could give something to what we do not want . &quot;
&quot; after the discussion aired , the discussion explo@@ ded , the social media has been ex@@ bill@@ ions about Dam@@ on &apos;s comments . &quot;
&quot; Mr Po@@ oni left his anger across the clip by saying , Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room , so he can explain their variety - that is SO WE@@ ISS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the Twe@@ et served more than 5,000 Ret@@ re@@ ets and 4,000 trucks since its release . &quot;
Dam@@ s comments come at a time when the accurate rac@@ ial representation in the media is at the head of social discussion .
&quot; after the teenage girl , Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white polic@@ emen , the movement of black L@@ ives mat@@ ured land@@ ed effects and authorities to discrimin@@ ate practices against colour@@ ing attacks . &quot;
&quot; in February , the singer Prince creates a scre@@ ening to the movement during the introduction of nom@@ inees &apos;s albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards . &quot;
&quot; album silent , &quot; &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) . &quot;
&quot; as books and black life , their albums are still their meaning . &quot;
&quot; in the younger time leaders of the Black L@@ ives Mat@@ ter , published an explanation and in response to the question of the Fox @-@ News @-@ personality Elisabeth Hassel@@ beck , whether the group should be considered a hate relationship . &quot;
&quot; the network black L@@ ives Mat@@ ter is a love @-@ group , &quot; said the leaders . &quot;
&quot; recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was visiting for a list of entertain@@ ers , producers and media leaders who were invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot;
whether he accepted the invitation or has already taken the Pope is un@@ clear .
&apos; American Ninja Warrior &apos;s First Champion
&quot; professional sport@@ re and operator , Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero was the first athl@@ ete who won the American Ninja Warrior on Monday night and took the Grand Prix of 1 million $ home . &quot;
&quot; the competition show , which completed just their 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who could enter all steps of his obstacle @-@ visits . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the season there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and c@@ amer@@ am@@ an Ge@@ off , until the final . &quot;
in the last task the climbing takes part in a 75 feet long climbing rope in 30 seconds .
&quot; B@@ ritten finished the task within the time , which he had ended the first athl@@ ete during the stren@@ uous stage 4 of American Ninja Warrior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero ended this challenge full three seconds faster than he made him the winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke to us ! News after the highly competitive winning victory , still under shock over the win of the Great prize of 1 million $ . &quot;
&quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned any more than 10,000 dollars or had gotten my life , &quot; said Isaac E ! &quot;
all suddenly .. how I can not even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; leading K@@ ent We@@ ed , the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Re@@ porter to discuss the finale and why B@@ ritten even though he was first finished at all the course , not some prize money . &quot;
the rules goes to the fastest person to the quick@@ est person .
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alists , he gets the one with the quick@@ est time , &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and life changed ; he gets the great Grat@@ ification .
I don &apos;t believe that he h@@ iss@@ ed something about it .
he is just as happy to have done what he did .
crow@@ ds of awards did he receive by fans .
he is such a great guy and a family .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; said to me , &quot; If I should be struck by someone , then I am glad that it is Isaac . &quot;
and I think that Isaac would have felt the same when they had the roles .
America Ninja Warrior League was extended for eight season to start shooting will be started in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers s@@ igh for Minnesota T@@ wins past
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ OL@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit tig@@ ers .
it used to be one of the best teams in bas@@ eball than today the Tig@@ ers stand on the last place in the American League Central .
&quot; the Tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as bo@@ iler , but playing this part on Tuesday perfectly against the Minnesota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in Target Field . &quot;
T@@ wins wast@@ ed a chance of adv@@ ancement within a playing half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card .
&quot; for Detroit , although only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word which was so hard to gr@@ asp by a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all vict@@ ories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Ex@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; Tiger Pit@@ cher Al@@ fredo Simon gave up his early off@@ ensive support , when Detroit had place three times in the first two inside , once in the sixth and then once in ninth . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) proposed 6 times in 1 / 3 inside and made three R@@ uns .
it was just a third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to end this year much , &quot; said Simon . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to throw in bul@@ l@@ ps of each game , and therefore I will concentrate entirely in the game . &quot;
&quot; the design@@ ated tiger @-@ Hit@@ ch Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BI@@ s since the middle of August . &quot;
&quot; it was the first three @-@ hit game of Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against the Seattle , on 6th July . &quot;
&quot; he has looked well with the pl@@ y@@ wood , &quot; said vis@@ m . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at the ( stroke training ) , saw clearly better off in the bul@@ l@@ ump , and he put it straight into the game . &quot;
&quot; with three R@@ uns in the back at the end of the seventh interior , the T@@ wins had their best chance to get into play . &quot;
&quot; center F@@ iel@@ der Byr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton , the In@@ ning ended with a dou@@ bles on the left Fel@@ dl@@ in@@ ie . &quot;
&quot; right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks reached a B@@ unt , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Du@@ z@@ ier to stri@@ ke@@ out before it was replaced by the Lef@@ th@@ and blade Hard@@ y . &quot;
&quot; Hard@@ y over@@ run wall , the only man in which he was faced , in front of the R@@ ookie R@@ ookie R@@ ookie of Miguel S@@ ano , who is the R@@ ookie of Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen a Two @-@ Run . &quot;
with a pair of run@@ ners and the end @-@ run at second brought Ver@@ hagen to the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double Play .
it was in the major League leading 27 times in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ w was able to beat a double Play .
&quot; after Detroit added a Insurance Run at the end of the ninth piece , the Wall was a R@@ BI @-@ Double against the Cl@@ os@@ er of Tig@@ ers Bruce Rond@@ on , generated the status of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
the left @-@ handed sword is S@@ ano with three pit@@ ches for its fifth save .
Detroit benef@@ ited for the pre@@ lu@@ de of the game from an even more movable Phil Hug@@ hes .
&quot; the Tig@@ ers sco@@ red three R@@ uns in the first two parties , which had been painted in front of the game by the viol@@ ability of vulner@@ ability , having received more than a month because of a back @-@ suffering . &quot;
&quot; obviously not the start I desired , &quot; &quot; said Hug@@ hes , &quot; &quot; but I felt well , when I thought out and felt that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches in the third in@@ ning . &quot;
&quot; after they received the Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ bat@@ ter , Hus@@ band gave a single to second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; a two @-@ out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z placed in Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z &apos;s game , played a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game . &quot;
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z has awarded its 0 @-@ 21 success series with the run@@ ners in the sc@@ oring position .
&quot; the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed one single on the right hand , made a further run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he att@@ empt@@ ing to get to the third one that was a threat . &quot;
the Tig@@ ers put on the second to sco@@ red an One @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James McC@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single of Center @-@ F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose to 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; it was a great blow , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul mol@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; he did not get well be@@ aten , but he got the right place . &quot;
Hug@@ hes found himself in a Pit@@ ch Count @-@ Count had no points in the third in@@ ning until it was replaced by the rela@@ b .
at Hug@@ hes came there for three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four stri@@ pper outs .
note : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP An@@ ib@@ al San@@ chez exp@@ ired because of a injury to the root school .
it is performed by Dr. James Andre@@ ws to operate the shoulder of San@@ chez in 2007 .
&quot; San@@ chez , since mid August on the vulner@@ list because of a school set , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; with San@@ chez from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris was painted by the viol@@ ability to start the wins . &quot;
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers since he was purchased in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on 30 July
he has fallen since 20 August because of a position in the right h@@ ip wr@@ ist .
the Tig@@ ers and T@@ wins will end their series of three games by target Field on Wednesday .

Isch@@ g : German military measures in Syria an option
&quot; the Manager of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military action with German participation in Syria for a possibility . &quot;
&quot; I believe that the thr@@ illing thinking about military action options must not be held without Germany , &quot; he said . &quot;
it dra@@ ft@@ ed the European states of &quot; collective minds . &quot;
four years ago it was glad that the chal@@ ice of a military participation in Germany has been deb@@ ated .

the EU states so far have not able to agree on a common action in the crisis .
the EU @-@ Finance Minister want to take on a special attraction for the binding distribution of more 120 000 refugees on the next Tuesday ( 22 September ) .
&quot; in the light of the strong refuge@@ e sand@@ ran@@ gs in Germany , the federal government wants to support countries in initial and distribution of people . &quot;
&quot; the covenant would share this together with the countries , announced today at the late Tuesday evening after nearly four @-@ hour consultations with the Prime Minister in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; Merkel has under@@ lined , those people , who smo@@ ked them also . &quot;
but who did not have a le@@ ven@@ ous @-@ purpose spe@@ e@@ ches may not remain in Germany too .
this view was widely used in the round .

Mang@@ os are exotic and ju@@ icy sweet .

&quot; when buying man@@ goes , not too soft or too strong and comfortable . &quot;
&quot; the form@@ work color alone tells nothing about it , like irrit@@ ation the fruit is - so can also taste green man@@ gan@@ ese very tasty . &quot;
you should be consumed in room temperature and should be consumed within a few days .
then they taste naturally pure or sweet meals .
a man@@ go is also a special touch .
they cut the slightly bitter taste of some aph@@ ids such as Ch@@ ico@@ ree and Radi@@ ccio .

Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Place
almost 500 years after the Reformation there is now a Martin Luther @-@ Platz .
&quot; in the presence of town@@ house Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino , on Wednesday a prestigious space in the park on the Op@@ p@@ io hill had been bapt@@ ised in the name of the German re@@ former . &quot;
&quot; he is now called &quot; &quot; German The@@ olog@@ ians &quot; &quot; to the &quot; &quot; German The@@ olog@@ ians &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of Rome just next to the Col@@ osseum .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the Con@@ sortium of the Protestant churches in Rome .
&quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , rem@@ inded that protests in the city of the Pop@@ es over centuries has often only been living in secret by faith . &quot;
with the place I become visible in symb@@ olic style that their tradition of the Christian faith in Rome is welcome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was held as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k around the Jahres@@ wende in 15@@ 10 / 11 a couple of months in Rome .
he received the city at that time as a pro@@ sth@@ al s@@ inner .
his negative impressions might be emp@@ ow@@ ered by histor@@ ians in his later fight against Rome .
Luther had then led with his thes@@ es against the aw@@ ning shift in the spl@@ itting of the Indian Church .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) Dorn@@ enk@@ rone is one of the main works that painted Ot@@ mar Old for his b@@ ible .
Klaus Al@@ te@@ post has updated the introduction and Bible lyrics .
in the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible who is now published with gorgeous paintings now . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Old who formulated his very personal interpret@@ ations from paper and canvas in 150 designs . &quot;
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colours and imagin@@ ative shapes have received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
&quot; on the contrary : the respective topics , it can quite be quite dark . &quot;
&quot; about three years Ot@@ mar Alto has worked on his b@@ ible project , for which he has made a subjective @-@ artistic selection from the many thematic areas of &quot; &quot; Book of all books . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; contracts , which are issues such as cru@@ ises , pl@@ agues , commandments or f@@ ather@@ land . &quot;
he has proved spont@@ aneously thanks to several partners : this applies to the Luther Verlag with his the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler Publishing company with its main focus on art books .
&quot; and there is especially the author Klaus Al@@ te@@ post , which is devoted to the basis of painting with the respective Bible question . &quot;
&quot; he interpreted the Bible from Ot@@ mar Alt selected Bible sites and thus translated into the present , translated into current contex@@ ts . &quot; &quot;
these texts are as verb@@ ally mirror of al@@ ts paintings .
&quot; nestled between the original Bib@@ ione , from Martin Luther and each set of the artist , he formulated his very personal thoughts on the respective situation . &quot;
the jewelry has golden Let@@ tern .
&quot; thus , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows for twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high level of intim@@ acy .
&quot; emotions were ultimately being born at all for the b@@ ible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , 1940 in Wer@@ n@@ ig@@ ero@@ de born and raised in Berlin , comes from a family who belong@@ ed to the strict prot@@ est@@ ant Herr@@ n@@ h@@ uter med@@ als . &quot;
&quot; then the education has already been with the cl@@ ass , &quot; Ot@@ mar Old . &quot;
&quot; I tried to work out of this , and perhaps to bear with the Lord father again for me again . &quot;
&quot; his second concern may , in order to increase the art in faster time : &quot; the perception of image world is today characterised by advertising , and that is loud . &quot;
symbol@@ ism is then driven .
artists also have a different desire and a pleasure to show things .
pictures are always something myst@@ ical and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Old wishes to let the viewer go into the pictures , &quot; &quot; let them come , discover and feel what strength they have : &quot; &quot; the picture looks for his counter@@ part . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Al@@ te@@ post was on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , who has always been &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Art . &quot; I like to understand how he understands with his pictures . &quot;
&quot; I have not suggest@@ ive the Bible to compreh@@ end the Bible , but selected for him the most important , even mysterious themes . &quot;
&quot; this was not collaboration on eye level , &quot; says Al@@ te@@ post : &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text explains only . &quot;
&quot; for Hans Mö@@ h@@ ler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to dee@@ pen their lives and find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s images speak for both the ( biblical ) language of love and responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas images - is presented for the first time in an exhibition which will be opened on November 15th in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation .
construction @-@ start for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn
&quot; plans made , place found , businesses commissioned , terre@@ strial rests for a circuit . one year later , almost everything was finished - but still before the official opening of the BM@@ X @-@ Bahn was finally possible . &quot;
&quot; om@@ issions in politics and administration made for compar@@ ing , especially in the residents that the railway does not end@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; so hills de@@ ported , new place sought - now with shaped planning and application for building permission . &quot;
&quot; the approval will enter in October , the first municipal director of Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ B@@ ock was now in the nur@@ ser@@ y and youth @-@ committee . &quot;
&quot; I hope that this year is still visible , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it should then be started without &quot; &quot; more commem@@ or@@ atory &quot; &quot; with the work of the former indoor swimming pool . &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fied engagement for refugees
&quot; the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees to 2019 , and the Bundes@@ l@@ iga marks an obvious sign on the weekend . &quot;
the football is respond@@ ing to the situation in Germany and sec@@ ures politics to find his help in dealing with the challenges ahead .
&quot; I think that is the greatest challenge of our country since re@@ unification .
&quot; there cannot be said in principle no one , that goes nothing , I have nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; this must be interested in making a handle on this subject , &quot; said DF@@ B @-@ CEO Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; in the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to intensi@@ fy the refuge@@ e situation in Germany intensi@@ vely . &quot;
&quot; I am the next Wednesday in the ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ ery and meet there the power of the Federal Republic of O@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z , and the ch@@ anc@@ ellor . &quot;
&quot; the topic will certainly play a central role , &quot; he announced . &quot;
the football could and could help .
but the crucial course must make politics .
the Deutsche Bundes@@ federation is therefore awarded its refuge@@ e initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome . &quot;
&quot; about the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun &apos;s foundation , we ensured that this program runs until 2019 , &quot; said ren@@ s@@ bach at the edge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
also some Bundes@@ l@@ iga support this program .
already this weekend the 36 Pro@@ fi@@ res constitutes a significant sign when they can lead to the left tribe of the otherwise usual sponsor@@ ship ( Her@@ mes ) of the im@@ print &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &apos; .
&quot; we also want to make it clear that all should help , where and how they can only &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen Sport@@ i Völ@@ s &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and drew the project as &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refuge@@ e drama is about every one , nobody is allowed to see . &quot;
&quot; we can use football ment@@ ees , no , we must use our radi@@ ance , our influence and our opportunities in order to help the many refugees who have so incredibly unbelie@@ v@@ ably , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
Hoff@@ en@@ heim@@ s Managing Director Peter Dot@@ tig said of a &quot; prominent mark of le@@ ague . &quot;
EM @-@ Qual@@ ification @-@ game against Hungary on this Friday is the national team of women 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
Nier@@ s@@ bach drew the support for refugees as a &quot; a great commun@@ al work of German football . &quot;
&quot; that all 36 lic@@ ences had started their own projects , be great . &quot;
absolutely great is that small and smallest clubs are active there .
&quot; the message &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome , &quot; which we have spent is lived in football . &quot;
&quot; it is of enormous importance , &quot; he said . &quot;
this year marks the association together with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government at 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees .
&quot; the Associ@@ ations have already called the whole sum for 2015 &quot; , &quot; said ren@@ ders . &quot;
reports : SAP User@@ name loses an eye in an accident
&quot; the Chairman of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has been estimated several reports according to a fall earlier July early July . &quot;
&quot; after the accident at the stair@@ way in the house of his brother in the USA , he fell into a glass of water after midnight that he was held in his left hand , reports &quot; &quot; econom@@ ists &quot; &quot; on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; he is almost ble@@ eding , was impot@@ ent , then it has out of tow@@ ed to the street - that he tells us so last week , &quot; quoted the &quot; Wi@@ where &quot; SAP @-@ co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could result in his work .
&quot; beginning October we meet in front of the board of directors in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot;
the 54 years old manager is at the meeting and &quot; fully functional . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( tu@@ es@@ day@@ .de ) he will go back to Germany in October and will carry on the software group .
&quot; I am full of SAP , fully in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course , I stood a regular contact with the super@@ visory board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t yo@@ dels usually between Germany and the US but since the summer it was no longer in the German SAP centr@@ ale in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; it is important to him to go to public with such a personal story , said the manager of &quot; S@@ Z &quot; : &quot; everyone can happen such a thing . &quot;
&quot; important is to stand up again , if you really liked . &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ spare pilot Magn@@ us@@ hes out of skir@@ mis@@ hes ...
&quot; Magn@@ us@@ sen t@@ wit@@ ter@@ te an appropriate photo and declared , he suffered the injury , when he was short@@ ened by the wheel . &quot;
&quot; he therefore comes with post@@ pon@@ ds in Singapore at the weekend as little as a reservoir for the two tri@@ but@@ s Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button , as a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan . &quot;
football : B@@ VB without re@@ us against Kras@@ no@@ dar : We@@ iden@@ feller in the gate
&quot; at Bor@@ us@@ sia , all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us in the first group game of Europe League finally hit . &quot;
the national champion is missing the table leader of the soccer le@@ ague also in the du@@ el with the F@@ K Kras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7 pm / Sky ) .
&quot; unfortunately we cannot touch him back , &quot; Thomas Tu@@ chel said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; whether Re@@ us on Sunday will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ l@@ iga @-@ Top@@ game against Le@@ verk@@ usen , left the B@@ VB @-@ Coach : &quot; we reck@@ on with a return from him to training on Friday . &quot;
&quot; in light of the high burden of his pro@@ s , Tu@@ chel its headquarters are not only changing on the Re@@ us position . &quot;
so he announced a change on the door@@ keepers .
therefore Roman We@@ iden@@ ken@@ feller the place of b@@ art@@ ender Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; he trained at an absolute top @-@ level , pra@@ ised the football master the world champion . &quot;
&quot; whether We@@ iden@@ feller in the future comes in all European @-@ le@@ ague playing , tou@@ ching however open . &quot;
with high prob@@ ability he will also dispute the second participation .
&quot; the research statement of fellow @-@ players Re@@ us , that the fin@@ alists should be for the B@@ NB in the Europa League this goal is to mean mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian We@@ ig@@ l for understand@@ able : &quot; that &apos;s Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
&quot; I think we have a good chance to access the title . &quot;
Robot@@ er@@ aut@@ os : the government wants the cutting edge for Germany
Germany shall be according to the will of the federal government to be in the course of the vehicles of technological pre@@ domin@@ ating .
the Ar@@ kab@@ in@@ ett decided on Wednesday a Strateg@@ o from the house of traff@@ ick@@ in@@ ister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( C@@ SU ) that provides further investment in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the Autom@@ esse I@@ AA of a &quot; New Mobility Age . &quot;
automated and connected driving are going to raise traffic safety and to ensure less energy efficiency said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t .
he wants to discuss the topic with his counter@@ part from the G@@ 7 states which will also meet with representatives of industry on the I@@ AA .
the Strateg@@ ic@@ paper of transportation is under@@ lined the importance of mobile Broad@@ band structure and a fast mot@@ ion@@ ing on digital radio .
the testing of new technology currently is produced on the motorway 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; to make the driver &quot; &quot; no additional liability limits &quot; , &quot; the federal government wants to ver@@ ify the legal framework conditions and , where needed to adapt to the new developments . &quot;
&quot; thus , Germany is going to use internationally such that the per@@ mis@@ sible top @-@ speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicles raised from 10 to 130 St@@ und@@ enk@@ il@@ ometer . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government is also intended to push for a change of the Vienna Convention , which so far only considers the human being as a driver . &quot;
&quot; automated driving takes over in increasing the car that driving the car , the driver becomes more and more for passenger . &quot;
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds .
&quot; after one of the economic dis@@ claimer of the study , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways until 2020 can be technically possible . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , cars are to be expected on public roads &quot; &quot; far from 2020 . &quot;
value added value in the field of navigation systems and the highly automated timetable of the company in Germany appreciate the authors of the study for 2025 to around 8.4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of the PK@@ W@@ s can lead to more safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said the SPD @-@ road to S@@ ören Bart@@ ol . &quot;
the question of liability in inc@@ idents and the security of the personal data of the drivers are clearly clear .
still the German self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicles are skept@@ ical - much more than French or Americans .
&quot; an on Wednesday at the AA @-@ occas@@ ional survey of the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the audit@@ or DE@@ K@@ RA will come to the result that only eight percent of Germans believe that aut@@ on@@ ous vehicles have to asser@@ t themselves , 32 percent do not expect in 20 years now , 31 percent do not believe in all of them . &quot;
&quot; in France 21 percent of respond@@ ents to 2025 with aut@@ on@@ ous cars , in the US 33 percent . &quot;
drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
&quot; according to a collection of the digital transformation of BIT@@ KO@@ M , only seven percent will agree that control throughout the whole ride on all roads . &quot;
&quot; on the free@@ way , in running traffic can also imagine 15 percent in running traffic in the St@@ au 45 percent . &quot;
virtually every fle@@ e would leave the car under no circumstances .
Bol@@ l tells team@@ - and double @-@ start with table @-@ tennis @-@ EM at
Düssel@@ dor@@ fer wants to present its current status to date with the title of September 25 until October 4 only in single .
the final decision will fall by September 22 at the latest .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the guys have experienced it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; but we are strong enough , even without Timo the title , &quot; Bun@@ dest@@ rainer Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the EM @-@ Lehr@@ s in Düsseldorf . &quot;
Bol@@ l was at that time on the flight to a agreed cons@@ or@@ tium to China at this time in the flight .
the 34 years old German champion is expected on Friday .
&quot; without Timo the dis@@ advantage , we are now no longer such a clear favorite , &quot; explained Single @-@ European sisters , Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot;
&quot; the Ham@@ el@@ ner that leads the S@@ etz@@ burg in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , but also rec@@ alled to the EM 2013 in Schwe@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; back then Timo Schei@@ der , and we have become European camp@@ ions . &quot;
&quot; we should be oriented , &quot; &quot; said the Wel@@ d@@ rank @-@ De@@ uter@@ us . &quot;
the English football team Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United has moved a serious violation of the right leg .

&quot; Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an enemy , &quot;
it is a mix of very big fashion show and wax cra@@ yon ( 63 ) feature of the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins that look thanks to video proje@@ ctions .
&quot; they wear the spectacular creations of the French designer , which among other things with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits the great star of the fashion scene - and with it that he put men in skirts . &quot;
&quot; I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant , the Haute C@@ out@@ ure , because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; it used to be ble@@ ached , now it is real , &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ ite . &quot;
&quot; for visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , it is lucky that the Mo@@ des@@ pot@@ ters has changed his beginning to a look at a look at his beginning . &quot;
&quot; actually he was against it . &quot; &quot; for me an exhibition came a bit after death , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; when one dies , you come to the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection had previously made in Montreal and in Paris .
&quot; it is about so much more than just beautiful clothes , &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ en . &quot;
&quot; it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society . &quot;
&quot; the exhibits have an insight into the barely @-@ looking work of the man , the fashion story , without ever performed an education . &quot;
&quot; Chron@@ ologically is the show not built , but it is a perfectly chore@@ o@@ grap@@ hed total work that was done for much effort : to fr@@ ase the dolls , for example , a styl@@ ist is engaged . &quot;
&quot; 14 tons of stuff created the creators to the information of the cur@@ ators Thierry @-@ Max@@ ime Lor@@ io@@ t , to Munich . &quot;
&quot; just before the start of the Okt@@ ober@@ fest there was a special treat : a leather h@@ osen @-@ dress with cor@@ s@@ ett . &quot;
Heidi meets Madonna .
&quot; he is always interested in strong women ( &quot; women are sm@@ arter than men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , said Gau@@ l@@ ite . &quot;
also Gau@@ l &apos;s old Teddy is to be seen in the exhibition .
&quot; he stands for the first , funny @-@ fashion@@ ed hearing of the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he attracted his Teddy &apos;s and d@@ resses , called Gau@@ l@@ ite . &quot;
&quot; playing with a pupp@@ et , his parents would not have allowed him . &quot;
the ab@@ ject of fashion has joined later by himself .
he st@@ ahl and looked at the dra@@ fts of other designers about how Gau@@ l@@ tier told in Munich .
later I bought it but of course also bought .
for his first own fashion show he did not pay the Models .
&quot; they got nothing , but they were afraid . &quot;
jewellery instead of Gard@@ on - Pl@@ au@@ ener tip as fashion @-@ n@@ iche
it used to make it to the long embro@@ ider@@ y machines in and around Pl@@ auen .
the embro@@ i@@ dered substances and l@@ aces were created in great quantity for clients that supplies them for example to blank@@ ets and she@@ ers .
&quot; today , this alone does not work anymore , says Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of Mo@@ eb@@ erg@@ ous Pl@@ auen . &quot;
&quot; instead , the fashion is important . &quot;
in the starting times of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze fashion has played a major role then driven by the home @-@ textile industry - and now is re@@ discovered as N@@ iche .
&quot; Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : head in jewelry , with accessories such as bags and with regional traction . &quot;
&quot; made the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which bor@@ row@@ ed off at past styl@@ istic periods , a increasing number of potential . &quot;
&quot; who are not served in the textile industry in Germany , is no longer the market . &quot;
with us they already make half of all orders .
Mo@@ eb@@ ri@@ al Pl@@ auen is one of the nine further company members of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze and Emb@@ ro@@ ider@@ ies .
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
over the last 15 years some 80 percent of the sales approach were broken down .
private stores and the wholesale trade are almost no longer there .
our products are hardly able to reach the customer in that way .
the mass @-@ ware made a lot cheaper nowadays in the Asian region and almost exclusively distributed over chains .
&quot; besides , export of export , currently to Russia and the US . &quot;
enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; industry @-@ linked also tries to focus on environmental awareness , such as Cord@@ ula Bauer by the Emb@@ ro@@ ider@@ mis in Fal@@ ken@@ stein : &quot; &quot; for this year we introduce a quality assurance that shows that we produce ecological and socially toler@@ able . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this refers to the materials used . &quot;
Ute Schmidt is dedicated to the tra@@ eber@@ ger University of Zw@@ ick@@ au - in the Faculty of Applied Arts - and is specialized in embro@@ ider@@ ies and tips .
&quot; to counter the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high quality and innovative products . &quot;
it takes time and courage .
&quot; there is a voltage field between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the factories that need to think mainly economically , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; therefore , a already existing design will often be easily modul@@ ated to maintain a customer . &quot;
a couple of years ago animated 3D @-@ donkeys Kat@@ i Re@@ uter was the historical in@@ fin@@ al@@ tip .
&quot; thereby , the machine drew a small cell . &quot;
the Pl@@ au@@ ener Gold@@ ding@@ h@@ master@@ in Bianca Hal@@ li@@ ach @-@ Kr@@ au@@ ße was inspired by this : &quot; before I was able to start anything from traditional tile .
now she uses the cutting tip for their jewelry .
in a elab@@ orate procedure they character@@ izes the patterns in silver .
&quot; many people in the region identify with the theme Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot;
&quot; it also supplies to the USA , to Australia and from Finland - mainly to customers , their ancestors in Pl@@ auen and surroundings and want to have a sou@@ venir piece . &quot;
this way I see my jewelry as a modern amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze .
Disney is planning new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; film
&quot; legends should not be stir@@ red , but Disney is still watching a new film of his classic &quot; &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to &quot; &quot; Entertainment Weekly &quot; &quot; it is not about a re @-@ filter , but a way continuation of the 20 years after the first film plays with the magic n@@ anny . &quot;
it is a question of the experience of the F@@ anny with family Banks in times of the world crisis in England .
who p@@ opp@@ ins plays more than 50 years after Julie Andre@@ ws is still un@@ clear .
&quot; but the director stands firmly , Rob Marshall , last with &quot; In@@ to the Woods &quot; in the cinema . &quot;
XI p@@ ushing the economy wider for the world
&quot; the economy has to open up wider outside , to promote growth , said President Xi Jin@@ ping on Tuesday of a group who was commissioned with the steering conversion . &quot;
&quot; China should use to improve foreign investment and know @-@ how and to improve the strategies for business organisation , &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the headquarters group for the dee@@ pen@@ ing of a comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; innovation to promote and implement reforms will generate new moment@@ um and vitality , and new place for economic growth , &quot; said Xi . &quot;
&quot; the management group has adopted a series of policies adopted , including a neg@@ atives to control the market development , relaxation of the State management ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ hau@@ l of the inhabitants of Mel@@ des@@ ystems . &quot;
&quot; after the statement , a negative report will be generated , the sectors and businesses are identified , which are not necessary for investment . &quot;
the system is gradually improved and improved by test programmes .
&quot; the initiative is of importance since it ass@@ igns the market a greater role in al@@ loc@@ ating resources , a legally relevant business environment and open the market open , said the statement . &quot;
the government will also control inspe@@ ctions on the powers to the company and to ensure that companies decide how they perform their business .
&quot; the statement also said that China becomes border regions , new models of cross @-@ border economic operation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth . &quot;
&quot; to open sectors during a quot@@ a , state controlled controlled sectors , further areas will be open for private investment . &quot;
&quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the right@@ ful interests of alien businesses and bring better services to it , &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , it will be easier for foreigners simply to request a permanent residence permit , or to request the &quot; Green Card . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to guarantee the right of lawyers to exercise their work , and to use professional judges and pro@@ secut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting . &quot;
in the session also Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ iang and important leaders like Li@@ u Yun@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli where it was reported in a statement published after the meeting .
EU wants to double Mercury
the European Commission wants to double the border values for mer@@ cur@@ y in large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish and hence the consumer with a significantly higher dosage of the nervous system .
&quot; the consumer organisation Food@@ watch , who represents an appropriate working paper of the EU , critic@@ ized the plans . &quot;
&quot; Wolf@@ sch@@ midt to form the thres@@ hold of the nervous system for big fish at the end of the food chain , like Hai@@ der or s@@ word@@ fish from a &quot; &quot; economic grounds &quot; &quot; taken from one to two mill@@ ig@@ ram of Mercury per kil@@ ograms of fish . &quot;
&quot; large pre@@ dat@@ ory Fish are already loaded too strong with Mercury @-@ fish , that on the basis of the still existing limit values can not be sold as much as 50 per cent of the fo@@ als . &quot;
after dou@@ bling of the thres@@ hold values we would only have 14.@@ 5 percent un@@ mistak@@ able .
&quot; in return to this sl@@ ack@@ ening , the EU does not want to ex@@ termin@@ ate the border values at other fish by currently 0,5 mill@@ ig@@ ram on 0.1 mill@@ ig@@ ram tas@@ ks@@ il@@ ber per kil@@ og@@ ram . &quot;
&quot; Food@@ watch refer this but as &quot; &quot; trick &quot; &quot; because smaller peace @-@ fish , such as carp , mostly are so low , that they keep the planned high@@ s already today . &quot;
&quot; the di@@ version with law@@ ns is therefore &quot; a per@@ fi@@ des dist@@ ill @-@ player , which helps the economy by &quot; &quot; Wolf@@ sch@@ midt &quot; . &quot; &quot;
Mercury is great for the people of high @-@ toxic heavy metal that extends over the food chain in particular in cat@@ fish @-@ fish .
the German government is therefore war@@ ned that &quot; the fact that &quot; even small quantities can be used especially in the nervous system of the nervous system . &quot;
&quot; the federal state of the state office lies on its homepage with regard to effective high@@ scores , but that a &quot; health threat of the general population &quot; will not be expected . &quot;
Mercury is primarily coming through coal se@@ com@@ bust@@ ion into the environment .
German coal power plants work according to a written information of the Federal Ministry of Finance to the Green @-@ Bundestag Ann@@ alena Ba@@ erb@@ ock received more than six tonnes of Mercury in Germany two thir@@ ds of the Federal Republic of Germany .
&quot; the concentration of Mercury in fishing is approximately in the Elbe , Rhine and Danube is &quot; permanent and &quot; @-@ covered &quot; , &quot; the &quot; mirror &quot; had been c@@ ited in March from the paper . &quot;
last year European warnings of Mercury in fish have already been reported on the most common reported medical risks in the EU @-@ War@@ n@@ system RA@@ S@@ FF .
