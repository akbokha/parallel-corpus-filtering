this document is a summary of the European Public Be@@ ur@@ ances ( EP@@ AR ) which is discussed as the Committee on Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) carried out in order to obtain recommendations concerning the application of the drug .
&quot; if you require any further information about your disease or treatment , please read the package passing ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; if you wish further information regarding the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of tablets , as a 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of mel@@ ting tablets ( tablets that can be absorbed in the mouth ) as a solution to inser@@ tion ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; B. wir@@ res thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or vision of things that are not present ) , mi@@ str@@ ust and ins@@ anity ; • Bi@@ polar disorder , in which the patients have man@@ ic episodes ( periods ) altern@@ ately with periods of normal mood . &quot;
&quot; A@@ bili@@ fy is used to treat medium to severe man@@ ic episodes , and for the prevention of man@@ ic episodes in patients who used in the past on the drug . &quot;
the inj@@ ect@@ solution will be used for fast control of fu@@ eled un@@ rest or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders when the or@@ ale ing@@ esting of the drug is not possible .
&quot; in both conditions , the solution can be used or the mel@@ ting @-@ coated patients may be used in patients with the swal@@ low of tablets difficulties . &quot;
&quot; in patients who want to take other medicines , which are just as advertis@@ ed , should be adapted as the dose of furnishings . &quot;
&quot; this affects the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters &quot; , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable communication of ner@@ ve cells . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ atom also works primarily as &quot; particip@@ atory Ag@@ on@@ ist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ Hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also Ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in ) .
&quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ as 5 @-@ Hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and D@@ op@@ amine , but in a slight extent than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters used to activate the recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; da D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ Hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ pol@@ ar@@ er distur@@ b@@ ance play a role to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and their re@@ act is prevented . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of furnishings , to prevent the re @-@ operation of symptoms , was examined in three studies above up to one year . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies at 8@@ 05 patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia or similar diseases , which suffered at me@@ at@@ ched un@@ rest , over a period of two hours with a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in another study , A@@ bili@@ fy over twelve weeks at 3@@ 47 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l , in a different study the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy and plac@@ ebo , re@@ acting to 160 patients , where the man@@ ic symptoms have already been stabili@@ zed with A@@ bili@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution was compared to a study of 301 patients with bi@@ pol@@ ar@@ er disorder , which suffered an un@@ interrupted un@@ rest , compared to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ik@@ um ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours . &quot;
&quot; in all studies , the changes in symptoms of patients were examined using a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who were addressed to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; the company also led studies to investigate how the body carries the mel@@ ting tablets , and the solution to take res@@ or@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies with the injection solution shown patients , the A@@ bili@@ fy in cans of 5,@@ 25 mg , 19,@@ mg or 15 mg received , a significant stronger decrease in symptoms were given un@@ rest than the patients who received a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
with the application for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder decreased as@@ bili@@ fy in four of the five Kur@@ zz@@ eit@@ ing studies man@@ ic symptoms more effective than plac@@ ebo .
&quot; A@@ bili@@ fy by more than 74 weeks , more effective than plac@@ ebo the re@@ act man@@ ic episodes of previously treated patients and if it was given in addition to an existing treatment . &quot;
A@@ bili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses reduced also more effective than plac@@ ebo the symptoms gest@@ ed un@@ rest and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
&quot; the most common side effects of furniture fy ( observed at 1 @-@ 10 of 100 patients ) are ex@@ tr@@ ap@@ yram@@ id@@ ale interference ( un@@ folding ) , head@@ ache ( ab@@ sten@@ tion ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , res@@ ting , in@@ som@@ o@@ eness , in@@ som@@ o@@ eness , in@@ som@@ o@@ eness , in@@ som@@ o@@ eness , in@@ som@@ o@@ eness , in@@ som@@ o@@ eness , in@@ som@@ o@@ eness , in@@ som@@ o@@ eness , in@@ som@@ o@@ eness , in@@ som@@ o@@ eness , in@@ som@@ o@@ eness , in@@ som@@ o@@ eness , in@@ som@@ o@@ eness , in@@ som@@ o@@ eness , in@@ som@@ o@@ eness , in@@ som@@ o@@ eness , in@@ som@@ o@@ eness , in@@ som@@ o@@ eness , in@@ som@@ o@@ eness , in@@ som@@ o@@ eness , in@@ som@@ o@@ eness , in@@ som@@ o@@ eness , in@@ som@@ o@@ eness , in@@ som@@ o@@ eness , in@@ som@@ o@@ eness , in@@ som@@ o@@ eness , in@@ som@@ o@@ eness , in@@ som@@ o@@ eness , in@@ som@@ o@@ eness , in@@ som@@ o@@ eness , in@@ som@@ o@@ eness , in@@ som@@ o@@ eness , in@@ som@@ o@@ eness , in@@ som@@ o@@ eness , in@@ som@@ o@@ eness , in@@ som@@ o@@ eness , in@@ som@@ o@@ eness , in@@ som@@ o@@ eness , in@@ som@@ o@@ eness , in@@ som@@ o@@ eness , in@@ som@@ o@@ eness , in@@ som@@ o@@ eness , in@@ som@@ o@@ eness , in@@ som@@ o@@ eness , in@@ som@@ o@@ eness , in@@ som@@ o@@ eness , in@@ som@@ o@@ eness , in@@ som@@ o@@ eness , in@@ som@@ o@@ eness , in@@ som@@ o@@ eness , in@@ som@@ o@@ eness , in@@ som@@ o@@ eness , in@@ som@@ o@@ eness , in@@ som@@ o@@ eness , in@@ som@@ o@@ eness , in@@ som@@ o@@ eness , in@@ som@@ o@@ eness , in@@ som@@ o@@ eness , in@@ som@@ o@@ eness , in@@ som@@ o@@ eness , in@@ som@@ o@@ eness , in@@ som@@ o@@ eness , in@@ som@@ o@@ eness , in@@ som@@ o@@ eness , in@@ som@@ o@@ eness , in@@ som@@ o@@ eness , in@@ som@@ o@@ eness , in@@ som@@ o@@ eness , in@@ som@@ o@@ eness , in@@ som@@ o@@ eness , in@@ som@@ o@@ eness , in@@ som@@ o@@ eness , in@@ som@@ o@@ eness , in@@ som@@ o@@ eness , in@@ som@@ o@@ eness , in@@ som@@ o@@ eness , in@@ som@@ o@@ eness , in@@ som@@ o@@ eness , in@@ som@@ o@@ eness , in@@ som@@ o@@ eness , in@@ som@@ o@@ eness , in@@ som@@ o@@
the Committee on Human@@ cis@@ ion ( CH@@ MP ) is to conclude that the benefits of furniture in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predomin@@ antly man@@ ic episodes and in those of the man@@ ic episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ onym@@ ously spoke to the risks .
&quot; in addition , the Committee came to the result that the benefits of the inj@@ ect@@ arian solution in patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes , if a or@@ ale therapy is not suitable , compared to the risks . &quot;
June 2004 the European Commission to meet Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . a licence for the In@@ dependence of A@@ bili@@ fy in the entire European Union .
A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y is shown for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of Bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predomin@@ antly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ onym@@ an@@ spoken ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended initial dose for A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily independently of the meals .
increased efficiency at doses over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended initial dose for A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as Mon@@ otherapy or Com@@ bin@@ ations therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and Bi@@ polar @-@ I@@ - disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
&quot; with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initi@@ ator should be considered as clinical factors to justify this ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ In@@ duction is set out of the combination therapy should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) .
the appearance of su@@ preme behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after a change of anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy .
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that it was no elevated to patients with bi@@ pol@@ ar@@ er distur@@ b@@ ance with Ari@@ pi@@ dal@@ ene in comparison to other anti@@ psych@@ otic medicines .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ ium should be used with caution in patients with well @-@ known kar@@ di@@ ovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ k@@ ard@@ in@@ colored or con@@ dem@@ ic reduction , flo@@ ppy disease , conditions , which are used for Hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( de@@ hydr@@ ation drugs ) or hyper@@ ton@@ er ( including ak@@ zel@@ er@@ ated medicines ) or hyper@@ ton@@ er ( including ak@@ zel@@ er@@ ated and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which were one year or less dau@@ ed , there were occa@@ sional reports about during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ forced Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia . &quot;
&quot; if at one with A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y treated patients signs and symptoms of a smooth@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esth@@ esia , should be considered to reduce the dose or to break the treatment . &quot;
&quot; when a patient sign and symptoms developed to interpret or un@@ clear high fe@@ ver without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ otic medicines , including A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ ium should be in case of patients with Kr@@ amp@@ fan@@ es in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese or in the conditions that have been applied with caution . &quot;
&quot; 56 - 99 years old ) with arias in patients with psych@@ osis who have been associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who have been treated with Ari@@ pi@@ gen@@ berg , a elevated point in comparison to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; however , there was in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the advocate for unwanted v@@ ascular events with Ari@@ ium @-@ treated patients . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic , in some cases extremely and associated with K@@ eto@@ azi@@ ar or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em Kom@@ a or death , was reported in patients who have been treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y . &quot;
there is no precise risk assessment for hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic @-@ related events with A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs treated patients who allow direct compar@@ isons .
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ uri@@ e , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes Mell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes Mell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in terms of deterioration of glu@@ cos@@ ity values . &quot;
&quot; a weight increases in general in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia patients and patients with bi@@ pol@@ ar@@ er Man@@ or , due to Kom@@ or@@ bid@@ ding , the use of anti@@ psych@@ otic medicines that is known as a side effect , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary effects of Ari@@ pi@@ gen@@ ess to the central nervous system , caution if Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ benzene in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective medicines ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 @-@ Ant@@ agon@@ ist is Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ ine , a mag@@ ens@@ ä@@ ure blo@@ cker , reduces the Res@@ or@@ p@@ ation rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ ism , with this effect however as clin@@ ically not relevant . &quot;
in a clinical study with healthy pro@@ bank@@ rolling increased a highly effective CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( Chin@@ id@@ in ) the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ um 107 % , while the C@@ max remained unchanged . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that other highly effective incre@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , like flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore should be made similar D@@ os@@ is@@ re@@ duc@@ tions . &quot;

if you consider the joint gift from K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol or other highly effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors with A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y should be considered the potential benefits for the patient .
&quot; other highly effective in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ol and HIV Prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , should probably have similar effects and therefore should be made similar D@@ os@@ is@@ re@@ duc@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; after placing the CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , the dosage of A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y should be raised to the D@@ os@@ ish@@ height before the beginning of the accompanying therapy . &quot;
Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y can be reached with an excessive increase of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentr@@ ations .
in clinical studies doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg arias per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ext@@ ro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ method xy@@ morph@@ in@@ an @-@ ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( om@@ ep@@ ra@@ benzene ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ext@@ ro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) . &quot;
&quot; the Pati@@ ents should be advised to notify their doctor , if they are pregnant or to plan a pregnancy during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ ium . &quot;
&quot; due to the insufficient data base for the safety when people and due to the reproduction studies in the animal studies of animal studies , this medicine may not be applied in pregnancy , unless the potential benefits are justified clearly the potential risk for the fet@@ us . &quot;

&quot; the effectiveness of abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a main study , participated in the 460 women with metast@@ atic breast cancer , of which approximately three quarters had previously been a anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ in . &quot;
the effect of abra@@ x@@ ane ( in some gift or as Mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the conventional Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el contained drug ( given in combination with other medicines for the reduction of side effects ) .
&quot; altogether spoke in the main study of 72 ( 31 % ) of the 229 with abra@@ x@@ ane patients treated to the treatment , to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 Pati@@ ents , the conventional Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el contained medicine . &quot;
&quot; seen only the patients who have been treated for the first time because of metast@@ atic breast cancer , there were no difference between drugs and survival for the first time . &quot;
&quot; against the other hand , with Pati@@ ents , which had previously received other treatments for their metast@@ atic breast cancer , with regards to these indicators that abra@@ x@@ ane effective as conventional Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el contained medicine was . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it must not be applied to patients who are silent or before the start of the treatment of low neutr@@ ality pay in the blood . &quot;
&quot; the Committee on Human@@ cis@@ ion ( CH@@ MP ) set forth that abra@@ x@@ ane in Pati@@ ents , where the first treatment did not beat more effective than conventional Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medicine , and that it must not be used in contrast to other Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medicine , to reduce side effects . &quot;

&quot; with sensor@@ ic N@@ europ@@ athy degree 3 is the treatment to break down to degree 1 or 2 , and at all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced . &quot;
there is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dosage adjustment in patients with easy to even imp@@ air@@ ment of the liver function ( see Section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
there were no studies carried out with patients with imp@@ tig@@ ated kid@@ ney function and there is currently no adequate data on the recommendation of dos@@ ages in patients with imp@@ air@@ ment the kid@@ ney function ( see Section 5.2 ) .

&quot; if an allergi@@ c reaction occurs , the medicine should be used immediately and a symp@@ tom@@ atic treatment should be initiated and the patient must not be treated with Pac@@ am@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; in the patients there should be no renewed abra@@ sion treatment cycles , up to 1.5 x 109 / l increased again on &gt; 100 x 109 / l . &quot;
patients with severe liver functioning ( B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with abra@@ sion .

women at child@@ bearing age should apply during and up to 1 month after treatment with abra@@ x@@ ane a reliable contrac@@ tion method .
&quot; male patients , which are treated with abra@@ x@@ ane is advised , while and up to six months after the treatment of no child . &quot;
&quot; male patients should be advised before treatment over a sperm count , since the treatment with abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible infer@@ tility . &quot;
abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as fatigue ( very often ) and shr@@ ub ( common ) that can affect on the traffic and the ability to use machines .

the application of abra@@ x@@ ane for metast@@ atic Mam@@ mak@@ zin@@ om is supported by data of 106 patients in two in@@ comparable trials and 454 patients who have been treated in a random@@ ised phase III comparison .
&quot; in a study , 43 patients were treated with metast@@ atic Mam@@ mak@@ zin@@ om with abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion about 30 minutes by a dosage of 175 mg / m2 . &quot;
in the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as in@@ fusion of 30 minutes to 63 patients with metast@@ atic Mam@@ mak@@ zin@@ om .

&quot; in patients with kid@@ ney problems and in patients who want to make their own blood @-@ blood , is se@@ amed to inj@@ ected in a V@@ ene . &quot;
the injection can also be made by the patient or his super@@ visor if they have received an appropriate instruction .
&quot; in patients with chronic kid@@ ney efficiency , or patients who receive chem@@ otherapy should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per Dec@@ il@@ ite in adults or between 9,@@ 5 and 11 g / dl in children ) . &quot;
&quot; the iron values of all patients are required before the treatment to ensure that no iron lack consists , and iron supplements should be given during the entire treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients who receive chem@@ otherapy , or in patients with kid@@ ney problems can be caused by a y@@ thro@@ po@@ iet@@ al lack or thus that the body does not sufficiently speak on the body &apos;s own y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin . &quot;
Er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin will also be used before operations to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of a blood loss .

Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared with filing as an injection in a v@@ eins within the framework of a main study with 479 patients suffering from one by kid@@ ney problems caused by reference problems .
all patients participating in this study was at least eight weeks old E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in a V@@ ene inj@@ ected before they were either placed on se@@ ab@@ amed or furthermore E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
main Indi@@ c@@ ator for the effectiveness was the change of hem@@ og@@ ist values between the beginning of the study and the completion period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
&quot; the company also laid out the results of a study in which the effects were carried out under the skin with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o at 114 cancer patients , which were given chem@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; in the study with patients who suffered on one by kid@@ ney problems caused by kid@@ ney problems , the hem@@ at@@ glo@@ bin@@ values of patients were provided on the same measure as with those patients who continue to be E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; compared to this , the patients still showed E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o , an increase of 0.@@ 0@@ 63 g / dl of the output value of 12,@@ 0 g / dl . &quot;
the most common side effect of Ab@@ sin@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure from occasionally to symp@@ tom of an enc@@ ephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden @-@ related mig@@ rant head@@ ache and b@@ ness .
se@@ ab@@ amed must not be used in patients who may possibly excessive ( allergi@@ c ) against ep@@ o@@ tin al@@ fa or one of the other components .
&quot; se@@ amed as inj@@ ections under the skin is not recommended for treating kid@@ ney problems , as further studies are required to ensure that this is triggered by no allergi@@ c reactions . &quot;
&quot; the Committee on Human@@ cis@@ ion ( CH@@ MP ) is to conclude that for abor@@ tion in accordance with the provisions of the European Union of evidence , the medicine is a comparable quality , safety and active profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;

&quot; the treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate an@@ emia ( hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin &#91; HB &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl ) , if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or in@@ adequate , in case of planned major operating terms that require a large blood volume , which require a large blood volume ( 4 or more units blood for men ; 5 or more units blood for men ) . &quot;
&quot; for reduction of stran@@ bl@@ eness , Ab@@ sin@@ amed can be applied in front of a large sel@@ ective orthop@@ edic intervention in adults without iron lack , where a high risk of trans@@ fusion applications are expected . &quot;

the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin @-@ destination Con@@ centr@@ ation is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.@@ 2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except for pa@@ edi@@ atric patients where the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ oc@@ ation between 9,@@ 5 and 11 g / dl ( 5,@@ 9 - 6,@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; anarch@@ ic symptoms and fol@@ ds may vary depending on age , gender and overall cranes , therefore the assessment of individual clinical trials and disease can be required by the physician . &quot;
a rise in hem@@ at@@ glob@@ ins around more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients may occasionally be observed in a patient individual hem@@ og@@ y@@ bin@@ aries via or under the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin audi@@ ences .
given this hem@@ og@@ y@@ bin@@ aries should be tried over an appropriate d@@ os@@ is@@ management management , the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin @-@ target group of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
if the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin is worth more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) exc@@ eeds 25 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) is the ep@@ o@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa dose by 25 % .
&quot; patients should not be monitored , to ensure that ep@@ o@@ tin al@@ fa is needed in the lowest possible dose which is required for controlling the an@@ emia and the anarch@@ ic symptoms . &quot;
the present clinical results suggest that patients with beginn@@ s very low HB @-@ value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) possibly need higher cab@@ s ( HB &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; the present clinical results suggest that patients with initial low HB @-@ value ( &lt; 6,@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) possibly need higher cab@@ s ( HB &gt; 6,@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;

&quot; anarch@@ ic symptoms and - fol@@ ds can be different depending on age , gender and overall cranes , therefore the assessment of individual clinical trials and disease can be required by the physician . &quot;
given this hem@@ og@@ y@@ bin@@ aries should be tried over an appropriate d@@ os@@ is@@ management management , the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin @-@ target group of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should not be monitored , to ensure that ep@@ o@@ tin al@@ fa is required in the lowest possible dose which is necessary for controlling the accumulation of symptoms . &quot;
&quot; if after 4 treatment weeks of hem@@ og@@ glo@@ ve value is increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , or the refl@@ ector number of ≥ 4@@ 0,000 cells / kg , the dose of 150 i.@@ e / kg should be kept once a week or 450 i.@@ E. / kg once a week . &quot;
&quot; if the hem@@ og@@ glo@@ bin@@ an@@ rose &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the refl@@ ective number &lt; 4@@ 0,000 cells / µl should be raised to the output value , the dose should be raised to 300 i.@@ e / kg three times a week . &quot;
&quot; if after another 4 treatment weeks with 300 i.@@ e / kg three times a week of hem@@ og@@ glo@@ ve value to ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , or the reduction of ≥ 4@@ 0,000 cells / µl should be maintained / kg three times a week . &quot;
&quot; is in contrast to the hem@@ og@@ glo@@ ve value by &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tik@@ o@@ zy@@ ten@@ sion@@ number of &lt; 4@@ 0,000 cells / µl compared to the output value , is an appeal to the ep@@ o@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be cancel@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; patients with mild an@@ emia ( hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , which is necessary for a dosage of ≥ 4 hem@@ isph@@ eres , should be se@@ amed in a dose of 600 i.@@ e / kg body weight twice weekly for 3 weeks before the operating procedure . &quot;
&quot; with the iron sub@@ stitution should be as early as possible - for example , some weeks before the start of the aut@@ ologists ble@@ eding program - to be started before the beginning of the se@@ ated therapy of large iron reserves . &quot;
&quot; 6 The recommended dosage is 600 i.@@ E. / kg Epo@@ et@@ tin al@@ fa , which should once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before the operating procedure and the day of the surgery ( day 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; this should be ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 i.@@ E. / kg at each 10 consecutive days before , on the day of the surgery , as well as 4 days immediately after . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , the injection at the end of the di@@ aly@@ sis can be given over the hose of a F@@ ist@@ el@@ na@@ del , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ on@@ ous cooking solution in order to rin@@ se the hose and ensure an adequate injection of the drug in the cycle . &quot;
patients suffering from treatment with some Er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin ( Pure Red C@@ ell A@@ pl@@ asia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive a se@@ amed or another Er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin ( see section 4.4 - Er@@ y@@ thro@@ bl@@ ast@@ open@@ ie ) . &quot;

the data on imm@@ unity with sub@@ stitutes for sub@@ stitutes in patients with a risk for an anti @-@ induc@@ ted PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 For patients with chronic kid@@ ney efficiency should not exceed 4.2 recommended upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin audi@@ ences .
in clinical trials a elevated mor@@ tal risk and risk for serious bar@@ di@@ ovascular events were observed if Er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ esis ( ESA ) with a tick @-@ concentration of more than 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) were given .
controlled clinical trials have demonstrated no significant benefits that is attribut@@ able to the gift of ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine symptoms when the hem@@ og@@ y@@ bin@@ oc@@ ation is required to control the control of accumulation symptoms and the avoidance of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ds should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in the blood pressure .
in patients with chronic kid@@ ney efficiency and clin@@ ically corro@@ sive cor@@ on@@ ary reduction or shr@@ ine efficiency should not exceed 4.2 recommended upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin audi@@ ences .
&quot; after the time of this findings , by the treatment of an@@ emia with ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa , with adult efficiency , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , the progression of kid@@ ney efficiency is not accelerated . &quot;
in tum@@ our patients under chem@@ otherapy ought to be considered for assessing the therapy of ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between ep@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ G@@ abe and the Er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin answer to be taken into account ( patients who may possibly be trans@@ figured ) .
&quot; if the HB increase is greater than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a HB @-@ value of 13 g / dl ( 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must keep the risk for possible thro@@ mb@@ al events ( see section 4.2 treatment of patients with chem@@ otherapy condi@@ tion@@ ality , between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) . &quot;
&quot; the decision for the application re@@ combin@@ ant Er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on the benefit of the respective patients , which should also consider the specific clinical context . &quot;
&quot; in patients , which are intended for greater sel@@ ective orthop@@ edic surgery should be , if possible , prior to the beginning of ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine @-@ al@@ fa therapy the cause of an@@ emia and treated accordingly . &quot;
patients suffering themselves to a greater sel@@ ective orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery should be an appropriate t@@ ro@@ mb@@ os@@ e@@ proph@@ yla@@ xis as they have a elevated risk for thro@@ mb@@ otic and v@@ ascular diseases , especially in a related cardiovascular disease . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it cannot be excluded that in treatment with ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an output mo@@ glo@@ zing by &gt; 13 g / dl a elevated risk for post@@ operative thro@@ mb@@ al / v@@ ascular events can exist . &quot;
in several controlled studies for ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine was not proven that they can survive in tum@@ our patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic an@@ emia and reduce the risk of tum@@ or progression .

the most common side @-@ effect during treatment with ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dos@@ ages @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or deterioration of an existing hyper@@ tension .
an increased incidence lic@@ al thro@@ mb@@ ov@@ as@@ cul@@ ated events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) was observed in patients under the treatment with Er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine .

the overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of t@@ ro@@ mb@@ s and associated complications associated with re@@ combin@@ ant Er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin treated patients and with inspections .
&quot; there is a elevated risk for th@@ rom@@ ance Bolshe@@ vik events in tum@@ our patients , which can be treated with re@@ combin@@ ant Er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin , and a negative impact on the overall survival cannot be excluded . &quot;
&quot; it is not clari@@ fied how far these results are treated to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant Er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin in tum@@ our patients using chem@@ otherapy with the aim to transfer a tick @-@ glo@@ ve under 13 g / dl , because too few patients were included with these characteristics in the supplied data . &quot;

&quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip abuse should be obtained before the first in@@ fusion of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) . &quot;
&quot; administration of Par@@ ac@@ et@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means against infl@@ amm@@ ation ) shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ asta can be reduced in the three days after the in@@ fusion of symptoms , such as fe@@ ver , muscle aches , gri@@ pping ache and head@@ aches . &quot;
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease .
&quot; since the active ingre@@ dient in A@@ cl@@ asta der@@ same is as in z@@ om@@ eta , a part of the data material for z@@ om@@ eta was attracted by A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; in the first study , nearly 8 000 older women were involved with ost@@ e@@ op@@ or@@ osis , and it was investigated the number of sp@@ ine and hip re@@ frac@@ tures over a period of three years . &quot;
&quot; the second study included 2 127 men and women with ost@@ e@@ op@@ or@@ osis over 50 years , which suffered recently a gir@@ der cast ; it was examined the number of frac@@ tures over a period of up to five years . &quot;
&quot; with Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et , A@@ cl@@ asta was tested in two studies in a total of 357 patients and compared six months long with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( a different bis@@ phosph@@ ate ) . &quot;
main Indi@@ c@@ ator for the effectiveness was whether the salary of the al@@ kal@@ ine Ph@@ osph@@ at@@ ase in Ser@@ um ( a enzy@@ me ) in the blood is re@@ alized or decreased by at least 75 % compared to the output value .
&quot; in the study with older women , the risk of sp@@ inal frac@@ tures was reduced by patients under A@@ cl@@ asta ( without other O@@ ste@@ op@@ or@@ os@@ em@@ edi@@ ente ) over a period of three years compared to the patients below plac@@ ebo by 70 % . &quot;
&quot; in comparison of all patients under A@@ cl@@ asta ( with or without other O@@ ste@@ op@@ or@@ os@@ em@@ edi@@ ente ) , with those under plac@@ ebo , the risk of hip re@@ frac@@ tures has been reduced by 41 % . &quot;
in the study with men and women with hip powers 9 % of patients under A@@ cl@@ asta a Fra@@ le ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of A@@ cl@@ asta appear within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent .
A@@ cl@@ asta may not be used in patients who may possibly excessive ( allergi@@ c ) against Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ or or any of the other components .
&quot; as with all Bis@@ phosph@@ ates are subject to patients with aspir@@ ated risk of kid@@ ney , reactions to the in@@ fusion set and O@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose ( Ab@@ die of bone tissue ) in the j@@ aws . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ asta provides cle@@ aring material for doctors ready to apply the A@@ cl@@ asta for the treatment of ost@@ e@@ op@@ or@@ osis , which contains how the medicine is used , as well as similar material for patients , in which the side effects of drug are explained and pointed out when they should address the doctor . &quot;

&quot; in patients with a recent low @-@ traum@@ atis@@ faction , a initi@@ ator of 5@@ 0,000 to 12@@ ,000 i.@@ E. or@@ alem or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the first A@@ cl@@ asta in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of symptoms which occur within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta , can be reduced by gift from Par@@ ac@@ et@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
patients with kid@@ ney function ( see Section 4.4 ) In case of patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min will not be recommended A@@ cl@@ asta as a limited clinical experience for this patient group .
&quot; older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A D@@ os@@ is@@ adap@@ tion is not necessary , since the bio@@ availability , distribution and Eli@@ mination in elderly patients is similar to younger . &quot;
&quot; children and young people of A@@ cl@@ asta is not recommended for use in children and young people under 18 years , since data are missing for in@@ consistency and effectiveness . &quot;
A@@ cl@@ asta is not recommended in patients with severe kid@@ ney efficiency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) since this patient &apos;s population is limited only limited clinical experience .
a pre @-@ existing hy@@ po@@ kal@@ z@@ emia is before the start of therapy with A@@ cl@@ asta by adequate supply of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; due to the rapid introduction of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid on the bone structure , a temporary an@@ a@@ emia can develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to guarantee patients with Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et an adequate supply of calcium , according to twice a day at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;

&quot; for patients who need dental car@@ riages , are no data available whether the inter@@ ruption of the treatment with Bis@@ phosph@@ or is reduced the risk for o@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen in the ortho@@ don@@ tics . &quot;
the clinical evaluation by the treating doctor should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and are based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
&quot; the frequency of symptoms which occur within the first three days after agreement of A@@ cl@@ asta , can be reduced by gift from Par@@ ac@@ et@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after application of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of as serious side @-@ effect in cases of pre @-@ hop@@ ed was increased by patients who received A@@ cl@@ asta ( 1,@@ 3 % ) in comparison to patients who received plac@@ ebo ( 0,@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3.@@ 8@@ 52 ) . &quot;

&quot; N@@ ier@@ en@@ functioning Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid was associated with kid@@ ney function , which brought itself as acceptance of the kid@@ ney function ( i.e. , an increase in ser@@ um @-@ cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as an ac@@ or@@ atory fail . &quot;
the change in the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( measured before administration ) and the appearance of kid@@ ney failure were measured in a clinical study at O@@ ste@@ op@@ or@@ osis over three years compared between the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a- and the plac@@ ebo group .
a temporary increase in the ser@@ um Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days after gift was observed at 1.8 % of patients with A@@ cl@@ asta treated patients compared to 0.@@ 8 % of the patients treated with plac@@ ebo patients .
&quot; based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings , the temporary calcium values indicated below the normal oscill@@ ation range ( less than 2,10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , with 2,@@ 3 % of the patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta in the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et studies treated with A@@ cl@@ asta in the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et studies . &quot;
all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al ost@@ e@@ op@@ or@@ osis in the study on avoiding clinical frac@@ tures and in the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et studies ( see Section 4.2 ) .
&quot; in the study on avoidance of clinical trials , the vitamin D mirror were not a regular basis , however , the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; local reactions after administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical study was reported on local reactions to the in@@ fusion set , such as redness , sw@@ elling and / or pain , reported ( 0.7 % ) . &quot;

A@@ cl@@ asta @-@ treated patients of 75 years and older had an increase of 60 % reduced risk for sp@@ inal diseases compared to plac@@ ebo @-@ patients ( p &lt; 0,@@ 0001 ) .
&quot; effects on gir@@ f@@ rak@@ tures A@@ cl@@ asta pointed an equal effect over three years , which resulted in one by 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) reduced risk to hip re@@ frac@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; effect on the bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cl@@ asta increased the bone density at the handleb@@ ar acid , hips and at the dist@@ al radius compared to all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) . &quot;

11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid compared to intake of 30 mg Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at once every day during 2 months was proven in two six@@ teen studies studies .
&quot; after 6 months , after 6 months a similar acceptance of pain relief and pain @-@ influenced in comparison to the starting value for A@@ cl@@ asta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at was observed . &quot;
patients who were classified at the end of the Six@@ sm@@ on@@ ati@@ gen main study as the Respon@@ si@@ der ( on the therapy ) were added to a follow @-@ up phase .
&quot; of the 143 with A@@ cl@@ asta and the 107 with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at treated patients , the therapeutic approach was treated at 141 of the patients with A@@ cl@@ asta , compared to 71 of the follow @-@ up phase of 18 months after application . &quot;
&quot; unique and multiple 5 and 15 minutes to feed in@@ fusion of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid at 64 patients with the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data which proved to be dos@@ is@@ independently . &quot;
&quot; after that , the plas@@ mas@@ egel took rapidly starting to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long lasting phase very low concentration , no more than 0,@@ 1 % of the maximum value . &quot;

the early distribution phases ( α and β , with the above mentioned ½ -@@ values ) we probably represent the fast Res@@ or@@ ption in the bones and the ex@@ propri@@ ation over the kid@@ neys . &quot;
&quot; in the first 24 h , 39 ± 16 % of the agreed dose were bound in the urine while the rest is mainly tied at bone tissue . &quot;
&quot; the total body Clear@@ ance is independent of the dose 5,@@ 04 ± 2,5 l / h and remains un@@ influenced by gender , age , race or body weight . &quot;
&quot; an extension of the in@@ fusion period of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ eous concentration by 30 % at the end of in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma centr@@ ation against time ) . &quot;
&quot; decreased Clear@@ ance by cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 @-@ Enz@@ ym@@ systems met@@ alli@@ zed substances is unlikely , because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid is not met@@ aboli@@ zed because they are a watch@@ ful or no direct and / or irre@@ ver@@ sible , inter@@ dependent in@@ hi@@ bit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ - &quot;

this results in fact that an easy ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a homogen@@ eous kid@@ ney functioning up to 35 ml / min does not require a dosage adjustment of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .
&quot; for severe kid@@ ney @-@ functioning ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ - Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) , only limited data are not limited to this population . &quot;
ac@@ ute tox@@ icity The highest not let@@ al in@@ tra@@ ven@@ ous individual dose was with mice 10 mg / kg body weight and with rats ± 6 mg / kg body weight .
&quot; in studies of dogs , individual doses of 1,@@ 0 mg / kg ( based on the AU@@ C the 6@@ 500 of the recommended human therapeutic exposure ) , given over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al flow . &quot;

&quot; Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is a representative of a sub@@ class class , called the Bis@@ phosph@@ or , and is used for treatment of ost@@ e@@ op@@ or@@ osis in post@@ men@@ op@@ or@@ osis in men and the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et of the bone . &quot;
&quot; the blood flow of sex hormones , especially o@@ est@@ rogen , which are formed from and@@ rogen , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass that is observed in men . &quot;
&quot; at the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et , the bone structure is carried out quickly , and new bone material is structured as normal , which makes the bone material weaker than normal . &quot;
&quot; A@@ cl@@ asta works by making it again norm@@ alized , thereby a normal bone @-@ building and thus gives rise to the bones again . &quot;
&quot; if you are in dental treatment or do not need dental surgery , please inform your doctor that you will be treated with A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;

&quot; summary of the EP@@ AR for the public , this document is a summary of the European Public Be@@ ur@@ ry report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee on Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) has been evaluated in order to obtain recommendations concerning the use of the drug . &quot;
Ac@@ tos is applied to the treatment of type @-@ 2 diabetes ( also known as not ins@@ ul@@ in@@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( Mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) in which Met@@ form@@ in ( a di@@ ab@@ et@@ es@@ medi@@ medication ) is not displayed . • It can be applied together with another Di@@ ab@@ et@@ es@@ medi@@ medication ( dual therapy ) .
it can be used in addition to Met@@ form@@ in patients ( especially overweight patients ) which can not be satisfactory with Met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose .
&quot; in combination with a sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ ness or ins@@ ulin , the previous dose of the sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ em@@ s or ins@@ ulin can be retained by patients with hy@@ po@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic ( low blood sugar ) ; here should be reduced the dose of the sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ em@@ s or the ins@@ ulin . &quot;
&quot; this means that the body of your own ins@@ ulin can be better toler@@ ated and the blood sugar levels , which can also adjust type @-@ 2 diabetes . &quot;
&quot; with more than 1 400 patients the effectiveness of Ac@@ tos in Tri@@ ple@@ therapy , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ ness , in addition they received up to 3.5 years either Ac@@ tos or plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood has been measured in the blood ( gly@@ co@@ y@@ li@@ fied hem@@ at@@ glo@@ bin , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) which shows how well the blood sugar is set . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos led to a reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which makes blood sugar values in use of doses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg were cut . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the Tri@@ ple@@ al study , the effect of additional gift from Ac@@ tos to existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ ness in a reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional gift of plac@@ ebo to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % led . &quot;
&quot; in a small study where the combination of Ac@@ tos and ins@@ ulin have been studied in addition to patients who took the Ac@@ tos in addition to ins@@ ulin , a reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.7 % after 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in the patients , which were in addition plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects in connection with Ac@@ tos were visible disorders , infections of the upper brea@@ ths ( decre@@ asing sensitivity ) , weight increases and hy@@ po@@ li@@ th@@ esia ( decreased sensitivity to irrit@@ ation ) . &quot;
Ac@@ tos may neither be used in patients who may react possibly sensitive ( allergi@@ c ) compared to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or one of the other components to be used in patients with liver problems , herr@@ ing efficiency or dia@@ be@@ tic k@@ eto@@ azi@@ box ( high concentration ) - bags - in the blood ) . &quot;
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos in the framework of a mon@@ otherapy ( for the sole use ) as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in patients is to serve in which Met@@ form@@ atted is not indicated .
&quot; October 2000 , the European Commission granted the company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited has permission for the approval of Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white until white , round , weigh@@ ed and wear on one side the mark@@ ings &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is also displayed for combination with ins@@ ulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is in@@ adequate at ins@@ ulin and with which Met@@ form@@ ations is in@@ appropriate ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; for use of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age , no data is available , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from the presence at least a risk factor ( e.g. earlier Her@@ zin@@ ess or symp@@ tom@@ atic cor@@ on@@ eness ) at risk , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of a heart efficiency , weight increases or ö@@ de@@ me to be observed especially those with reduced cardi@@ ology reserve . &quot;
patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of a heart efficiency and can be observed if Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is applied in combination with ins@@ ulin .
a kar@@ di@@ ovascular Out@@ come study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients under 75 years of type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre@@ am@@ mat@@ ory illness was carried out .
&quot; in this study , an increase in reports about heart efficiency , which however did not lead to an increase in mor@@ ality in the study . &quot;
&quot; in patients with increased stamina , AL@@ T &gt; 2,5 x upper limit of the standard range ) or with other signs of a liver disease may not be used . &quot;
&quot; if the AL@@ T @-@ Spiegel can be raised up to the 3 @-@ fold the upper limit of the standard division , the liver ymers are to control as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; if a patient symptoms developed , which are developed on a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ clari@@ fying , fatigue , fatigue , appeti@@ te and / or dar@@ ker resin , are the liver ymers . &quot;
the decision whether the patient treatment should be continued with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on should be guided until the fores@@ een of the laboratory parameters .
&quot; in clinical studies with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , a dos@@ ages @-@ dependent weight increases , which can be seen by li@@ pos@@ sessions and in some cases with a liquid quality . &quot;
as a result of a hem@@ isph@@ eres occurred under the therapy with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one a low reduction of the middle hem@@ at@@ glo@@ ve values ( relative reduction around 4 % ) and the hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction around 4,@@ 1 % ) .
similar changes have been observed in comparative controlled studies with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under Met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ at@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff and ins@@ ulin ( relative reduction in hem@@ at@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff and ins@@ ulin ( relative reduction in hem@@ at@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff and ins@@ ulin ( relative reduction of hem@@ at@@ oid to 1 @-@ 2 % and the hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its at 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
&quot; as a result of increased incidence in patients , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on as or@@ ale two @-@ combination therapy with a sul@@ fur @-@ combination therapy with ins@@ ulin @-@ combination therapy with ins@@ ulin , the risk of a dos@@ cope @-@ dependent hy@@ po@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; after the launch of the market launch under the treatment with Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ons , including Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , about a occurrence or deterioration of a dia@@ be@@ tic mac@@ ul@@ a@@ dem@@ s with a reduction of visual shar@@ p@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; it is un@@ clear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and the appearance of Mak@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ de@@ men , however , the possibility of a Mak@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ dem@@ s should be aware of the possibility of a Mak@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ dem@@ s ; a suitable oph@@ thalm@@ ological statement should be considered . &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of reports of unwanted events regarding bone mar@@ qu@@ itting from random@@ ized , controlled , double clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.@@ 100 patients who have been treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one . &quot;
the calculated Fra@@ um @-@ In@@ zi@@ pped amoun@@ ted to 1.@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on treated women and 1,@@ 1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years with women who have been treated with a comparative study .
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a study of 3,5 years for the study of kar@@ di@@ ovascular events , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) with patients treated with a comparative study . &quot;
&quot; the patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or it occurs , the treatment is ab@@ ide ( see Section 4.6 ) . &quot;
studies on the investigation of interactions have shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one does not have relevant effects on the Pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tics or Pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , Var@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and Met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; interactions with pharmaceuticals that are met@@ aboli@@ zed by these enzy@@ mes , e.g. or@@ ale cont@@ raz@@ ep@@ tive , cy@@ mb@@ um@@ kan@@ al@@ blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A @-@ Re@@ duction are not expected . &quot;
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with Gem@@ fi@@ bro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) result in an increase in the AU@@ C from Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on around the 3 @-@ fold .
simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C8 @-@ In@@ duction ) result in a reduction in the AU@@ C from Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
this is due to it that under treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one which is dimin@@ ished in the pregnancy of hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ in@@ emia and increased ins@@ ulin to decrease the availability of the met@@ abo@@ lic substr@@ ates for the killing growth .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequent &gt; 1 / 100 ; &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , individual cases : unknown ( from this data will not be estimated ) . &quot;
these lead to a temporary change of the tur@@ bine and the billing index@@ es of the lens as they can also be observed in other hy@@ po@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic drugs .
&quot; in clinical studies with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , AL@@ T @-@ An@@ sti@@ ege played over the tri@@ ples of the standard area often equally at plac@@ ebo , however rare than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or Sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff . &quot;
in a out@@ come study in patients with advanced advanced mac@@ rov@@ as@@ cul@@ osis &apos;s disease was the frequency of a heavy herd efficiency while Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on around 1.6 % higher than under plac@@ ebo when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on b@@ z@@ w .
&quot; since the launch , it has been reported by means of Her@@ zin@@ ess efficiency under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , however , more frequently when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was used in combination with ins@@ ulin and in patients with heart efficiency in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; it became a summary analysis of reports of unwanted events regarding bone mar@@ qu@@ arri@@ es from random@@ ized , controlled , double clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on treated groups and over 7.@@ 400 patients in the groups involved in comparison @-@ media treatment . &quot;
&quot; over a period of 3.5 years of ongoing pro@@ active study , the frac@@ tures appeared at 44 / 870 ( 5,@@ 1 % ) of the patient with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on treated patients with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients with a comparative study . &quot;
&quot; at intake of the maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms occurred . &quot;
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on seems to have a activation of specific core recipe ( per@@ oxide ) to work in the animal model to an increased ins@@ ulin @-@ sensitive sensitivity of liver , fat and sk@@ el@@ eton muscle cells . &quot;
it could be shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduces the Glu@@ cos@@ e@@ production in the liver and increases the periph@@ eral gluten @-@ valuation in case of in@@ sul@@ in@@ resistant .
a clinical study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on ver@@ sus Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de as Mon@@ otherapy has been continued over two years to investigate the time until leaving the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.@@ 0 % after the first 6 treatments ) .
&quot; at the time after two years after the therapy , a blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8,@@ 0 % ) by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on at 69 % of the patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ eb@@ oc@@ ont@@ rol@@ un@@ ed study about 12 months , patients whose blood sugar were in@@ adequate despite three int@@ on@@ ati@@ ful optimization phase with ins@@ ulin , to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in patients under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduced the medium sized H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c - value by 0.@@ 45 % , compared to patients who continued only ins@@ ulin ; a reduction in ins@@ ulin in the group has been observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies over one year , under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on consistently showed a statis@@ tically significant acceptance of the Alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Qu@@ oti@@ ons compared to the output values . &quot;
the effect of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on ( Mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg ver@@ sus plac@@ ebo ) was checked in a small , on 18 weeks by examining type @-@ 2 Di@@ abe@@ tics . &quot;
in most clinical trials compared to plac@@ ebo a reduction of the total plasma cl@@ ash and the free fatty acids and a rise of HD@@ L@@ - cholester@@ ol levels as well as little feet , but clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL@@ - cholester@@ ol levels . &quot;
in clinical studies over a period of up to two years Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one compared to plac@@ ebo , met@@ form@@ in or li@@ cl@@ azi@@ d the overall plas@@ ticity and the free fatty acids , and increased the HD@@ L cholester@@ ol levels . &quot;
compared to plac@@ ebo under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was not determined statis@@ tically significant increase in the L@@ DL cholester@@ ol levels while under Met@@ form@@ in and Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d dimin@@ ished values were observed .
&quot; in a study of 20 weeks reduced pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one not only the so@@ ber tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de , but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial elevated tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de mirror , this has an effect on the tri@@ gly@@ ca@@ vities and on the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ ca@@ vities synthesis . &quot;
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a kar@@ di@@ ovascular Out@@ come study , 5@@ 238 patients were random@@ ized with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and advanced medical illness in groups , which has received a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing anti@@ dia@@ be@@ tic and kar@@ di@@ ovascular therapy either Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; according to oral application Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on quickly res@@ or@@ ated , whereby the peak of concentration in unchanged pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one will usually be reached 2 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; based on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV is based on the effectiveness of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , where the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot;
&quot; in Inter@@ action studies , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on could not have relevant effect on the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , Var@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and Met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with Gem@@ fi@@ bro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C8 @-@ In@@ duction ) ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; after the application of radio@@ active mark@@ isen Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , the mark@@ er became mainly found in the fur ( 55 % ) , and to a lower extent in the Har@@ n ( 45 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the middle plasma @-@ Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ alb@@ um@@ al time of un@@ changing pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is at the people 5 @-@ 6 hours , and the whole active met@@ abo@@ o is at 16 - 23 hours . &quot;
&quot; the plasma concentration of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and his met@@ abo@@ o are lower in patients with reduced kid@@ ney function lower than with healthy propor@@ tions , whereby the mar@@ es of the or@@ al Clear@@ ance of the parent company were similar . &quot;
&quot; in tox@@ ic@@ ological studies they appeared in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys agreement after repeated agreement of Plas@@ ma@@ iled Plas@@ ma@@ sts , an@@ emia and rever@@ sible cent@@ ric heart hyper@@ hyper@@ tro@@ phy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to that treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on which is dimin@@ ished under the treatment of hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ in@@ dem@@ ia , and increased ins@@ ulin to decrease the availability of the met@@ abo@@ lic substr@@ ates for the killing growth . &quot;
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) were induc@@ ed at the R@@ atte increased incidence of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( with male and female rats ) and tum@@ ors ( at male R@@ atting ) of the ur@@ gency epi@@ th@@ el@@ ium .

&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a study of 3,5 years for the study of kar@@ di@@ ovascular events , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) with patients treated with a comparative study . &quot;
&quot; in a further study over two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ an with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d were investigated . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies over 1 year , under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on consistently showed a statis@@ tically significant acceptance of the Alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Qu@@ oti@@ ons compared to the output values . &quot;
&quot; in a study of 20 weeks reduced pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one not only the so@@ ber tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de , but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial elevated tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de mirror , this is both an effect on the tr@@ y@@ gly@@ co@@ eri@@ d absorption as well as on the h@@ ep@@ atic tr@@ y@@ g@@ um@@ eri@@ d synthesis . &quot;

in both studies Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol in a dose of once daily 300 mg used ; patients with kid@@ ney problems received only 100 mg per day .
main indi@@ ator for the effectiveness was the number of patients whose ur@@ inary ur@@ chin was in the blood among the last three measurements under 6 mg / dl .
&quot; in the first study 48 % ( 126 from 262 ) of the patients , the A@@ den@@ uri@@ c in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) the patients who participated once daily 120 mg in the blood of under 6 mg / dl . &quot;

&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used for treating ost@@ e@@ op@@ or@@ osis ( a disease , where the bones are used ) in women after men@@ op@@ ause , where a risk for a low vitamin D mirror is composed of . &quot;
&quot; the patient has to take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or disposable other medicines ( including Ant@@ azi@@ da , Cal@@ ci@@ um@@ - and Vit@@ amin@@ supplements ) . &quot;
&quot; to avoid a maturity of the es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient is to take place until after the first food intake of the day , the breakfast is 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; since Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at and vitamin D@@ 3 already separated from each other in pharmaceuticals that are approved in the European Union , the company presented data from earlier studies and published literature . &quot;
the company also led a study with 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ al women with ost@@ e@@ op@@ or@@ osis to detect the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in terms of increasing the vitamin D mirror .
&quot; after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with the lowest vitamin D mirror was treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 11 % ) than with those who took exclusively Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( 32 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the company also laid data before that , that in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE included in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , which is exactly the dose which is needed for preventing a bone loss . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of motion apparatus ( muscles , bones , or joints ) and symptoms of the diges@@ tive apparatus , dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia ( diges@@ tion ) , coll@@ ar@@ rhe@@ a ( b@@ lows ) , pe@@ p@@ rhe@@ a ( b@@ olog@@ ation ) , ag@@ ar@@ rhe@@ a ( b@@ lowing belly ) , as well as su@@ ction lift . &quot;
&quot; in patients with any over@@ sensitivity , vitamin D@@ 3 or one of the other components may not be used AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE . &quot;
&quot; it must not be used in diseases of the es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with Hy@@ po@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium mirror ) or in patients who can not stand up or sit for at least 30 minutes . &quot;
Janu@@ ary@@ - 2007 the European Commission hosted the company Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd . a permission for the In@@ dependence of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in the entire European Union .
&quot; chap@@ els , white to broken white tablets , characterized by setting up a button on one side and &quot; 710 &quot; on the other . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , beverage or disposable drugs ( including Ant@@ azi@@ da , Cal@@ ci@@ um@@ - and Vit@@ amin@@ supplements ) for the day . &quot;
the following indications are to be accurate to reduce the risk for mal@@ oph@@ age@@ al irrit@@ ation and related side effects ( see Section 4.4 ) :
&quot; • AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed after the advent of the day only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) , as a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ ale Ul@@ zer@@ a . • The patients should not take place before the first food intake of the day , the breakfast is 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; B. pe@@ p@@ tic Ul@@ kus , active gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal ble@@ eding or surgical interventions in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ sy@@ in@@ al@@ tra@@ kt except P@@ yl@@ or@@ o@@ plast@@ y , only under special caution ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ age@@ ale reactions , such as Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ agi@@ tis , mal@@ oph@@ age@@ ale Ul@@ zer@@ a and ös@@ oph@@ age@@ ale ero@@ sion , were reported by patients under the intake of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( partly these serious and necessary a health instruction ) . &quot;
&quot; the doctor should therefore draw attention to all signs and symptoms , which should point out upon possible mal@@ oph@@ onic reactions , and the patients should be pointed out in the appearance of symptoms such as dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ie , pain@@ s while swal@@ low or retro@@ lim@@ mer of soy ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
3 The risk of severe mal@@ icious side effects seems to be increased by patients who do not take correctly and / or after the appearance of symptoms that are on a mal@@ oph@@ age@@ al irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all the analyses to be passed on to the patient and be understood by the patient ( see Section 4.2 ) .
&quot; while in large clinical studies with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at no elevated risk was detected ( according to market launch ) Mag@@ en- and Du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ zer@@ a , including some serious and with complications , reported ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;

&quot; there are no data available to indicate whether the deport@@ ation of a Bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ at@@ therapy in patients who need a cold surgical procedure , reducing the risk of O@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ o@@ arthritis of the Kie@@ fer . &quot;
the clinical assessment by the doctor treating the doctor is decisive for therapy planning in every patient on the basis of an individual benefit risk .
patients should be dependent that they should take in the failure of taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE the tablet in the next morning after they have noticed its failure .
&quot; they should not take two tablets on the same day , but taking one tablet per week as originally planned to continue the week@@ day . &quot;
&quot; other diseases , which affect the mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin @-@ D @-@ lack and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ idi@@ dis@@ m ) , should also be treated before the start of therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at food and drinks ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplement , Ant@@ azi@@ da and some or@@ ale medicines can affect the remains of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at if they are taken at the same time . &quot;
&quot; therefore , patients must wait for at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although specific response studies have not been carried out , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at in clinical studies were taken together with a multitude of usually prescribed medicines , without that clin@@ ically relevant interactions . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for use in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and therefore does not apply neither during the pregnancy still of bre@@ ast@@ feeding women .
animal studies with al@@ end@@ ron@@ age leave no indication of direct compensation effects in terms of pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development . &quot;
&quot; O@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose of the Kie@@ fer was reported in patients among Bis@@ phosph@@ ates , but most of the reports come from cancer patients , but was also reported at O@@ ste@@ op@@ or@@ os@@ ep@@ ati@@ ents . &quot;

Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f is administ@@ ered adult patients to prevent a kid@@ ney or liver trans@@ pl@@ anti@@ ed to prevent a dra@@ inage of the trans@@ planted organ by the immune system .
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and pro@@ gra@@ f are already used in the EU , the company has presented the results from previously performed studies with pro@@ gra@@ f / pro@@ gra@@ ft and data from the published literature . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results of a clinical study were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kid@@ ney trans@@ plant , whereby the application of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f with pro@@ gra@@ f / pro@@ gra@@ ft or in comparison has been compared . &quot;
main indi@@ c@@ ator of the effectiveness was the number of patients with which the trans@@ plantation was termin@@ ated after a treatment duration of one year ( by example , as often a renewed trans@@ plantation or a revival of di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , further studies were carried out in 119 patients with kid@@ ney trans@@ plant and 129 patients with liver trans@@ plant and investig@@ ates how Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f compared to pro@@ gra@@ f / pro@@ gra@@ ft from the body . &quot;
&quot; marble ( tre@@ m@@ bling ) , head@@ aches , head@@ ache , kid@@ ney problems , increased blood sugar levels ( hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic ) , diabetes , more pot@@ assi@@ um content of blood ( hyper@@ cal@@ m@@ ia ) , hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , as well as sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness ( in@@ som@@ nie ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with any over@@ sensitivity , mac@@ ro @-@ antibiotics ( such as Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) , or one of the other components may not be applied to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f . &quot;
patients and doctors need to be careful when others ( especially some herbal ) medicines simultaneously be taken at the same time with Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f as the Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f dose or the dose of the simultaneously active medicine must be adjusted accordingly .
&quot; gest@@ ures , ret@@ ardi@@ ert Yellow @-@ orange Gel@@ at@@ in@@ ek@@ ap@@ tles , printed in red ink with &quot; 0.5 mg &quot; and on the orange cap@@ sel@@ or with &quot; &quot; 6@@ 47 &quot; ; they contain white powder . &quot;
only doctors who are familiar with the immun@@ otherap@@ ist therapy and treatment of trans@@ plantation patients should be able to arrange this medicine or make changes in the immun@@ oh@@ emian therapy .
&quot; based on clinical @-@ relevant differences of the system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , this may lead to trans@@ plants or to an increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or over@@ immune soup . &quot;
patients should always keep the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; surveys of the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under the control of an experienced physician ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; in consequence of a conversion to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic monitoring and appropriate D@@ os@@ is@@ customizable will be carried out to ensure that the system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us will remain . &quot;
the dosage of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f should be primarily based on the clinical evaluation of dra@@ inage and compatibility in the individual case and on blood cells ( see below )
&quot; after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should be controlled before the conversion and over two weeks after conversion . &quot;
&quot; on day 4 the system@@ ic exposure , measured as a valley mirror , with both form@@ ulations both with kid@@ ney and lively patients comparable . &quot;
careful and repeated controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us talents are recommended during the first two weeks after trans@@ plantation under Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate delivery phase .
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low clearance , can last several days until the ste@@ ady State is reached . &quot;
&quot; if the condition of the patient is not allowed in the first post@@ operative phase , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment is in@@ tra@@ ven@@ ous ( pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentr@@ ating on the manufacture of an in@@ fusion solution ) . &quot;
&quot; the duration of the application to supp@@ ression of trans@@ plantation must be maintained , the immune soup must not be maintained ; therefore a maximum duration of the oral therapy is not indicated . &quot;
D@@ os@@ is@@ Recommen@@ dations - N@@ ier@@ trans@@ plant proph@@ yla@@ xis of trans@@ plantation the or@@ ale Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f therapy should begin with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
further deriv@@ atives can be later required as the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can change in the course of stabilisation of the patient after the trans@@ plantation .
D@@ os@@ is@@ Recommen@@ dations - liver trans@@ plantation proph@@ yla@@ xis of trans@@ plantation the or@@ ale Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f therapy should begin with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
&quot; dosage intake - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f on Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f must be converted from pro@@ gra@@ f to a once daily intake of Adv@@ ag@@ f , so this conversion in relation 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the entire day dose . &quot;
kid@@ ney and liver trans@@ plantation after a shift from other immun@@ os@@ res@@ si@@ va on Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f once daily needs to begin the treatment with each in kid@@ ney and liver trans@@ plantation for the proph@@ yla@@ xis of trans@@ plantation for the proph@@ yla@@ xis of trans@@ plantation .
&quot; trans@@ plantation In case of adult patients , which are converted to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , is a or@@ ale initi@@ ator of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day to take daily time in the morning . &quot;
other trans@@ plants do not receive clinical experience with Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f at L@@ ung , pan@@ cre@@ ature and dar@@ ed patients pro@@ gra@@ f in a or@@ al initi@@ ator of 0,@@ 2 mg / kg / day and with intest@@ inal initi@@ ators from 0,@@ 3 mg / kg / day for application . &quot;
dos@@ ages in special patient @-@ groups patients with reduced liver function in the maintenance of blood vessels in the targeted area can be required in patients with severe Leb@@ er@@ functioning dysfunction .
patients with reduced kid@@ ney function As the kid@@ ney function does not exercise any influence on the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us cannot be taken into that a dosage adjustment does not require .
&quot; due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ical potential of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , is recommended a careful control of the kid@@ ney function ( including a regular determination of the Ser@@ um@@ Cre@@ at@@ in@@ insp@@ ect , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ ka and monitoring of the ure@@ vol@@ um@@ inal ) . &quot;
conversion of Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in to advoc@@ ag@@ ra@@ f In the conversion of a Cic@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is offered to caution ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations about the talent mirror in full fl@@ atter@@ ies The dose should be based primarily on the clinical evaluation of dra@@ inage and compatibility in the case under the help of full blad@@ der Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ Tal@@ mirror controls .
&quot; it is recommended to conduct frequent controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us talents during the first two weeks after trans@@ plantation , followed by perio@@ dic controls during accounting therapy . &quot;
&quot; blood @-@ talents of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also change after conversion of pro@@ gra@@ f at Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , D@@ os@@ is@@ adap@@ tion , changes of immun@@ o@@ de@@ press@@ ants therapy or in the current application of substances which could change the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ thorou@@ gh@@ ties ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f is a medicine with a low clearance , adjustments of the dose may need several days until the ste@@ ady State has entered . &quot;
&quot; the information in clinical trials can be realized that a successful treatment is possible in most cases , when the valley mirror in the blood 20 n@@ g / ml not exceed . &quot;
in clinical practice the talent mirror of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us lies in the first time after liver trans@@ plants usually in the range of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and with kid@@ neys - and hearty patients at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml .
&quot; during the subsequent treatment of liver , kid@@ ney and heart trans@@ plants were usually used to ble@@ eding in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; this has led to serious undes@@ irable events , including trans@@ plantation or other side effects , which can occur in consequence of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us under@@ - or over@@ exposure . &quot;
patients should always keep the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; surveys of the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under the control of an experienced physician ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; 5 For the treatment of adult patients with trans@@ plants , who proved to be treated with other immun@@ o@@ de@@ press@@ ants than therapies , are still no clinical data for the ret@@ ardi@@ zed wording Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f . &quot;
the proph@@ yla@@ xis of trans@@ plantation at adult heart trans@@ plants and trans@@ plants are not interested in the child @-@ age and no clinical data for the ret@@ ardi@@ zed wording Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f .
&quot; due to possible interactions that can lead to a reduction of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ ous@@ ehold levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the intake of the Johann@@ icum per@@ for@@ atum ) , or other plant breeding may be avoided during a treatment with Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with Di@@ ar@@ rh@@ ö is a particularly careful control of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ ous@@ tics concentr@@ ations in the blood , since the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels under such circumstances can be subject to significant fluctu@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , among pro@@ gra@@ f it was considered a car@@ di@@ omy@@ opathy , Kam@@ mer@@ - or Sept@@ um@@ hyper@@ tro@@ phy to observe that can therefore occur under Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; other factors that increase the risk of such cl@@ in@@ ic distur@@ ban@@ ces , are an already existing heart , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ cians , blood pressure , kid@@ ney or liver dys@@ functions , infections , liquid and oils . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ o@@ de@@ press@@ ants , the impact of sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant skin changes due to suitable clothing or use of a solar protection using a high level factor . &quot;
&quot; if patients , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us take , symptoms for P@@ RES such as head@@ ache , altered consciousness levels , scrat@@ ches and visual dys@@ functions should be a radical investigation ( e.@@ g . &quot;
&quot; da Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , ret@@ ardi@@ zed , L@@ act@@ ose , is in patients with the rare can@@ act@@ ose @-@ intoler@@ ance , l@@ act@@ ase @-@ lack or glu@@ c@@ ose @-@ mal@@ act@@ ose @-@ Mal@@ medy special caution . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous application of drugs or herbal medicinal products known as inhi@@ bit@@ es or in@@ duction of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can increase the metabolism of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and thus reduce the blood values of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is advisable to change the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ ous@@ - blood levels in con@@ current gift of substances that can change the CY@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and to set the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose for maintaining even higher concentr@@ ations accordingly ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; a strongly affected interaction has been with anti @-@ yk@@ j@@ az@@ ol , Flu@@ con@@ az@@ ol , I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ol and Vor@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ e@@ as@@ signs ( z ) . &quot;
&quot; Pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tics studies , that the rise of blood levels mainly consists of the increased or@@ bit@@ ability of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , caused by the im@@ itation of gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal temp@@ tation , results . &quot;
&quot; Hoch@@ do@@ si@@ c Pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or Meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on , as it is used for ac@@ ute de@@ duction actions , can increase the concentration of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood . &quot;
effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on the metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ Hem@@ mer ; therefore the simultaneous application of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us may be met@@ aboli@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 met@@ aboli@@ zed .
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us increase the cle@@ aring of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tive and thus able to increase the hormone exposure , is particularly careful with decisions regarding recep@@ tive measures . &quot;
the results of animal experiments demonstrated that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us may reduce the Clear@@ ance of Pent@@ ob@@ itu@@ al and phen@@ az@@ on and extend their half @-@ time .
&quot; the results of a small number of studies in trans@@ plants patients deliver no indication that among other immun@@ o@@ de@@ press@@ ants , compared to other immun@@ o@@ de@@ press@@ ants , there is no risk to unwanted events with regard to the course and the outcome of pregnancy . &quot;

it was reported about ben@@ evol@@ ent or mal@@ icious Ne@@ o@@ plas@@ ms including EB@@ V@@ - associated l@@ ymp@@ ho@@ pro@@ ofs and skin tum@@ ors in connection with the treatment with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
&quot; due to its high molecular weight , its low water solu@@ bility and the high binding in Er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma red can be assumed that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is not di@@ aly@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; accounting Mechan@@ ism and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects on molecular level are likely to be convey@@ ed in the effects of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us by its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ol@@ ish protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for the enrich@@ ment of the connection in the cell@@ inn@@ ers . &quot;

Adv@@ ate is used for the treatment and prevention of ble@@ eding in patients with H@@ äm@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( one by the lack of factor VIII condi@@ tional blood circulation ) .
the dosage and frequency of application depends on whether Adv@@ ate is applied to the treatment of ble@@ eding or to prevent ble@@ eding in surgical intervention .
patients with H@@ äm@@ op@@ hili@@ a A suffer from a factor VIII lack what ble@@ eding problems such as ble@@ eding in the joints , muscles or inner organs . &quot;
&quot; Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extrac@@ ted from human plasma , but according to a method that is called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; : &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a cell , in which a gene ( DNA ) was transferred to the formation of the human eye factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; advoc@@ ates is similar to another in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , however , however , will be different , so the medicine does not contain proteins or animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies in patients with heavy duty to moderate high ten@@ op@@ hili@@ a A , including a study with 53 children under six years , the application of the drug was examined by means of prevention of ble@@ eding as well as in surgical intervention . &quot;
&quot; in the main study , the effectiveness of Adv@@ ate was awarded in the prevention of ble@@ eding in 86 % of 510 new blood c@@ iso@@ des with &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; or with &quot; &quot; good &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are Sch@@ win@@ del , head@@ aches , Py@@ re@@ x@@ ie ( fe@@ ver ) and the formation of anti@@ bodies towards factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; Adv@@ ate may not be used in patients , which may possibly be excessive ( allergi@@ c ) against human right@@ eous factor VIII , mouse or hamm@@ am protein or one of the other components . &quot;
&quot; March 2004 , the European Commission granted the Company Ba@@ x@@ ter AG for approval of Adv@@ ate in the entire European Union . &quot;
dosage The dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution therapy depends on the sever@@ ity of the factor VIII century , according to the site and the extent of blood and the clinical state of patient . &quot;
in the following h@@ ä@@ mor@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events the factor VIII is not meant to decrease in the corresponding plas@@ mas@@ egel ( in % of standard or in i.@@ E. / dl ) .

injection all 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the risk for the patient is over .
&quot; during the treatment process , the control of the inj@@ ectable dose and frequency of inj@@ ections is recommended for an appropriate determination of the factor VIII plasma cutting . &quot;
&quot; individual patients can differ in their response to factor VIII , different in vi@@ vo recovery and have different hem@@ isph@@ eres . &quot;
3 Proph@@ yla@@ xis for long @-@ term proph@@ yla@@ xis against patients with severe H@@ äm@@ op@@ hili@@ a A should be given doses from 20 to 40 i.@@ e of factor VIII per kg body weight at intervals of 2 @-@ 3 days .
&quot; if the expected factor VIII @-@ plasma activities will not be achieved or if blood flow is not ruled by a reasonable dose , a test must be carried out if necessary to follow an inhi@@ bit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high in@@ hi@@ bit@@ or@@ age it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic action must be wo@@ unded . &quot;
&quot; the agreement speed should be set up after the patient , with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . &quot;
the formation of neutr@@ alis@@ ing anti@@ bodies ( in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a known compensation in the treatment of patients with hamm@@ op@@ hili@@ a A .
these in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors are always opposed to the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII the Ig@@ G immun@@ og@@ lo@@ bul@@ ins which in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma by means of modified Beth@@ es@@ da As@@ say quanti@@ fied .

&quot; based on the available data available since the original exemp@@ tion of the CH@@ MP , the CH@@ MP has continued to be assessed as positive , but into consideration that the security profile must be closely monitored in the following reasons : &quot;
&quot; therefore , the CH@@ MP has on the basis of the Security Pro@@ fil@@ s of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which makes a sub@@ missions of PS@@ UR@@ s all 6 months required , decided that the authorisation has to apply for more than 5 years . &quot;
December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ec@@ ular Limited by the Committee on Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) officially with that the company takes its application for approval of Adv@@ exin for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
&quot; however , the chest , the brain , the bones , or the soft@@ ens ( tissues , the other structures in the body connects and draws ) from it . &quot;
&quot; this is a kind of virus that gene@@ tically changed so , that it can be gene in the cells of the body . &quot;
&quot; in the virus in Adv@@ exin , it is a &quot; A@@ den@@ o@@ virus &quot; which has changed so that there is no copies of himself and thus no infections can trigger people . &quot;
Adv@@ exin could have been di@@ pped directly into the tum@@ or and thus enable the cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
&quot; the p@@ 53 protein , which is formed from which not def@@ ective in the human body of existing p@@ 53 gene , contributes to the restoration of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered . &quot;
&quot; at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , which is def@@ ective at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ cancer , the p@@ 53 protein is not working properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share . &quot;
&quot; the company presented data from a study with a patient , with the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the field of under@@ mining , in the bones and in the brain . &quot;
&quot; after the CH@@ MP checked the answers of the company on the questions asked , there were still some questions un@@ explained . &quot;
&quot; based on the examination of the initial documentation , the CH@@ MP is created on day 120 a list of questions that will be sent to the company . &quot;
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP , the CH@@ MP has not been sufficiently proven that the injection of Adv@@ exin is in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ tum@@ or benefits for the patient . &quot;
&quot; the Committee also had concerns about the processing of drug by means of the body , the type of administration and the security of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company had not sufficiently proven that advoc@@ ates can be manufactured in a reliable way and that there is neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient . &quot;
the CH@@ MP does not endor@@ se the CH@@ MP whether the res@@ ign@@ ing consequences for patients who currently participate in clinical studies or &quot; Com@@ 1 @-@ Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ exin .
&quot; modified drug release , means that the tablets are so assembled that one of the effective components can be released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours . &quot;
aer@@ os@@ ze is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal Rhin@@ i@@ tis ( Heu@@ schn@@ u@@ bs , by an all@@ ergy against pol@@ ish @-@ infl@@ ated infl@@ amm@@ ation of the nas@@ al passages ) in patients with Rhin@@ oplast@@ y ( hidden nose ) . &quot;
in adults and young children over 12 years the recommended dose of aer@@ os@@ ze twice a day a tablet that should be taken completely with a glass of water with or without food .
&quot; the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and ended as soon as the symptoms , especially the sw@@ elling of the nose @-@ s@@ ne@@ al ( hidden nose ) , shortened . &quot;
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of drug can leave upon the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
&quot; the main platforms were the changes of gravity of the h@@ ay symptoms , which were reported by patients prior to treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment . &quot;
&quot; during the study , patients carried their symptoms every 12 hours into a diary and rated with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; in viewing of all h@@ ops symptoms except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose reported the patients , the aer@@ os@@ ze , compared to a decrease of symptoms by 46@@ ,@@ 0 % , compared to 35,@@ 9 % in patients , the pe@@ se@@ u@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine alone . &quot;
&quot; if only the sw@@ elling of the nose @-@ s@@ ne@@ a was considered , the patients were under aer@@ os@@ ze a lin@@ ation of symptoms by 4@@ 8.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients , the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in alone took place . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of aer@@ os@@ ze ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are T@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ st ( heart disease ) , p@@ om@@ or@@ ic hyper@@ activity ( res@@ ili@@ ence ) , cl@@ amping , fatigue , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness ) , Som@@ n@@ ol@@ enz ( sle@@ e@@ age ) , ins@@ om@@ nia and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ os@@ ze may be used in patients who may possibly excessive ( allergi@@ c ) against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , p@@ se@@ u@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine or one of the other components , against ad@@ ren@@ own active ingredients or Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( another medicine for the treatment of allergi@@ es ) are not applied . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ os@@ ze may also not be used in patients who suffer from a bott@@ win@@ ch ( powder painting ) , Du@@ thy@@ ro@@ osis ( hyper@@ tension of the thy@@ ro@@ id ) , or have already caused an hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ic stroke ( by brain blood circulation ) , or have a risk for a h@@ oo@@ ding stroke . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission adopted the European Commission for the In@@ dependence of Aer@@ os@@ ze in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , however is to be swal@@ low ( i.e. without them to cr@@ ush , break or walk ) . &quot;
aer@@ os@@ ze should be applied to children under 12 years due to the mis@@ sibility and effectiveness ( see Section 5.1 ) for children under 12 years of age .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not continue after the symptoms of symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the application duration on 10 days as with long @-@ term application the activity of p@@ se@@ u@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine can decrease in time .
&quot; after drop the sw@@ elling of the v@@ aul@@ ted in the upper brea@@ ths , because the treatment can be continued when needed with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in as Mon@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; since Aer@@ den@@ ze P@@ se@@ u@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine contains , the medicine is also contro@@ versi@@ al in patients who are treated with a mon@@ o@@ amin@@ oxid@@ ative ( Mao ) or within 2 weeks of ending such therapy . &quot;
&quot; this is attribut@@ able to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ e@@ tic activity in combination of P@@ se@@ u@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine with other vas@@ o@@ on@@ gs , Er@@ go@@ d , Er@@ go@@ d@@ ol@@ amin , Er@@ go@@ d@@ ol@@ amine , Phen@@ y@@ le@@ quin , Phen@@ y@@ le@@ phrases in , Eph@@ esi@@ ans , Ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ ka@@ olin , Nap@@ haz@@ olin etc. ) . &quot;
&quot; the safety and the effectiveness of these Com@@ bin@@ ations were not tested for this patient , and the data are not sufficient to address corresponding recommendations for dosage . &quot;
&quot; the safety and the effectiveness of aer@@ os@@ ses were not tested in patients with kid@@ ney or liver functioning , and the data are not sufficient to address corresponding recommendations for dosage . &quot;
&quot; patients must be informed that treatment during a hyper@@ tension or a t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ st or of Pal@@ ag@@ ations , cardi@@ ac or et@@ wai@@ sts other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or a rein@@ forcement of the head@@ ache ) . &quot;
&quot; in treating the following patients &apos; patients &apos; patients &apos; patients with cardi@@ ac disease • patients with cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ m@@ ia • patients with a m@@ yo@@ k@@ ard@@ in@@ colored in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese , Diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , brass or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ mus in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ os@@ ze is ab@@ norm@@ ated at least 48 hours before carrying out dermat@@ ological testing , since anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ini@@ ka otherwise can prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin campaigns or to reduce their extent . &quot;
&quot; in the context of clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , where Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol additionally were given , however , no clinical interaction or changes of the plasma concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in observed . &quot;
&quot; in the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or tests , no significant differences could be found between the patients with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and with plac@@ ebo patients regardless of whether des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in alone or with alcohol . &quot;
&quot; this has not yet been identified for the met@@ abo@@ ism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in responsible enzy@@ mes , so that inter@@ dependen@@ cies with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out . &quot;
&quot; Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in inhi@@ bits in @-@ vi@@ vo CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 not , and in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ studies have shown that the medicine CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a substr@@ ate nor an inhi@@ bit@@ or of P @-@ Gl@@ y@@ copic rot@@ one . &quot;
&quot; the un@@ think@@ able of the application of aer@@ os@@ ze during pregnancy is not secured , experience from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies however no increasing the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities in comparison to the normal population . &quot;
because reproduction studies on animals do not always be transmitted to humans and are not applied to v@@ ok@@ on@@ stri@@ kt@@ or@@ ical properties of P@@ se@@ u@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine should not be applied in the pregnancy .
&quot; however , patients should be enlight@@ ened that it may come in very rare cases to lead to imp@@ air@@ ment or the ability to use machines . &quot;
&quot; symptoms may vary between a Z@@ NS depression ( Se@@ al , Ap@@ no@@ e , comb@@ usti@@ ces , com@@ a , cardiovascular coll@@ ages ) and a Z@@ NS stimulation ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ) with possible let@@ ins . &quot;

&quot; a Z@@ NS stimulation is particularly likely to be particularly likely , as at@@ rop@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth drying , p@@ up@@ tion , p@@ up@@ tion , hyper@@ thermal and gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal symptoms ) . &quot;
these include both the im@@ itation of the release of pro@@ tal@@ am@@ mat@@ or@@ ic cy@@ to@@ k@@ ines like IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 8 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es P @-@ S@@ elek@@ tin on end@@ ot@@ hel@@ ical cells . &quot;
&quot; with an individual dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg no influence on standard measurement sizes , including the strengthening of subjective battles or the tasks that are connected to the flies . &quot;
in controlled clinical trials at recommended dosage of 5 mg daily there was no increased frequency of free@@ zing compared to plac@@ ebo .
&quot; the or@@ ale application of P@@ se@@ u@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in recommended dosage may cause further person@@ om@@ im@@ e@@ tic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ st or manifestations of a Z@@ NS arous@@ al . &quot;
&quot; there were 1,@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal Rhin@@ i@@ tis part , with 4@@ 14 patients Aer@@ a@@ ze tablets were received . &quot;
&quot; in both studies the hi@@ stam@@ in@@ antagon@@ istic effectiveness of Aer@@ e@@ ze tablets , determined by the complete scores for the symp@@ tom@@ atic ( except nas@@ al s@@ ne@@ al cord ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with P@@ se@@ u@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
the effectiveness of aer@@ os@@ ze tablets with regard to the ab@@ uses effect is determined by the nose @-@ s@@ ne@@ al cord , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;

&quot; for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1,@@ 25 mg once daily , in the form of 2,5 ml sy@@ rup b@@ z@@ w . &quot;
&quot; for children aged 6 to eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once daily , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup b@@ z@@ w . &quot;
A@@ eri@@ us was studied in total eight studies with about 4 800 adults and young people with allergi@@ c Rhin@@ i@@ tis ( including four studies in seasonal Rhin@@ i@@ tis and two studies in patients who also studied as@@ thma ) .
&quot; the effectiveness has been measured by changing the change of symptoms ( it@@ ch , number and size of the square , imp@@ air@@ ment of the sleep and the efficiency of the day ) before and after six @-@ weekly treatment . &quot;
&quot; there were further studies presented to indicate that the body uses the sy@@ rup , the solution for taking and the mel@@ ting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the use of children un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; at allergi@@ c Rhin@@ i@@ tis led , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us became an average acceptance of symptoms ( symptoms ) around 25 to 32 % compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients who received a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies at Ur@@ tik@@ aria , the acceptance of symptoms after six @-@ made treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared to 40 and 33 % with the patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may possibly excessive ( allergi@@ c ) against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in or one of the other components . &quot;
&quot; January 2001 , the European Commission adopted the European Commission for the In@@ dependence of A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; a tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , to lin@@ qu@@ ate the symptoms of allergi@@ c r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and pers@@ ist Rhin@@ i@@ tis ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see below section 5.1 ) . &quot;
there are limited experience from clinical studies for effectiveness when applying Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in for young people aged 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of inter@@ fer@@ r@@ ally Rhin@@ i@@ tis ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be carried out according to the previous disease progression and can return after the end of symptoms and res@@ umed upon them .
&quot; in the Persian Rhin@@ i@@ tis ( occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days per week , and more than 4 weeks ) can be recommended to patients during all@@ ergy time . &quot;
&quot; clinical @-@ related relevant interactions were not observed in the context of clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in tablets , where Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol additionally were given ( see below section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clin@@ ically @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , with the current intake of as@@ eri@@ us and alcohol the powerful effect of alcohol is not reinforced ( see below section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be enlight@@ ened that it can occur in very rare cases , which can lead to a imp@@ air@@ ment of the transportation or the ability to use machines . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials in various indications , including allergi@@ c Rhin@@ i@@ tis and chron@@ ically idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , when patients were treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most frequently recorded side effects that was reported more often than plac@@ ebo were ti@@ redness ( 1.2 % ) , oral drying ( 0,@@ 8 % ) and head@@ ache ( 0,@@ 6 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study with 5@@ 78 young patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common side effect of head@@ aches , these stood at 5,@@ 9 % of the patients were treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and with 6,@@ 9 % of the patients , which were treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi@@ dose study , which were administ@@ ered up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( ninth clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects have been observed . &quot;
this includes both the im@@ itation of the release of pro@@ tal@@ am@@ mat@@ or@@ ic cy@@ to@@ k@@ ines like IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 8 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es P @-@ S@@ elek@@ tin on end@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ al cells . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical study with multiple sclerosis , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in a dosage of up to 20 mg every day over 14 days was given , no statis@@ tically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clin@@ ically @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) over ten days was given , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c @-@ Inter@@ v@@ alls . &quot;
&quot; with an individual dos@@ ages study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg no influence on standard measurement sizes , including the strengthening of subjective battles or the tasks that are connected to the flies . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergi@@ c Rhin@@ i@@ tis was A@@ eri@@ us effective in the alle@@ vi@@ ation of symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , Nas@@ en@@ secre@@ tion and Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z of the nose , Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z , t@@ ears and redness of the eyes as well as Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ en@@ ni@@ al , allergi@@ c Rhin@@ i@@ tis can also be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent Rhin@@ i@@ tis and pers@@ isti@@ ble Rhin@@ i@@ tis and pers@@ isti@@ ble Rhin@@ i@@ tis . &quot;
inter@@ mitt@@ ent Rhin@@ i@@ tis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
pers@@ isti@@ ical Rhin@@ i@@ tis is defined as the appearance of symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
&quot; as with the outcome of the questionn@@ aire on the quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ economic ti@@ vi@@ tis showed , dimin@@ ished A@@ eri@@ us effectively caused by seasonal Rhin@@ i@@ tis r@@ alled strain . &quot;
&quot; the chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tik@@ aria was investigated for further forms of the pri@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ology regardless of the ether@@ ic path@@ ology regardless of the ether@@ ic path@@ ology is similar to and chronic patients can be made easier for spec@@ tively . &quot;
&quot; because the Hist@@ amin@@ ites @-@ release is an ordinary factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ari@@ ous disorders , is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in except for the chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria in other forms of the pri@@ tic@@ aria to an improvement of symptoms . this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines . &quot;
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tic@@ aria was A@@ eri@@ us effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first D@@ os@@ is@@ inter@@ v@@ alls .
&quot; as in other studies with Anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ini@@ ka near chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tik@@ aria , the minority of the patients , who are not excluded from the study . &quot;
an improvement of the ju@@ gs of more than 50 % was observed at 55 % of patients with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in treated patients compared to 19 % of the patients treated with plac@@ ebo patients .
&quot; the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of the sleep and of the wax , as is measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to assess this variable . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ oc@@ ine@@ tic study , in which the patients were comparable with the general seasonal Rhin@@ i@@ tis population population , was achieved at 4 % of patients a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in . &quot;
there are no evidence for a clin@@ ically relevant Kum@@ ulation after once daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days before .
&quot; however , this is not identified for the met@@ abo@@ ism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in responsible enzy@@ me , so that inter@@ dependen@@ cies with other medicines will not be excluded completely . &quot;
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in inhi@@ bits in @-@ vi@@ vo not CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ studies have shown that the medicine CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhi@@ bit and neither a substr@@ ate nor an inhi@@ bit@@ or of P @-@ gl@@ y@@ copic rot@@ one .
in a single dos@@ er study with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in a dosage of 7.5 mg combined meals ( fatty , cal@@ orie breakfast ) does not affect the availability of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in . &quot;
the clinical trials conducted by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in conducted in a comparable degree of exposure of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , no qualitative or quantitative differences with regard to the tox@@ icity of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and by Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety issues , tox@@ icity , tox@@ icity , gen@@ esis , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity , and to Re@@ production @-@ par@@ icity can be seen the pre@@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in no particular haz@@ ards for man . &quot;

&quot; A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals , to lin@@ qu@@ ate the symptoms of allergi@@ c r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and pers@@ ist Rhin@@ i@@ tis ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see below section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the prescription doctor should be aware that most cases of Rhin@@ i@@ tis in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see below 4.4 ) and that no data are available to support a inf@@ ective Rhin@@ i@@ tis with A@@ eri@@ us .
&quot; in addition to the exclusion of upper brea@@ ths or anatom@@ ical an@@ om@@ alies should play a role in diagnosis the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese , physical investigations and corresponding laboratory tests . &quot;
approximately 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years met@@ aboli@@ zed Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in restricted and find a higher resolution load ( see below section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the security of A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up in children between 2 and 11 years , which are restricted met@@ aboli@@ zed , is the same with the children who are normal met@@ aboli@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; this medicine contains Sac@@ char@@ ose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients should not take patients with her@@ edit@@ ary problems of a fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glu@@ c@@ ose @-@ par@@ act@@ ose @-@ sor@@ ption efficiency of this medicine . &quot;
&quot; clinical @-@ relevant interactions with A@@ eri@@ us tablets were not observed when Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol additionally were given ( see below section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clin@@ ically @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , with simultaneous intake of as@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol the powerful effect of alcohol are not reinforced ( see below section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the overall sti@@ ff@@ ness of the side effects of children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up group as with the plac@@ ebo group .
&quot; clinical studies with adults and young people in various indications , including allergi@@ c Rhin@@ i@@ tis and chron@@ ically idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at recommended dose 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , when patients were treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi@@ dose study of adults and young people , with up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( ninth clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; children between 1 and 11 years , who received an anti @-@ hi@@ stam@@ in@@ therapy in question , received a daily Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ind@@ dose of 1,@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2,5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) . &quot;
because the course of allergi@@ c Rhin@@ i@@ tis / chron@@ ically idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tik@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in with adults and children can be similar in adults to children &apos;s population .
&quot; as part of a clinical study with multi@@ disciplinary an adult and young people , in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statis@@ tically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clin@@ ically @-@ pharmac@@ ological study of adults and young people , in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) over ten days in adults showed no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c Inter@@ v@@ alls . &quot;
in controlled clinical trials at recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents no increased frequency of fl@@ ushing in comparison to plac@@ ebo .
with an individual daily dose of 7.5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us tablets with adults and young people in clinical studies no imp@@ air@@ ment of psych@@ omot@@ or .
&quot; in clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological studies of adults , there was neither the simultaneous intake of alcohol neither to a rein@@ forcement of alcohol induc@@ ed performance imp@@ air@@ ment even to an increase in the free@@ zing . &quot;
&quot; in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergi@@ c Rhin@@ i@@ tis were A@@ eri@@ us tablets effective in the alle@@ vi@@ ation of symptoms like Ni@@ esen , Nas@@ en@@ secre@@ tion and Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z , t@@ ears , and redness of the eyes as well as Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; as with the outcome of the questionn@@ aire on the quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ economic ti@@ vi@@ tis showed , dimin@@ ishing A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively replaced by seasonal Rhin@@ i@@ tis . &quot;
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tic@@ aria was A@@ eri@@ us effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first D@@ os@@ is@@ inter@@ v@@ alls .
&quot; the dissemination of this restricted met@@ aboli@@ zed phen@@ otyp@@ s was comparable with adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations greater in Black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Kau@@ c@@ asi@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
similar phar@@ a@@ o@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ oc@@ ine@@ tic multi@@ dose study with the sy@@ up@@ form@@ ulation to children between 2 and 11 years with allergi@@ c Rhin@@ i@@ tis based on met@@ alli@@ ances observed .
the load ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in was after 3 to 6 hours approximately 6@@ times higher and the C@@ max approximately 3 to 4@@ times higher with a tempor@@ al half time of about 120 hours .
there are no responsibility for a clin@@ ically relevant active ingre@@ dient cou@@ ulation after once daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days with adults and young people .
&quot; 12 In different retailers studies , AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ max values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients were comparable to those of adults , the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in @-@ Sir@@ up in a dosage of 5 mg . &quot;
&quot; however , this is not identified for the met@@ abo@@ ism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in responsible enzy@@ me , so that inter@@ dependen@@ cies with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out . &quot;

the overall sti@@ ff@@ ness of the side effects of children from 2 to 11 years was similar to the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in group similar to the plac@@ ebo group .
&quot; in small children between 6 and 23 months , the most frequently recorded side effects were reported on more frequently than plac@@ ebo ( 3,@@ 7 % ) , fe@@ ver ( 2,@@ 3 % ) and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness ( 2,@@ 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in an additional study conducted by 2,5 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in solution , no side effects in patients aged between 6 and 11 years were observed . &quot;
at the recommended doses were the plasma concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( see section 5.2 ) in the children &apos;s and adult population comparable .
in controlled clinical trials at recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents no increased frequency of fl@@ ushing in comparison to plac@@ ebo .

&quot; A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and older people to protect the flu , which is caused by the trunk ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the flu @-@ A virus . &quot;
&quot; this is a special kind of vaccine which could cause before a trunk of Gri@@ p@@ pe@@ virus that could cause a future pan@@ dem@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; a Gri@@ p@@ pe@@ pan@@ dem@@ ic breaks out when a new trunk of influ@@ enza , which can easily spread from man to man because people still have no imm@@ unity ( no protection ) against it . &quot;
&quot; after making the vaccine the immune system recognis@@ es the immune system the parts of the Gri@@ p@@ pe@@ virus as &quot; &quot; physically &quot; &quot; and forms anti@@ bodies against it . &quot;
this makes the immune system later in the position to form a contact with a grip virus of this pedi@@ gre@@ e faster anti@@ bodies .
&quot; subsequently , the membran@@ e envel@@ le of the virus with the &quot; surface surface &quot; ( prot@@ eine on the membran@@ e surface , which recognizes the human body as body @-@ alien@@ ation ) separated , and used as a component of the vaccine . &quot;
&quot; inspection of some of the study centers showed that the study was not conducted according to the &quot; &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the scope of the clinical data base for the evaluation of the vaccine is not made to fulfill the requirements of the EM@@ EA guidelines for pre@@ pan@@ dem@@ ic vacc@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; should you take part in a clinical trial and need more information on your treatment , please contact your doctor &apos;s doctor . &quot;
&quot; if you wish further information regarding the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in combination with other anti@@ vir@@ al medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which are caused by humane imm@@ weak@@ est virus of type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) which are caused by the acquired Immun@@ e De@@ fic@@ iency Syn@@ drome ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who can &apos;t swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase may not be taken as a solution to deposit , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r since the safety of this combination was not examined . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should only be sub@@ ordin@@ ated if the doctor has checked , which anti@@ vir@@ al medicines has been taken before , and the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood that the virus is addressed to the medicine . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for patients over twelve years amounts to 600 mg twice daily , which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ vir@@ al medicines . &quot;
in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg the recommended dose of as@@ gener@@ ase depends on the body weight .
A@@ gener@@ ase decreases in combination with other anti@@ vir@@ al medicines for HIV quantity in the blood and keeps them at a low level .
&quot; AIDS not to heal , however , however , can delay the immune system and thus also delay the development of with AIDS infections and diseases . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in combination with other anti@@ vir@@ al drugs , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults , which were previously not treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ certain@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; that with low dosage ampli@@ fied pharmaceuticals A@@ gener@@ ase has been taken with 206 adults , which had previously used prot@@ e@@ as@@ signs , with other proteins . &quot;
main Indi@@ c@@ ator for the effectiveness was the proportion of patients with no subsequent concentr@@ ations of HIV in the blood ( Vir@@ us@@ last ) or the change of the Vir@@ us@@ last after treatment .
&quot; in the studies with patients who previously had not taken prot@@ e@@ as@@ certain@@ ties , although after 48 weeks under A@@ generated , more patients had a vir@@ us@@ load under 400 copies / ml than under plac@@ ebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; with children lower A@@ gener@@ ic also the Vir@@ us@@ last , whereby however , by the children who had been treated earlier with prot@@ e@@ as@@ certain@@ ties , only very few of the treatment . &quot;
in the study with adults who have been treated earlier with prot@@ e@@ as@@ certain@@ ties that have been treated with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r reinforced drug A@@ gener@@ ase after 16 @-@ week treatment as effective as other proteins .
&quot; in patients with HIV , which was resistant against four other proteins of proteins , along with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a greater waste of the Vir@@ us@@ last after four weeks than with patients who have continued their previous proteins . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , Di@@ ar@@ rh@@ ö ( per@@ sever@@ ity ) , nau@@ sea , r@@ ash , r@@ ash and Fati@@ gue ( ti@@ redness ) . &quot;
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ a must not be used in patients who may not be excessive ( allergi@@ c ) against am@@ b@@ lown or one of the other components .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase may also not be used in patients who are at Johann@@ is@@ kr@@ aut ( a herbal supplement for treating depression ) or drugs , which are just as advertis@@ ed and harmful in high concentr@@ ations in the blood health . &quot;
&quot; as with other medicines for patients with patients , A@@ gener@@ ase , the risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ ph@@ ie ( changes in the distribution of the body fat ) , a ost@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ o@@ arthritis ( absorption of bone tissues ) or a immune re@@ activated syn@@ dro@@ ms ( symptoms of a infection which are caused by the recovered immune system ) . &quot;
the Committee on Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) to conclude that the advantages of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al drugs used to treat with proteins in HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee held that the use of A@@ gener@@ ic in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who previously did not have proteins in proteins . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ a was originally approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances because at the time of approval for scientific reasons only limited information is required .
&quot; October 2000 , the European Commission granted the company Gla@@ x@@ o Group Limited has permission for the In@@ dependence of A@@ gener@@ ase in the entire European Union . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase is available in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines for the treatment of HIV 1- 1- infected ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years of age .
for usually to A@@ gener@@ ase capsules for pharmac@@ oc@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ sts of amp@@ b@@ umps along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is given ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of amp@@ b@@ lown should take place taking account of the individual vir@@ al Resi@@ stance and the pre @-@ treatment of the patient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of amp@@ b@@ ish@@ ops as a solution to one is about 14 % less than from amp@@ b@@ lown capsules as a capsule ; therefore are A@@ gener@@ ase caps and solution to inser@@ ts on a milli@@ grams per milli@@ gram ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg of amp@@ b@@ umps twice daily with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines .
&quot; 2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the ampli@@ fied addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( booklet ) , higher doses must be applied to A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ generated capsules is 20 mg of amp@@ b@@ umps / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines of up to a daily @-@ highest dose of 2400 mg of Am@@ b@@ ish@@ ops which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; Pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tics , effectiveness and safety of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other proteins in children were not examined . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the mis@@ regard of data for in@@ conceivable and effectiveness ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe Leb@@ er@@ functioning dysfunction at 300 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application should be done with patients with slight or even liver functioning with caution , in patients with severe Leb@@ er@@ function it is contro@@ versi@@ al ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase may not be given simultaneously with drugs , which have a small therapeutic width and also represent the substr@@ ates of cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzy@@ me 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot;
herbal supplements that contain Johann@@ is@@ kr@@ aut ( hyper@@ icum per@@ for@@ atum ) may not be used due to the risk reduction of plasma concentration and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of amp@@ b@@ ish@@ ops during the intake of Am@@ b@@ lown . ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be pointed out that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opport@@ un@@ istic infections or other complications of an HIV infection .
the present anti@@ retro@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or cont@@ amination with blood .
&quot; for usually , A@@ gener@@ ase caps are to be used together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients who suffer from chronic h@@ epatitis B or C and treated with an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy with an anti@@ retro@@ spective treatment of potentially fat@@ al effects .
for the case of simultaneous anti@@ vir@@ al treatment of h@@ epatitis B or C please read the relevant information of this medicine .
patients with pre @-@ existing reduced liver function including a chronic @-@ active h@@ epatitis show an increased frequency of liver dys@@ functions under an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
&quot; simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ tic@@ ason or other Glu@@ k@@ ok@@ or@@ tik@@ o@@ ids , which is not recommended by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , it is not recommended , unless the potential benefits of treatment is the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ s@@ ore including Mor@@ bus C@@ s@@ ore and Supp@@ sion of the auxiliary @-@ function . ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the material altern@@ ation of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ Re@@ duc@@ t@@ ase @-@ Hem@@ mer Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ vast@@ atin has been dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , an simultaneous administration of A@@ generative with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ vast@@ atin due to the increased risk of my@@ opathy , including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ sen not recommended . &quot;
&quot; 4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threat@@ ening effects , such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , Phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , Phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and warning in ( under monitoring of the International Standardi@@ zation ratio ) , are methods of determination of the drug concentration . &quot;
&quot; in patients who take this medicine at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase may be less effective because of decreased plasma pi@@ ds . ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the possibility of met@@ abo@@ lic interactions with Am@@ u@@ x@@ avi@@ r can be altered the effectiveness of hor@@ monal contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills , however , the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions . &quot;
&quot; when meth@@ ad@@ on is given at the same time with amp@@ b@@ lown , the patients should therefore be monitored on O@@ pi@@ at@@ ent@@ ment symp@@ tom , especially if there are also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; due to the possible risk of tox@@ icity , due to the high prop@@ yl@@ ation of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution to the entry , this intest@@ inal form of children under a age of four years and should be applied with caution with certain other patients . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase should be placed on duration 5 if a r@@ ash of system@@ ic or allergi@@ c symptoms will be accompanied or the v@@ ested skins are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; in patients who received an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy including proteins , was reported about the appearance of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic or an ex@@ hilar@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus . &quot;
many of the patients had other diseases whose therapy is needed to be associated with the development of a diabetes or a hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ y .
&quot; B. high age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer continuous de anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment and the associated met@@ abo@@ lic disorders . &quot;
&quot; in h@@ äm@@ op@@ hil@@ es patients ( type A and B ) that have been treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ certain@@ ties , are reports of an increase in blo@@ od@@ ation including spontaneous hem@@ at@@ oms and here@@ mar@@ thro@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; in HIV @-@ infected patients with sever@@ ely immune def@@ ective , at the time the introduction of an anti @-@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy ( ART ) can develop an infl@@ ated reaction to as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ du@@ ous opport@@ un@@ istic infections that leads to severe clinical trials or deterioration of symptoms . &quot;
&quot; although a multi@@ fact@@ orial e@@ ti@@ ology is adopted ( including the use of cor@@ tik@@ ost@@ ero@@ ids , alcohol consumption , high Body @-@ Mass index ) , cases of O@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ o@@ arthritis in particular were reported in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 substr@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used simultaneously with medicines that have a small therapeutic width and also represent the substr@@ ates of cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzy@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substr@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ic with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be changed along with medicines whose active ingredients are being changed via CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are connected to the increased plasma pi@@ pers with heavy duty and / or li@@ fel@@ ong side effects .
&quot; it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ mon@@ avi@@ r causes , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and lead to a resident development . &quot;
&quot; trying to offset the lowest plasma cutting through a di@@ os@@ is@@ increase of other proteins in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , have been observed very often unwanted effects on the liver . &quot;
Johann@@ is@@ kr@@ aut ( Hyper@@ icum per@@ for@@ atum ) The Ser@@ um@@ mirror of Am@@ b@@ lown can be brought down through the simultaneous application of herbal preparations with Johann@@ is@@ kr@@ aut ( Hyper@@ icum per@@ for@@ atum ) .
&quot; when a patient is already redeemed at Johann@@ is@@ kr@@ aut , the am@@ b@@ lown mirror , and , if possible to check the Vir@@ us@@ last and shut down the Johann@@ is@@ kr@@ aut . &quot;
a dosage adjustment for one of the medicine is not required when Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is given together with am@@ b@@ lown ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
&quot; 508 % increased , for C@@ max against a 30 % lower , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with Am@@ nest@@ y capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
in clinical studies Do@@ si@@ sts have been used twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily used to occupy the effectiveness and thought@@ fulness of this therapy .
52 % lower when amp@@ b@@ lown ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
&quot; the C@@ min values of Am@@ mon@@ avi@@ r in Plas@@ ma , which were reached in combination of Am@@ mon@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ b@@ umps ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily . &quot;
&quot; a dosage recommended for simultaneous administration of amp@@ b@@ ish@@ ops and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , there will be a closer monitoring , since the effectiveness and un@@ think@@ able of this combination is not known . &quot;
&quot; there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study conducted by A@@ gener@@ ic in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , however , due to the ant@@ ul@@ ent component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see Ant@@ azi@@ da bottom ) . &quot;
therefore at gift of E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) .
&quot; the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ mon@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended , since the exposure of both proteins would be low . &quot;
the effect of Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ in to other proteins and available limited data can be susp@@ ected that Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ in the Ser@@ um@@ kon@@ centr@@ ation may possibly lowers .
&quot; if this medicine should be used at the same time , caution is offered as delic@@ acy in because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma cutting @-@ mas@@ egel could be less effective . &quot;
&quot; if this medicine is applied together , caution must be performed ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring is to be made , as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of amp@@ b@@ lown and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ rd@@ is difficult . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous gift of Am@@ mon@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ ol@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in Plas@@ on@@ entri@@ ation ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ fab@@ ol@@ tin around 193 % , and thus a rise in the side effects associated with Ri@@ fab@@ ol@@ tin . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons , Ri@@ ach@@ u@@ tin is required along with A@@ gener@@ ase , to be reduced to a reduction in the dosage of Ri@@ fab@@ ol@@ tin to at least half of the recommended dose , although there are no clinical data . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ oc@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin have not been carried out , however the plas@@ mas@@ al of both medicines could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration . &quot;
simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol once a daily led to an increase in the C@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol in Plas@@ ma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 members ) to the 2,@@ 69@@ mm on a daily basis without simultaneous application of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ate , inhi@@ mer or in@@ duction of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , if they are used together with A@@ gener@@ ase may possibly lead to interactions . &quot;
patients should therefore be connected to tox@@ icity reactions that are linked to these drugs if they are used in combination with A@@ gener@@ ase .
&quot; based on the data of other proteins , it is advisable that Ant@@ azi@@ da are not taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase , since it can come to res@@ or@@ atory disorders . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous application of anti@@ on@@ volcan@@ ic , which are known as en@@ cy@@ duc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , Phen@@ ob@@ y@@ al , car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in ) , with amp@@ b@@ ang@@ avi@@ r can lead to a hum@@ ili@@ ation of plasma cutting of amp@@ b@@ ish@@ ops . &quot;
&quot; the Ser@@ um Con@@ centr@@ ations of Cal@@ ci@@ um@@ bers , like Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , y@@ di@@ pin , N@@ im@@ odi@@ pin , N@@ im@@ odi@@ pin , N@@ im@@ odi@@ pin , N@@ im@@ odi@@ pin , N@@ im@@ odi@@ pin , N@@ im@@ odi@@ pin , N@@ im@@ odi@@ pin , N@@ im@@ odi@@ pin , N@@ imp@@ air@@ pin , which increases the activity and tox@@ icity of this medicine is increased . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous intake with A@@ gener@@ ase can enhance their plasma @-@ concentration , and with PD@@ E@@ 5 @-@ inhi@@ bit@@ ors in connection with side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ ension , t@@ ances and Pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
in a clinical trial where the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at int@@ ran@@ as@@ al ( 4 @-@ times daily ) over 7 days on pro@@ ban@@ anas ( 4 @-@ times daily ) over 7 days to rehear@@ sal cor@@ ti@@ sol ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days off ( 90 % reduction ( 90 % reduction ( 90 % reduction ) .
&quot; consequently , the simultaneous gift of A@@ generated with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended together with these glu@@ c@@ avi@@ r along with these glu@@ c@@ avi@@ or@@ tik@@ o@@ ids , unless the potential benefits of treatment is the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ i@@ tic @-@ effects ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; at H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ Re@@ duc@@ t@@ ase @-@ Hem@@ m@@ ics such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin , and Sim@@ vast@@ atin , whose distor@@ tion has been dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are distinct from plasma cutting with simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; since plasma cutting increases by this H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ Re@@ duc@@ t@@ ase @-@ Hem@@ m@@ ics , including a hab@@ i@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ sis , the combined application of this medicine is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended to be a frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentr@@ ations up to stabil@@ ise the mirror , since the plas@@ tic@@ on@@ entri@@ ations of Cy@@ et por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased with the current gift of amp@@ b@@ ish@@ ops ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase may not be applied together with oral bi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) , while the current application of A@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ alem Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am bew@@ are . &quot;
data for simultaneous application of par@@ enter@@ ic Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other proteins of proteins point to a possible increase in plasma cutting of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around the 3- to 4 @-@ fold .
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ on agreed together with Am@@ mon@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored on O@@ pi@@ at@@ ent@@ ment symp@@ tom , especially if there are also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; due to the di@@ ligence of historical verses of historical compar@@ isons , there cannot be any recommendation as the amp@@ b@@ lown dose is given , if Am@@ b@@ lown is given at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ on . &quot;
in con@@ current gift of warning or other or@@ alen anti@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with A@@ gener@@ ase will be an enhanced control of IN@@ R ( International norm@@ alities ) because of the possibility of a weak@@ ening or rein@@ forcement of the anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hor@@ monal contrac@@ ep@@ tive is not predic@@ table so as alternative methods are recommended for contrac@@ eption methods .
careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( for example D@@ esi@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended in con@@ current gift of A@@ gener@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; this medicine may only be applied during pregnancy only after careful extraction of possible usage for the mother , compared to the possible risks to the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; in the milk l@@ apping bre@@ wed were proven , Am@@ ir@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances were proven , however , it is not known whether Am@@ b@@ lown is over@@ flowing with people into the mother &apos;s milk . &quot;

the in@@ conceivable of A@@ gener@@ a was studied with adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical studies in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines .
&quot; most of the used effects associated with the A@@ generative @-@ treatment effects were slightly to moderate , they appear early on and led rarely to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in many of these events , it is not clari@@ fied whether they are related to the intake of A@@ gener@@ ase or another simultaneously on HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the atro@@ cities . &quot;
&quot; most of the side @-@ mentioned side effects come from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , where with Prot@@ e@@ as@@ certain@@ ties not pre @-@ treated patients 1200 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily . &quot;

the anti @-@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy has been associated with a re@@ distribution of the body fat ( Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) with HIV patients , including a loss of periph@@ eral and fast under@@ ne@@ al tissues , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of breasts and dor@@ m@@ aler fat collection ( bo@@ iled ) . &quot;

&quot; skin seals were usually easy to moderate , er@@ y@@ them@@ at@@ orial or mak@@ ul@@ op@@ ul@@ ous nature , with or without ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z , and they usually occurred during the second treatment of treatment and disappeared spont@@ aneously within two weeks , without the treatment with amp@@ b@@ ish@@ ops had to be broken off . &quot;
cases of O@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ o@@ arthritis in particular were reported in patients with generally known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
in HIV @-@ infected patients with sever@@ ely immune def@@ ective , at the time the introduction of an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al Com@@ bin@@ ational therapy ( ART ) can develop an infl@@ ated reaction to as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ du@@ al opport@@ un@@ istic infections ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with PI pre @-@ treated patients , the 600 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase were observed twice daily together with low dosage ( degree 3 and 4 ) which were observed among allergi@@ es ( degree 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( degree 3 and 4 ) which were obtained with low dose of tri@@ gly@@ ca@@ vi@@ - and CP@@ K values , which were obtained with low dosage , very often recorded . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , the patient is to observe signs of an in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , are required support measures . &quot;

&quot; anti@@ vir@@ al activity of Am@@ mon@@ avi@@ r in vit@@ ro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied both in ac@@ ute and chronic in@@ ymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tic cell lines ( M@@ T @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as in periph@@ eral blood @-@ ymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ ec@@ cent@@ ric ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ mon@@ avi@@ r is located in the range of 0.@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µm in infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µm in chronic infected cells
the connection between the activity of Am@@ mon@@ y against HIV @-@ 1 in vit@@ ro and the im@@ itation of HIV @-@ 1 replic@@ ation in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al not pre @-@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ amp@@ avi@@ r @-@ Do@@ si@@ ties - as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r b@@ oo@@ ster@@ o@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors - the described mut@@ ations are rarely observed .

gen@@ otyp@@ e @-@ based analyses Gen@@ otyp@@ e inter@@ pret@@ ations can be applied to de@@ preci@@ ation of the activity of amp@@ b@@ lown / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ certain@@ ties .
&quot; the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 @-@ algorithm for Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / C / F / V , I@@ 54@@ F , I@@ 54@@ F , I@@ 54@@ F , I@@ 84@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in connection with a gest@@ ated ph@@ one@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and a reduced lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood of a vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) . &quot;
&quot; the conclusions concerning the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation@@ sm@@ u@@ ster can be amended by additional data , and it is recommended to always educate the current inter@@ pret@@ ations to analyse the results of resistance tests . &quot;
on ph@@ ur@@ otyp@@ e @-@ based analyses clinical analysis @-@ based analysis systems can be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ e data for de@@ preci@@ ation of the activity of amp@@ b@@ lown / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ avi@@ r in patients with Prot@@ e@@ as@@ formerly isol@@ ates isol@@ ates .
companies that sell diagnostic resistance tests , have developed clin@@ ically @-@ ph@@ än@@ otyp@@ e @-@ off@@ s ( cutting points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be applied to the interpretation of results of a resident test tests . &quot;
&quot; each of these four with a reduced sensitivity against Am@@ mon@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns produces a certain cruise resistant to Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity against in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r stays in general . &quot;
&quot; there are currently data for cross @-@ resistant difference between amp@@ b@@ lown and other proteins of proteins for all 4 Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r resident , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of fifth twenty anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al &apos;s non @-@ treated patients , with whom a Fos@@ amp@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , Dar@@ in@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ thor@@ avi@@ r re@@ tains its activity against some other proteins of protein isol@@ ates ; the receipt of these activity seems to be dependent upon the number and type of Resi@@ st@@ ence mut@@ ations in isol@@ ates . &quot;

&quot; the cover of the effectiveness of A@@ generative in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ised open study , in which with PI pre @-@ treated adult ( NR@@ TI ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) , with a PI , primarily associated with the lowest Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; one @-@ time @-@ thir@@ teen ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus @-@ sensitivity compared to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one NR@@ TI were included in the part study A by PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
the primary analysis set the non @-@ sub @-@ leg@@ ality of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI Group in terms of time @-@ adjustable ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in Plas@@ ma after 16 weeks of age ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in Plas@@ ma after 16 weeks of age of 0,@@ 4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
&quot; the cover of the effectiveness of un@@ geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ tem A@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled studies with a total of 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 years , of which 152 were treated with PI . &quot;
&quot; in studies A@@ gener@@ ase solution to take and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg 3 times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2,5 mg / kg twice daily , whereby the majority of patients receive 20 mg / kg twice daily . &quot;
there was no low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of the patients treated with PI @-@ treated patients previously had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the attached NR@@ TI@@ s .
&quot; after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of the patients included a plasma @-@ 1 @-@ R@@ NA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml with a medi@@ ans increase in the CD@@ 4 cell number of 26 cells / mm ³ ( s = 74 ) compared to the output value . &quot;
19 Basi@@ cs on this data should be considered with the therapy optimization for the benefit of &quot; In@@ geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ tem &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase in consideration .
&quot; according to oral administration , the average duration ( t@@ max ) is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
&quot; 508 % increased , for C@@ max against about 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) together with Am@@ nest@@ y ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; administration of Am@@ b@@ ish@@ ops with a meal leads to a 25 % total acceptance of AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of amp@@ b@@ lown 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the minimum concentration at ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , s@@ s ) remained un@@ influenced by the food intake , although the simultaneous food intake is affected by the extent and rate of res@@ or@@ ption . &quot;
the apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and leaves a large distribution volume as well as an enormous penetration of amp@@ b@@ lown from the blood cycle in the tissue .
&quot; this change leads to a decrease of the total concentration of the drug in the plasma , whereby the amount of in@@ adequate Am@@ b@@ ish@@ ops which represents the active share , probably remains the same . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of in@@ adequate Am@@ b@@ umps remains constant , the percentage of free active components , depending on the total doctor of the ste@@ ady State of the ste@@ ady State on the area of C@@ max , s@@ s up to C@@ min , s@@ s . &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines that CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ duce or inhi@@ bit or a sub@@ str@@ ate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with caution can be given once they are given simultaneously with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase caps , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily amp @-@ up @-@ exposure as with adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ ber avi@@ r is from the solution 14 % less bi@@ over@@ flowing as from the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase solution and A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ metre base . &quot;
&quot; even the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible , therefore the effect of a kid@@ ney function is likely to be low . &quot;
these therapy schem@@ ata lead to Am@@ b@@ ish@@ ops @-@ plasma pi@@ ers comparable to those who have made to healthy pro@@ ban@@ ces after a dosage of 1200 mg of amp@@ b@@ umps twice daily without simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies to rab@@ bit in mice and rats , with male animals ben@@ ign h@@ ep@@ at@@ cell@@ ular A@@ den@@ ome with doses at d@@ si@@ ties with doses at d@@ osing ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - triple ( R@@ atte ) of the exposure to man , according to twice daily gift of 1200 mg of amp@@ b@@ lown . &quot;
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ular A@@ den@@ ome and car@@ cin@@ oms has not been enlight@@ ened and the relevance of these observed effects for man is un@@ clear .
&quot; from the present exposure data on people , both in clinical studies as well as from therapeutic use , however , however , little evidence of acceptance of a clinical relevance of these findings . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and In @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ical testing , the bacterial stra@@ w@@ ph@@ oma test , micro@@ kern@@ els of rats and Chro@@ mos@@ omen@@ err@@ ational test , was amp@@ b@@ lown neither mut@@ u@@ ous nor gen@@ esis . &quot;
this liver tox@@ icity can be monitored and proven in clinical everyday life by measuring A@@ ST , AL@@ T and the activity of al@@ kal@@ ine Ph@@ osph@@ at@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; until now , in clinical studies there have been observed no significant liver tox@@ icity in patients , neither during administration of A@@ gener@@ ic nor after the end of the treatment . &quot;
&quot; studies for tox@@ icity in young animals , which were treated at an age of 4 days , showed both to the control and with the b@@ lown animals a high mor@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; at a system@@ ic plasma @-@ position , which lay significant among ( edges ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected ex@@ position under therapeutic dosage , however , have been observed a number of slight changes including Th@@ y@@ mus@@ el@@ ong@@ ation and low sk@@ el@@ eton changes that can be found on a consuming developments . &quot;
24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the ampli@@ fied addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( booklet ) must be used for higher doses of A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ generated capsules is 20 mg of amp@@ b@@ umps / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines of up to a daily @-@ highest dose of 2400 mg of Am@@ b@@ ish@@ ops which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the simultaneous application is to be performed in patients with a vig@@ il@@ ance or easier liver functioning with caution , in patients with severe Leb@@ er@@ function it is contro@@ versi@@ al ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 26 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threat@@ ening effects , such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , Phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , Phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and warning in ( under monitoring of the International Standardi@@ zation ratio ) , are methods of determination of the drug concentration . &quot;

&quot; the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ mon@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended , since the exposure of both proteins would be low . &quot;
&quot; if this medicine is applied together , caution must be performed ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring is to be made , as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of amp@@ b@@ lown and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ rd@@ is difficult . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons , Ri@@ ach@@ u@@ tin is required along with A@@ gener@@ ase , is to be reduced to a reduction in the dosage of Ri@@ fab@@ ol@@ tin to at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although there are no clinical data . &quot;

&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ thor@@ avi@@ r re@@ tains its activity against some other proteins of protein isol@@ ates ; the receipt of these activity seems to be dependent upon the number and type of Resi@@ st@@ ence mut@@ ations in isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; based on these data should be taken into consideration in the therapy with PI @-@ treated children of &quot; &quot; im@@ pregn@@ ated &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase &quot; . &quot; &quot;

&quot; if the local Hau@@ ling actions can cause big discomfort or are very strong , the treatment can be suspended for a few days . &quot;
&quot; from the data of an open clinical trial , patients with more than 8 AK@@ - L@@ ä@@ sions provide a shorter complete healing rate than patients with less than 8 l@@ esi@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; due to the imm@@ ac@@ ulating properties , Im@@ i@@ quim@@ od Cre@@ am should be applied with caution in patients who receive an immun@@ otherap@@ ist de@@ pressed treatment ( see 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; from animal studies there are no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fat development , the discharge or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; although not according to one time still after multi @-@ storey application , quanti@@ fied serv@@ ings levels ( &gt; 5@@ n@@ g / ml ) can be given no recommendation to apply during lact@@ ation time . &quot;
the most commonly used shared and may be used as likely or possibly with the application of Im@@ i@@ quim@@ od cream in connection with three times weekly treatment were local reactions at the place of treatment of f@@ eig@@ war@@ ts ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of the patients treated with Im@@ i@@ quim@@ od treatment ) .
&quot; among the most commonly reported cases , as probably or possibly with the application of the Im@@ i@@ quim@@ od Cre@@ me in connection @-@ side effects include complaints at the application location with an frequency of 28,@@ 1 % . &quot;
the bases of 185 with Im@@ i@@ quim@@ od @-@ Cre@@ am treated in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trial of phase III reported side effects are listed below .
the most common , as likely or possibly with the application of the Im@@ i@@ quim@@ od Cre@@ me in connection @-@ effect were in these studies a reaction to the application location ( 22 % of the patients treated with Im@@ i@@ quim@@ od treatment ) . &quot;

&quot; according to the inspection of the clinical evaluation of the clinical trial , it shows that in these plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with three times of weekly treatment with imp@@ i@@ quim@@ od cream , including Er@@ y@@ them ( 61 % ) , ero@@ sion ( 23 % ) and the ( 14 % ) and the ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; according to the inspection of the clinical evaluation of the clinical signs , it shows that in these studies with five times weekly treatment with Im@@ i@@ quim@@ od cream cream very often on heavy duty @-@ themes ( 13 % ) , heavy ero@@ sion ( 13 % ) , and to heavy duty @-@ training and c@@ abling ( 19 % ) . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials to investigate the application of Im@@ i@@ quim@@ od for the treatment of ak@@ t@@ ine ker@@ at@@ ose , Alo@@ pe@@ y was observed with an frequency of 0.7 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment office or in the surrounding area . &quot;
&quot; the irre@@ ver@@ ly unique absorption of 200 mg of Im@@ i@@ quim@@ od , which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags , could lead to nau@@ sea , head@@ aches , myth@@ ical and fe@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; the clin@@ ically most serious side @-@ effect , which entered into several or@@ al doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted in hyp@@ ot@@ ony that has been norm@@ alized or in@@ tra@@ ven@@ ous fluid . &quot;
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic investigation were proven according to the top@@ ographic application of Im@@ i@@ quim@@ od growing system@@ ic concentr@@ ations of the alpha@@ bet and other cy@@ to@@ k@@ ine .
in 3 the relevant phase 3 efficacy studies could be shown that the effectiveness in relation to a complete heat treatment at an im@@ i@@ quim@@ od treatment over 16 weeks of a plac@@ ebo treatment is significantly superior .
at 60 % of the total of 119 with Im@@ i@@ quim@@ od therap@@ ists the fet@@ ters fully from ; this was at 20 % of the 105 with plac@@ ebo diagnosed patients ( 95 % CI ) :
a complete lower@@ ing could be reached at 23 % of 157 with Im@@ i@@ quim@@ od treat@@ ed male patients to 5 % of 161 with plac@@ ebo treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) :
the effectiveness of Im@@ i@@ quim@@ od at five mal@@ iger application per week over 6 weeks was evaluated in two double blin@@ ders , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials . &quot;
the target @-@ c@@ ors were hi@@ st@@ ologically confirmed individual primary super@@ fi@@ di@@ pl@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 cm and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
&quot; the data from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years show that around 7@@ 9.3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.9 % ) &#93; all treated patients clin@@ ically been cured and this also stayed for 48 months . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of Im@@ i@@ quim@@ od with three times of weekly use in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week period , treatment @-@ free period , was examined in two double blin@@ ders , plac@@ eb@@ oc@@ ont@@ rol@@ un@@ answered clinical studies . &quot;

the effectiveness of Im@@ i@@ quim@@ od could not be shown in these studies with the doses examined there ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks ) .
a minimum system intake of the 5 % of the 5 % be@@ i@@ quim@@ od cre@@ ams by the skin of 58 patients with ak@@ t@@ in@@ ic Ker@@ at@@ osis was observed during three times of weekly usage during 16 weeks .

&quot; the study was primarily examined by the security of the drug , but it has also measured its effectiveness ( by examining its effect in terms of reduction in g@@ ag concentr@@ ations in the urine and in terms of the size of the liver ) . &quot;
&quot; with children under five years of age Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me the G@@ ag concentr@@ ations in the urine around 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , pan@@ dem@@ ag@@ athy ( laughter ) , Ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , Ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( in hands and feet ) , Hit@@ z@@ eg@@ e@@ emp@@ athy , fe@@ ver and reactions to the in@@ fusion set . &quot;

&quot; the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will receive patients , the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , with regard to the reactions to in@@ fusion and the development of anti@@ bodies . &quot;
June 2003 the European Commission welcomed Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. is a licence for the In@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in the entire European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of humane DNA @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using Ch@@ o @-@ mamm@@ alian cell division ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ vary , E@@ ier@@ stock of the Chinese Ham@@ sters ) . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is for long @-@ term enzy@@ mes in patients with secured diagnosis of a Mu@@ kop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ ch@@ ari@@ d I ( MPS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place by a doctor , the experience in treating patients with MPS I or other her@@ edit@@ ary metabolism . &quot;
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be toler@@ ated when the patient can toler@@ ated this every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
&quot; the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and for these patients there cannot be a do@@ cking scheme . &quot;
&quot; the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kid@@ ney or liver efficiency has not been determined , and for these patients cannot be recommended any do@@ cking scheme . &quot;
&quot; with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , patients can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which are defined as any in connection with side effects that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; for this reason especially these patients should continue to be monitored , and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be made available in a reasonable clinical environment in the re@@ organization facilities for medical emergen@@ cies . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical phase 3 @-@ study , that almost all patients Ig@@ G @-@ anti@@ bodies against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase are usually formed within 3 months from treatment . &quot;
patients who develop anti@@ bodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion in reaction must be treated with caution from Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with caution ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; since little experience regarding the res@@ um@@ ption of treatment after a longer break , has to be done due to the theoretical risk of an over@@ sensitivity reaction after the inter@@ ruption of the treatment . &quot;
60 minutes before the start of in@@ fusion with medication ( anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ini@@ ka and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ tika ) to treat the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion reactions .
&quot; in case of mild or moderate @-@ related response to the treatment with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ini@@ ka and Par@@ ac@@ et@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to half the in@@ fusion rate , where the reaction occurred . &quot;
&quot; in case of a single , heavy in@@ fusion in response the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are brought to decline , a treatment with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ini@@ ka and Par@@ ac@@ et@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to aw@@ aken . &quot;
in@@ fusion can be performed with a reduction of in@@ fusion rate on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
&quot; 3 ( anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ini@@ ka and Par@@ ac@@ et@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids ) , as well as a reduction in in@@ fusion rate on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of in@@ fusion rate , where the required reaction occurred . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be applied simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ quin or Proc@@ ain because a potential risk of interference with in@@ tra@@ cell@@ ular absorption of Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
&quot; experimental studies do not leave direct or indirect impact on pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; because no data on new@@ born , which were exposed to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase over the mother &apos;s milk , is recommended , is recommended during the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me not to silent . &quot;
the side effects in clinical trials were organized mainly as in@@ fusion condi@@ tional reactions which have been observed at 53 % of patients in the phase 3 @-@ 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and at 35 % of patients in the study with participants under the age of 5 ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) .
&quot; unwanted drugs in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were observed during phase 3 @-@ 3 study and its extension for a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older in a treatment period of up to 4 years , are common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) . &quot;
&quot; in some patients with severe MPS @-@ I @-@ condi@@ tional involvement of the upper brea@@ ths and gaps in the pre @-@ history , moreover , heavy reactions to , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ mus , resp@@ ir@@ atory and fac@@ ial ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children Un@@ le@@ ased drug interactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 @-@ study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years , with mainly heavy duty shape and a treatment duration up to 12 months , reported are listed in the table . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg in@@ tra@@ ven@@ ous once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg in@@ tra@@ ven@@ ous once a week , 200 E / kg in@@ tra@@ ven@@ ous every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg in@@ tra@@ ven@@ ous every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in most patients there was a serv@@ o version within 3 months following the treatment of a ser@@ ok@@ on@@ version , whereby it came to patients aged under 5 years with a heavy bond form ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days with patients aged 5 years and older ) . &quot;
&quot; until the end of the phase 3 @-@ study ( or up to a premature pull out of the study ) , at 13 / 45 patients were not found by radio@@ immun@@ o@@ ge@@ al anti@@ bodies ( RI@@ P ) As@@ say , including 3 patients , where it has never come to ser@@ ok@@ on@@ version . &quot;
&quot; patients with errors to the lowest anti@@ bodies mirror , a robust reduction in the g@@ ag mirror in the Har@@ n , while patients with high anti@@ bodies to determine a variable reduction of g@@ ag in the Har@@ n . &quot;
&quot; four patients ( three in the phase 3 @-@ study and one in Phase 2 @-@ study ) showed a margin@@ ally to small neutral inhi@@ bit@@ or@@ ic effect on the enz@@ ym@@ atic Lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ - activity in vit@@ ro , which seemed to inter@@ fere with the clinical effectiveness and / or the reduction of g@@ ag in the Har@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the presence of anti@@ bodies did not seem to stand in connection with the incidence of unwanted drugs , even if the appearance of unwanted drug interactions typically fell together with the formation of Ig@@ G @-@ anti@@ bodies . &quot;
the reason@@ ing for the enzy@@ mes is in one for the hy@@ d@@ rol@@ y@@ se of the ac@@ ulate sub@@ state and the prevention of another accumulation of adequate growth of enzy@@ mes .
&quot; after in@@ tra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly taken from the cycle and recorded by cells into the Ly@@ s@@ os@@ om@@ es , most likely about Mann@@ ose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ or@@ at@@ - recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a random@@ ised , double blin@@ ders , plac@@ eb@@ oc@@ ont@@ rol@@ un@@ loaded phase @-@ 3 @-@ study at 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years . &quot;
&quot; although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , which showed the entire disease spectrum , was the majority of patients from the middle phen@@ otyp@@ e and only a patient pointed to the heavy phen@@ otyp@@ e . &quot;
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a for@@ ci@@ ated volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute test test .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension where they received more 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) every week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
after 26 weeks of therapy the patients were treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me patients compared to the plac@@ eb@@ og@@ as an improvement of the lung function and the capacity that is shown in the following table .
&quot; during open renewal study , an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 182 weeks in plac@@ ebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as follows from the following table . &quot;
the decrease of the expected percentage of the FE@@ V is not significant over this period of time and the absolute lung vol@@ um@@ ina increased further proportional to the height of growing children .
&quot; from 26 patients with a H@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ alie , before treatment reached 22 ( 85 % ) to the end of the study a normal live size . &quot;
&quot; within the first 4 weeks , a clear drop of the g@@ ag mirror was established in the Har@@ n ( µ@@ g / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) which remained constant until the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; regarding the hetero@@ gene@@ ous stret@@ chers between the patients who taken into account by using a combined end point , the clin@@ ically significant changes in the 6 @-@ minute test , was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deterioration at 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot;

&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is applied together with Cis@@ pl@@ atin ( a other medicine against cancer ) if cancer is not removed ( drugs against cancer ) , and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( e.g. surgery alone can not be removed ) and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( by an operation alone can not be removed ) and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; non @-@ national &quot; pneum@@ atic cancer , which does not shed the plate of epi@@ th@@ el@@ cells . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is not treated with patients who previously had not been treated in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who previously received other chem@@ otherap@@ ies , as well as for some therapy . &quot;
to reduce side effects should be given patients during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fol@@ ate ( an vitamin ) and inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
&quot; if A@@ lim@@ ta is given together with Cis@@ pl@@ atin , should be given before or after the gift of cis@@ pl@@ atin in addition an &quot; anti@@ em@@ e@@ tik@@ um &quot; ( medicines for breaking ) and liquids ( to bow to a liquid lack ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose blood image changes , or when certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be raised up or the dose should be reduced . &quot;
the active form of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed slow@@ s the formation of DNA and R@@ NA and prevent the cells split .
&quot; the transformation of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed into its active form goes more easily than in healthy cells , which leads to higher concentr@@ ations of the active form of drug using and a longer lasting effect of cancer . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of mal@@ icious Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ oms , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a main study of 456 patients , which previously had not received chem@@ otherapy against their disease . &quot;
&quot; in treating non @-@ clinical lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta have been treated with local advanced or metast@@ atic illness , which previously had been treated with chem@@ otherapy with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another medicine against cancer ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ in ( a further medicine against cancer ) , and both in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin in a study at 1 7@@ 25 patients who previously had not received chem@@ otherapy for lung cancer . &quot;
&quot; patients who have been treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and Cis@@ pl@@ atin , survived an average of 12.5 months , compared to 9,@@ 3 months at the sole administration of Cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; in patients who previously had previously received chem@@ otherapy , the average over@@ life time with A@@ lim@@ ta 8,@@ 3 months , compared to 7,@@ 9 months at Doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el . &quot;

during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed must be taken at least 5 cans of fol@@ onic acid and the intake must continue during the entire treatment period as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients must also receive an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) in the week before the first p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed dose as well as after each third round cycle .
&quot; in patients who received P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed , should be created before each gift of a complete blood image - the , including a differenti@@ ation of the leu@@ ko@@ zy@@ ten and a Th@@ rom@@ an@@ zy@@ ch . &quot;
the al@@ kal@@ ine Ph@@ osph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ at @-@ tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( A@@ ST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine @-@ tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AL@@ T or SG@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 @-@ fold of the upper limit value . &quot;
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a D@@ os@@ is@@ econ@@ d will take place under the reck@@ oning of the blood of blood or the maximum not @-@ h@@ mat@@ ological tox@@ icity of the previous therapy cycles . &quot;
&quot; after the recovery , patients must be treated according to the instructions in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for ALI@@ M@@ TA as Mon@@ otherapy or in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
these criteria correspond to the definition of National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ icity C@@ rit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; NC@@ I 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degrees 2 ble@@ eding .
&quot; should patients not develop @-@ h@@ mat@@ ological tox@@ icity ≥ grade 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity ) , the therapy with ALI@@ M@@ TA must be interrupted by the patient the value before the treatment
the treatment with ALI@@ M@@ TA must be cancel@@ ed when patients after 2 di@@ os@@ is@@ tive tox@@ icity or non @-@ h@@ mat@@ ological tox@@ icity degree 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - fort at the appearance of degree 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
clinical trials have no indication that in patients aged 65 years - or in comparison to patients aged 65 years an increased by side @-@ effective risk .
ALI@@ ZA@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to non @-@ sufficient data of in@@ conceivable and effectiveness .
&quot; in clinical studies , patients were not necessary for patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance by ≥ 45 ml / min . &quot;
the data base for patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance under 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; however , patients were examined with a Leb@@ er@@ up@@ set player of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper leg ( with lower@@ ing of the upper limit value ) or &gt; 5,@@ 0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in the presence of Leb@@ an@@ et@@ ast@@ asen ) , not specifically investigated in the studies . &quot;
patients must be monitored in terms of bone mark@@ ings and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed must not be given to patients before their absolute neutr@@ ality number must be given a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ - cy@@ linders again reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dosage reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adir of the absolute neut@@ ro@@ ids and maxim@@ ally non @-@ mat@@ ological tox@@ icity , as they were observed in the previous treatment cycles - ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
a less@@ er tox@@ icity and a reduction of degrees 3 / 4 h@@ ä@@ mat@@ ological tox@@ icity such as neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie and infection with degree 3 / 4 Neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie was captured when a pre @-@ treatment with fol@@ ate and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
&quot; therefore all patients must be instruc@@ ted with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed patients , fol@@ ate and vitamin B@@ 12 as a proph@@ etic measure for reduction @-@ related tox@@ icity ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients with easy to medium N@@ ier@@ en@@ in@@ suff@@ iciency ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and Ac@@ et@@ yl@@ s@@ ali@@ - cy@@ ls@@ acid ( &gt; 1,@@ 3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before the therapy and mind@@ set - TE@@ NS 2 days after treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; all patients who are provided for therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed , take the intake of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with a long half @-@ value for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients , where these events occurred , appropriate risk factors for the appearance of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , the existing hyper@@ tension or diabetes . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid liquid collection - collection in the trans@@ cell@@ ular space a dra@@ inage of the Erg@@ onom@@ y in front of the p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed treatment . &quot;
&quot; 5 serious cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ k@@ ard@@ in@@ colored , and cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cul@@ t events were reported in clinical studies with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed occasionally , if this drug was usually given in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ et@@ ox@@ ic drug . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated livel@@ ih@@ u@@ bs ( excluding terrain , this vaccine is not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of an irre@@ ver@@ sible damage caused by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed , men should be pointed out before the treatment - g@@ inn to get advice regarding the sperm level . &quot;
&quot; in patients with normal kid@@ ney function ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds , such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and Ac@@ et@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1,@@ 3 g daily ) to a reduced p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed outlet with the consequence of a more increasing effect of side effects . &quot;
&quot; therefore , caution if in patients with normal kid@@ ney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or Ac@@ tu@@ t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ acid can be used in high dosage . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or Ac@@ et@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ac@@ idity in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and mind@@ set - TE@@ NS 2 days after treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no data regarding the interaction potential as with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with a long half @-@ value , such as Pi@@ ro@@ x@@ x@@ ic@@ am or Ro@@ f@@ ec@@ ox@@ i@@ b , must be avoided at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - x@@ ed . &quot;
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the scent status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between or@@ ag@@ ul@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine chem@@ otherapy requires increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International norm@@ alities ) if the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
&quot; there are no data for the use of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed in pregnant , but as with an@@ de@@ - An@@ tim@@ ber@@ ol@@ ites are expected during an application in the pregnancy of heavy birth . &quot;
&quot; P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed must not be used during pregnancy , except if absolutely - requirements and after careful dra@@ fting of the user for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of an irre@@ ver@@ sible damage to the reproductive ability by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed , men should be pointed out before the treatment commen@@ ces , advice regarding the sperm count . &quot;
it is not known whether P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed goes into the mother &apos;s milk and unwanted effects on tor@@ till@@ ed inf@@ ward cannot be excluded .

&quot; primary analysis of this study was made in the population of all patients , which were received in the treatment of treatment ( random@@ ized and treated ) . &quot;
a statis@@ tically significant improvement of the clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and Dy@@ sp@@ no@@ e ) in connection with the mal@@ ig@@ nen Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ om was shown at the use of the Lun@@ ar Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ om during the application of the Lun@@ ches / Cis@@ pl@@ atin @-@ arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the sole cis@@ pl@@ a- tin @-@ arm ( 218 patients ) .

all@@ i is required for weight reduction of adults with overweight ( body @-@ Mass BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hy@@ po@@ kal@@ ine and fatty diet .
&quot; all@@ i may not be applied to children and young people under 18 , because not enough data on the effectiveness and safety . &quot;

the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood of the advent of gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal symptoms ( see section 4.8 ) can increase when all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ period or f@@ ett@@ rich@@ er diet .
&quot; as the weight reduction in diabetes can be obtained with improved met@@ abo@@ lic control , patients who consult a medicine against diabetes , before the beginning of a therapy with all@@ i a doctor or pharmac@@ ist , because the dosage of anti@@ dia@@ be@@ tics must be adapted . &quot;
patients who take all@@ i as well as medicines for blood pressure or an increased cholester@@ ol levels or a increased cholester@@ ol levels should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ists whether the dosage of this medicine must be adjusted .
&quot; it is recommended to meet additional fluctu@@ ating measures in order to bow to the case of severe Di@@ ar@@ rh@@ ö possible ver@@ sus the oral contra@@ sting contrac@@ eption ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
both in a study on interactions of drugs as well as in several cases with simultaneous application of or@@ list@@ at and Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in was observed an ab@@ sen@@ ing of Cic@@ ing por@@ in plasma cutting .
&quot; when applying War@@ far@@ in or other or@@ alen anti@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with Or@@ list@@ at could be influenced by Quick values ( internationally norm@@ alities , IN@@ R ) ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in most patients who have been treated in clinical studies up to 4 full years with or@@ list@@ at , the concentr@@ ations of vitamins A , D , E and K and the beta car@@ ot@@ ins in the standardis@@ ation area . &quot;
&quot; however , the patients should be recommended before bed@@ time a supplement of the mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement to ensure sufficient vitality intake ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; after the gift of a single painting Ami@@ o@@ dar@@ on was observed in a limited number of volunteers , which at the same time received Or@@ list@@ at , a slight decrease of Ami@@ o@@ dar@@ on @-@ plasma science . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly hospitable nature and hang together with the pharmac@@ ological effect of drug by means of preventing the absorption of in@@ filtr@@ ated fat .
the gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal side effects were obtained from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a duration of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary .
&quot; the skins are defined as follows : very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 ) , and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency on the basis of the available data is not removable ) . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of which ad@@ verse side effects were determined according to the market launch of Or@@ list@@ at , is not known because these events were voluntarily reported from a population of a certain size . &quot;
+ It is pl@@ au@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can lead to inf@@ ancy in terms of possible or actual gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal side effects .
&quot; individual doses of 800 mg of Or@@ list@@ at and multiple sclerosis from up to 400 mg three times daily were given over a period of 15 days to norm@@ al@@ ge@@ important and overweight pro@@ ban@@ den , without the significant clinical trials . &quot;
with the majority of reported cases reported in the market reported cases of or@@ list@@ at @-@ over@@ do@@ zation have either been reported to any side effects or similar side effects such as the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
&quot; based on investigations on people and animals can be attributed by a rapid re@@ formation of system@@ ic effects , which can be attributed to the li@@ abilities of the or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
the therapeutic effect continues in the lum@@ ens of the stomach and the upper thin @-@ intest@@ ine by kov@@ al@@ ente to the active ser@@ in @-@ rest of gast@@ ric and pan@@ cre@@ atic Li@@ pas@@ en .
&quot; clinical trials was derived from clinical trials that 60 mg of Or@@ list@@ at , three times taken daily , the absorption of about 25 % of food is blocked . &quot;
&quot; two double blind , random@@ ized @-@ plac@@ eable studies of adults with an BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 occupy the effectiveness of 60 mg of Or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times daily in combination with a hy@@ po@@ kal@@ ine , fatty food . &quot;
&quot; primary parameters , the change of body weight compared to the output value ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ ization ) , has been rated as follows : as a change in the course of course ( table 1 ) and as a share of the study participants who have lost over 5 % or more than 10 % of their output weight ( table 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although in both studies the weight reduction has been observed over 12 months , the biggest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months . &quot;
the average change in the overall cholester@@ ol was with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 2.@@ 4 % ( starting 5.6 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with plac@@ ebo + 2.@@ 8 % ( output worth 5.4 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change of the L@@ DL cholester@@ ol was equivalent to Or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( starting value 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with plac@@ ebo + 3.2 % ( output value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average modification was the average change -@@ 4,5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( starting 10@@ 3.@@ 7 cm ) and with plac@@ ebo -@@ 3.@@ 6 cm ( value value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .

Alo@@ xi is applied to chem@@ otherapy that are strong pe@@ ers for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting are ( like Cis@@ pl@@ atin ) as well as for chem@@ otherapy that are gr@@ aci@@ ers for nau@@ sea and om@@ iting are ( like cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , Do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in or Car@@ bo@@ pl@@ atin ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be enhanced by the additional gift of a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids ( a medicine that can be used as anti@@ em@@ e@@ tic@@ um ) .
the use of patients under 18 years of age is not recommended because to the effects in this age group does not exist enough information .
&quot; this means that the drug use a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ Hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in Dar@@ m . &quot;
Alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies at 1 842 adults who received chem@@ otherap@@ ies which are strong or excessive trigger for nau@@ sea and breaking .
&quot; for chem@@ otherapy that have been treated strong pe@@ ers for exercise and breaking , showed 59 % of patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi in the 24 hours after chem@@ otherapy ( 132 of 223 ) , over 57 % of the patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron patients ( 126 of 221 ) . &quot;
&quot; for chem@@ otherapy , the excessive trigger for nau@@ sea and breaking , showed 81 % of the patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi in the 24 hours after chem@@ otherapy ( 153 from 189 ) , over 69 % of the patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron patients ( 127 of 185 ) . &quot;
&quot; with a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron , these values at 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 from 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 from 191 patients ) . &quot;
&quot; March 2005 , the European Commission hosted the European Commission of Helsinki n Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmac@@ euticals Ltd . a permit for the In@@ dependence of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union . &quot;
Alo@@ xi is indi@@ gen@@ dered : to the prevention of ac@@ om@@ iting and ex@@ iting at strong em@@ eto@@ gen@@ ic chem@@ otherapy due to a cancer disease and to the prevention of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting chem@@ otherapy due to a cancer disease .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi for prevention of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting that is induc@@ ed by a strongly em@@ eto@@ gen@@ ic chem@@ otherapy that can be enhanced by adding one before the chem@@ otherapy given cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids .

&quot; however , like with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 @-@ Ant@@ ag@@ ists , however , caution with the current gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with pharmaceuticals that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients , where the Q@@ T interval is extended or which circum@@ cis@@ ed for such an extension . &quot;
&quot; except in connection with another chemical therapy , Alo@@ xi should be used in the days after chem@@ otherapy neither for prevention nor for the treatment of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting . &quot;
in pre@@ clinical trials Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron the against tum@@ ors the activity of the five examined chem@@ otherap@@ ists not ( Cis@@ pl@@ atin , cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , Cy@@ clo@@ ab@@ in , Do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in and Mit@@ omy@@ cin C ) . &quot;

&quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of over@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions at the agreement ( burning , curing , complaints and pain ) have been reported in post @-@ marketing experiences . &quot;
&quot; in the group with the highest dosage , similar frequencies showed themselves from unwanted events such as in the other doses , there were no dose of activity relations . &quot;
there were no di@@ aly@@ sis studies carried out due to the large distribution volume is a di@@ aly@@ sis but probably no effective therapy with a alo@@ xi@@ ety .
&quot; in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind@@ ed studies were given a total of 1,@@ 132 patients , which were a moder@@ em@@ eto@@ gen@@ ic chem@@ otherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 Do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in and 250 micro@@ gram or 750 mg Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ time 7,@@ 3 hours ) , which was given on day 1 without D@@ ex@@ ame@@ th@@ ason in@@ tra@@ ven@@ ous . &quot;

results of the studies with moderate chemical chem@@ otherapy and the study with strong em@@ eto@@ gen@@ ic chem@@ otherapy are summar@@ ized in the following tables .
&quot; in clinical studies for the indication of chem@@ otherapy and ex@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron have been comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ T@@ c Inter@@ v@@ alls with the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; after the invented pre @-@ clinical trial , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the is@@ ent@@ arian de@@ centr@@ ation and Rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation involved and extend the duration of the shareholder . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the study conducted by 221 healthy Pro@@ ban@@ den , was the assessment of the E@@ EC@@ G Eff@@ ective Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in individual doses of 0,@@ 25 , 0,@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg . &quot;
&quot; res@@ or@@ ption After in@@ tra@@ ven@@ ous gift follows the initial acceptance of Plas@@ mak@@ on@@ entri@@ ations a slow Eli@@ mination of the body with an average week@@ day period of about 40 hours . &quot;
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the surface under the concentr@@ ations period ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - 1 ) are generally proportional to the entire D@@ os@@ is@@ area of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ g / kg with gest@@ ures and cancer patients dos@@ o dos@@ o .

&quot; derived from phar@@ yn@@ oc@@ ine@@ tic simulation , that at once a daily use of 0,@@ 25 mg pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has been comparable to 3 consecutive days ; however , the C@@ max after the single date of 0.@@ 75 mg was higher ; however , the C@@ max after the single @-@ painting of 0.@@ 75 mg was higher . &quot;
about 40 % will be eliminated by the kid@@ neys and about another 50 % are converted into two primary metals compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron over less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on 5@@ HT@@ 3 recept@@ ors .
&quot; in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ studies on the met@@ abo@@ ization have shown that CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in light dimensions , the I@@ so@@ enzy@@ me CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 at the met@@ abo@@ ism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are involved . &quot;
&quot; Eli@@ jah After a in@@ tra@@ ven@@ ous individual dose of 10 micro@@ gram / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron have been found approximately 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ changing active ingredients made approximately 40 % of the given dosage . &quot;
after a unique in@@ tra@@ ven@@ ous Bol@@ usin@@ an object was the total body of 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
&quot; although patients with severe liver functioning , the termin@@ ale Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ ists and the average system@@ ic exposure with Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron increases , a reduction of dosage is however non @-@ justified . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ clinical trials , effects were observed only to Ex@@ positions which are regarded as sufficient about the maximum human therapeutic ex@@ position , which indicates a low relevance for clinical use . &quot;
10 from pre@@ clinical trials of evidence that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block in very high concentr@@ ations of I@@ on@@ enk@@ et@@ ron in very high concentr@@ ations of I@@ on@@ enk@@ et@@ ron and extend the promotion of potential duration .
&quot; high doses Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded to about 30@@ triple the therapeutic exposure when people ) , which were given daily over two years , led to a growing frequency of Leb@@ ri@@ ors , end@@ ok@@ r@@ ines Ne@@ o@@ plas@@ ms ( in the thy@@ ro@@ id , pan@@ cre@@ atic ) and skin @-@ tum@@ ors for rats , but not at mice . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high doses of doses and since Alo@@ xi is determined by humans for the unique application , the relevance of these results are low rated as to the human being . &quot;

it can be used for the treatment of imp@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( one with cr@@ ush@@ less skin infection ) and small in@@ infected la@@ zy ( r@@ iss@@ ors or car@@ tw@@ unden ) , shut@@ ters and se@@ wn wound . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections that were proph@@ es@@ tically or probably due to meth@@ yst resistant to st@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) , because Alar@@ go against this kind of infections may not work . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but with patients under 18 years of age may not exceed 2 % of the body surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient is not talking about two to three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments . &quot;
it works by blocking of the bacterial bos@@ bos@@ om@@ es ( the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced ) and inhi@@ bit the growth of bacteria .
main Indi@@ c@@ ator of the effectiveness was sealed in all five studies of the share of patients whose infection was sealed off after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.@@ 1 % ) of 71 patients under plac@@ ebo talked to treatment .
&quot; during the treatment of infected Hau@@ s , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ exin similar response : if the results of both studies were taken together in Hau@@ tw@@ ins , spoke about 90 % of the patients of both groups in the treatment . &quot;
&quot; however , in these two studies , Al@@ tar@@ go was determined that Al@@ tar@@ go was caused by the treatment of deport@@ ations ( si@@ diary ) or infections that have been caused by MR@@ SA , not effective enough . &quot;
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a maturity in the order .
&quot; the Committee on Human@@ cis@@ ion Science ( CH@@ MP ) is to conclude that the advantages of Al@@ tar@@ go in the cur@@ se treatment of the following super@@ ficial skin infections against the risks exagger@@ ated : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small la@@ thes , de@@ hydr@@ ations or gen@@ dered wo@@ unds . &quot;
&quot; May 2007 , the European Commission granted the company Gla@@ x@@ o Group Ltd . a permit for the In@@ dependence of Al@@ tar@@ go across the European Union . &quot;
patients who have no improvement within two to three days should be examined once again and an alternative therapy is considered ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in the case of a Sensi@@ tiz@@ ing or serious local irrit@@ ation by the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be , the treatment should be cancel@@ ed carefully and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection . &quot;
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used to treat infections where MR@@ SA is known or assumed ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in clinical studies at secondary wo@@ unds was the effectiveness of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections that were caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant forkli@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) .
an alternative therapy should be considered when after a 2- to 3 @-@ day treatment no improvement or deterioration of the infected place occurs .
the effect of the simultaneous application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ographic means at the same skin surface has not been examined and the simultaneous application of other top@@ ology is not recommended .
&quot; due to the low plasma de@@ centr@@ ations , which were achieved by the people after the top@@ us@@ eless skin or infected super@@ ficial wo@@ unds , is a clin@@ ically relevant inhi@@ bit in vi@@ vo not to be expected ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
3 After con@@ current gift of 2 @-@ times daily 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol increased the middle Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max after top@@ ographic application of 1 % re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be on the scrat@@ ched skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
&quot; due to the lower system@@ ic exposure to patients , dos@@ ages are not required for patients if top@@ i@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is being used during a system@@ ic treatment with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors . &quot;
animal studies have shown a reduction of production and are insufficient in regards to a statement on the birth and the killing / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
&quot; Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should be used during pregnancy , if an top@@ ographic therapy is clearly index@@ ed and the application of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin of the gift of a system@@ ic anti@@ bi@@ otic . &quot;
&quot; when deciding whether the bre@@ ast@@ feeding is continuing / termin@@ ated , or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go should be termin@@ ated , is between the benefit of lact@@ ation for the baby and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for women . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies to 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections , the Al@@ tar@@ go was most commonly reported by side @-@ action on the agreement which is about 1 % of the patients concerned . &quot;
drug Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthe@@ tic deriv@@ ative of Ple@@ uro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated by fer@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ ag@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) . &quot;
the acts Mechan@@ ism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on sel@@ ective shirts of the bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding point of the bacterial bos@@ bos@@ ses that differs from the ties of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ ag@@ ro @-@ bacterial fabrics .
data suggest that the ties of ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales L3 L3 involved in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P attachment and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ as@@ ez@@ centre .
by binding at this tie @-@ point Ple@@ uro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer , block partial P @-@ binding interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50@@ s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ aler sub@@ units . &quot;
&quot; should be based on the local pre@@ valence of the Resi@@ stance , the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in at least some inf@@ ectious forms should be pursued by experts . &quot;
&quot; there were no differences in the In @-@ vit@@ ro activity of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the ins@@ ulating or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in case of non @-@ appealing to the treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes with additional vir@@ ul@@ ents ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on @-@ Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered . &quot;

&quot; from 516 patients ( adults and children ) , 1 % re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be received twice daily for 5 days for the top@@ ographic treatment of secondary traum@@ atic wo@@ unds , were obtained individual plasma ro@@ bes . &quot;
the sampling took place in days 3 or 4 at adult patients each before the medi@@ ate and the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .

Ambi@@ rix is committed to protecting h@@ epatitis A and h@@ epatitis B ( diseases that affect the liver ) in children between one and 15 years old that are not immune to these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is used as part of two cans of existing vacc@@ ination and a protection against h@@ epatitis B may only be reached after administration of the second dose .
&quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used when immun@@ ization is a low risk of h@@ epatitis B infection and is ensured that that can be run from two doses to end existing vaccine plan . &quot;
if a refres@@ her dose against h@@ epatitis A or B wants to be Ambi@@ rix or another h@@ epatitis B or -@@ B vaccine being given .
vacc@@ ines act by bringing the immune system ( the natural def@@ aul@@ ting of the body ) &quot; as it can inv@@ ade against a disease .
&quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognizes the viruses and surface @-@ surface as &quot; foreign &quot; and produces anti@@ bodies against it . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix contains the same ingredients as the approved vaccine Twin@@ rix Adults and the same since 1997 approved vaccine Twin@@ rix Children .
&quot; the three vacc@@ ines are applied to the protection against the same diseases , but Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administ@@ ered within three doses of existing vacc@@ ination plan . &quot;
&quot; because ambitions and Twin@@ rix contain identical ingredients , some of the data which are supported by Twin@@ rix adults , also as proof for the application of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
the main indi@@ c@@ ator for the effectiveness was the proportion of the indic@@ t@@ apped children that had developed a month after the last injection of a protective anti@@ de@@ centr@@ ation .
&quot; in an additional study with 208 children , the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared to a six@@ sm@@ ote and a 12 @-@ month distance between the two inj@@ ections . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix carried out between 98 and 100 % of the indic@@ t@@ apped children one month after the last injection of the development of anti @-@ based anti@@ bodies against h@@ epatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix was similar between inj@@ ections - and at a 12 @-@ month distance between inj@@ ections .
&quot; the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed with more than 1 of 10 vacc@@ ines ) are head@@ ache , appeti@@ te , pain in the injection point , redness , mat@@ ing ( ti@@ redness ) as well as irrit@@ ability . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix may react to patients who may possibly excessive ( allergi@@ c ) to active ingredients , one of the other components or Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an anti@@ bi@@ otic ) will not be applied . &quot;
August 2002 the European Commission entitled Gla@@ x@@ os@@ clerosis Bi@@ olog@@ icals . a permit for the In@@ dependence of Ambi@@ rix throughout the entire world
&quot; the standardization plan for the Grun@@ di@@ mm@@ un@@ ization with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ ines , whereby the first dose is given at the date of choice and the second dose between six and twelve months after the first dose . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her is desired for h@@ epatitis A as well as for h@@ epatitis B , can be vacc@@ in@@ ated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or with a combined emp@@ ower@@ ment . &quot;
the compliant anti @-@ h@@ epatitis C ( anti @-@ h@@ epatitis C ) - and anti @-@ h@@ epatitis C ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) - and anti @-@ h@@ epatitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) -@@ anti@@ bodies ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) -@@ anti@@ bodies are vacc@@ ines in the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
&quot; it is not yet completely secured whether immun@@ otherap@@ ists who are addressed to a h@@ epatitis @-@ aging vacc@@ ination as protection , since they are also protected by immun@@ ological anti@@ bodies possibly by the immun@@ ological memory . &quot;
3 As with all inj@@ ustice they should always be available for the rare lak@@ tic reaction after the gift of the vaccine to always be available immediately for medical treatment and super@@ vis@@ ing .
&quot; if a fast protection against h@@ epatitis B is required , the standardization scheme is recommended by means of combinations , the 360 EL@@ ISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated h@@ epatitis @-@ A @-@ Virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ able h@@ epatitis B @-@ surface . &quot;
in hem@@ at@@ aly@@ tic and persons with faul@@ ts of the immune system is not achieved under the pri@@ ming anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs anti @-@ anti@@ bodies so that in these cases the gift can be required .
since a in@@ tra@@ der@@ mal injection or in@@ tra @-@ mus@@ cular administration could lead to a sub@@ optimal vaccine success should be avoided .
&quot; in Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ top@@ en@@ ie or blood circulation , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected sub@@ k@@ ut@@ an inj@@ ected since it can occur in these cases to in@@ tram@@ us@@ cultur@@ ally gift to ble@@ eding . &quot;
if Ambi@@ rix is given in the second life year in the form of a separate injection moul@@ ds of t@@ et@@ us@@ - , in@@ activation type b @-@ vaccine ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with a combined mask - m@@ umps ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with a combined mask - m@@ umps was given , the immune response was sufficient ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with immun@@ o@@ de@@ press@@ ors therapy or in patients with immune def@@ ective , it must not be sufficient immune response . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study involving 3 vacc@@ ination of this wording in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , sw@@ elling , gast@@ ro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , head@@ aches and fe@@ ver comparable with the frequency that has been observed in the former Thi@@ om@@ ers@@ al@@ - and preser@@ v@@ ative vaccine form@@ ulating . &quot;
in clinical studies 2029 vacc@@ in@@ osen Ambi@@ rix received a total of 10@@ 27 imper@@ for@@ ns at the age of 1 to 15 years .
&quot; in a study with 300 participants aged 12 to 15 years , the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix was compared to the 3 @-@ doses of Com@@ bin@@ ed @-@ combination . &quot;
&quot; only exceptions were the higher frequency of pain and mat@@ ality on a justification basis per vacc@@ in@@ osis Ambi@@ rix , but not on a calculation basis per person . &quot;
pain was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix at 50@@ ,@@ 7 % of the test compared to 39.@@ 1 % in the test after the gift of a dosage of 3 @-@ cans of combinations .
&quot; after the complete vaccine of 66@@ ,@@ 4 % of the test , the Ambi@@ rix had to get enough , about pain , compared to 6@@ 3,@@ 8 % at the Pro@@ ban@@ den , which had been vacc@@ in@@ ated with the 3 @-@ D@@ os@@ - Com@@ bin@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; however , the frequency of mat@@ ality was compared to the pro @-@ tape compared to 39,@@ 6 % of the test , the ambitions received , compared to 3@@ 18.@@ 2 % compared to the Pro@@ ban@@ den , which received the 3 @-@ doses of Com@@ bin@@ aries . &quot;
the frequency prono@@ unced pain and mat was low and comparable to the sub@@ missions of the Com@@ bin@@ ed @-@ vacc@@ ination with the 3 @-@ doses @-@ vaccine has been observed .
&quot; in a comparative study at 1- to 11 @-@ year im@@ pe@@ ers , the appearance of local re@@ actions and general actions was comparable with the 3 @-@ doses Com@@ bin@@ ations with 360 EL@@ ISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated Hepatitis @-@ A @-@ Virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ able h@@ epatitis B @-@ surface . &quot;
&quot; however at the 6@@ - until 11@@ - J@@ ol@@ ds , however , after vacc@@ ination with ambitions a common incidence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per Pro@@ band reports . &quot;

&quot; 7 In a comparative study that was carried out at 12@@ - until including 15 @-@ year @-@ old , 142 two cans of Ambi@@ rix and 147 received the standard combination sim@@ ulations with three cans . &quot;

&quot; the immune response that were taken in a clinical study by 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ ol@@ ds a month after the end of the complete vaccine series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , Im@@ pe@@ ers received either a 2 @-@ cans with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ doses @-@ vacc@@ ination with an Com@@ bin@@ ation@@ sim@@ ulations with 360 EL@@ ISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated Hepatitis @-@ A @-@ Virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ able h@@ epatitis B @-@ surface . &quot;
&quot; in people who were at the time of the Grun@@ di@@ mm@@ un@@ zation between 12 and 15 years old , the Per@@ sist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs anti @-@ anti@@ bodies could be proven by at least 24 months after the immun@@ ization with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 @-@ month vacc@@ ination scheme . &quot;

&quot; you can feel very tired , have a dar@@ ken@@ ed urine , a bl@@ asses face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( laughter ) and other symptoms that may possibly make a stationary treatment . &quot;
&quot; as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix cannot protect completely before an infection with h@@ epatitis @-@ A@@ - or h@@ epatitis B virus , even if the total vaccine has been completed with 2 cans . &quot;
if you are not infected with h@@ epatitis C or h@@ epatitis B virus if you are not infected with h@@ epatitis C or h@@ epatitis B virus ( although you do not feel uncomfortable or sick ) a vaccine may not prevent a vaccine to prevent a disease .
&quot; a protection against other infections that cause the liver or symptoms , which are similar to those of a h@@ epatitis or h@@ epatitis B infection cannot be convey@@ ed . &quot;
• When your child has already been an allergi@@ c reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine including Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an anti@@ bi@@ otic ) .
an allergi@@ c reaction can express itself through ju@@ ck@@ ling skin irrit@@ ations , resp@@ ir@@ atory or ch@@ asti@@ ty of the face or the tongue . • If you have already performed an allergi@@ c reaction to an earlier vaccine against h@@ epatitis A or h@@ epatitis B . • If you have a severe infection with fe@@ ver with fe@@ ver . &quot;
• if you want to quickly have a protection against h@@ epatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the planned agreement of the second vacc@@ ination ) .
&quot; with a possible risk of infection with h@@ epatitis B between the first and second vaccine , the doctor will advise you / your child from a vaccine with ambitions . &quot;
&quot; instead , he will recommend you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined Hepatitis C units with a reduced salary of effective components per vacc@@ in@@ osis ( 360 EL@@ ISA units of a formal Hepatitis A @-@ virus and 10 micro@@ gram of a re@@ combin@@ able h@@ epatitis B @-@ surface anti@@ gens ) . &quot;
the second vacc@@ ination of this vacc@@ ination with reduced content of effective components usually occurs one month after the first dose and is likely to give you a vacc@@ ination before ending the vaccine .
sometimes Ambi@@ rix is afflic@@ ted for individuals who are afflic@@ ted on severe blood circulation . • If you are weak@@ ened on severe blood circulation . • If you are weak@@ ened to your child due to a disease or treatment in your own physical resistance .
&quot; Ambi@@ rix may be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals may not be sufficient , so that a blood test can be required to see how strong the reaction to vaccine is . &quot;
&quot; 21 S@@ ear@@ ing your doctor , if you take / your child further medicines / income ( including those who have recently been missing ) or if you / your child have recently been mist@@ aken / has been given or immun@@ og@@ lo@@ bul@@ ins ( anti@@ bodies ) or has been planned in the near future . &quot;
&quot; however , it may be that immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both h@@ epatitis A and B viruses . &quot;
&quot; when another vaccine has to be given simultaneously with Ambi@@ rix , should be vacc@@ in@@ ated at separate locations and as various li@@ mb@@ s . &quot;
&quot; if ambitions are given to the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lo@@ bul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine is nevertheless enough . &quot;
&quot; usually Ambi@@ rix or bre@@ ast@@ feeding women is not ad@@ mitt@@ edly , except that it is urgent need to be vacc@@ in@@ ated both against h@@ epatitis A and h@@ epatitis B . &quot;
important information on certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergi@@ c reaction to Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( anti@@ bi@@ otic ) .
&quot; if you miss the agreed date for the second vaccine , talk to your doctor and arrange a new date as soon as possible . &quot;

am@@ mon@@ aps can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with in@@ valuable spongiform enc@@ ephal@@ opathy ( brain @-@ compensation as a result of high am@@ orph@@ osis ) in the pre @-@ history .
&quot; am@@ mon@@ aps will be sum@@ med up to several retailers at meals - swal@@ lowed , under the food , or via a Gast@@ ro@@ ar hose ( through the ab@@ dom@@ inion in the stomach &apos;s leading he@@ ap ) or an nas@@ al Sensor ( by the nose in the stomach leading he@@ ap ) . &quot;
&quot; it was not a comparative study , since am@@ mon@@ aps do not be compared with any other treatment or plac@@ ebo ( a hy@@ po@@ drug drug , i.e. without drug ) . &quot;
&quot; am@@ mon@@ aps can also lead to Ap@@ peti@@ tions , a ab@@ nor@@ ly ac@@ idity , co@@ aches , impotence , impotence , pot@@ ency , loss , con@@ sti@@ cking , sus@@ pic@@ ation , r@@ ins@@ ing , sus@@ pic@@ ation , r@@ ins@@ ing , in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous body or weight increases . &quot;
the Committee on Human@@ cis@@ ion ( CH@@ MP ) to the conclusion that am@@ mon@@ aps in patients have been effectively prevented from patients with interference of the ur@@ inary cycle .
&quot; am@@ mon@@ aps was approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances , as due to the rar@@ ity of the disease at the time of admission only limited information on this medicine . &quot;
the use is indi@@ ans in all patients with which a complete enzy@@ mes already manifested in the new@@ born old ( within the first 28 life @-@ days ) .
&quot; in patients with a delay of a delay ( in@@ consistency , which is manifested according to the first life force ) then there is an indication for the use when in An@@ am@@ n@@ ese a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ary Enz@@ ie . &quot;
&quot; for inf@@ ants , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with gor@@ ck@@ dysfunction is AM@@ MONA@@ PS also available in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form . &quot;
the daily dose is individually calculated with regard to protein intoler@@ ance and growth and development of daily protein intake .
&quot; after the recent clinical experience , the normal daily dose of so@@ dium but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of 20 kg as well as in Her@@ an@@ growing and adults . &quot;
in patients who suffer from a breakfast lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ ase or Ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day required .
patients with a Ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase @-@ lack must Ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.1 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8,@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
&quot; AM@@ MONA@@ PS tablets must not be administ@@ ered patients with gor@@ ck@@ troubles , as a risk to the emergence of Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ cer@@ a consists , if the tablets do not go instantly in the stomach . &quot;
&quot; every tablet AM@@ MONA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium per 20 g so@@ dium ar@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MONA@@ PS should therefore be used with patients with counter@@ productive efficiency , as well as with so@@ dium in@@ suff@@ iciency as well as with so@@ dium and o@@ de@@ mb@@ al clinical clinical trials only with caution . &quot;
&quot; since Met@@ abol@@ ization and ex@@ cre@@ ases of so@@ dium ar@@ yr@@ at over the liver and the kid@@ neys , should be applied only with extreme caution only with extreme caution . &quot;
the meaning of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contro@@ versi@@ al ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; at sub@@ k@@ ut@@ aner gift of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate to young rats in high dosage ( 190 - 474 mg / kg ) , it came to a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal distor@@ tion and increased loss of neur@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; also , there were also a consuming matur@@ ation from cer@@ eb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ sen and a dimin@@ ished number of functional ner@@ ves in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth . &quot;
&quot; it could not be determined whether Phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate is re@@ tired when people turn into the mother &apos;s milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS during lact@@ ation is contrac@@ ted ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with AM@@ MONA@@ PS , at 56 % of patients had at least an un@@ desirable event ( AE ) , and at 78 % of these undes@@ irable events that they had not been with AM@@ MONA@@ PS . &quot;
&quot; the frequency is defined as follows : very often ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able Tox@@ ic response to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old an@@ or@@ ek@@ tic patient , which developed an met@@ abo@@ lic Enz@@ ie , periph@@ ery N@@ europ@@ athy and pan@@ cre@@ atitis . &quot;
a case of over@@ dose came with a 5 month old inf@@ ant with a free dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate which showed up to 400 mg / kg / day a dos@@ is@@ sive neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
Phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate is a met@@ abo@@ isch active connection that is con@@ stru@@ ed by Ac@@ et@@ y@@ elling with Gl@@ ut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine which is eliminated through the kid@@ neys .
&quot; St@@ nu@@ i@@ omet@@ ric is seen from phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine with urea ( both compounds included 2 nit@@ rogen at@@ oms ) ; Phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carriers to the retirement of excess nit@@ rogen . &quot;
5 patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the ur@@ inary cycle can be accepted that for each gram@@ bi@@ ased so@@ dium but@@ yr@@ at between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine nit@@ rogen produced .
it is of importance that the diagnosis is at an early stage and the treatment will immediately start to improve the survival chances and the clinical outcome .
&quot; the progn@@ osis of the early symptoms of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms in the new@@ born old age was almost always inf@@ ect , and the disease led themselves in treating with Per@@ it@@ one@@ al@@ di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids , or with their sti@@ ck@@ le free an@@ alog@@ a within the first year of life to death . &quot;
&quot; through hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis , utilisation of alternative ways of nit@@ rogen ( so@@ dium @-@ phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate ) , prot@@ ein@@ ated K@@ ost and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate of Neu@@ geb@@ or@@ ener on post@@ parties ( however within the first life of life ) diagnostic disorders within 80 % . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose disease were diagnosed in the course of pregnancy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even with these patients there was time with many to intellectual disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its . &quot;
in patients with a delay of the disease ( including female patient with the hetero@@ gene@@ ous form of the or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ scar@@ ce @-@ Man@@ aus ) which have been treated by a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ic Enz@@ ephal@@ opathy and afterwards permanently treated with so@@ dium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and a prot@@ ein@@ ated diet amoun@@ ted to the survival rate of 98 % .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly rever@@ sible in treatment and in some patients may occur a further deterioration of neuro@@ logical condition .
&quot; it is known that Phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at to phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate oxide is created , which is created in liver and kid@@ ney enz@@ ym@@ atic with gl@@ ut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine arises . &quot;
the concentr@@ ations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its met@@ abo@@ o in plasma and urine were obtained according to gift of a single dose of 5 g so@@ dium @-@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in so@@ ber @-@ healthy adults and in patients with faul@@ ts and repeated gifts of or@@ al doses of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled studies ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and his met@@ abo@@ lic was also investigated with cancer patients after in@@ tra@@ ven@@ ous gift from N@@ atri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate .
after a or@@ al individual dose of 5 g N@@ atri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in tablet form were determined 15 minutes after the intake measurable plasma concentration of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
&quot; in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary cycl@@ amen or hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ o@@ e@@ opathy , according to various doses of Phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) the next morning after night @-@ time fast@@ ing no Phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ at in Plas@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; with three of six patients with liver for@@ r@@ p@@ ants , which were repeated with so@@ dium @-@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 20 g / day oral in three single d@@ ots ) , the middle phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ at@@ con@@ cent@@ ric presses in the third day five times higher than after the first gifts . &quot;
retirement The medication is avoided within 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100 % in the form of con@@ ju@@ ed product Phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine on the kid@@ neys .
according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests had been treated so@@ dium @-@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in with tox@@ icity and non @-@ toxic cans ( examination 24 and 48 h after or@@ ated administration of a single dose from 878 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) .
&quot; AM@@ MONA@@ PS Gran@@ ul@@ at is either taken by oral ( ac@@ ces and children , who can still not swal@@ low any tablets , or patients with gor@@ ck@@ dysfunction ) or via a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ p@@ esch@@ eme , or a Nas@@ al Sensor . &quot;
&quot; after the previous clinical experience the normal daily dose of so@@ dium but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ born , inf@@ ants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of 20 kg as well as in Her@@ an@@ growing and adults . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of ammonia , argin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( in particular det@@ ectable amino acids ) , car@@ ni@@ tin and Ser@@ um@@ logs one in the plasma should be kept within the normal range . &quot;
in patients who suffer from a breakfast lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ ase or Ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day required .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS Gran@@ ul@@ at contains 124 mg ( 5.6 m@@ mo@@ l ) N@@ atri@@ um per gram N@@ atri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at per 20 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium per 20 g so@@ dium ar@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when di@@ vers were exposed in front of the birth Phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ at ( active met@@ abo@@ lit by Phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ) came to l@@ esi@@ ons in the pyramid cells of the deer .
&quot; a prob@@ able Tox@@ ic response to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old an@@ or@@ ek@@ tic patient , which developed an met@@ abo@@ lic Enz@@ ie , periph@@ ery N@@ europ@@ athy and pan@@ cre@@ atitis . &quot;
&quot; St@@ nu@@ i@@ omet@@ ric is seen as Phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine with urea ( both compounds included 2 nit@@ rogen at@@ oms ) ; Phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carriers to the retirement of excess .
based on investigations on the extraction of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary cycle can be assumed that for each gram@@ bi@@ ased so@@ dium but@@ yr@@ at between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine nit@@ rogen produced .
&quot; already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are also not rever@@ sible in treatment , and in some patients can occur a further deterioration of neuro@@ logical condition . &quot;
after a or@@ al individual dose of 5 g N@@ atri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form were determined 15 minutes after taking measurable plasma concentration of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
&quot; during the duration of durability , the patient can retain the finished product for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not over 25 ° C . &quot;
&quot; with this procedure , the small measuring ran@@ ge@@ on 0.@@ 95 g , the average measurement of 2,@@ 9 g and the large measuring range 8,@@ 6 g N@@ atri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at . &quot;
&quot; if a patient has to receive the medication via a probe , AM@@ MONA@@ PS can be dis@@ solved even in water ( the solu@@ bility of so@@ dium @-@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at is up to 5 g in 10 ml water ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with these rare diseases are missing certain liver enzy@@ mes , making them acc@@ ord the sti@@ ck@@ ery of proteins in the body after consuming proteins in the body . &quot;

&quot; angi@@ ox is used for the treatment of adult patients with &quot; ac@@ ute Cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes &quot; ( ACS , decreased blood flow to the heart ) , for example with inst@@ abil@@ er Ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in chest with different thickness ) or m@@ yo@@ k@@ ard@@ in@@ colour@@ less ( heart attack ) without &quot; ST@@ - Heb@@ ung &quot; ( a an@@ om@@ al measurement value in the electrical cable or EC@@ G ) . &quot;
&quot; will be used an@@ gi@@ ox to prevent blood vessels in patients suffering from one PCI , becomes a higher dose and the in@@ fusion can be continued by up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this can contribute to patients with Ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
&quot; nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study of the treatment of ACS , where the effect of an@@ gi@@ ox at allergi@@ c / II@@ I@@ a @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( G@@ PI , a different medicine to prevent blood vessels ) with the conventional combined treatment with H@@ ep@@ mar@@ ans ) and a G@@ PI compared . &quot;
&quot; during the PCI the patients frequently became a St@@ ent ( a short tubes that remains used in the ar@@ tery , and they also received other medicines to prevent blood vessels , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and aspir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; with the treatment of ACS , An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without gift of G@@ PI - in preventing new events ( deaths , heart inci@@ dents , or Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation ) after 30 days or a total of as effectively as traditional treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients who turned into a PCI was An@@ gi@@ ox in terms of all indicators just as effective as H@@ ep@@ arin , except for heavy ble@@ eding , where it was significantly more effective than h@@ ep@@ mar@@ in . &quot;
angi@@ ox must not be used in patients who may possibly excessive ( allergi@@ c ) against bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , other shepherd , or one of the other components . &quot;
&quot; it may not be used by patients who recently had a blo@@ od@@ ation , as well as people with strong blood pressure or heavy kid@@ ney problems or a heart infection . &quot;
the Committee on Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) to conclude that angi@@ ox at the treatment of ACS and during a PCI is an acceptable replacement for h@@ ep@@ mar@@ in .
&quot; September 2004 , the European Commission granted to The Company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd for permission for the In@@ det@@ ox in the entire European Union . &quot;
for the treatment of adult patients with ac@@ ute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes ( inst@@ ab@@ ile Ang@@ ina / non - ST @-@ Heb@@ er in@@ coloured ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) at a emergency stop or if an early intervention is planned .
the recommended initiation of an@@ gi@@ ox from An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with ACS is a in@@ tra@@ ven@@ ous bol@@ us@@ tion of 0.@@ 1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; if the patient is performed in another episode , an additional bol@@ us should be given by 0,5 mg / kg and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery on 1,@@ 75 mg / kg / h increases . &quot;
&quot; after the PCI requirements , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h will be recorded for 4 to 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; immediately before the procedure , a Bol@@ us@@ tion of 0,5 mg / kg is given to be given , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1,@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the surgery . &quot;
the recommended dosage of an@@ gi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of 0.7 mg / kg body weight and any subsequent in@@ tra@@ int in@@ fusion with a dose of 1,@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery . &quot;
&quot; the safety and effectiveness of an allergi@@ c @-@ gift of an@@ gi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended , even if a brief PCI procedure is planned . &quot;
&quot; this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to under 225 seconds , should be a second pin of 0.7 mg / kg / body weight . &quot;
&quot; to reduce the appearance lower ACT values , the re@@ formed and dil@@ uted medicine should be carefully mixed before using the application and the Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis rapidly in@@ tra@@ ven@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; once the ACT is worth more than 225 seconds , another surveillance is no longer required , provided that 1,@@ 75 mg / kg In@@ fu@@ sion d@@ osis is given correctly . &quot;
&quot; in case of patients with moderate kid@@ ney functionality ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which treated a PCI ( whether with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in against ACS or not ) , should be used a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1,@@ 4 mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; lies the ACT value below 225 seconds , is a second Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis between 0,@@ 3 mg / kg and to check the ACT 5 minutes after the second Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kid@@ ney compensation , which were included in the Phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( replace @-@ 2 ) , the ACT lay 5 minutes after the gift of the bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Bol@@ us at an average 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
3 In case of patients with severe kid@@ ney compensation ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also for di@@ aly@@ sis patients ( see section 4.3 ) .
the treatment with angi@@ ox can be used 30 minutes after the in@@ tra@@ ven@@ ous gift of un@@ fol@@ dable h@@ ep@@ mar@@ in or 8 hours after the end of the sub@@ du@@ sting gift of lower h@@ ep@@ mar@@ in .

patients are carefully monitored during the treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of blood blood , especially if bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in combination with another anti@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant is given ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; even if in PCI @-@ patients among Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ to occur in most ble@@ eding to arter@@ ies , can occur in patients who occur to a per@@ k@@ ut@@ ant cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) during the treatment in principle of ble@@ eding . &quot;
&quot; in case of patients who are waiting in and treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , should ensure monitoring the IN@@ R value ( International norm@@ alities ) , should ensure that the value after lower@@ ing the treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in again reached the level before the treatment . &quot;
&quot; based on the knowledge about the acts Mechan@@ ism of anti@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( H@@ ep@@ arin , War@@ colour@@ ing , t@@ ro@@ mb@@ ol@@ y@@ tika or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ ten@@ sion@@ ists ) can be taken from it that these substances can increase the blood circulation . &quot;
&quot; in the combination of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in with Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ ten@@ sion@@ ists , or anti@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants are the clinical and biological hem@@ og@@ ic parameters in each case regularly . &quot;
&quot; the animal experimental studies are in terms of effects on pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , the discharge or the post@@ nat@@ al development of insufficient ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;

&quot; both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in group , as well as in the associated with H@@ ep@@ mar@@ es , it came to women and patients over 65 years more frequently to unwanted events than with male or younger patients . &quot;
heavy ble@@ eding were defined according to the AC@@ UI@@ TY and TI@@ MI measures for heavy ble@@ eding like in the foot@@ ing of table 2 .
both light and heavy ble@@ eding were significantly lower than in groups with H@@ ep@@ ir@@ ud@@ in alone than in groups with H@@ ep@@ arin plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
&quot; an AC@@ UI@@ TY heavy blood pressure has been defined as one of the following events : extraction , retro@@ fitting , in@@ tra@@ oc@@ ular blood circulation of ≥ 4 g / dl without obvious blood point , reduction of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ds of ≥ 3 g / dl with a known blood point , implementation of blood products for trans@@ fusion . &quot;

the following information on side effects are based on the data of a clinical study with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in at 6000 patients who moved to PCI .
&quot; both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in group , as well as in the associated with H@@ ep@@ mar@@ es , it came to women and patients over 65 years more frequently to unwanted events than with male or younger patients . &quot;
both light and heavy ble@@ eding appeared under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in significantly less often than in the comparison group among H@@ ep@@ arin plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or .
&quot; the following side effects , which are not listed above , were reported according to comprehensive application in practice and are sorted according to system organs in table 6 . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , the treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in is to break down immediately and to monitor the patient with regard to signs of blood flow . &quot;
&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox contains Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , a direct and specific Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in@@ inhi@@ bit@@ or , which is located in the cat@@ aly@@ tic centre as well as in the Ani@@ ol@@ ymp@@ ic region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in bin@@ ds , regardless of whether Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in in the liquid phase or at Ger@@ inn@@ sel . &quot;
&quot; the bond of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in at Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and thus its effect , is rever@@ sible because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in its part the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Arg@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 slowly turned into re@@ generated the function of the active centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in re@@ generates . &quot;

&quot; Ap@@ id@@ ra is used for treatment of adults , young people and children from six years with diabetes that require a treatment with ins@@ ulin . &quot;
&quot; Ap@@ id@@ ra is sub@@ k@@ ut@@ an ( under the skin ) into the ab@@ dom@@ inal wall , the th@@ ig@@ h or the upper arm or as permanent in@@ fusion with an ins@@ ulin pump . &quot;
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not have sufficient ins@@ ulin to control the glu@@ cos@@ es@@ pi@@ eg@@ els ( sugar ) in the blood or the ins@@ ulin do not work effectively .
&quot; In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in differs very low due to human@@ ins@@ ulin , and the change means that it works faster and a shorter act of activity than a short @-@ effective human@@ ins@@ ulin . &quot;
&quot; Ap@@ id@@ ra was produced in the application in combination with a long @-@ effective ins@@ ulin in patients with type @-@ 1 diabetes , where the body is not able to produce a ins@@ ulin in two studies with a total of 1 million adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years . &quot;
&quot; in type @-@ 2 diabetes , which is not effective in type @-@ 2 diabetes , Ap@@ id@@ ra was evaluated in a study with 878 adults . &quot;
the main indi@@ ator for the effectiveness was the change in concentration of substance gly@@ co@@ y@@ li@@ fied hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood which shows how well the blood sugar is set .
&quot; in the first study with adults with type @-@ 1 diabetes , after six months , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( 7.4 % ) compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % at In@@ sul@@ in@@ l@@ is@@ per . &quot;
in adults with type @-@ 2 diabetes the reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration amoun@@ ted to 0.@@ 46 % after six months with Ap@@ id@@ ra compared to 0.@@ 30 % in humanitarian crisis .
&quot; Ap@@ id@@ ra may not be used in patients , which may possibly be excessive ( allergi@@ c ) against in@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in or one of the other components , or in patients who already suffer from a hy@@ po@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic . &quot;
the doses of Ap@@ id@@ ra may need to be adjusted if it is administ@@ ered together with a number of other medicines that may affect blood vessels .
&quot; September 2004 , the European Commission entitled San@@ o@@ fi @-@ Aven@@ tis Deutschland GmbH is a licence for the In@@ dependence of Ap@@ id@@ ra in the entire European Union . &quot;
Ap@@ id@@ ra is as subtle inj@@ ections either in the area of the ab@@ dom@@ inal ceiling or the Del@@ tam@@ us@@ k@@ els apply or sub@@ k@@ ut@@ an by continuous in@@ fusion in the field of pan@@ cre@@ ams .
&quot; due to the reduced gluten @-@ dimension@@ ed capacity and the decreased incidence of ins@@ ulin , the isl@@ anders can be set down in patients with a limitation of the liver function . &quot;
&quot; any change of its active strength , the brand ( Her@@ - ) , the In@@ sul@@ int@@ yp@@ s ( normal , N@@ PH , zin@@ k@@ ver@@ delayed etc . ) , the type of ins@@ ulin ( animal ins@@ ulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can draw a change in the ins@@ ulin needs . &quot;
&quot; 3 A insufficient dosage or dis@@ ruption of treatment , especially in patients with a ins@@ ul@@ in@@ ated diabetes , can lead to a hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic and a dia@@ be@@ tic K@@ eto@@ azi@@ box ; these states are potential life @-@ threat@@ ening . &quot;
the conversion of a patient to another ins@@ ulin type or a ins@@ ulin of another manufacturer should be carried out under strict medical supervision and may make a change of dosage required .
the date of appearance of a hy@@ po@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic depends on the efficacy profile of the used ins@@ ulin and can therefore change when changing the treatment schem@@ as .
&quot; to the substances that can increase blood sugar and reinforce the incl@@ ination to hy@@ po@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic , fi@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , Mon@@ o@@ amin @-@ Ox@@ id@@ ase , Pro@@ po@@ xy@@ pha , Pro@@ po@@ xy@@ pha , S@@ aliz@@ yl@@ ate and Sul@@ ph@@ amide antibiotics . &quot;
&quot; in addition , under the effect of sympath@@ ies such as Bet@@ ab@@ lock@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ id@@ in , Guan@@ eth@@ id@@ in and reserve the symptoms of ad@@ ren@@ a@@ gen counter@@ ing , be weak@@ ened or missing . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies for re@@ production sto@@ ols showed no differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human@@ ins@@ ulin in terms of pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , the birth or the post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ enters into human breast milk , but generally the ins@@ ulin occurs neither into the mother &apos;s milk , nor will it be res@@ or@@ ated to or@@ aler . &quot;
&quot; following are the clinical trials listed from clinical trials listed , group@@ ed according to system organs and sorted according to the frequency of their appearance ( very often : ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency on the basis of availability ) . &quot;
&quot; cold - welding , cool and bl@@ asse skin , fatigue , nerv@@ ousness or trekking , confusion , concentr@@ ations , confusion , concentration of vision , head@@ ache , head@@ ache , evil and heart clo@@ ves . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy Wir@@ ing to change the inj@@ ecting position within the injection range , can occur in the result a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy to the injection point . &quot;
heavy hy@@ po@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic bodies with consciousness can be given by means of in@@ tra @-@ mus@@ cular or sub@@ stitutes injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) which is given by a corresponding person or by in@@ tra@@ ven@@ ous gift of glu@@ c@@ ose by a doctor .
&quot; according to a glu@@ c@@ ist objects , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the judgment - cause for the heavy hy@@ po@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic species and to avoid similar episodes . &quot;
ins@@ ulin ins@@ ect the blood sugar levels by the stimulation of periph@@ eral glu@@ cos@@ ity ( especially by sk@@ el@@ eton muscles and fat ) as well as through the im@@ itation of glu@@ cos@@ m production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at subtle Ga@@ ther@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in the action occurs faster and the active duration is shorter than at hu@@ - man@@ em Reg@@ ins@@ ulin .
&quot; in a study with 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type @-@ 1 diabetes , T@@ US showed In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in in the therap@@ ist range of 0.@@ 0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg a dis@@ proportionate rise of glu@@ c@@ ant effect , just as human ins@@ ulin . &quot;
In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has a twice as rapid impact as normal human ins@@ ulin and achieves the complete glu@@ c@@ ant effect approximately 2 hours earlier as human@@ ins@@ ulin .
&quot; from the data , it was visible that at an application of In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ cent in 2 minutes before meal a comparable post@@ p@@ ale gly@@ cem@@ ic control is given , 30 minutes before meal is given . &quot;
&quot; was given In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before meal , became a better post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ ous control than with humane Reg@@ ins@@ ulin , which was 2 minutes before meal . &quot;
&quot; is used In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal , a comparable gly@@ cem@@ ic control such as with humanitarian crisis ins@@ ulin , which is given 2 rent before meal ( see picture 1 ) . &quot;
