the module website can be interpreted in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ menu on extras website . select the source and target language of the translation .
&quot; if a part of the text is selected , only this part is translated into place of the entire &amp; URL ; &quot;
machine translations are only very ru@@ di@@ ment@@ ary . Bab@@ el@@ fish produces in the best case a rough translation and in the worst case non@@ sense . therefore we should not make important decisions on the translations without delay the translation before .
&quot; only web pages can be translated on the Internet . other texts should be translated on the Bab@@ el@@ fish side by yourself , where you can insert the translated texts directly . &quot;
&quot; the package &amp; package ; contains different modules for &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite its small size , they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions of &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making these easier available . &quot;
&quot; for more information on the use of &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or , and the built @-@ in functions can be found in manual &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or . &quot;
&quot; to load these modules in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or , select Settings enhancements .... open the card tools and select the desired modules there . &quot;
&quot; this is a list of standard settings modules from the package KDE , Add@@ ons . please note that any more modules are installed on your system if you have added any additional software . &quot;
&quot; you should install the package k@@ de@@ base , the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you compile this package . &quot;
&quot; to use the cr@@ ashing module , click here &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; on extras . then you can view the page , the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; for the crash , or the list of cr@@ ashes if available , delete . &quot;
the panel filter ( also called folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under extras filter filter . with the module you can filter &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos;s updated working directory on different kind .
&quot; to use the DO@@ M @-@ tree supervision in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or , select extras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the document , example : docum@@ ent@@ element , all other k@@ not@@ s are sub@@ parts of this wor@@ k@@ not@@ ary . &quot;
the module &amp; F@@ S@@ View ; for &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides a further view for objects with the M@@ IE @-@ Type in@@ ode / directory with local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbols and text views in order to view the content of your local file system .
&quot; the distinctive feature of &amp; F@@ S@@ View ; consists in it , mer@@ ges Ord@@ n@@ erh@@ ier@@ ies with the help of a so called Tree @-@ Map graph@@ ically . each object is determined by a rect@@ angle whose area is proportional to its size . this size has to possess the sum of the sizes of the sub@@ ordinate objects of an object smaller or equal to the size of the object . &quot;
&quot; at &amp; F@@ S@@ View , the size of a folder or folder itself , whereby the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries is set in it . according to this way , large files , even then can be easily detected in the folder hierarchy . therefore , &amp; F@@ S@@ View , as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; instruction will be considered . &quot;
in &amp; F@@ S@@ View ; is an entry in the Tre@@ ber display and represents a rect@@ angle that represents a file or folder in your fil@@ es@@ ystem . for simpler navigation have the right color @-@ defined and label settings .
&quot; the color of a rect@@ angle that is switched on view color mode , either depth be switched to the light detection of the tight@@ ening , or the illustration of a different file name such as name , owner , group or mouth @-@ type . &quot;
&quot; a rect@@ angle can be used with the various properties of the respective file or folder . for each property you can specify if it is used at all , only if enough space for the presentation is available , or whether the surface can occur in the sign of the stairs ) . furthermore , you can set the relative position of the lab@@ eling in the rect@@ angle . &quot;
&quot; in display algorithms for Tre@@ em@@ aps it should be respected that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . at the Tre@@ ads in &amp; F@@ S@@ View , this target will not always be respected . note that less space is lost for the frame if the rect@@ angle square is square . &quot;
&quot; as the division of the area of an entry for the sub@@ ordinate entry is done , the implementation remains intact . here it is for the marking and for avoiding space losses caused by the frame the best methods are created . the best methods in this are lines , columns or recur@@ sive zinc @-@ release . &quot;
&quot; you can specify the minimal area for an entry over the menu entry button . instead , a ru@@ de pattern is drawn into the area of the associated entry , to view that this area is actually covered by a sub@@ ordinate entry . &quot;
&quot; originally , &amp; F@@ S@@ View was intended as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets developed for the application K@@ C@@ ach@@ egr@@ ind . &quot;
the module gallery is available in the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ menu under the extras picture gallery ... or with C@@ trl ; I .
&quot; if you call the module image gallery , a dialog opens with which you can set the appearance of the gallery . &quot;
the option titles of the page allows you to customize the title of the image gallery .

&quot; an easy to use camera interface is provided to you so that you can connect with your digital camera and your photos directly into &amp; digi@@ code , of course , each medium and every ticket cameras will be supported by using the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , each medium and each card reader gets supported by your operating system , with &amp; digi@@ tization came together . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ tization ; contains a quick image processing with basic imaging tools . you can use this to review and correct your photos , evaluate and correct . editing skills can be easily extended with KDE Image plugins interface ( manual ) modules . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; digi@@ tization came ; easy to use , it provides doz@@ ens professional skills available . it works fully in 16 @-@ bit color foam and all available modules support the raw materials by using li@@ bra@@ w , DN@@ G @-@ Export and ICC @-@ colour workflow . &quot;
&quot; improved database with considerably more metad@@ ata , such as &amp; eg ; via the camera or the lens , which can be looked for . &quot;
&quot; like all &amp; KDE ; programs is also &amp; digi@@ tization ; a open source project . that means , it is dependent on the support of the end users . you should therefore report problems and improvement possibilities . &quot;
&quot; and digi@@ tization ; tries to make the milking of problems or suggestions for them . wherever you are in the program , the help menu provides an entry problem or requests .... This opens a dialog with a lower system . all required information is already registered . follow the instructions to send your report . &quot;
&quot; this is a project that is supported by a community . that means that users and developers came to each other . if you came a regular user from &amp; digi@@ code , then we would like to answer you questions to other users of &amp; digi@@ tization ; and hopefully , you will soon ask questions to other users of &amp; digi@@ tization . in this mailing list , however , in this mailing list , you should therefore be powerful in this language . &quot;
you can also visit the digi@@ tization ; homepage to visit news on shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ tization ;
&quot; the best start to get involved in &amp; digi@@ tization ; to participate , is registration in the developer mailing list . guidance to register in the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ tization ; &quot;
&quot; if you arrived &amp; digi@@ tization ; for the first time , you will be asked where you want to save your pictures and your database . just enter a local , remote or remote folder , just enter a local folder icon to select a folder . &quot;
&quot; in the second field , you must select a local folder on your computer . here the data is stored on your computer . this path remains the same for all image folders . &quot;
&quot; later , you can add as many folders as you want . &amp; digi@@ tization came ; will you additionally use as an aging library . settings digi@@ tization . &quot;
&quot; if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive , you can select the top folder that contains the main folder as the basic folder . no picture will change . during the passage of the folder you will get a progress report like this one : &quot;
&quot; and digi@@ tization came , thir@@ sty , the library path@@ way in its whole depth . you cannot include any sub@@ folders , unless it was i@@ ste in hidden folder . this allows you to add exceptional clubs &amp; digi@@ tization ; by doing a point in front of the name of the folder . &quot;
&quot; if you take an existing folder with photos as a basic folder , you will notice that the albums in M@@ eine Al@@ ben@@ list will have no photos as symbols . you can change it by clicking a favorite photo from the album and then use this on the folder icon . further details can be found in the section albums . &quot;
&quot; once you have configured the basic folder , you can set up in &amp; digi@@ tization ; your digital camera setup , then you should learn how to manage M@@ eine &apos;s albums and folders to manage your photos in the albums . &quot;
&quot; raw support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , so it &apos;s also possible to deal with it . the support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out whether a special camera is supported , so you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the menu &apos;s help of pipe support . &quot;
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections of Ro@@ h Dec@@ oder@@ settings and Ro@@ h workflow .
&quot; an easy to use camera interface is provided to you so that you can connect with your digital camera and your photos directly into &amp; digi@@ code , of course , each medium and every ticket cameras will be supported by using the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , each medium and each card reader gets supported by your operating system , with &amp; digi@@ tization came together . &quot;
modern digital camera cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory card and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . the camera will also be implemented as a record system . older cameras can also use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&quot; &amp; digi@@ tization ; uses the program g@@ photo@@ 2 for communication with digital camera cameras , which supports a constantly growing number of over 800 cameras supported . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports the picture of over 800 cameras supported by the International Im@@ aging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images of digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need of additional drivers . &quot;
&quot; many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . since photos are generally large files and transm@@ issions on the serial port are slow , this connection has now been out@@ dated . &amp; digi@@ tization ; supports these cameras and runs the transfer of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link . &quot;
&quot; lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 has to be created with li@@ bex@@ ative support so that the thumb@@ nails will be read by some lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 camera features , in order to add the thumb@@ nails by some lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 camera features , you may not be thumb@@ nails , possibly nothing left or the generation could be very slow . &quot;
one of the most beautiful things to &amp; digi@@ tization came ; is how easy to expand its functionality by modules :
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I @-@ Module : the KDE Image plugins interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ tization ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . aim is to provide the modules of all graphic programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section . &quot;
&quot; modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way , as it can also be a user . your advantage is that it &apos;s much easier to supplement &amp; digi@@ tization ; by writing a small module to add a function as the changes in &amp; digi@@ tization came ; even perform . &quot;
to simplify the window you can either make the side effects with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ trl + Shift + F .
&quot; drag and drop images everywhere : you can put an image in a different part of the Al@@ ben@@ bau@@ ms , above the horizontal separ@@ ating line or into another application window . the only restriction is that a picture is not in keywords , dat@@ um@@ list or search . &quot;
&quot; - a file selection allows you to raise the most common services : JPEG , PNG , TIFF , Ro@@ h , films and audio &quot;
&quot; the text filter is used only for the fields , which will be displayed in the toolbar . this is how the filtering is displayed on the fil@@ en@@ ame only if this type it is displayed . which fields can be displayed in the dialog of the aging settings . &quot;
&quot; the view &amp; quot ; M@@ eine Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; presents a organised view on your photo gallery . these albums can be stored on the hard disk , in which they have been created on the hard disk after the name of their collection , in which the album was first created , sorted by the album . the date can be changed in the properties of the album . &quot;
&quot; if you have established a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . you can also add a screen@@ shot directly to one album . you can also select a screen@@ shot directly to an album . select album Im@@ ported screen@@ shot . &quot;
&quot; to copy a picture from one album to another or move , you can move the photo with the mouse on the target album . you can move to the same type as well as copy or copy it . simply select all the photos and move it to the target album . &quot;
&quot; an album contains a collection of photos and the album characteristics allow you to access information about this collection . to access the album properties , you must click on the album button and edit the same menu properties below . &quot;
&quot; Alb@@ um@@ - Coll@@ ections : are a method to mark your albums , so that you can choose under a common name . the collection is used for sor@@ ting your photos . if you want to add or delete new collections . if you want to add new collections , you can do this in the settings for collections . &quot;
the Alb@@ um@@ - Date : is used if you sort your albums by date with view albums by date sort by date .
&quot; the Butt@@ ons El@@ t@@ ester , average , new@@ t@@ ester : these set the date on the oldest , the latest image or that of the album . this fails to calculate the average of images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , instead the date of the last change in each file is used in this folder . &quot;
&quot; if you first arrived an album in &amp; digi@@ tization , the first image in the album is selected as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; M@@ eine Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ er ; sometimes this is the first photo in the album , and you might want to select another photo as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to select another photo as an album icon , you will need to select the image with the right mouse button and select in the context menu &amp; quot ; as a Alb@@ um@@ pre @-@ check ; additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
an album can only be included in a collection and coll@@ ections cannot be wast@@ ed .
&quot; &amp; digi@@ tization ; supports the input of keyword for individual photos in the area of M@@ eine keyword list . album coll@@ ections have a different effect . the collection includes always all the photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos . &quot;
&quot; the picture window provides you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all pictures displayed in this album are displayed in the picture window . each photo will display in a preview pane , you can customize the size of this lecture using the two l@@ ou@@ fl@@ s in the tool . &quot;
&quot; when you open an album the first time you will wait short while the thumb@@ nails will be generated , while the thumb@@ nails will be generated , in which you can create all the thumb@@ nails in the menu extras . &quot;
&quot; for information on each picture will be shown below the preview preview . what information is , you can change about settings digi@@ tization . select the albums page and adjust the range pictures to suit your wishes . &quot;
the thumb@@ nails have help files that let the mouse pointer a moment over a picture . the help shows the most important features including all the keywords of a photo . the screen@@ shot in the section introduction into the main window displays such help window .
photos are all what it came to &amp; digi@@ tization . albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures as it fits . you can get all the features that are using and digi@@ tization as possible . you can have the choice between viewing the pictures , a slideshow or the editing of the pictures . &quot;
you can open the image processing with a photo by using either F@@ 4 Photo Edit ... or the context menu of the picture with the right mouse button and select ... select a guide on how to edit your photos . with image editing you can view your photos and change them .
&quot; it may happen that &amp; digi@@ tization came ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by selecting the menu from opening menu , and how you can customize your requirements when your program is not en@@ umer@@ ated , you will find information in the &amp; KDE ; manual . &quot;
&quot; you should note that it can be used after editing through other image processing programmes . some programs do not store this data , if you want to save the changed image . this information goes from the EX@@ IF@@ S and IP@@ TC data such as orientation , aper@@ ture etc . &quot;
&quot; and digi@@ tization ; provides two options available for rotation . the easiest is to select it with the right mouse button on the preview and select turning . in the sub @-@ menu , you can specify the degree of rotation . &quot;
&quot; to change the file name of a photo , you can select with the right mouse button on the preview and select F2 ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you keep the extension ( .@@ jpg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; if you came a photo from &amp; digi@@ tization ; delete , it will be removed in the M@@ ül@@ mer of &amp; KDE ; postponed . F@@ 8 picture delete or dischar@@ ged Falls you prefer really delet@@ ing , you can use this by clicking the Shift . &quot;
&quot; the view &amp; quot ; M@@ eine Dat@@ um@@ sli@@ p@@ quot ; organizes your photos by means of the data . &amp; digi@@ tization ; uses either the EX@@ IF @-@ Date or , if this is not available , the date of the last modification of the file . &quot;
&quot; if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month be shown in the image view . you can select days or weeks in the data sheet below , so that only the photos of the selected days are shown . &quot;
&quot; photos with sampling provides a flexible and powerful option to organize your photos and cat@@ alog@@ ing your photos . keywords are sti@@ ckers , which can be assigned to individual photos or whole groups . once a keyword was assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting the keyword or search . &quot;
&quot; if a keyword is selected , all photos that have been marked with this keyword . &quot;
&quot; tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . here you can organise your keywords log@@ ically . you can also include parts of the Bau@@ ms &amp; quot ; M@@ eine s@@ wor@@ m &amp; quot ; mixing , so that you can search the keywords that you can search , easily . &quot;
&quot; the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and designated keyword ( IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG , stored . you can thus import your keywords in other programs as soon as &amp; digi@@ tization ; the images noticed . &quot;
you can add new keywords by clicking with the right mouse button either on &amp; quot ; My keyword ; or to an existing keyword . if you have a new keyword ( click on an existing keyword ) after you click on an existing keyword , this is what this keyword . &quot;
&quot; you can delete a keyword , click on the keyword with the right mouse button and delete it . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself is not deleted . only the keyword is removed from this photo . &quot;
&quot; you can change the position of a keyword , drag it to the desired position in the tree and then put it down . then , a menu that gives you the possibility to move the keyword . a keyword can be at a time only once in the tree . &quot;
you can edit the properties of a keyword by selecting it with the right mouse button and edit the icon in the context menu and the icon in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword ;
&quot; to select another photo as an album icon , you need to select the image with the right mouse button and select the default menu . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; in order to use &amp; digi@@ tization ; s functionality with keywords , you must first select your photos with keywords , you can first select your photos with a keyword ; you can also click on the appropriate keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword ; alternatively , you can also cli@@ ck@@ here with the right mouse button and select from the context menu keyword . &quot;
&quot; you can select a photo with any number of keywords . the photo will be displayed as soon as you choose one of the keywords for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event , where it was made etc . &quot;
&quot; once you have provided a photo with keyword , this is displayed under the preview of the image in the main window . &quot;
&quot; you can remove a keyword , which you can open the context menu of the photo and select from the keywords menu . the menu shows you only the keywords which were assigned to the photo . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline displays shows a time @-@ dependent history of the number of images per time unit . a selection of frames can be shifted over this history . to select a time frame , you only need to select the default frame of the selection frame . thus all associated images are shown in the main window . &quot;
in the box below you can enter a title and save your selection . it then appears in the list below .
&quot; cover all elements of the database : name , reviews , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , and in the future even more . &quot;
&quot; Neb@@ ula he search box is a small lamp the green , if the search is found . if you click here , the filtering will be deleted and all pictures displayed again . if the search has nothing found , then the lamp is red . &quot;
the advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side@@ bar with the remote glass top . you can open this search here but as a live search which is always fil@@ tered what you have saved as a search criterion . after you saved a seem@@ ing t@@ d filter in the list .
&quot; when you are satisfied with your selection , push the head OK and the search will be performed . the results will be displayed in the view of My search list . if you choose to select a name in My search list , you just need to select a name from the view of My search list and select an option in its context menu . &quot;

&quot; the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Al@@ ben@@ database . all rules will be added / search group . each option can be deleted with others about logical operations All ... , A ... , No ... or M@@ at ... link . furthermore , you can search of the type &amp; quot ; AND NI@@ CH@@ T@@ quot ; create . &quot;
&quot; and digi@@ tization ; characterized by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows images to compare by these sig@@ natur@@ es , the more correspond to them . this technique is applied in three areas . &quot;
&quot; similar entries : this is an area where you can drop a similar picture . by means of a sw@@ ell@@ er@@ ts , the result can be enlarged or res@@ ized . if you move an image from somewhere over the symbol of the un@@ loading search in the left side@@ bar , then it will open and you can drop it there . &quot;
sketch : freedom and colour colour : draw a quick sketch and &amp; digi@@ tization ; find the matching pictures . also here can be a gay value .
this tab provides an intuitive card search tool based on the Mar@@ ble @-@ Mini@@ ature range . you can drag and move with the mouse wheel . press C@@ trl ; lin@@ ker mouse button to pull a square . all pictures within this coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . this is naturally ahead of your pictures Ge@@ o data .
&quot; in the field below , you can specify a name for your Ge@@ o filter . this is then added for a later use of the list below . it works like a live Geo@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ tization ; presents a light table in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image form , also raw files , together . &quot;
&quot; choose one or more pictures from any view in the main window and then use C@@ trl ; L D@@ em lumin@@ tically add to the context menu . the selection will be added to the light table and its windows , you can open the lumin@@ osity quickly with L extras . &quot;
&quot; from the preview bar you can drag and drop the pictures you want to see in the left or right area of the window . if you want to preview the copy of the tool , then you can preview the same picture as well . you can also compare the same area of the two images . &quot;
&quot; another mode is better suited to use quickly out of a picture series , then the two first pictures are automatically loaded into the fields below . you can now use the left mouse button on any thumb@@ nail . the right nearby picture is displayed in the right area . this makes it easier to work through a number of similar images . &quot;
&quot; of course , the normal sol@@ der actions are also working directly from the lumin@@ ous as e.g. F@@ 4 file editing ... &quot;
all image information from the right side@@ bar of the main window are available for both thumb@@ nails in the light . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
&quot; at the bottom of each range , you will find a built @-@ in swing function that you click on the cross @-@ crossed paths . to preview the visible range of the image , you need to preview it and the &amp; L@@ MB ; then preview the same images in the same image area . &quot;
the zoom works as well as in other views . simply use the zoom regul@@ ator under the pictures or C@@ trl ; mouse wheel in the image into and out of zo@@ oming . this happens in both pictures if you are in the mode preview .
&quot; what is a digital stock management - away from the process of fashion ? digital stock management considers each part of the process , followed up to the final output and permanent storage . each of the photos records , sc@@ ans or digital photos saves a form of digital stock management . most of us do not make this in a systematic and efficient way . &quot;
&quot; we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips as you can backup your images , protect and use photos again . we consider the download , edit , review , review , evaluation , improve , maintain , maintain and export of image files . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Digital Asset Management takes on , indi@@ fies , categorized , is searching , transform@@ ed , contra@@ sting , and exported contents which is a mon@@ et@@ ari@@ ous or cultural value . &quot;
metad@@ ata are defined as data about data . metad@@ ata are provided according to your definition data to provide information about or a documentation of other data which are managed by an application or environment .
&quot; I dare to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you do not even know how many photos you have , then do not even know how many photos you have , then do not use a quick search and secure archiving on which you can access with other programs , platforms and formats . &quot;
&quot; the first thing you need to do and need to know anything in your system is the construction of information structure in contrast to data structure . you must decide whether other access to your photos do , whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or make sure you have to change it on a larger drive . &quot;
&quot; perhaps you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can easily be found via your location . if you were using enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folders as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . export is then a folder for images which you want to print or publish on a website . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have other requirements such as ver@@ aging of photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant intake of pictures on different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % Archives and 5 % working files you will not have to organize your structure for this content . &quot;
which types of files fit together ? the separation of data types makes the p@@ ile processing easier . separate new of old files .
the separation of original and work files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derived image .
&quot; we also recommend the option metad@@ ata store in the setting of the metad@@ ata in &amp; digi@@ tization ; this ensures that Ex@@ if@@ - and IP@@ TC data to be written into the file , then you can then select the metad@@ ata from the database into the files by selecting the appropriate item in the menu . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what change ? how to change the metad@@ ata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones . &quot;
&quot; now the real work , since you should now choose any photo keywords , sign@@ ments and a review . of course , you can select all the images you need the same attri@@ bute and set the value . this makes sense , as you can concentrate on the best photos on the best photos . &quot;
&quot; let us now speak with keyword , keyword , as you can proceed with other programs or categories . all three are syn@@ onyms for the same thing . &quot;
&quot; if you import kat@@ alog@@ ized images from another source with embedded sampling , then the hierarchy came into the right place ; the re@@ sort of hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can simply be done by using a sub@@ set to another . the changed keywords will be followed by &amp; digi@@ tization ; updates during it the under@@ trees . &quot;
the graph shows how different metad@@ ata are over@@ cut . this is a very rough representation since each block of metad@@ ata in truth consists of many sections . file names and calendar data are properties of all images .
&quot; enough the keywords - the next section refers to labelling or comments , the third important tool to cat@@ alog@@ ze your metad@@ ata . &quot;
&quot; you want to see most nobody in your photos just , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies . they are certainly interested in your photos . &quot;
&quot; take a look at this panorama . from af@@ ar is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you consider it closer to see , then catch some details to see people , the place . &quot;
&quot; and now I say to you this of the Lan@@ de@@ platz in Al@@ lied &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ ha 60 years after landing . Wow ! it begins to dream , association , the historical period of time is again present , you might even hear the silence . the lab@@ eling has thus changed your perception of this panoramic position . &quot;
&quot; for others who regard your photos , the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . think of the key it is to help you about the motive that you move about what you understand . &quot;
&quot; it is ok if a picture is not perfect , if the strength has only to work with an in@@ scription for themselves alone . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; digi@@ tization ; you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alized alpha@@ bet ( U@@ TF @-@ 8 ) , then you can even export it for a selection of images at the same time . KDE can even export it for a selection of pictures . you &apos;ll have to tell you the story to your wishes in the marking and / or the title of the Web @-@ Gal@@ eri@@ es@@ ystem . you will have to tell the story for the opening period , no second time . &quot;
remember the times ahead of GPS ? when you had to find another city without navigation system ? it was Earth not a boring planet at G@@ oogle@@ Earth ? well because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now already with light speed .
&quot; the possibilities offered by Ge@@ ol@@ ok@@ alization are already inn@@ umer@@ able and will be repeated in the future , in the near future , you can also export the pictures at G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flickr &amp; etc ; with the G@@ oogle@@ Maps viewer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; copy@@ left is a word play with copyright and describes the practice the copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same freedoms are also valid in all changed versions , so also for the works of others . &quot;
the following description tells you what information contained in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ tization ; as information depos@@ ited should be depos@@ ited :
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for creators and author ) : this field should add your name , or the name of the person who has created the photo , for example to protect the identity of the photographer , then it should not be changed once again . this field does not support comm@@ as nor Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for contrac@@ tion ) : linked to the author . this field contains the name of the photographer . examples of this can be titles as : employee photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a note to the author &apos;s field , this must be filled out . &quot;
&quot; Editor ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the provider to identify who there is to identify the photo . if the photographer does not work here . if the photographer is listed for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then you can find the picture here . if the image is a bearing photo , then the image / agency will be given here . &quot;
&quot; it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although this does not provide protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calculator . for individuals , this is very important for the majority of your photos only of low interest . for professionals and half professionals , this protection is very important . &quot;
the digital wat@@ ermark is unique per image once . &amp; digi@@ tization ; will make such a module for st@@ acking processing in the near future .
&quot; topics : plate errors , black@@ boards , electricity errors , allocation of storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , age @-@ time , temperature , data size , widespread su@@ pers@@ ti@@ tions &quot;
&quot; of course , we do not talk about CDs that are lost on the street or a fire . this kind of loss are the same that you can happen with traditional paper photos or negative . in this section it is about problems with the new media . &quot;
&quot; K@@ roll On@@ track , the biggest data recovery company in the world , has some interesting statistics which has a loss of data . &quot;
&quot; to fight the problem at CDs / DVDs , you must stay longer than a couple of years . of course , you can also buy CDs and DVDs into archive quality . naturally there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; @-@ in ; 2 the piece which claim a lifetime of 100 years for itself . whether you believe in your jud@@ g@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ read@@ able , but you can use this risk in which you are able to use good discour@@ se and good performances . the best DVD lifts are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write much reliable . it is therefore the right way to choose . &quot;
&quot; CDs and DVDs are very sus@@ cep@@ tible to mistakes , even if you just have written to protect yourself . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we needed for form@@ atting and the control elements . despite this massive protection they needed by chemical ag@@ eing , Ul@@ tra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; for def@@ ective CDs and DVDs there is a cheap program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster which seems to have some wonder at CDs and DVDs . there is also similar applications available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications that damaged data from damaged disks , hard drives , Fl@@ ash@@ media , USB drives , etc . &quot;
optical media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to win the For@@ mat@@ War against the HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can store 50 GB and therefore almost six@@ sm@@ al the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8,@@ 5 GB . all what to CDs and DVDs was of course also applicable to the Blu @-@ ray disc .
&quot; get slowly burning with a good recording at high quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ated format . read the media with a description , date &amp; author passwords and especially protected spot . don &apos;t forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read this media . &quot;
flo@@ oring retain your statistics for themselves . your manufacturer warranty includes a new disk but not the data . Google will provide a major field study on the lack of hard disk drives : disc@@ ards
&quot; shortly : disco hold on the longest in temperature of 35 ° C up to 45 ° C . at lower temper@@ art@@ acids , these errors are not able to determine the most common fault of S@@ MAR@@ T . these are particularly legi@@ tim@@ eters and publishers . the expected life @-@ time period is between 4 and 5 years . &quot;
&quot; this is only about the complete losses due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also have data loss due to a flow case before you have secured files , but these losses can normally restore without great problems . &quot;
&quot; while most electric devices are not much difference , it looks different in devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processors . these can cause serious damage , hardware loss , destruc@@ tive mother@@ boards and other defects . protect yourself from the un@@ avo@@ idable that leads to a loss of time and money . &quot;
the most widespread protection against black@@ tips is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that is part of the energy line absor@@ bs and the rest . it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ in line . think that does not contain any plug @-@ in bar too .
&quot; if you &apos;re looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should be aware that he meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also pay attention to the protection against flash and thus protects the right connected devices . &quot;
&quot; as an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should be sure that all periph@@ ery and cable mo@@ dem@@ s can also be connected to your system . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage support which also includes a telephone connection for your modem . others provide connection options for the co@@ ax@@ ial cable of the cable mo@@ dem@@ s and TV card . &quot;
&quot; if you have a laptop , then you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially developed for not@@ ebooks and therefore also contain the protection of the modem . this makes you ideal for travel . &quot;
&quot; while an over@@ voltage protection will protect your system from smaller variations in the electricity lines , it will not really help you to loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . even a down@@ fall from a few seconds may lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in a lower @-@ breaking power supply . &quot;
&quot; besides the protection against over@@ vol@@ tages , these devices can supply automatically cordless power . this gives you the possibility to save your data and running the system . if you have a US@@ V then you should be sure to get the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the life time of the battery and the attached software is interesting . &quot;
&quot; concerns the potential risk that is exposed to your computer system and compare its security in power disorders , you can get up to &amp; euro ; 20 cost , One 500@@ W US@@ V can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 40 . this is just a little difference . to the end , you should always remember all cable drag before you drive in the holidays . &quot;
&quot; Amazon Web Service contains S3 - Simple storage service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration you can use this as a backup destination for your software , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to store it as a backup destination for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is a further optional offer with which you can store any amount of data . &quot;
&quot; however , they are at home in comparison to hard drives , however very expensive - 40 GB costs &amp; in price ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; cost ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data about the compar@@ atively slow Internet . &quot;
&quot; the solutions are therefore suitable only as a solution against a local data loss of the most important pictures . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . it is too slow . &quot;
&quot; Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flickr ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com make online storage services available on photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not get your images in full resolution online . for 25 $ each year you will receive unlimited memory , which should be checked in reality . &quot;
&quot; from the point of view of data Backup the Web solutions are very safe . transmission errors are automatically adjusted , thanks to the TCP protocol and with large companies is included in the offering a backup and a distributed memory . &quot;
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in computer . all transm@@ issions are pr@@ one to transmission errors . the fil@@ es@@ ystem Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs make at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive safely .
&quot; the worst thing is that no man tells you when a transmission error occurred , not when this happened in your computer . it is quite disturbing to you to have one day to do so . nobody seems to have thought about it . the internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data away than that in your computer . &quot;
&quot; un@@ reliable power supplies are a further source of transmission losses , since they generate interference within the data streams . in normal fil@@ es@@ ystems , these errors remain un@@ noticed . &quot;
&quot; even if you are currently not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of errors a year . &quot;
Z@@ FS from Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with plate errors and can be highly scal@@ able . it is open source with many pat@@ ches and is available under one to the GPL in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it is soon available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available . read this article in English .
Oracle has started its own initiative with its b@@ trendy fil@@ es@@ ystem . this is still used in Alpha status . it uses the same protective mechanisms that uses the Z@@ FS and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not part of the kernel .
&quot; do not under@@ estimate this not ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data losses in the not@@ ebook and 46 % , while not@@ ebooks is already the percentage of the theft of 50 % . &quot;
&quot; data loss due to viruses is less common than most of viruses . it leads to a lower damage , e.g. theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users know only very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; it has been no longer sight@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; open source file systems are less sus@@ cep@@ tible to data loss as proprietary systems : incorrect , NTFS is minimal better than EX@@ T3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the common file systems . a very good English articles can be found here . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . if however , a file was not completely saved before the problem occurred , it is lost . &quot;
viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : incorrect , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss . &quot;
sensors of digital camera cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ tures settings from fundamental physical limits . meant that the technology further developed there is a natural border for this progress . sensitivity and smoke character@@ ize for all types of light sensors are no longer far away from this border .
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and high quality optics are the optimum size for compact cameras . even DSLR cameras have your border with 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ xel . for higher resolution you need a full format sensor ( 24x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
&quot; a 750@@ GB disk drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not take any other for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are affected by a data loss , so secure your data often according to a plan and test this backup before getting something dangerous as the new installation of your operating system to make exchange of disks or the change of hard disk drives . &quot;
&quot; suppose you make your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a flash be@@ ats you have fortunately when the drive was not connected to the moment . &quot;
&quot; a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget plane , water , electricity , electricity , children and theft are dangerous for your data . they usually affect a whole room or the complete house . &quot;
&quot; therefore , des@@ ast@@ er@@ ism always means a not local storage . bring your f@@ uses the stairs into the neighboring house , into your office or similar . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of the physical separation : as above already said is a common reason for a data loss despite securing the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save the one day . &quot;
complete backup : a complete backup of all files secured . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differenti@@ ation : a backup of the files changed since the last complete backup . creates a complete snapshot of two periods : the complete backup and the last differenti@@ ation .
&quot; incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files have been changed since the last backup . you can restore the original status at any time again . this backup comes to a ver@@ sion@@ ing system at the next one with the exception that it is only shut down , and not continued . &quot;
r@@ sync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily set up your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP meetings or other types of file transfer @-@ transm@@ issions only copies the difference of files that really changed . this happens if you want to increase safety via ss@@ h .
save important pictures directly after you saved them on your computer to a DVD or other op@@ tic medium .
&quot; this procedure lets you discover enough time to discover losses and restore it . at the end , you will have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month . any further withdrawal should be done manually after which you have made a complete review . &quot;
&quot; themes : metad@@ ata , in the image file stored IP@@ TC information , original X@@ MP files , original , storage , scal@@ ability , media , recovered from images and metad@@ ata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , viewing , ... , use of the internet . &quot;
&quot; in order to survive valuable pictures the next 40 years , that is about the time span in which you really are interested in your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be observed : &quot;
&quot; as the future due to your nature is un@@ predic@@ table , you have to look at all today is done with caution and re@@ assess the time . unfortunately , there is no other option than a certain vig@@ il@@ ance . unfortunately , you should ask yourself how the current system is back@@ wards compatible . the less variations you have used in the past , the more easily it is the questions of the future . &quot;
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or switch to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtu@@ alization is nowadays available for everyone . so you have an old system important to read your images then save it and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
&quot; on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your storage and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert a new standard . stay with open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the expert pressure for the possibility to change a system in its size . this means more and more .
&quot; we assume that you have planned the scal@@ ability with a planned record and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated record or partition . at * ni@@ x systems like &amp; Linux , you can copy this area and store the screen to a new record . &quot;
&quot; check with the command dm@@ es@@ g , whether your new record has been detected by the system , but hang them out . &quot;
&quot; dd / / dev / s@@ db / dev / s@@ d@@ c / dev / s@@ d@@ c / dev / s@@ d@@ c / dev / s@@ d@@ c / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 , 32 and travel FS ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of Reiser@@ FS if necessary &quot;
open Source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day no software can be read more then you can create it . this task will be easier for year to year .
GI@@ F is a proprietary format that slowly dis@@ appears from the market . you should not use it anymore .
&quot; PNG has been replaced as an open source standard , X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metad@@ ata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . PNG can only collect Gam@@ ma@@ - and ch@@ rom@@ ati@@ veness . PNG can only need Gam@@ ma@@ - and ch@@ rom@@ ati@@ veness . PNG can only need Gam@@ ma@@ - and ch@@ rom@@ ati@@ veness . this format , we would like to recommend you to save your pictures . &quot;
&quot; TIFF was widely used as a picture format . I can store images in high quality , but requires very large files . with some cameras , you can save your images in this format . however , there is more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types . &quot;
DN@@ G The Digital Neg@@ ative file format is a licensed and open resource format that has been developed by Adobe Systems . DN@@ G was already available on the TIFF / EP format and we hope for the use of metad@@ ata . a hand@@ ful@@ ler DN@@ G is now available and we hope to use the competi@@ tor Canon and Nikon it also eventually .
&quot; this is possibly one of the reasons why to replace 2001 , Adobe its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology ; a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a set of XML and R@@ DF . it is a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . the file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .@@ x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF . &quot;
&quot; many photographers prefer to archive a original of your recording , mostly in the raw format , as it saves the metad@@ ata separately from the image file . therefore , however , it can think about problems with the link between the metad@@ ata file and the image file , and how above all , you should consider whether you use DN@@ G as a container and put everything there together . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata initiative is an open organization responsible for fully compatible online metad@@ ata standards , which supports a wide range of application purposes and modeling , discussions and collective work in the D@@ CM@@ I Communities and the D@@ CM@@ I working groups , annual conferences and informative efforts to achieve a far @-@ depth acceptance of metad@@ ata standards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import pictures from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the pictures on the camera to use , you can use this as temporary backup . &quot;
convert raw files to DN@@ G and save it to your raw archive . this function is not yet implemented .
&quot; if you use external programs , you can use external programs . if you edit the pictures again with &amp; digi@@ tization ; then you should add the metad@@ ata again . these have been cut off from the other programs . &quot;
&quot; protect the edited images for the copyright with a digital wat@@ ermark . export it to MPEG , use it in MPEG , use &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ tization . in the section adding a photo to an album you will find a description , as you can already add on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings to import images to your alarm database . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ tization ; connect them using the computer , turn the camera to the display mode and turn it . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; when you start the camera interface , it is trying to connect to your camera . if this is the case , the fil@@ en@@ ame is displayed at the bottom and the thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera will be displayed . some cameras do not appear thumb@@ nails and a symbol for the file assignment for each file , photos , movies , music etc. shown on the camera . &quot;
&quot; before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information to each entry . with the page features and metad@@ ata from the camera interface you can see the properties of a inser@@ tion or metad@@ ata . &quot;
&quot; this dialog shows file properties and the photo information that can be stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image is not downloaded to your computer . note that in some digital camera cameras do not have any information available . &quot;
&quot; the tab Metad@@ ata shows the internal metad@@ ata as to , manufacturer , manufacturer , GPS etc. of the picture . this information is the same as for the metad@@ ata page from the main window of &amp; digi@@ tization . please note that these metad@@ ata is not available in some digital cameras . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button to download and then we recommend the photos from their camera into a single album , and we recommend to check if the pictures have been downloaded in an album before you delete the photos from the camera . &quot;
&quot; if you do not want to download all photos , you can only select the desired with the default methods of &amp; KDE ; once you select the photos you want to download and then download it . the button chosen is long as long as you selected some photos . &quot;
&quot; if your camera is supporting this , an option New download is available . these images have not been downloaded from &amp; digi@@ tization . in this case the new pictures have been selected with a star in advance . if you select this option , of course only the new images can be downloaded . &quot;
&quot; when you use the buttons All download or selected , a dialog will be displayed with which you can select the target album , shown in which the photos you can read in section M@@ 1 albums . select the target album from the list and click OK . &quot;
&quot; after that you chose the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ tization ; loads the photos from the camera into the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all the button at once . if you just want to delete it , you will need to select it first and delete it afterwards . &quot;
&quot; please note that there are no possibility of photos that you have deleted from the camera . however , they have been completely deleted before you delete it from the camera . if you want to delete them from the camera . if you do not want to delete it from the camera , as this is much faster . &quot;
&quot; cameras are used as fil@@ en@@ ame for the photos often not particularly expres@@ sive names . this file names are usually loaded again , if you load photos from the camera . this can be used to double fil@@ tered galleries in the same album . therefore , it can be useful , the date and time when the picture was made to integrate into the fil@@ en@@ ames . &quot;
&quot; in the next section you will find options to the rotating and mir@@ rors of the image , and for dat@@ eable sub@@ sist@@ ence . if you use this latter option , will automatically be created a folder per day . &quot;
&quot; the options during the transmission opens three more options , which will be carried out before the photos on the record are stored on the record . the first two concern the information about the author in the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct the date &amp; time for all downloaded pictures . &quot;
&quot; if you wish to have a different date format than the default format , you can use for example in the editing field / pre@@ fix photo - % Y@@ - % d % H : % M : % M : % M : % S . for further adjustments you should read the help of the command str@@ f@@ time . &quot;
&quot; if you use the camera file name , you have the option to change the fil@@ en@@ ame in small letters , or if you prefer this . &quot;
&quot; the new fil@@ en@@ ame , the &amp; digi@@ tization came ; for a photo being used below the name , the camera is displayed in the preview pane . your settings for ren@@ ame is stored and automatically used when you open the camera . &quot;
&quot; and digi@@ tization ; can use all the information about the orientation of the camera to the time @-@ point of recording . not all cameras are willing to use this information . in the section Side@@ bar Metad@@ ata you can read more details , about the information that has embedded your camera into the photo . &quot;
&quot; automatic la@@ yo@@ g@@ ation is usually switched on , and if your camera does not supply this information , it leaves the photo in the original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic turning point and select the Autom@@ atic la@@ under@@ ing in the bottom of the window . &quot;
&quot; if your camera has been made information about the date , available on which the photo has been made available , it can be loaded to download automatically sub@@ ars in the target album . not all cameras are available in the same sub@@ album . not all cameras are available in the same sub@@ album . not all cameras are available in the same sub@@ album . in the section side@@ bar Met@@ a data you can read , which could be embedded your camera into photos . &quot;
&quot; this option is normally switched off , and in this case it saves &amp; digi@@ tization ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this option , you need to switch this option and select the Dat@@ ums@@ y template at the bottom of the window . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to load photos from their computer to your camera is the button download . choose the file option dialog &amp; KDE ; appears , in which you can select the files up@@ loaded , you can also select more than a file with the standard &amp; KDE ; methods . &quot;
&quot; after choosing the selection is asked , ask us where the images will be loaded too . a folder dialog for the camera will appear . select a folder dialog for the camera . select the desired folder and click OK to load the up@@ loading . the pictures are not deleted from your computer . &quot;
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this is a position meant to be displayed in length and l@@ ati@@ l@@ ati@@ tudes and which can be displayed on a map . determining the data can be performed by the American GPS to the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European Galileo or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional photographers , it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to capture an area by automatic inclusion of GPS data . environmental pl@@ anner , military , police , architecture offices and real estate mak@@ ler can use this ability . &quot;
&quot; if you have forgotten later , where exactly the photo was done , you can locate a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ tization ; user want to locate a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ tization ; user want to locate the location of the photos , it is good the position of a photo . &quot;
&quot; the question is , how do the GPS data come into the image ? first , you should know that exi@@ v@@ 2 many GPS data fields , such as the way you come into these fields ? there are at least three ways to reach this . directly with the correct hardware , via a retro@@ editing of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there are currently no camera which has been integrated into a GPS unit . but there are a few who work together with GPS recei@@ vers . either as a card module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye iP@@ A@@ Q i@@ ke Ko@@ dak D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR RI@@ CO@@ H Pro G3 Sony
&quot; downloading of GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ p@@ sman or g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel . you must save this data in the g@@ p@@ x format , since this is the only format that is supported by the module for geographical assignment . &quot;
&quot; there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract data from pictures and from the GPS . on the following page you can make the same under &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
&quot; if you know the length and l@@ ati@@ l@@ ati@@ tudes or other data , then you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ if@@ Tool by P@@ hil Harv@@ ey . it uses the in@@ sig@@ nat@@ ories coordinates , which can be created e.g. by map@@ s.@@ g@@ oogle . &quot;
&quot; map@@ s.@@ g@@ oogle@@ .com does not show European roads . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe . &quot;
&quot; and digi@@ tization ; tries to give you so much control over his work procedures as possible . there are many settings that connect the behavior of &amp; digi@@ tization . to set up these settings , you have to set up settings in eight pages . you can change between them by clicking on the symbols of the left side . &quot;
&quot; to select action can be displayed on embedded preview or edit image processing , so that it &apos;s the standard behavior of &amp; digi@@ tization ; fixed if you click on an entry in the main view . &quot;
&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the standardis@@ ation and protected legal data . these data are automatically selected in the appropriate IP@@ TC data fields . also with a database synchron@@ isation , these data are written into the IP@@ TC fields . &quot;
&quot; author : this field should contain a syn@@ onym for the photographer : this field should be the professional @-@ name of the photographer . this can be design@@ ations such as a photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a detailed description of the author , it must also be filled . &quot;
Editor is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to give the photo . this must not be the author if this is a stock agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press ; if the image is a stock photo , then the group or agency should be provided here . &quot;
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the appropriate IP@@ TC field . this metad@@ ata is permanently included in the image and not only came in the database of &amp; digi@@ tization ; this metad@@ ata are also available in other programs and can be imported in &amp; digi@@ tization ; imported without lost .
&quot; pictures are stored in JPEG pictures ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes comments to add to your photos , with the boards also from other picture frames . attention : for pictures that have already delivered sign@@ ments , they will be over@@ written by the by &amp; digi@@ tization . &quot;
&quot; the page Settings contains all the options for the information that appear , when the mouse pointer in the main window on a file rests . depending on the selected option , this information is displayed or not . &quot;
&quot; &amp; # 160 ; digi@@ tization came ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to set the file extensions &amp; digi@@ tization came , you can add the file extensions of this list and remove the file extensions that has not added any of these extensions . &quot;
the default settings can be returned again by pressing the button up@@ loading right of each category .
&quot; the settings of the lumin@@ aires of &amp; digi@@ tization came ; can then be switched on this page to the default values . however , some images have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . the option &amp; quot ; in all of the image size lad@@ ders ; if you have one , then you can get a better visibility results . &quot;
&quot; by default , the editing process uses a black background behind the shown photos . if you prefer a different color , you can choose this here . you can use the tool used in full screen mode . &quot;
over@@ - and under@@ lined areas of an image can be marked with dar@@ ker or bright colour in the image . these colors will be set here . in the image processing can be switched on and switched on .
&quot; with Chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling is meant that the images are co@@ ded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance , as well as in colour information . please read this article in Wikipedia for the immediate explanation . &quot;
&quot; with setting PNG compression , you can reduce the size of PNG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality , as PNG have a loss of free algorithm . the only effect is that the image data is more time to import and pack . this means 1 : a low and 9 a high compression . &quot;
&quot; with the option of TIFF files , you can comp@@ ress the De@@ fl@@ ate compres@@ sor for TIFF images . this reduces the size of TIFF images . it does not affect the image quality as the de@@ fl@@ ate algorithm is free . &quot;
&quot; with the setting of loss of all @-@ free JPEG files , you can save losses freely . even if you have written losses and file size far better than normal JPEG . as this paragraph , Metad@@ ata was not yet supported , but was in the planning stage . &quot;
&quot; in the earlier versions of &amp; digi@@ tization ; the image processing was only a picture looking for photos . currently , it is very quick to use a tool for mani@@ p@@ ulation of your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of the image processing . &quot;
&quot; the standardis@@ ation is that all green pixels are equal . if the pixel is used for odd lines , this difference is a bit soft , elimin@@ ates this problem with a minimum loss of details . this option shows the picture a little soft , eliminated , but the 2x@@ 2 G@@ uns pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method . &quot;
&quot; when this option is set , the white off the camera is used . otherwise , if placed , the automatic colour balance is used . &quot;
&quot; this setting is only used when the white altern@@ ate is not set . standard is it a fixed color balance sheet , which was photograph@@ ed on a white card that is photograph@@ ed in sunlight . &quot;
this setting is supported only for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SLR cameras . the use of the second sensors has the effect that under@@ lined images in four steps more details in the sh@@ utter . for other cameras this option will be ignored .
&quot; the standard is the sh@@ utter , i.e. the parts of your images have been burned , due to the in@@ ability of your camera to view the sh@@ ame@@ ful results , because they can fix the sh@@ utter in various horses . finally , you can try some parts of missing information from the nickname . &quot;
&quot; this is possible because blue pixel is generally not so fast s@@ ati@@ fied as green and red . &amp; digi@@ w therefore , therefore , the absence of green and red shares out of the still not saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a question how much color or white you want . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the option re@@ construct a level , you get the possibility of setting a level . here is a value of three a compromise and can therefore be adapted for each picture individually . &quot;
sit down the L@@ umin@@ anz@@ ee according to your taste . you probably have to set him a bit higher than the default 1 . this can also be made later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ tization ; to keep the time for hum@@ os@@ a@@ icing small , you should be conservative . &quot;
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to obtain a complete picture from the partial image sensor that provides many cameras and which provides a matrix colour pixel . this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation or color construction .
&quot; and digi@@ tization came ; and D@@ cra@@ w provide you three alternatives available : Bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( Vari@@ able number of gradient ) was the first algorithm that used by D@@ cra@@ w . it creates colour exchange with the edges . Bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a fast solution with an acceptable results . &quot;
&quot; if you know the color deviation of your lenses , you can set the red and blue correc@@ tive values here . this is certainly the best method for a color correction , as you are carried out during the raw conversion . &quot;
a profile translated the color information and gives instructions such as it should be returned . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ tization ; information such as the color information from a color foam in the others so that the colors are as accurately as possible .
behavior issues if a picture is open in the image processing / colour administration module with raw files .
&quot; colour Fol@@ der Fol@@ der here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you can save all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ tization then exam@@ ines these folders during the start . &quot;
settings of ICC profiles you have here the possibility &amp; quot ; Standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to deposit . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later .
the color @-@ view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your images colored not the whole screen .
&quot; the input profiles should be adapted to the camera models and model that you use . not all profiles are included in the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which do not contain color ton@@ ing or gam@@ mak@@ or@@ re@@ boot . this means that you need to carry out the color ton@@ ing itself . &quot;
&quot; there are other options like the soft @-@ Pro@@ of profile , which you can em@@ ulate how your image can be returned from a device as your printer can print a smaller colour area than your camera and some colors can therefore be very saturated . this could be manually correct , rather than to leave on the blin@@ ders of your printer . &quot;
for most cameras it is pretty obvious which color profile is intended for them . unfortunately not with the models of Canon . therefore here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is of course in@@ officially :
&quot; the Canon Profile extension leaves the style for the goal : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for neut@@ ral , P for por@@ tra@@ it@@ and S for the standard style . &quot;
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; KDE ; image Plugin interface . it is an interface that is supported by a series of &amp; KDE , imaging and image processing ; many modules have been written to cooperate with any program that uses the K@@ IP@@ I interface . &quot;
&quot; if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . choose which you want to use , and these modules are then loaded from &amp; digi@@ tization . these modules appear as new items in the menu of the main window and beyond , see some also in the context menu of the lecture . &quot;
&quot; short commands for tasks required by modules can be set in the menu under settings short commands . &quot;
further information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I @-@ modules can be obtained via the K@@ IP@@ I project at http : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manual books of the K@@ IP@@ I module .
&quot; the settings of the di@@ vest@@ ock should be easy to understand . the top Reg@@ ulators adjust the time between the image outputs , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds well . the other wag@@ ons can switch off the metad@@ ata or that are built at the bottom of the images during the ad . &quot;
&quot; the camera properties show on the left a list of all the cameras supported cameras . on the right side there is a button Autom@@ atic detection , which is trying to connect a camera that is connected to the computer , turned into the image settings . currently here are the port settings , US@@ B@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire memory . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the end you can put the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wi@@ re@@ - ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) -@@ mass storage camera from the camera box . you have to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / you to specify on which you add your camera . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ tization ; you have to connect the camera to your computer , connect them into the display mode and switch off . &quot;
&quot; pro@@ bi@@ ere you off , whether &amp; digi@@ tization came ; the camera automatically recognis@@ es . if not , you can set camera models and port manually . after you set up your camera out your camera will appear in the camera . &quot;
&quot; you can select any arbitrary name for your camera . this is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window . if you own more than a camera , you can insert all here . &quot;
&quot; with the option confir@@ ming dialog for the move of &gt; images into the folders , you can set the inter@@ viewer of &amp; digi@@ tization ; when delete a photo in an album . in the sections delete a photo and delet@@ ing a album you will find more details . &quot;
&quot; editorial changes due to the right side@@ bar can be imp@@ lied by &amp; digi@@ code , if you use the option changes in the right side@@ bar without any queries . otherwise you need to use the changes with the button changes . &quot;
you can also tie the display of the welcome screen saver from &amp; digi@@ tization ; in some circumstances it accelerated the start process of &amp; digi@@ tization .
&quot; the setup was looking to look for new photos &amp; digi@@ tization ; the base folder after new or deleted albums / photos came . this extended the start time of &amp; digi@@ tization ; if something was deleted from the basic folder , asks that it is to delete it from the database . &quot;
various color schem@@ as can be used in &amp; digi@@ tization ; used to adjust the main window to your tastes . these settings can be used under settings design from the tool tool . a preview of the available designs is shown below :
these designs are defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ tization ; find more information about this tutorial .
&amp; digi@@ tization came ; contains a quick image processing with some basic tools . you can use this to view your photos and improve the correction and improvement . the editing process can be launched by a click with the left mouse button to preview the preview and selection of the entry displays / editing .
&quot; editing editing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of these are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ tization ; therefore , they are not part of your distribution . further information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules can be found in section image processing . &quot;
&quot; status bar at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current fil@@ en@@ ame , enlargement factor and the current image size shows . &quot;
a menu bar on the top of the top and below the toolbar for quick access to the most common functions .
&quot; editing functions of image processing will change your photos . none of the functions will change the original photo before you save the file saving or save the button save from the tool &apos;s tool , as soon as you have saved the original photo once you have saved the image . &quot;
so you should possibly add a copy of your image before you change it . this can save you with file Save as .
&quot; as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the image file or restore the button restore processing in the tool tool . you will lose any change that you have done on the photo since last time . &quot;
virtually any action of image processing can be und@@ et@@ ected or restored . the last action you can un@@ lock by selecting the edit back or restored by selecting Edit from the menu .
&quot; if you frequently use this , you should make yourself the keyboard short@@ cuts , C@@ trl ; -@@ Z to restore and C@@ trl ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore . &quot;
&quot; if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; on the traceability or restore button in the tool @-@ like a moment , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu items , all actions are also un@@ interrupted or restored . &quot;
&quot; once you have started image processing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword . if you have made changes in the menu file , you will be asked if you want to save it . &quot;
you can start in the photo and zoom out in the you C@@ trl ; mouse wheel or the symbols in the tool item or the entries in the saf@@ est menu .
&quot; to customize a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool size : enlarge factor automatically select &quot;
&quot; view full screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode . usually , you can use this button in dialog with the ES@@ C button . usually , you can view this in the dialog dialog by &amp; digi@@ tization ; you can view it from the &amp; digi@@ tization . see the section for setting up the image processing . &quot;
&quot; if you want to print the current picture , you can print in the menu file and get the standard &amp; KDE ; printing dialog . you can customize the settings before you print your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the main menu , you can print individual images or whole phrases . you only need to select the pictures with the standard methods and select from the menu album export printer assist@@ ent . if you follow the wizard , you just need to make your choice . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ tization came ; main window has a side@@ bar on the right edge , which is important information and promotions available for selected images . the same side@@ bar is available , even in the image processing . it is displayed when one of the five rider is cli@@ cked : &quot;
multiple Click on the same tab leaves the side@@ bar to appear or go back into the edges .
&quot; in the lab@@ eling view , you can insert complaint with un@@ restricted size or insert . note the note below . the text is U@@ TF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed to be copied to EX@@ IF@@ S and IP@@ TC@@ - fields so that you can use other programs . &quot;
the IP@@ TC data support only ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are deduc@@ ted according to 2000 characters . if you want to use the IP@@ TC lab@@ eling field in other applications you should consider these restrictions .
&quot; after you commented , you will either use the button user or simply switch to the next picture , the complaint are then stored . &quot;
&quot; beside the user button , there is a button More . with this you can read further metad@@ ata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also read the metad@@ ata in the files . this is always done if you have chosen a metad@@ ata that will always be written in the pictures . &quot;
&quot; the section evaluation shows a review of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in searching and sor@@ ting colors . it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar , or with the keyboard short@@ cuts . to evaluate several images at the same time , select this from and use the context menu . &quot;
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field ur@@ gency . the enco@@ ding follows the schema in the following table :
the keyword view displays a search box for filtering the keywords , the s@@ wor@@ t@@ tree and a selection box with the previously mentioned in this &amp; digi@@ tization . &quot;
the sampling tree is dynam@@ ically adapted to the given search keyword . you can restrict the number of possibilities in search of a keyword . this ability is particularly useful if you have many keywords .
&quot; the input field at the bottom is another relief in entering the keyword at a picture series . if you have given different keywords , these are stored for quick access . &quot;
keywords can also be placed by mark@@ ings of the corresponding an@@ ic boxes in the tree . all the keywords of an image are stored in the IP@@ TC field keyword .
&quot; if several images are selected in the main view and choose a keyword in the key tree , this is only applied to the exact picture and not to the whole selection , if you want to select a selection with a keyword , please read the section sampling filter . &quot;
&quot; the side@@ bar sampling filter is used to edit the selection of images shown in the main window . usually , the left side@@ bar with their album , - Dat@@ um@@ - , keyword and search views used . if additionally one or more sampling filter from the right side is displayed , only the quantity of these two is displayed . all the keywords are available . &quot;
&quot; you can also drag and drop a keyword . suppose you have chosen several images to draw you with keywords , you can simply drag it out of the right side@@ bar and paste it to the selection . then , a dialog you ask if you want to put the keyword . &quot;
&quot; in the upper example , the main window displays the pictures on a calendar day . the sampling filter is reduced to a calendar day . you have been selected with Str@@ g + a , and after that a dialog was asked from the right keyword tree . a dialog asks whether this keyword is set to be set . &quot;
this search for changes will take place at every start of the program . it can also be switched on settings .
&quot; if you have a rule with and created , and notice that it would be a or to be , you can easily change it with a double click on the text and in the control area . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : the entry that is looked for in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , keywords , keywords , etc . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or a string which is already set in the database . &quot;
you can also set a searching for all elements of the database using the following options :
&quot; if you want to group options , you only need the connector box at the end of the rule and then use the button group@@ ing to use the options as follows : &quot;
why were Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Flickr not listed ? the free space is limited there to 1 GB and you will not want to save the pictures in full resolution .
this article / tutorial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly got it to &amp; digi@@ tization ; s concrete implementation .
&quot; the reason why you can use a Color@@ ful workflow , this is the colors that are actually photograph@@ ed from your camera or scanner . with a colored workflow you can reach that the colours on your monitor can be photograph@@ ed from your camera or scanner and the colours you want to print or publish on the web from your digital dark chamber . &quot;
&quot; when the theme comes onto color administration , everyone wants to know which buttons he needs to provide for the results that he wants to provide information about color management . additionally , links with deeper information allow you to make your own informed decisions so that you get the desired result . &quot;
&quot; if your pic@@ ks meets all the criteria listed below , then you don &apos;t have to worry about colour management . &quot;
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated on the s@@ R@@ GB color foam . ( more information can be found below )
&quot; your only other image editions are sent by e @-@ mail or the Web , where s@@ R@@ GB of de facto standard . &quot;
&quot; so if s@@ R@@ GB works so well and make life easier for all so easy , why one should then use a different color room and to make thoughts about paint des@@ ol@@ ds ? &quot;
&quot; a visual example of the limitation of s@@ R@@ GB compared to colors that we really can see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hu@@ b@@ ish region , and the colors in the R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum , the tri@@ angular region . &quot;
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ R@@ GB with some larger colour@@ ing so visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms page and click on info and then on information About R@@ GB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to convert my monitor k@@ alli@@ bri@@ ds when I decided to work for it only in the R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum ?
&quot; yes ! if you work in the R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum or not , you need to work your monitor k@@ alli@@ bility , since s@@ R@@ GB works that your ; on@@ itor on s@@ R@@ GB k@@ alli@@ bri@@ ates , then you need to use your monitor to the R@@ GB standard , a suitable monitor profile or both . &quot;

&quot; this tool sets up five automatic correc@@ tions , which can improve a picture in most cases . use it before you try further manual processing . &quot;
&quot; the features standardis@@ ed , the same , automatic par@@ amount and contrast automatically expand your colors to make the best . you will need to experiment with these effects , to see which best suits your photo . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize : this method scal@@ ded the lumin@@ ous point , so that the dark point black and the bright@@ est point is as bright as possible without any color sh@@ aded . this function is often a magnet for images which are dark or selected . &quot;
&quot; same : this method adjust the lumin@@ osity of the colours of the selected image , so that the history of the intensity of an image , sometimes produces the same very good results in improving the cont@@ emplation of an image , sometimes it also produces a very powerful surgery , which means either wonders in a picture or it was destroyed . &quot;
&quot; automatic shut @-@ like : this method maxim@@ izes the colour area in the Rot@@ ary , green and blue canal . it evalu@@ ates the dark and light border tones and adjust the red , green and blue channels of the complete hi@@ ogra@@ m area . &quot;
contrast contrast this method improves the contrast and the lumin@@ osity of the R@@ GB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values of all values in between . this is only visible in selected pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white off @-@ off of &amp; digi@@ tization came ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white off of a photo .
&quot; the white @-@ axis correction is slightly limited as a color foam with 8 @-@ bit per colour . if you can perform a distance from the original image , in case you can perform the white box in the raw mode , which in the 16 @-@ bit mode , so your ways will cause a correction . &quot;
&quot; this tool is based on a white equ@@ alisation of the copyright of Pa@@ wel T. Jo@@ ch@@ y@@ m is protected . they launch it over the menu entry colors white off the image processing . &quot;
the pre @-@ case can be adjusted in size . on the left side you can see the original image as well as the preview of the target image . the preview is dynam@@ ically adapted to the settings of the tool . if you want to see the origin@@ ality of the tool then it is enough to click on the sub@@ window .
the preview of the target photos has a red mark@@ er . the L@@ umin@@ ance of the pixels under this mark@@ er is displayed as vertical line in the history of history .
&quot; on the right above , a hi@@ ogra@@ m is displayed that dynam@@ ically change as soon as you have a parameter , even in well illuminated images , most pixels very small L@@ umin@@ ous values . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; the contrast of your result depends on shadows , satur@@ ation and gam@@ ma . the shadows can be improved or down the sc@@ attend@@ ant of your photos or also down . &quot;
&quot; An@@ stat with the above mentioned controls , you should use the color temperature @-@ pi@@ p@@ ette . click on this button and then somewhere to the calculation of the color temperature of the white equ@@ alisation . in this way the temperature and green values are automatically set . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can set the whit@@ eboard with the list of default settings . the following settings are available : &quot;
the over@@ exposure indi@@ k@@ ator increases the colours when more than a colour channel of the pixels .. you will see the combined result in the white in@@ correctly . this is displayed in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final picture .
the buttons Save as and charging make exactly this . any setting of the white equ@@ es you can then save in a text file and re@@ loaded later .
the kno@@ b settings sets all filter values on their standard values and the corresponding white in@@ verse white . note that also neutral settings will be used as your original . if you save this your original image .
&quot; you can adjust the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ung@@ e@@ fe per color channel of the edited image . 8 @-@ bit enco@@ ding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit enco@@ ding is more suitable for high @-@ quality images . this enco@@ ding requires also more record , accountability and stands on@@ ly@@ for the formats PNG , P@@ N@@ M , TIFF and DN@@ G . &quot;
&quot; this tool opens the same dialog as the processing of raw materials . it uses the change and allocation of paint pro@@ fil@@ en . colour ton@@ er can be carried out by the sub@@ window for the hel@@ pers . a detailed manual for the use of paint pro@@ fil@@ en allows you to rate the chapter color administration . &quot;
&quot; another important tool is available in the menu under colors of sound correc@@ tions . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several colour channels at the same time , so that you can make use of the same errors and you can therefore always need the same correction . &quot;
&quot; a very powerful option to correct exposure problems is the tool for Gra@@ dation , that you can find under colors Gra@@ dation in the menu . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ tization came , tool color effects , a solar effect , a vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a cant@@ on filter . &quot;
&quot; in times of chemical processing , solar radiation , also Sab@@ ati@@ er , also called Sab@@ ati@@ ans , a effect of the additional light . this was the effect that the bright@@ ening areas of dar@@ ker and the colors used by the second illumination . this tool was a partial negative of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect . &quot;
&quot; the intensity controls the solar panels . at about 50 % intensity , the image is what chem@@ ically possible . another increase is finally creates a negative image that does not generate photo image . &quot;
this is an example of the solar effects . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the process ( 2 ) . applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vivi@@ d filter sim@@ ulates the so @-@ mentioned &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; -@@ effect . it differs from a satur@@ ation effect the colors brilliant and smooth . try it simply to beauti@@ fy many photos .
&quot; Vel@@ via is the brand name for one of day@@ light optimized color film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth photo structure . Vel@@ vi@@ as strong saturated colors are also very saturated colors , but also some photo album , especially those which hardly wait landscapes , too much . &quot;
the ne@@ on@@ filter sim@@ ulates ne@@ on@@ light on the contra@@ sting channel . the parameters level controls the brightness of the result and the sli@@ der re@@ peti@@ tions the strength of the Ne@@ on@@ lich@@ ts . at large pictures the filter can use the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and the lumin@@ ous intensity of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . you can viewing the various Far@@ bas@@ ing your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . once you are satisfied with the result you are using the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
&quot; if you can get a photo with bad light conditions , you can get the reverse problem : one to great satur@@ ation . also in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to increase the satur@@ ation . also in this case , you can view them in the preview . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k . &quot;
&quot; between the complex tool Gra@@ dation and the simple lighting / double / gam@@ ast / gam@@ ma , the tool is very complicated to improve the exposure process . even if the dialog on this tool is very complicated , you need to explain the use of the sli@@ der . concrete the three sli@@ ders under the history . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graph of the int@@ eg@@ ram , a history , the active channel or the selected area . under the graph@@ s are three sli@@ der into which you go and the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas . &quot;
the easiest way to learn to learn it is to move the regul@@ ator and pay attention to it as the picture changes .
&quot; on the right , the original and preview of the image can be seen . the preview is dynam@@ ically updated , based on the settings of the image , updates . on the left side are the following options available . &quot;
&quot; sc@@ aling : with this selection box can be set if the hi@@ ogra@@ m is shown with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ ical Y @-@ axis . for pictures of a constant paint it is often dominated by a single pillar . in this case , the linear history is dominated by a single pillar . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic classification is provided by a single pillar . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic classification is provided . &quot;
&quot; three regul@@ ator : the top for the dark sounds , the middle for the light sounds and the under@@ line for the middle sounds , frequently Gam@@ ma@@ values . &quot;
&quot; the three color species can be used in the preview of the original image , to adjust the input of shadows , middle and light sounds automatically . furthermore , there is a button for an fully automatic adjustment . &quot;
output : the output range allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are two regul@@ ators that can be used in order to make use of output inter@@ actively such as in the input rate . the compression of the output can be used for example to create a slight picture as background while doing something else in the foreground .
automatically : with this button the image values are automatically set according to the values of the image .
&quot; save as and loading : with these buttons , the incoming values in the fil@@ es@@ ystem is saved and later re@@ loaded . this will be used to Gimp levels format . &quot;
&quot; if you use this mode and the three colours , the input will be adjusted automatically for all shadows , remedies and solar tones . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click on the preview of the original image for Rot@@ ary , Green , Blue , Blue , and the L@@ umin@@ ati channels . &quot;
&quot; the option of over@@ exposure indi@@ k@@ ator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixel and to show you the combined result of all channels . here it is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview pane and it is not a effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see an example of adjustment of the input applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and Alpha channel , as well as the output boxes are unchanged . the original picture is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left side , half of the original and the target image is shown . the preview is updated dynam@@ ically depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available : &quot;
modi@@ fying channel : this selection box allows the channel to be modified by the module :
beside this box there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ ical view . for pictures with a digital camera . for pictures with large areas of a constant color the linear mode creates a wide beam . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ ic mode will help further .
&quot; if you move for example a cur@@ v@@ ator to the right , for example the bright sounds , then you can see that these bright tones with dark Ones , and that the corresponding car@@ riages will be dar@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; on the preview of the original photos , a red mark@@ er to see . if you want to change this marking to the area you want to change the original value . create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted according to your taste . &quot;
&quot; save as and loading : with these buttons , you can make exactly this . any curve you can save this file system and later be loaded on file system . the file format is the Gimp short format . &quot;
&quot; if you create this method and the three dy@@ es buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of the shadow , middle and solar tones . activate the paint pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click on the original image to put the control points for the red , green , blue and L@@ umin@@ anz@@ kur@@ ve . &quot;
&quot; the option of over@@ exposure indi@@ k@@ ator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixel . if in more than one channel @-@ coated pixels , you get the combined result displayed only in the preview and it is not a effect on the final result . &quot;
&quot; below you can see a black @-@ white photo , which was corrected in the L@@ umin@@ anz@@ Canal and has been used with the paint pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) . &quot;
the channel mix@@ er of the &amp; digi@@ tization came ; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the sh@@ ades of the photos .
the channel mix@@ er is another highly developed tool to mix the colors @-@ tones of the images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel mix@@ er of image processing .
with the channel box you can choose the color for the history . this gives you an initial indication of how you can correct the channels by selecting the relative distribution and r@@ ash . the left area of the window shows you a preview . the original can be seen as compared with the own rider .
the preview of the target image has a red mark@@ er . if you position it in the image appears a vertical line in the hi@@ ft to show you the appropriate color .
&quot; controls for the module are right down : regul@@ ator for red , green and construction enable you to mix these channels . if you also activate the appropriate color components , as the channel mix@@ er then DAS as a tool for generating great black and white conver@@ sions of your photos . try the green channel for black @-@ white portra@@ its . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially if you mix Mon@@ och@@ rom , which occurs in the same place in the colour channel , which does not appear at the same place in the colour channel , and their spac@@ ers can be different from each channel . if that is the case you can improve your mon@@ och@@ rom converting in which you can reduce the colour@@ ing first . &quot;
&quot; the saving as and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any mix@@ er setting , you can store for later and then load the file format is the Gimp channel mix@@ er format . &quot;
&quot; the option of over@@ exposure indi@@ k@@ ator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixel and to show you the combined result of all channels . here it is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview pane and it is not a effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a photo shown in the blue channel . option L@@ umin@@ ance is activated . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography has always been intri@@ gu@@ ing because of your abstr@@ action . with the development of digital photography is black / white a work step , as colour pictures can easily be converted to the machine . also with a set of film clips . &quot;
&quot; Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3200 , Il@@ ford FP@@ 4 Plus , Il@@ ford Pan@@ F Plus , Il@@ ford X@@ P2 Super
&quot; green filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film coating with a green lens filter . this looks good , in all scen@@ eries and fits very well to portra@@ its against the sky . thus similar to the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Grün@@ filter . &quot;
&quot; Oran@@ fil@@ il@@ ter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film coating with a orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and air photos . thus similar to the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Oran@@ ti@@ il@@ ter . &quot;
rot@@ ect : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a red plate filter . this creates a dramatic rule @-@ effects and can sim@@ ulate lun@@ ar effects for day@@ time . thus similar to the 003 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Rot@@ filter .
yellow filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film coating with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural colour ton@@ ing and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) gel filter .
Sep@@ i@@ aton : produces warm bright and medium tones while he adds a bit col@@ dness in the sh@@ att@@ acking . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and therefore similar to the 005 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
&quot; with the &amp; digi@@ tization ; tools texture , you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture . &quot;
&quot; by adding a texture to your image , regardless if it is a color picture or not , you can look it like a oil painting out of enlarged points or like a wall picture on a wall . the menu entry image texture apply to the image processing can be used for it . &quot;
Rel@@ ief : move this parameter to the right increases the depth of the depth or three @-@ dimensional of the texture on the image .
a paper Tex@@ ture@@ effect has been applied to the photo below . the original picture is set ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) . the parameters Rel@@ ief has been set to 200 .
&quot; with the &amp; digi@@ tization ; tool frame , a decorative frame can be added to an image . &quot;
&quot; the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . an opportunity to keep its attention is to put a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier to the dispute . this is a psychological barrier to the dispute . under the frame image , the module can be started from the editing process . &quot;
&quot; type : with this parameter you provide the desired basket for your image . the image with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce um@@ ran@@ ged it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame of the ideal for a button effect and decor@@ atively adds a decorative frame with patterns . &quot;
width : returns the width of the frame in percent . the value of value for width is from 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; this with the frame of decorative target is bigger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for the pressure of the images , especially if you have used the tool to cutting aspect rati@@ os before . &quot;
&quot; with this practical tool , you can insert easily a form@@ atted text into an image at any location . this also goes to multiple places if you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . just use the text and place it with the mouse . use text orientation , orientation , color from the color area and the character set with its properties as you need . you can simply select a frame around the text and / or a half @-@ clear background . already the image is finished . &quot;
&quot; any setting you have chosen for your text , can be changed until you click the button &quot; OK &apos; . after the image once the image is part of the image . it can no longer be changed . &quot;
&quot; with the &amp; digi@@ tization ; tools Sch@@ abl@@ one apply , you can place a template over an image . &quot;
the menu image Sch@@ abl@@ one apply in the image processing can be used to put sho@@ ots over a picture .
for the Sch@@ abl@@ one there is no restrictions on the size and orientation . you only have to add to PNG file format and should add your p@@ abl@@ one of the file size ( 9 ) for the reduction of the file size of the sten@@ cil . if you want to add a mail in English to the &amp; digi@@ list ; mail@@ ing@@ liste arrived @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; if you use this tool for the first time , you have to set your sten@@ cil folder with the button base folder in dialogue . select the folder in which you have copied the template files . these settings will be set for the next start . &quot;
&quot; after the root folder for the sten@@ cils has been set in a building of building , which is reflected by the folder structure of the sten@@ cil . the selection of a folder updates the preview of the template . &quot;
under the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the enlargement factor and the position of your image .
&quot; enlarge : this button increased the dar@@ ed image . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; smaller : this button res@@ ized the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you need to get the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
move this button to move the image below to move under the template . take the image and place it at the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your image . the image is then adapted automatic of the thumb@@ nails .
&amp; digi@@ tization ; provides three different tool for dy@@ eing . each of you has its advantages in other fields .
&quot; shar@@ pen is a traditional tool for shar@@ pen@@ ing . it is very fast and simple , but produces especially in dark areas , gra@@ zing images . &quot;
un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing mask works on the contrast of the edges to look like a picture . actually doing it works rather psych@@ ovis@@ ual Dun@@ st and it makes it a really good job . the algorithm has been taken from Gimp and it is protected by W@@ inst@@ on Chang .
&quot; focuss@@ ing is possibly the best of the three , since he really improves the shar@@ p@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters to adapt . &quot;
photos without focus as well as most digi@@ tised images need a correction of shar@@ p@@ ulation . this is the same as the dissolution of a colour point . this in turn leads to a common color combined . SLR cameras do normally need more retro@@ spec@@ ulation as normal cameras for the private application .
&quot; with JPEG @-@ images , it is often applied to a camera internal shar@@ p@@ ulation . images in the raw format , must always be used during processing . &quot;
&quot; some scanner turn a circular filter already during the reading of the image . if you de@@ activate this , you get the control of your picture . &quot;
in some situations you can get usable results by shar@@ ply a photo with the shar@@ pen@@ ing value . this allows you to access the menu item with the menu item .
&quot; you should deal with however , however , because the results are not very natural : the shar@@ pen@@ ing of the edges , but also enhances the smo@@ ked technology to shar@@ pen the tool . in general , you can gain further information and a comparison of all techniques for shar@@ pen@@ ing . &quot;
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ ack@@ ly . the solution to record the image is much easier than to shar@@ pen . use the tool for soft signs using the menu entry using the menu item and experiment something with settings . the preview pane on the right side of the dialog box shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter in@@ sharp mas@@ king is a very good tool to remove sand@@ ing from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and the preview will help you edit the image . the default case shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the standard values produce often good results and should be tried first . an increase in the radius or the amount to increase the effect . if you create the un@@ shar@@ p@@ ent mask , become smo@@ kers and the impression of gray in the vicinity of sharp edges . &quot;
the radius represents how many pixels have been affected on each side of a channel by the filters . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . you should therefore take pictures at best in their final resolution .
&quot; the amount represents the percentage of the original one of the original , and the original image will be added to the original . this becomes the strength of the shar@@ p@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; the tail value is a fraction of the maximum R@@ GB value and the applicable difference amount . one can thus define a minimum difference between the pots , and hence beauty error in faces , He@@ av@@ ens and water surfaces . &quot;
this is an example of the bl@@ ur@@ red filter . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and the edited image that has been applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a tail value = 0.0 . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ tization came ; tools Re@@ focus ref@@ us@@ ates an image by improving the har@@ p . it used to use the protected folding filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
&quot; this tool seeks a picture to &amp; quot ; ref@@ ok@@ us@@ sier@@ en@@ quot ; in which it makes the defect . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener filtering . this is using a technique called FI@@ R Wiener filtering . you can start using a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ ters . you can start using a technique called FI@@ R Wiener filtering . you can launch it from the menu by moving colors re@@ focuss@@ ed in the editing process . &quot;
&quot; in practice the circular fur works much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche barrel . the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche barrel has a very long tail , which is dependent on the original pixel , which is far from original pixel . the FI@@ R Wiener In@@ verse of Gau@@ ß is influenced in most cases even very strongly influenced by the remote pixel . the causes unwanted results . &quot;
circular shell@@ ac : this is the radius of the circular fur . it is the most important parameter to use this module . for most pictures the default value should put 1 good results . you can put a higher value if your image is very bl@@ ur@@ red then but then to Hei@@ ligen@@ chers .
cor@@ relation : an increase in the cor@@ relation can help reduce arti@@ facts . the cor@@ relation can be chosen by 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0,5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the cor@@ relation reduces the shar@@ ply effect of the module . &quot;
&quot; diamond filters : an increase in the smoke filters can help you reduce arti@@ facts . however , values are higher than 0,@@ 1 rarely helpful . however , values are higher than 0,@@ 1 rarely . however , the image quality is very poor . a high value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value is still further sm@@ ear@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche shell@@ ac : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche shell@@ ac . this parameter may be caused by a previously un@@ veil@@ ed filter . in most cases , you should use this value to 0 to get a value zero , so you might also have to increase the cor@@ relation and / or the smoke filter . &quot;
&quot; size : this value determines the size of the trans@@ ation@@ sm@@ atri@@ x . an increase in the mat size can generate good results , especially if you choose great value for the circular archipelago or the pal@@ ate &apos;s archipelago . in most cases , you should choose a value in the area of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
&quot; the saving as and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focus parameter you set , will then be saved for later and can then be loaded . &quot;
&quot; try all the cuts , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the picture before you use the module . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , you should use the module before you change the image elsewhere . the reason for this is that much surgical changes are not immediately visible are not immediately visible , but the later un@@ enjoyable art@@ e@@ facts left . &quot;
&quot; if you read and comp@@ ress pictures , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed picture . &quot;
&quot; in general , un@@ sharp mask produce better results as shar@@ pen@@ ing . this could be caused by this , bl@@ ur@@ red mask is used as shar@@ pen@@ ing a larger neighborhood . &quot;
&quot; theoretically , however , you have to generate un@@ sharp mask . even under optimal conditions it is never possible to remove the effect of un@@ shar@@ pen . it is practically the result of the FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ ters always at least as good as the un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing mask . the FI@@ R Wiener Filter is often better in the processing of small details . &quot;
&quot; below you can see a comparison between the different filters , on a small un@@ focused picture : &quot;
the original un@@ sharp colour image has to be corrected . this picture was done with a analogue camera . the un@@ focused outcome is attribut@@ able to insufficient light for the car focus lin@@ se .
&quot; for more information on the methods of the shar@@ pen@@ ing process in digital pictures , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address . &quot;
the regul@@ ars sets the un@@ shar@@ p@@ ity of the area of the tight@@ ening to create a natural pump .
&quot; the po@@ inte enables a customized color for the P@@ up@@ ille . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can adjust this here . &quot;
the tool image error correction is one of the most widely developed tool to remove not desired arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ painting algorithm has been developed by the IM@@ AG@@ E team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains various pres@@ ets as star@@ points to simplify the restoration . the available pres@@ ets are listed below :
&quot; if you want to adjust the filter settings for a adjust , you can use the tab Gl@@ ati@@ fication and advanced settings . &quot;
&quot; detailed post@@ ure p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the maintenance of the details . a small value leads to an even more homogen@@ eous regions . a value of 0,@@ 9 should be given so much more homogen@@ eous regions . a value of 0,@@ 9 should be given so far . please note the detailed assessment of the judges should always be sub@@ ordin@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; Set @-@ dependent Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value equ@@ es in all directions , while a value is close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a film shot , or CCD ru@@ stling will produce a high value of w@@ avy pattern . JPEG arti@@ facts are best possible at a value in the vicinity of 1 . &quot;
&quot; smooth@@ ed &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum gly@@ col factor above all . put this value adapted to the degree of smoke in your image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects greater structures . the higher this value is necessary , the more it is necessary , as it is difficult to value the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s tur@@ mo@@ or@@ bit more effective than 3 . &quot;
re@@ peti@@ tions : there is how often the algorithm run is running . normally there is 1 or 2 .
&quot; angle @-@ source , da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ ot@@ rop@@ en Alpha . if Alpha is chosen , it should also be small to generate a long term . you should therefore choose this value as greatest possible and acceptable to your needs . &quot;
&quot; integral part &#91; 0,@@ 1 , 10 &#93; : integral part in pixels . you should avoid the value of smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel glasses and never exceed 2 . &quot;
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation use : the More quality you get through the choice of this option is only low . it doubled but the running time . we recommend it to allow him to allow him to happen .
the buttons Save as and charging exactly this . any setting of image errors can be saved into a text file and be loaded later .
&quot; correct fl@@ aw is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can still take a long time and a high CPU load to move . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button drop . &quot;
below you can see how image error with small arti@@ facts can be corrected . the module is done on a photo that was created in Guatemala City with a analogue camera . as you see there is an intr@@ insi@@ c black arti@@ fact that was caused by a poor film storage during the trip . the original picture is under ( 1 ) see and the corrected picture under ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ tization came ; smo@@ ker is a very powerful tool to reduce imaging . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Peter H@@ eck@@ ert .
&quot; this tool makes sel@@ ectable image filters available to remove spots and other arti@@ facts , e.g. from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor joints from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ ography ; effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines . &quot;
&quot; if you need further information on Sensor@@ ro@@ ads of digital cameras , so you can read it in English in this tutorial . &quot;
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene which was made with a digital camera and high ISO sensitivity . it shows a qu@@ aint noise which can be successfully removed with this tool .
&quot; in the following , you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases you only need the sub@@ window details and the sub@@ window advanced settings can remain with the default settings . &quot;
&quot; radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) up to 20 ( 41@@ x@@ 41 ) which is needed for the filter . large values increase the time the filters per pixel and can move the image into it through the image and the color in it , and therefore smaller mistakes . &quot;
&quot; shar@@ pen@@ ing : controls the bucket sp@@ acing . this value sets the pixel sp@@ acing off the filter , when it is increased , the adap@@ tive filter photo details does not need to get rid of the edges , the adap@@ tive filter photo details do not get more and rou@@ gh@@ ing or lubri@@ cation occurs . &quot;
&quot; edges : controls the cant@@ on precision for the har@@ ness . this value enhances the frequency response . if it is too strong , not the entire noise can be removed or smo@@ ker . put it on a value close to the maximum , if you want to remove an exc@@ eed@@ ingly smoking or JPEG art@@ e@@ facts without losing details . &quot;
lumin@@ ance : controlled the lumin@@ ance of the image . we recommend you either colour or lumin@@ ance to change a picture . these settings do not control the smooth@@ ing process of the details and settings .
color : controlled the color @-@ toler@@ ances of the image . we recommend you either colour or lumin@@ ance to change a picture . these settings do not control the smooth@@ ing process of the details and settings .
&quot; GAMMA : controls the gam@@ mat@@ ernity of the image . this value can be used to increase the toler@@ ances of the dark areas , which are typically stronger , however , too . he also pollution the sl@@ ats . &quot;
&quot; damp@@ ing : controlled the adjustment of the leading edge stability . this value defined as quickly the adap@@ tive filter radius on variations of the lumin@@ ance is re@@ acted . if it is increased , the edges can occur . if he is too high , the edges and Phas@@ el@@ j@@ itters appear to the edges . he can remove qu@@ itting off the edges and is the recommended method for it . &quot;
&quot; save under and loading : these buttons are used exactly for it . all parameters for pre@@ dat@@ ors , which you have set , can be stored in the fil@@ es@@ ystem and later loaded . &quot;
this is an example of how drugs can change your life . the original picture is lab@@ eled with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) and the corrected with the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cr@@ ack@@ ly for your purpose . the solution to draw the picture a little soft to shar@@ pen is fortunately much easier than a picture . use the tool for soft signs using the menu item below shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ tization came ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most widely developed tools to reduce photo sets .
&quot; this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted art@@ e@@ facts . it is very well adapted to dive into digital , original or retro@@ fitted digital mistakes that takes place along the image cont@@ ours , and thus receives the content as it is also the human eye . &quot;
the same algorithm can be used for color and tex@@ tures . the tex@@ tual composition is developed with another tool , the image error correction , carried out by the IM@@ AG@@ E team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
&quot; JPEG Ar@@ te@@ fak@@ te reduce the compression from JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away . as a loss@@ less compres@@ sion@@ ists , it creates some compression &amp; quot ; art@@ e@@ facts ; - small standards that can be seen in un@@ compressed picture . this setting should correct this problem . &quot;
the buttons Save as and charging make exactly this . any setting of photo restoration can be saved into a text file and be loaded later .
photo restoration is relatively very fast at work . but it can still take a long time and a high CPU load to move . you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time with the button finish .
below you can reduce how a photo with equality is being restored .. The module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the re@@ mun@@ eration film on the faces . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the corrected can be seen under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of photo restoration . this time tex@@ tures has been read on an old colour photo which have been read with a scanner which has been caused by the Sc@@ ann@@ er@@ lighting and the photo ap@@ ier . the original picture is under ( 1 ) see and the corrected picture under ( 2 ) .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ tization came ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows the shot of photos that have been removed with a CCD camera according to eight . it uses algorithms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pix@@ i project , which are protected by Martin Dick@@ op@@ p . &quot;
bright , dead or hot pixel are especially high @-@ quality raw mode photos a problem since many cameras with JPEG compression over an built @-@ in oppression for hot pixels . &quot;
&quot; this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark picture sub@@ tract method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels . &quot;
download this file into the wizard with the button dark image . the tool becomes automatic the hot and bright pixel . these are highlighted in the picture show .
&quot; if you have an old digital camera , it is important that you can start the dark picture directly following the connection to discover new hot or bright pixel by CCD defects . &quot;
&quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should download the suitable dark picture to the corrected image . an automatic processing of the dark picture will notice the bad pixel and will automatically re@@ locate this automatically during the next meeting . &quot;
the image range and the preview can help you correct within the image . the preview pane shows the output of the filter with the current settings . poor pixel are raised in all pre@@ ant@@ ment .
select an area around the def@@ ective pixel on the preview and the results of the filter . select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ish these pixels .
Dur@@ ing : it is identified an average of the neighbour pixels . the resulting colour will be assigned to all def@@ ective pixels on the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels have drag@@ ged a distance of 1 from Pix@@ el@@ block ( 2 @-@ DI@@ M ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ DI@@ M ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ DI@@ M ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ishing pixel in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance from 2 or less to the pix@@ el@@ block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ DI@@ M ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ DI@@ M ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ DI@@ M ) and then used to inter@@ pol@@ ish the pixel in the block .
spher@@ ical : all pixel with a distance of 3 or less will be drawn to calculate a bi @-@ ku@@ bian surface ( 2 @-@ DI@@ M ) or a group of Cu@@ b curves ( 1 @-@ DI@@ M ) which then used to inter@@ pol@@ ishing pixel in the block .
&quot; below you can view the hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , taken out of a broken digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long expos@@ ures that has been applied to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected picture is under ( 2 ) to see . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ tization came ; Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ fications , is a tool to correct the Vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. under@@ lined corners , one image to correct . &quot;
&quot; cru@@ el lenses , especially those in the middle and large photo format , can often illumin@@ ate the whole sensor range not even the whole sensor range . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( sh@@ ook ) they reduce the corners and ra@@ ils of the image by reducing the light that the sensor can be reached there . Tele@@ objective point under circumstances also this behavior . &quot;
&quot; however , he also has dis@@ advantages . many Center filters require a factor 1.5 or 2 with the Bl@@ ending filter , which it is impossible to keep the camera with the hand . long win@@ ec@@ tives should also use with center filter , an opening of f / 16 or small , as otherwise un@@ shar@@ p@@ est effects caused by motion . &quot;
&quot; with the large exposure areas of today &apos;s filtration and the color or gra@@ zing field of digital camera cameras and film scanner , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of a Center@@ filter by using an equivalent adjustment to a painting filter on a picture . the algorithm is protected by John Walker . &quot;
&quot; with three shelves , you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ fications filter , and with three other the exposure of the target image . &quot;
&quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of the largest density . the standard density is 2,@@ 0 , what an optical filter with a light@@ ening set of 1 , or acci@@ dentally compens@@ ated for the density to compens@@ ate for a bigger degree of Vig@@ net@@ ting , reduce it to compens@@ ate for a small degree . &quot;
&quot; lumin@@ ous , contrast and gam@@ ma settings : the Edit of an image with the Vig@@ net@@ ting correc@@ tions reduces the lumin@@ osity of the pixel . you need to adjust the exposure of the target with these options . the regul@@ ators provide only positive values as you only have to increase the settings . &quot;
if you want a fine re @-@ tuning of the target image so let the values for fluor@@ escent / double / gam@@ ma with zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ tization came ; image processing from the menu color Gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ tic correction to an image . the original picture ( 1 ) shows the Vig@@ net@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image . a lumin@@ ous sc@@ ary and contra@@ sting correc@@ tions was also carried out in the image using this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ tization came ; Lin@@ sen@@ ver@@ stri@@ d is a tool to correct the effect of spher@@ ical lenses to photos . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by David Ho@@ d@@ son .
&quot; this tool works with geomet@@ ric distor@@ tions . colour distor@@ tions can not be corrected with this tool . &quot;
the co@@ efficient of the second gradient deals with the general geomet@@ ric fast@@ ening of the lens and can correct the con@@ cave or con@@ dense form of the image .
&quot; the co@@ efficient of the third gradient has a similar circular effect , fl@@ acht , but at the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool . &quot;
&quot; the co@@ efficient fourth gradient fixed the distant corners to the second gradient . if you combine these two , any geomet@@ ric distor@@ tion almost eliminated . &quot;
&quot; generally , this value controls the strength of the distor@@ tion second gradient . with negative values can be corrected and positive values can be corrected and positive values . &quot;
&quot; corner : this value controls the strength of the distor@@ tion fourth gradient . this value acts stronger than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &quot; Four Corners &quot; has been the sign of the parameter . &quot;
zoom : this value completes the image size and thereby results a correction first gradient through . negative values are increased while positive the image size .
&quot; this value adjust the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values they increase . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best filter settings , illustrated the dialog with a preview the distor@@ tion correc@@ tions . the values you use for your image will be saved and used at the next start as standard . &quot;
the continuous or soft correction should be carried out before all the cuts or size changes . best do you perform this correction as all the first . if you want to cut a picture and then perform a detailed correction would be the effect on the fal@@ sely .
&quot; to help you find the best correction to help you find this tool a vertical and a horizontal relief line . move it to an important place , such as the marine or a building wall , in your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines on this spot . afterwards you can correct the depth of the lines with the help of the lines . &quot;
&quot; if you correct a vertical break@@ down , the resul@@ t@@ ant picture will have black corners . you can transform them with the cutting edge tool in the menu , cut out of image processing or via the zoom regul@@ ator of this dialogue . &quot;
&quot; for most pictures , the depth of images ranges from the front . the next logical step for some moti@@ fs such as recordings from the front , frame and paintings , it is the perspective so correct the all angle in the image 90 degrees . note that if you keep the camera with your hand , you will always keep an easy distor@@ tion of the perspective . &quot;
this is an example of the mounting correction can be applied to a church in Norway . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the corrected picture under ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to sim@@ ulate infr@@ ared film by the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u@@ .org website that is accessible from this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ infr@@ a film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
in the left side of the window you can select the area for the preview . if you can move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the image .
&quot; beneath the Pre@@ view , you can sim@@ ulate two parameters and want to sim@@ ulate film cinem@@ as if you want to sim@@ ulate the texture texture of a high sensitive film and the domin@@ ance of colour green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in the transformation . green meadows are white as snow ! &quot;
&quot; since the filter colour channels to reproduce by infr@@ ared film , particularly the green channel makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white pictures , as the color information is missing . &quot;
this is an example of infr@@ ared fil@@ me@@ ff@@ ing applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original picture is set under ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film has been set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a kind of au@@ ra in the sh@@ utter .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ tization came ; filter cinem@@ as is an easy to use tool to reproduce film drawing on your pictures . this is known by classic high @-@ speed filters such as the B / W Ko@@ dak Tr@@ i @-@ X , known . to increase the sensitivity of films by the manufacturer great silver @-@ maker of photographs . &quot;
&quot; the film effects of your photo gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . if you want this special , Galerie @-@ like , roadmap photograph@@ ed , watching photos especially in your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ men photos , so you need to use this filter . &quot;
&quot; with the regul@@ ator , the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ularity of the bask@@ ets . the default value is , although often higher values needed , on ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need more bask@@ ets , so you can apply the filter several times . &quot;
this is an example of film production effects on a black / white image . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and the edited film@@ maker corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ tization came ; filter oil painting creates the appearance of a oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ tization came ; filter oil painting gives your digital images a nice look like a oil painting . natural pictures and bre@@ ast@@ feeding is good for this effect .
there are two regul@@ ator to influence this effect . the upper chosen the brush size between one and five out . thick@@ er brush are suitable for large images . smooth@@ ed the sliding or , from the other side , the hin@@ ge . &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original picture is marked with the ( 1 ) and the original is marked with ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixel large picture is 1 and Gl@@ pu@@ te 17 .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ tization came ; filter coal @-@ drawing is used color and Int@@ ent gra@@ dations to create a Kohl@@ esk@@ iz@@ ze in the drawing . it &apos;s helpful if you would like to imagine what scene you chose to play . this would be good pictures to begin with it . &quot;
&quot; there are two regul@@ ators with a value of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper regul@@ ator select the tab@@ ern@@ acle , and the double adjust the contrast ( gl@@ ed ) . &quot;
this is an example of the cohesion filters . original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used . the result can be further improved through adaptation of the int@@ ment value .
the &amp; digi@@ tization came ; filter engraving is your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was stolen in wax . it uses a copyright protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ tization came , filter engraving is a fast tool to return your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with images with a simple structure where colour is not the most important part of the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity , to transform the image into a grey , mon@@ ial landscape . &quot;
&quot; the depth allows the contrast of the filtration . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting . &quot;
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the edited image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an art work by means of distor@@ tion effects . it uses protected algorithms by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave @-@ blocks 1 : spl@@ its the image into cells and let it look as if it is considered by glass blocks .
shaft poles 2 : analog to the shaft loc@@ s 1 is distor@@ ted the picture here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can break these effects anytime with the button finish .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an art work by means of inj@@ ure effects . it uses protected algorithms by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
&quot; zoom &quot; &quot; zoom in the image along with a central point . this sim@@ ulates the un@@ shar@@ p@@ ity a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of often in sport photography . &quot;
radi@@ al un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing : de@@ activate the image by rotation of the pixels by a central point . this sim@@ ulates the un@@ shar@@ p@@ ouring of a rotating camera .
removal in@@ estim@@ ation : bl@@ ur@@ ged the picture to generate the effect of a not focused camera . the object appears to be back in the background .
&quot; movement of movement : bl@@ ur@@ ances the image by horizontal movements of the pixels . this sim@@ ulates the un@@ shar@@ p@@ ity of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photograph@@ ing , camera . &quot;
&quot; soft in@@ shar@@ pen : knowing the image soft in the dark tones , and strong in the bright killing . this creates photos with a dre@@ aming and gloss @-@ focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portra@@ its , gl@@ am@@ our photos or to adding a warm and subtle Gl@@ üh@@ ens . &quot;
shar@@ pen@@ dic@@ tive : bl@@ ur@@ ged the picture by random shifting of the pixel and sim@@ ulate the un@@ shar@@ p@@ ouring of a different moving camera .
intelligent imm@@ u@@ ity : finds the color @-@ bas@@ ins in the picture and escap@@ es this without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : shares the photo into rectangular cells and then creates it through filling with an average pixel value .
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time with the button finish .
the regul@@ ators are a nice little tool to make regul@@ ating on your picture . thus it gives natural your images a n@@ asses appearance . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n protected algorithm .
&quot; comfort size allows the size of the drop to change . as the dro@@ pl@@ et size is not automatic with the size of the image , it is often necessary to reduce the size and density of drops . fishing changes the optical effect of drop in the image . &quot;
&quot; you can stop using the &amp; digi@@ tization ; image processing a area free of reg@@ ent@@ ails . use the choice tool to stay the area , e.g. a face , which will stay free to stay . if you then install the filter regul@@ ators , the area will remain free of regul@@ ators . &quot;
this is an example of reg@@ ent@@ ails filtering . the original picture ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the edited image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the standard values were used for this example .
&quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , so you can bring it through mir@@ rors or turning into the right orientation . the tools can be found in the menu transform@@ ing or transform@@ ing mir@@ rors . &quot;
photo bu@@ b@@ bles is definitely one of the most widely developed tools to enlarge a photo with a minimum loss of image quality .
a picture to smaller is simple . the big question is simple . the big question is how you can find a picture and describe the details ? how can you find the missing information again ? how can you find the missing information again or guess here ? how can you see the missing information again or guess here ? how can you see the missing information again ? how can you see the missing information again ? how can you see the missing information again ? how can you see the missing information again ? how can you see the missing information again . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size using the tool size . select to change size in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is below to see .
&quot; the tool to change the size uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method , to enlarge the pixels . if you want a small image with a better quality , then try the tool for fl@@ ection . &quot;
many imaging programs use a type of inter@@ pol@@ ation for example Spl@@ ine Inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; digi@@ tization came ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm has been developed by IM@@ AG@@ E team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you must tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in the rider New size and are listed below :
&quot; aspect rati@@ os : if this setting is activated , when entering the new size the aspect ratio of the original image is maintained . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is necessary , the more it is necessary , as it is difficult to produce the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s tur@@ mo@@ or@@ bit more effective than 3 . &quot;
the buttons Save as and shop will be used exactly as text file saved as text file and be loaded later .
&quot; photo bu@@ b@@ bles is very fast with what it does , but it can still take a long time and a high CPU load to move . you can break the calculation at any time with the button finish . &quot;
you can see below an example of photo bu@@ b@@ bles by selecting a small color picture on the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) is the result of linear standard enlargement .
&quot; the cutting of a photo is not only a common operation , but also a commonly under@@ estimated tool to create a picture . image processing allows you to create a photo with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and drag the case , then you will see this rect@@ angle while you move the mouse . &quot;
&quot; once you leave the mouse button again , the area of the photo will be cut off . this gives you a good overview of how your photo will look after cutting . you can change the size of the object by clicking on the corners of the holder . a new rect@@ angle create it simply by clicking on the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the detail , you will use the button button in the tool button and the photo is tailored ( C@@ trl . + X ) . use the file saving or file save under the menu file to save the newly arranged photo . &quot;
&quot; in the preview area , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog . &quot;
&quot; in the tool after aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as a high @-@ format or cross @-@ format . in high format , the larger value of height and width is assigned to the width of the width . &quot;
&quot; the tool to cutting aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same , regardless of whether you can use cen@@ tim@@ eters , in@@ ch or any other physical size . you can also see below a list of traditional sizes for photographers and their aspect ratio . &quot;
at the right end of the dialogue there are two buttons to run the selection automatically horizont@@ ally or ver@@ tically .
&quot; in the dialog box you can use the Max . relation to the area to cut the maximum possible , depending on the chosen conversion and orientation . &quot;
&quot; the tool after si@@ le ratio cut its settings depending on the orientation ( horizont@@ ally or ver@@ tically ) . if you use the password for the next time , these settings are displayed as standard values depending on orientation . the modified image measurements are reflected in the EX@@ IF data , so that the EX@@ IF data are reflected in the original image and not the original image . &quot;
the settings of the comp@@ elling assistance allow help to hide your images better . these help are :
&quot; harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic particles are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third el@@ bow , harmonious tri@@ angles are an opportunity to share a rect@@ angle in similar harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles . &quot;
Golden center : the golden center is a division that is on different natural growth sm@@ u@@ ster such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us pussy or the flower@@ sheets of a sun@@ flower . it emerges in all sorts of things that we are considered beautiful .
&quot; the golden division is the ir@@ rational number 1,6@@ 18@@ 03@@ 39@@ 88 ... and you already used to construct your temple and pyram@@ ids , making your pictures , building and even photos together to give your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number leads from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i eps . 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 34 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 34 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 34 , 21 , 21 , 34 , 21 , 21 , 34 , 21 , 21 , 34 , 21 , 21 , 34 , 21 , 21 , 34 , 21 , 21 , 34 , 21 , 21 , 34 , 21 , 21 , 34 , 21 , 21 , 34 , 21 , 21 , 34 , 21 , 21 , 34 , 8 , 8 , 8 , 8 , 8 , 8 , 8 , 8 , 8 , 8 , 8 , 8 , 8 , 8 , 8 , 8 , 8 , 8 , 8 , 8 , 8 , 8 , 8 , 8 , 8 , 8 , 8 , 8 , 8 , 8 , 8 , 8 , 8 , 8 , 8 , 8 , 8 , 8 , 8 , 8 , 8 , 8 , 8 , 8 , 8 , 8 , 8 , 8 , 8 , 8 , 8 , 8 , 8 , 8 , 8 , 8 , 8 , 8 , 8 , 8 , 8 ,
the golden center provides fluid auxiliary lines when you put a picture together . these help are en@@ umer@@ ated below :
&quot; the Golden Spir@@ ale will bring you good results to your photos closer to your photos . compared to third el@@ rain , the Golden Spir@@ al creates a liquid line with the view along the spiral along the spiral and creates a symmet@@ rical visual flow . &quot;
&quot; a further rule is the rect@@ angle of the golden sand@@ als , also called golden rect@@ angle . this justification should be used to create the golden spiral . this can be a line or different objects . this one can simply be there without the eye there will be his task . &quot;
&quot; the golden tri@@ angles also lead themselves from the top of the sides of the golden rect@@ angle . note that in contrast to harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are no equ@@ in@@ sight@@ ed tri@@ angles . di@@ agon@@ als do not place the same object of dynam@@ ical object . &quot;
if you use golden tri@@ angles to finish your frame create a effect of professional photo plac@@ eable dynamic symmet@@ ry . try your photo focal points on one of the cutting points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve differently .
the options horizont@@ ally mirror and ver@@ tically reflect can be used to reflect the harmon@@ ic divi@@ ders .
&quot; with the button color , you can set the color of the aid lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the aid lines can be invisible . this way you can customize the color of the lines of your current image . &quot;
the Free Rot@@ ation is a tool to rot@@ ate a picture to any angle .
&quot; if you make a photo , then it happens easily that you don &apos;t keep the camera exactly vertical or horizont@@ ally . this creates an image where things got a corner . you can repair this with the &amp; digi@@ tization . you can transform this free rotation and adjust the target angle . &quot;
turn your picture with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this sli@@ ders are specified in degrees . with the Button settings you can set the sli@@ der back to 0 degrees . a preview of the screen@@ shot is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture are shown on the right .
&quot; to help your help is the module Free Rot@@ ation a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse cursor into the image show around the two lines , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now , adjust the angles as described in previous sections . &quot;
&quot; after having made a picture , you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . an opportunity to repair it is the function transform@@ ing cutting from the editing process . &quot;
an elegant way to cut the image is the function Autom@@ atically cutting . choose one of the following options :
the option Anti @-@ Ali@@ asing smooth@@ es the image a bit after rotation . take note of the above warning .
all per@@ spec@@ tiv@@ ical transform@@ ations are performed by a fix@@ ation of the so @-@ mentioned reference point . this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red square rate on the corners of your image . the preview is then automatically calculated . on the right side of the dialogue you will find some information which can help you to change the perspective :
&quot; new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
&quot; new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
angle left above : displays the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed area .
angle on the right side : displays the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed area .
angle on the left below : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle on the right bottom : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
&quot; after adjustment of perspective , the image becomes a little pollution . for a single adaptation it is small , but two adjustments create a twice as powerful effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
&quot; after you adapted the perspective , you get unwanted tri@@ angular holes on the corners . an opportunity to ber@@ some is it the image with transform@@ ing cutting from the editing process . &quot;
&quot; the replacement tool is used to move a part of the image into a direction and move the other part into the opposite . a horizontal sh@@ ear , e.g. the upper part of the picture is turned to the right and the lower part to the left . this is no rotation , the picture is distor@@ ted into a parall@@ el@@ gram . you can transform this module to transform sc@@ iss@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; choose your picture by using the horizontal angle and the vertical angle . you can push horizont@@ ally and vertical simultaneously . if you press on preferences , the angles are displayed on zero . a preview of the effect will be shown to you and the new dimensions of the destination will be shown on the right of the preview area . &quot;
&quot; to your help , a vertical and a horizontal line appears . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the template to adjust your image . &quot;
&quot; after you have carried out the sh@@ ear , the image becomes a bit more ridicul@@ ous . for a single sh@@ ear , this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two sl@@ ings generated twice as much as cl@@ amping and therefore you should avoid this . &quot;
&quot; after sh@@ ear , the image has un@@ beautiful tri@@ angular holes in the corners . an opportunity to eliminate it is the image with transform@@ ing cutting out of the image processing . &quot;
&quot; and digi@@ tization ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write formats , therefore depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries are comp@@ ili@@ ated . in most distribu@@ tions you will get a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ tization . &quot;
&quot; due to this dependence of other libraries , it is impossible to give a list of all available file formats on its system . however , you will always find JPEG and TIFF . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ tization ; displays only files in formats to which knows . this happens based on the file extension and a comparison of this with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension came into the list , the file expan@@ sion@@ ing is provided ; you can change this list of file extensions the &amp; digi@@ tization ; in the section configuration you will find more information . &quot;
nearly all digital camera cameras save photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras allow you to select the format . a detailed description of these file formats can be found in the Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ tization came ; supports both formats .
compression is the application of data pres@@ sion@@ ers to digital pictures . these are redund@@ ant information in order to save the image data to a more efficient way .
&quot; JPEG 2000 is also supported . generally , there are better , smooth results than JPEG to the same compression dis@@ proportionate . the 2000@@ s version can also save losses if this is specified in the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to learn more about the raw format , so you can read under Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in colour . you can convert raw image images in JPEG or TIFF with the pipe converter from &amp; digi@@ tization ; in the section configuration you will find more information about the use of modules with &amp; digi@@ tization ; &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ tization came ; supports the loading of raw materials only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is supported in &amp; digi@@ tization ; this table below shows more than 200 raw material formats . all support cameras can be seen below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw materials that came from &amp; digi@@ tization ; &quot;
many digital camera cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are frequently saved in the A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . however , it &apos;s not a movie work program , but it does not have a film load to display or edit them ; the &amp; KDE ; settings to play movies to play the program to play . &quot;

&quot; if you change the steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well if the initial contrast was very good , then you can perform the first four steps with the module white . &quot;
many tools you need the photographs you need in &amp; digi@@ tization ; your description follows here .
&quot; all imaging tools such as shar@@ pen@@ ing , soft@@ ens , pun@@ ching , bl@@ ur@@ ances , bl@@ ur@@ ances , bl@@ ur@@ ances , which shows the effect in a preview pane before the filter is applied to the current image . below you see &amp; quot ; texture application user @-@ quot ; in this dialog : &quot;
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter on the current image . links of him allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
&quot; ver@@ tically share without duplic@@ ate . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area right of the selected p@@ ant@@ ment . &quot;
horizontal sharing each horizontal without duplic@@ ate . the upper range shows the original and the under@@ ne@@ e displays the filter applied to the area below the chosen ant@@ enn@@ bar .
&quot; ver@@ tically divide the left side , the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter . &quot;
the upper range shows the original and the lower compared to the effect of the filter .
&quot; mouse over &apos; -@@ style : shows the preview when the mouse is not in the preview area , and otherwise the original . &quot;
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can switch to over@@ - and exposure to show . the used colors can be adjusted in the general settings site .
( 3 ) : the frame for the selection of the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the image and paste it to the part of the image . the preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
&quot; ( 5 ) : in the left corner of the corner , here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons on your default levels . all the adjustable from the last use of the module are measured . &quot;
the side@@ bar features shows the essential information about the selected picture and is largely explained . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo characteristics : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos . these data come from EX@@ IF data when it is available .
this tab provides an intuitive card search tool based on the Mar@@ ble @-@ Mini@@ ature range . you can drag and move with the mouse wheel . press C@@ trl ; lin@@ ker mouse button to pull a square . all pictures within this coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . this is naturally ahead of your pictures Ge@@ o data .
&amp; _ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pall@@ ets files . the application can be used for editing colour pal@@ ettes and to select and use colors .
&quot; the pall@@ ets files , which are installed by &amp; KDE ; can either be installed for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case they are in your personal folder for &amp; KDE ; -@@ settings and hot user @-@ defined color and connecting colors . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog box , they can select from a list of installed pall@@ ets or search the folder to files . &quot;
the cursor is displayed in the pall@@ et view as a line . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
it shows on the colour in addition . the color is described below the pall@@ et view . here can also be changed the color name .
&quot; it can also be used to use . to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cursor . then move the mouse over the left lin@@ ker mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if the connector box is enabled under the button color , the color is inserted from the color plate at the cursor . the color is either inserted or over@@ write a different ; depending on whether the mode over@@ write is selected . this mode you can set by writing the An@@ xi@@ feld over@@ write under Bei@@ m cursor . &quot;
&quot; a selection , which was created as described in the last section , can be used together with the actions of copying , cut and paste . &quot;
&quot; for each colour , the following format for data in the clip@@ board : for each colour three values for the propor@@ tions of red , green and blue and an optional colour name , followed by a line character , if another color follows . if one color is followed in the clip@@ board , these can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ download ; &quot;
the colours in the range and output of the colours can be drag@@ ged with the mouse .
you can choose a color somewhere on the screen and then select it in the shade on the left .
&quot; &amp; graph@@ viewer ; is a KDE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ s ; programs are free layout programmes . graphics programs are used in science , especially in science , especially in computer science . so far , there was no modern &amp; GUI ; programs to visualize graphics &amp; X11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with just a few functions . &quot;
the &amp; graphic viewer ; the project has set itself the goal to replace these programs by a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; KDE ; program .
&amp; Co @-@ graph@@ viewer ; is a KDE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ s ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graphic elements ; displays graph@@ s with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; KDE ; -@@ program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; K@@ ate ; and &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of graph@@ s in &amp; K@@ ate ; the graph is newly charged and in &amp; graph@@ viewer ; )
menu to open the graph@@ s in &amp; K@@ ate ; to open or graph@@ ite in &amp; ch@@ graph@@ viewer ; in a &amp; K@@ ate ; component to open
load of large graph@@ s ( currently there are problems from approximately 1000 k@@ not@@ s and a h@@ ack to represent more than this k@@ not@@ s )
&quot; further required software : &amp; ch@@ graph@@ viewer ; is a &amp; KDE ; -@@ program , which sets the &amp; graphic ; tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of graph@@ s are required in detail : &quot;
&quot; the main window displays the opened graph@@ s , each in an own sub@@ window . initially , if you start &amp; graph@@ viewer ; without an argument is the main window open as in the bottom screen . in this case , the tool displays the icon open and the ( empty ) list . click on the first symbol to open the dialog file . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected one or more &amp; dot ; -@@ files selected , the main window looks like in the bottom of the screen@@ shot : &quot;
&quot; as you can see , an overview in the corner is displayed when the Grap@@ h is bigger than the character area . you can select a fixed position of this list or select this position automatically . &quot;
&quot; the mouse wheel ( high and r@@ under without special keys , left and right with penet@@ rated &amp; Alt ; -@@ button ) ; &quot;
the zoom is in both directions by the factor 10 . below you will see the maximum reduction of a graph .
&quot; if the file is currently in &amp; graph@@ viewer ; downloaded file from another program , the following window will be displayed : &quot;
&quot; you can choose whether the Grap@@ h is to be re@@ loaded , or if you want to ignore the change . &amp; _ graph@@ viewer ; can make your decision later on , so that later as well as proceedings . if you want to change your decision later , you can set the menu item Settings ; set up , see also . &quot;
&quot; if you open a graph file outside an ongoing &amp; ch@@ graph@@ viewer ; -@@ instance , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; graph@@ viewer ; -@@ instance you want to present a new &amp; graphical graph@@ s in an under@@ window of already running instance . &quot;
&quot; as with the last option , you can permanently save your choice but also change it with the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; at the program start , you can open all graph@@ s of your last session again . again , you can save your choice both and later . &quot;
you can also specify how the graphics will be divided to several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be chosen freely .
&quot; if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graphics are to be found on a page , on this page will be ignored . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled with the respective parts of the graph . &quot;
side @-@ show with one on several pages distributed graph@@ s without head@@ line and with another font .
&quot; the site again charging gives the possibility to set the behavior when a file has changed on the hard disk , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically re@@ load or ignore the changes ) or the program every time . &quot;
&quot; the page is open to set the behavior of &amp; graphic viewer , if a graph is opened outside an ongoing session . you can select a standard behavior for this case ( the graph@@ s in a new window will open or specify in a sub@@ window of already running session ) or determine that every time is asked . &quot;
&quot; the page seat management gives the possibility to set the starting behavior of &amp; ch@@ graph@@ viewer ; you can set a default behavior ( the files of the last session or not ) or determine , at every start afterwards . &quot;
&quot; the context menu , which usually appears at a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; opens further possibilities : &quot;
&quot; here you can choose among different &amp; graph@@ s ; -@@ layout algorithms . the entries , as described on the website of &amp; graph@@ s ; are : &quot;
&quot; &amp; dot ; -@@ algorithm , the standard for the graph@@ s . he produces hierarch@@ ical or wel@@ ded representations of directed graph@@ s . the algorithm lays down the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom ) and then tries to produce as short edges and as possible as few cant@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for odd graphics . it produces representations according to the spr@@ ing@@ spring model . this is used , the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm , which is equivalent to statistical multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling . &quot;
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm generated for odd graphics model . it uses the fru@@ chter@@ man Rein@@ gold He@@ uris@@ tics , and includes a multi @-@ de@@ fl@@ ector for the treatment of large and g@@ ec@@ lu@@ ster@@ ten graph@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; Cir@@ co ; -@@ algorithm holds the k@@ not@@ s in accordance with the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and Kau@@ ff@@ man and meadow , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cy@@ c@@ lic@@ al structures . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command , which will then run by a shell . the command should give graph@@ ite file as parameters , and the calculation layout of graph@@ s in x@@ dot format . with such a layout , you can change &amp; graph@@ s ; -@@ algorithms special options , or also change the graph@@ s with a filter before it is drawn . &quot;
determines the type of graph@@ s ( directed or odd ) and turns the standard algorithms for the respective type in ( dot ; for oriented , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for un@@ regulated graph@@ s ) . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is enabled , the overview is displayed if this is necessary . otherwise it is not displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active . &quot;
displays the What is the mouse pointer to . click with this mouse pointer to a &amp; GUI ; -@@ Element to get further help to this item ( if available ) .
a list of changes is available at this address and in the file Ch@@ ange@@ log in the base folder of the source code .
&amp; graphic viewer ; is a &amp; KDE ; -@@ program that uses the &amp; graph@@ s ; tools for presentation . it requires the following programming packages :
a special setup is not necessary to use &amp; graphic viewer ; in the menu settings you will find more options .
&quot; the main window of the symbol editor is divided into five sections : the main tool tool , the bar for drawing tools , the status bar , the .@@ color palette and the G@@ it@@ tern@@ etz in which you draw the symbol . &quot;
&quot; created a new icon . if the current file was changed , you will be asked if you want to save the changes in which you can choose whether the symbol of a template is to be created , or if you want to start from scratch . &quot;
imagine the last un@@ covered step back . if you do not have taken a step back@@ wards this function is de@@ activated .
adds the content of the clip@@ board as a new image ( if the clip@@ board contains a symbol ) .
sets the current symbol in gray stages . this can create colors that do not match with those of the symbol palette of &amp; KDE ;
&quot; changes not the symbol , but sets the current drawing colour on the color of the point on which you click . &quot;
&quot; the status bar shows you the current promotions . from left to right , it shows you the x@@ - and y @-@ coordinates of the current pixels , the size of the current drawing space , the enlarge factor and the current number of colors of symbols . &quot;
adds the content of the clip@@ board as a new image ( if the clip@@ board contains a symbol ) .

choose Transpar@@ ent Pixel or Lin@@ e@@ als : or a ch@@ ess@@ board as a banner indicator . you can also set up for the ch@@ ess@@ board the size : the Kar@@ os on Klein , means and grand , as well as the colour 1 : and colour 2 : choose . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module images can be read tools used to invite new images and to conf@@ use them .
this module can be used to det@@ ects new images from external sources . currently two sources can be used :
pictures scan : uses the K@@ oo@@ ka interface for reading images from a scanner which is supported by the SA@@ NE project or another source such as video streams . so this works you have to install K@@ oo@@ ka and SA@@ NE .
&quot; when you open the images , you can open a dialog that lets you choose between all available sources on your computer . choose here the source of which you want to pick up the picture . you can also set the default source for the next time . &quot;
&quot; after that , K@@ oo@@ ka window appears by replacing the pre @-@ given standard duc@@ ted duc@@ ks can select to select your picture accordingly . see the preview below and adjust the range of your needs . the estimated file size will display you in the right , bottom corner . in K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find more information . &quot;
&quot; note that the window will be displayed completely , as some settings may otherwise possibly possibly be displayed . &quot;
&quot; after you have pushed the button , you need to wait until the scan has been completed and the window to create the image file . here you can select the compression and the type of image file . you also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; they must also select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create the image saved . &quot;
screen@@ shots you can create after you choose in the menu Im@@ por@@ tive &gt; screen@@ shot ... selected . a window appears in which you can set the different screen phot@@ om@@ o@@ di :
select The complete work@@ space to read a single window under the mouse .
&quot; if all own program window selected is selected , the re@@ vocation program will disappear , so you can read other screens and windows . otherwise , you will read after a short delay , read the currently visible work place and read only the window under the mouse . &quot;
&quot; the delay determines how long screens are waiting , before it starts . if you have to switch to other working areas , you should choose these delay high enough to have the time to navigate there . &quot;
&quot; after the screen@@ shot , the dialog options for the target image appears with the options already described above . &quot;

&quot; Flickr is an online photo management board in the internet . with Flickr , it is possible to come to the people who are important . you can show your favorite photos of the world to show photos of your camera online and show your photos safely and private your friends and family all over the world . &quot;
the module Ex@@ por@@ tiere to Flickr can be used to upload images from your computer to a Flickr server in the Internet .
&quot; if you use the module for the first time , you will use the process of generating a Tok@@ ens . this is thus being used for your authentication . a browser will be started so you can log in on Flickr . &quot;
&quot; after successful registration , the module can send photos to the Flickr website . you will be presenting the following page after a successful registration . &quot;
just connect the browser window and return to the program . after you have pressed on Yes you get the dialog to upload photos after Flickr . this will be displayed in the next section .
&quot; if the module is started on Flickr for the second time , you will be welcomed with the following Dialog that displays the current per@@ missions that displays the current per@@ missions . the module now supports no other per@@ missions . you will also be asked if you want to continue with these per@@ missions . &quot;
the button photos should be pushed once after you have set any other options . with this button you can select the photos you want to upload . if you click on the O@@ k button click the up@@ loading of the photos to the Flickr server .
the keywords field can be filled with one by comm@@ a separated list of words . these are added to the picture as a keyword during the flood .
&quot; with the options open , friends and Fam@@ illi@@ e you can set the per@@ missions to your pictures . by default , the photos are classified as a private . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the option to upload the size of the photos prior to the up@@ loading , the photos prior to the up@@ loading are changed in size . the size is taken from which at maximum size . &quot;
the maximum size can be used to set the maximum amount of images . the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant .

&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery is currently no documentation . if you are interested in writing , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under KDE @-@ Im@@ aging @ k@@ de.@@ org. Note : the participants in this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical localization allows GPS co @-@ ordin@@ ates in the metad@@ ata of an image and edit it . the geographical data are stored in the EX@@ IF @-@ sampling of the image and the loc@@ alisation can be displayed in a map of an external browser .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical localization provides tools available to images geographic in the spher@@ ical coordination system , which is used by GPS and Galileo . height , length and l@@ ati@@ l@@ ati@@ tudes are used . &quot;
to cor@@ relate your images with geographical data you need a GPS track as XML file in the g@@ p@@ x @-@ format . g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel and g@@ p@@ sman you can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image geographical localization Kor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can lead a number of previously selected pictures with a GPS track .
&quot; select the images you want to customize in the main window and call the menu on . the above @-@ looking dialog will then load a trace file with G@@ P@@ X file , you need to upload a trace file with G@@ P@@ X file , such as the pictures of your camera . &quot;
&quot; if the file load is loaded an automatic cor@@ relation , the coordinates in red displays . GPS trace data are recorded in GMT @-@ time and therefore the camera date has to be carried out with the GMT . this can be done with the time zone . Set up here your camera zone . &quot;
&quot; the adjustment for the maximum time deviation is a top deviation for the GPS time and compan@@ y@@ eit . lies the deviation , including the data will be combined . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds . &quot;
if you don &apos;t have trace data from one place for pictures you can edit the g@@ p@@ x file manually and add the pictures . the time difference between 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all images in this area .
&quot; the options inter@@ pol@@ ishing and difference in minutes can be used when you don &apos;t have the appropriate data . if you know that in reality a locom@@ otive between camera and GPS is , you can put these limits here and then push the button cor@@ relation to inter@@ pol@@ ish . &quot;
&quot; the coordinates can be manually set with this dialog . this is useful , if you have a set of photos on the same location . as the dialog can use the coordinates from one call to the next notice you just need to use the button OK to put the data in the current photo . &quot;
the localities can also be found with the displayed map and enlarge it . select the relevant region and enlarge it . the height must always be selected manually until you have to be selected manually . the card may be switched between card mode , satellite image and a mixed mode . &quot;
completely outside of the K@@ IP@@ I module there are ways to attach the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that is used to provide a p@@ ile of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
&quot; this module can export your albums into a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums as HTML pages , and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set becomes U@@ TF @-@ 8 to enable the best possible internation@@ alization . &quot;
&quot; the module has four rider in which the settings can be adjusted . the tab allows all albums to choose according to HTML , you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below , you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below the Al@@ ben@@ ign and text of the HTML page will appear . &quot;
the tab defines the general look and layout for each page . this tab is largely explained by itself . the option for each image will create a new page created in which the picture is displayed . otherwise the picture will be displayed directly with your default image , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show , displayed &quot;
&quot; the tab album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be stored with all your related pictures . choose a folder on which you write to write . a sub@@ folder with the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ A@@ export , which contains everything will be created there . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information is stored in the new pictures in the new pictures . &quot;
&quot; with different colour depth , you can change the standard colour depth . this also influences the file size . all other settings are even explan@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; the rider thumb@@ nails allows you to adjust some of the settings from the album rider for the thumb@@ nails , these are small images displayed in the gallery . &quot;
a progress window shows the user as far the action is . press Cancel to break the process .
&quot; if the module generates the pages , the window will not automatically shut down . you can therefore read the Program@@ mes to find out whether a mistake occurred during the generation . the web browser is automatically started to view the preview of the gallery . click Connect to close the module . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I sculp@@ tor is a very fast and flexible OpenGL based tool to view images .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I sculp@@ tor allows to view a selection of images and run on them base operations such as shooting , Zo@@ om@@ es or leaving . it is designed for quick image display and quick access to its functions . &quot;
after starting a picture as standard in full screen mode . this can be modified in a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG loss module is a tool to change images without inter@@ fere with your quality .
&quot; this module allows for the actions below to store images in the JPEG format , without the usual losses of quality or metad@@ ata . &quot;
the consequence of the loss of loss is the file size is rising because there is no compression of the color information . this can be found e.g. at PNG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool so that you can connect your computer with a digital camera .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is currently no documentation . if you are interested in writing , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under KDE @-@ Im@@ aging @ k@@ de.@@ org. Note : the participants in this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I @-@ Module Metad@@ ata editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation please contact the mailing list KDE @-@ Im@@ aging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
&quot; using the import function of the Metad@@ ata module , you can copy data from one picture to another . select the file option dialog with which you want to copy the target image , so the image to which you want to copy the metad@@ ata . the data will be copied to the button OK . &quot;
&quot; this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not in any target format . JPEG is supported by writing . please refer to exi@@ v@@ 2 to see which formats are supported . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer Module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slideshow .
&quot; the module MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length , to convert . this module uses the packages M@@ jp@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick . between the individual images you can add a basic configuration . you can also add an audio file in MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slideshow . &quot;
&quot; all pictures are automatically listed on the correct size for the selected video format . additionally , you can select a background color for the slideshow . with this module , it is possible to use the formats of DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the K@@ 3@@ b program . &quot;
you must first select the images to be packed into the MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au . afterwards you can create the module of extras MPEG Di@@ ash@@ au .
the pictures selected from you are then en@@ umer@@ ated under image files in the portfolio . there you can also change the type of images or the contents of the list .
&quot; after you are satisfied with your list , you should customize the other settings . the video format can select from different formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . PAL is pre @-@ set and most likely the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds which is displayed in seconds . the speed of the image is set out below . a low value creates very sudden , a high contrast very smooth image change . &quot;
&quot; the background color can be next set . in doubt , you should let them black . the name and the path of the created file can be set under name of the MPEG @-@ output file . &quot;
&quot; if you specify a audio file with the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . after all settings you can start the movie . depending on the speed of your computer you can now drink a coffee or enjoy a coffee and enjoy the slideshow , if you are back again . &quot;
&quot; if a note appears that Ko@@ di@@ erer or tools are missing , so you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ jp@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick packages on the button settings to the right bottom . &quot;
the printer driver allows to print multiple images on a sheet paper along with standard Photo@@ sizes . the combined images can also automatically be opened with the image processing . this is e.@@ g : useful to improve you or with the Gimp module to direct expression .
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import your saved images in one of three formats JPEG , TIFF or P@@ PM . &quot;
&quot; the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w of Dave Coff@@ in . an original connection of Him is : expect from d@@ cra@@ w not that it creates the same results as the software from your camera channels . sometimes , you get a better results with d@@ cra@@ w better results ! &quot;
&quot; first select the raw file that should be converted , and start the module . the Ra@@ w image converter will then appear in the mode for a single image . with the button preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture . &quot;
&quot; you can now re @-@ adjust the values to optimize the conver@@ gence process . the first option decides whether the camera settings for the white is to be used . the essential parameters such as gam@@ ma , brightness and red / blue amplifier can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the image later on . &quot;
a four colors of R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected to use the contrast information . if your camera works in R@@ GB mode the R@@ GB@@ G switches has no effect .
&quot; once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . it uses a loss@@ y algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes . &quot;
&quot; the Tagged Image Format , TIFF , re@@ tains all information of your image and uses the loss@@ less LZ@@ W compression . &quot;
&quot; if you are going to process your images frequently , or later , you should not choose the JPEG format because it is only a limited number of operations allowed before the image quality is deteri@@ or@@ ated . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot;
&quot; if you select JPEG as a storage format , the metad@@ ata contained in the raw file are stored in the JPEG file in the folder information . &quot;
&quot; when you have adapted your settings , you can start the conversion . if you want to break this process again , so you can break down . &quot;
the p@@ ile load mode allows you to convert different images at one time . use this mode when you are sure if you are sure of one single picture which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images . you have here however the possibility of existing file automatically over@@ write . it is helpful if they have been created in an earlier attempt . a preview is not available . the progress bar is not available .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in one album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following formats are supported :
&quot; this module can be used for ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the start number and the time stamp of the time . &quot;
this module can be used to modify the size of several images of a photo collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can enlarge the image size or enlarge . this will be made four types of image change :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is automatically selected to be selected depending on the image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : change of change in two dimensions . here the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option e.g. to adjust your image to the screen format .
not proportional : not dis@@ proportionate change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed at this option .
&quot; Pre@@ par@@ ation preparation : prepar@@ es the image for photo pressure . the user can adjust the printing resolution and the size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , colour size and background color , is adjusted accordingly . &quot;
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected pictures with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to edit the size of the additional pictures before . further images can draw on the list of vertical images and put it down there .
&quot; after you have started the module , the pictures window will display with the pictures selected . over the button pictures you can add additional images . for the last chosen picture a preview is displayed on the right . &quot;
you can also drag and drop images on the picture list and add it to the list of vertical images .
&quot; with the Button images , you will remove the selected pictures from the list of vertical images . &quot;
once you have selected all images you can click with the button OK the new message -@@ window of your e @-@ mail clients . you just have to add the addresses and the subject matter . the pictures selected from you are already attached to an app@@ endi@@ x .
&quot; if you do not pay attention to many pictures at one time . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations for the size of sen@@ sible e @-@ mails . it may be a good idea to send several mails if you want to send a lot of images . &quot;
the email window will be used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is stored and every@@ time use it to change it .
&quot; select your email clients from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you have to specify the right path for your installation . &quot;
&quot; if you use the Google Mail Service , you have to install the G@@ Mail@@ Agent on your computer . you can download it here . &quot;
&quot; after the selection of comments in one attached file , the comments to the pictures are attached to a text file and attached to the mail . &quot;
the PNG format under the menu image file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files as e.g. TIFF . you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast Internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend the JPEG format .
&quot; if you select JPEG to select file format and the original files in the JPEG format , the original Ex@@ if@@ b data will be added to sen@@ sing images . &quot;
&quot; when the process is finished , the window will not automatically shut down the status messages , looking for errors , see . your e @-@ mail program is automatically started at the end . with the kno@@ b you can switch this window . &quot;
after the type of the modular advanced Di@@ asch@@ au you will have shown a window with questions like you can see your di@@ vest@@ ock . you can choose between you selected and all the pictures of the album .
&quot; the OpenGL outputs in the presentation are activated very elegant picture inputs by OpenGL . you must have a corresponding graphics card , as otherwise the slideshow is very slow . &quot;
&quot; the option file names display , that the fil@@ en@@ ame of images in the left corner will be displayed during the presentation . &quot;
the Schlei@@ fe option ensures that the presentation is displayed in a finishing loop . you can then manually break manually with ES@@ C ;
&quot; the option pictures are acci@@ dentally , that the images are displayed in a random order . it is thus not used to order the pictures in the album . &quot;
under delay between the pictures can be set the time distance between the individual images . 1500 mill@@ is@@ econ@@ ds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . however the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transi@@ tional effect . you should do so before you show your friends !
there are more than a dozen excess effects between which you can choose . by chance you choose another effect at any point between the pictures .
&quot; during the slideshow , you can access a tool at the top left of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn off . &quot;
&quot; with this tool , you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and the next picture and stop the slideshow . &quot;
&quot; on the left bottom of the screen you can see the current file name , the position of the current image and the entire number of images in your presentation . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module Time &amp; Date has no documentation . if you are interested in writing , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under KDE @-@ Im@@ aging @ k@@ de.@@ org. Note : the participants in this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to put a picture as background image for the working surface .
&quot; this module sets the currently selected picture , depending on the selected option of the substr@@ ate , as background for your KDE working surface . &quot;
&quot; once you have provided your images and videos with notes , you can see with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; by these brow@@ ses , see picture . as you can see by a comparison with the picture , so are in each group , so in persons , places and in group keywords entries . &quot;
&quot; in the browser window you will see the categories , for which you provided information to look at your images and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ating information . in addition , there are entries to look at EX@@ IF @-@ based information , to view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course the current thumb@@ nails . &quot;
&quot; when you press with the mouse to the entry , the view of the browser will change . see picture . &quot;
&quot; if you choose another person , only the images are displayed on which both persons are displayed . by this selection method you can limit the number of images shown from a few thousand pictures to a few single images . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected all the people , places and other settings , you can display with thumb@@ nails to view the images of your activity . &quot;
&quot; in the picture every person has the same symbol before their name . you can store with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person an own preview picture , that is of course also suitable for places , keyword and other categories that you have defined yourself . see the picture . &quot;
&quot; to view images next to the name , select the button , which you want to use for each category . in the apparent context menu . this has the advantage that you can see for example symbols with images of persons and at the same time a list of keyword ( if you have no suitable images for your keyword ) . &quot;
&quot; however , you don &apos;t have to specify which image will be displayed for each individual person . here you can see the picture of the image file ( in closer ) , you have to adjust the image to the appropriate person in the context menu . here you can adjust the image to your wishes and select which part of the image is to be displayed or cut . &quot;
&quot; if you access the entry in the main window , you will show a dialog that is very similar to the dialog for fixing the image properties very similar . this dialog can be seen on the image once again . &quot;
&quot; if you want to enter a string of text in the field lab@@ eling or description , the complaint or descriptions of the images after this text is to be sear@@ ched , so for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options in the lower part of the window , you can browse all the pictures according to specific name as you can see in the picture . here , according to pictures , however , not Anne Hel@@ ene are pic@@ tured . &quot;
&quot; this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . if you do not like to read manuals , but rather want to try out functions , you have the following alternatives to this guide : &quot;
go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and watch the quick@@ set up the screen@@ shots and the introduc@@ tory videos .
&quot; start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and choose in the first dialog the demo , if you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select the demo recordings , and you can test the features of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can try out the features of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a combined HTML document to download . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar see here : . as the name suggests , this bar gives you data statistics about the pictures in your database . &quot;
&quot; the schedules can show you several different time units . each bar shows another unit . you can change between the units of years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by introducing the bar only 10 @-@ minute sections . &quot;
&quot; the schedules can be used on the following ways : you can select the displayed entries from the database ( if you select a date , the first picture of this date is shown in the preview tab ) and also displays the current date of the currently shown pictures when you navigate in the preview view . &quot;
&quot; you can also select a range of time by selecting the mouse button pressed and drag the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , so you can select a range , you will be able to preview the selection of this time period by clicking on a beam of the time bar . &quot;
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; introduces you two options to create HTML websites with your images . the one is available in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version described in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version which you can create using the menu file HTML ...
&quot; before HTML pages , you have to create some settings . these are divided into three areas content , layout and finish . in the following , each area is described more exactly . &quot;
first enter the title of the over@@ looks and a description which is to contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML sample pages you will see an example of these settings .
next select whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; -@@ export file will be created to see the page description page . nutri@@ ent information about export files can be found here .
&quot; finally , you can choose which information can be displayed on the HTML pages . therefore , you can avoid that information is displayed from a party . note that the viewer can also be displayed without description . you can therefore not use this setting to hide specific pictures from certain viewers . &quot;
&quot; in this area you can define how the HTML pages should look like . most settings options are clearly , why does this not have been made specifically . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the page you can view different resolutions for the images . therefore those who have to view your website and have a monitor that have the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no images download for example a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the viewer of your site may change the resolution at any time . it is possible to search your pictures with low resolution , which results in a lower transfer time , if he wants to see a picture bigger , he changes to a higher resolution . &quot;
in this setting section you place the various folders and the URL where your website is stored .
&quot; it is best to choose a basic folder for all your HTML files , and for each subsequent set a new sub@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; first , you must select the main folder where all your images will be stored . this folder will be stored and automatically select the next time . this allows you to select a folder or one from KDE support protocol , for example : &quot;
&quot; after you have created your pictures , you can check if this really all is visible for viewing folders . if you select for the basic folder a URL will be started . the URL you can find here should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; if the supported HTML files are still not in the final destination folder , you need to manually copy it to the final destination . this is not the sub@@ folder of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the actual files , but the basic folder in which all sub@@ folders are located . &quot;
the settings described here are all three on basic folders or URLs . in this one sub@@ folder will set out a sub@@ folder whose name you set in the output folder .
&quot; if you &apos;re on a family party , a meeting at the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you may of course have a lot of time for viewing the images , etc . however , you may have to stand a lot of time for viewing , etc . , then you have to do with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this work does not even have to do . &quot;
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others to your database . the image properties are imported with ex@@ - and imported .
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in it whether the images are stored with the file , or whether the pictures can be stored in the file , that you can add all pictures to the file , but the obvious draw@@ back is however the file size . &quot;
&quot; you can either create a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the menu file or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with a HTML file , this will create an external .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in two ways . first , the images are not found in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . these images will not be found in the folder of the URL that you have created when creating the HTML files . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using HTML export . &quot;
&quot; in the following , the dialog for the export of images described you can export over the menu file ... &quot;
the most important option of this dialogue is whether to act internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . there are the following three options available :
&quot; when using the .@@ k@@ im file , you must copy the images in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; using the Autom@@ atically option to copy the .@@ k@@ im file , copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the pictures automatically for you . &quot;
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . as most pictures have already been compressed with JPEG to comp@@ ress the XML file itself . if you want to comp@@ ress this so you simply select the option of export file .
&quot; the last option of this page will limit maximum image size . if you want to send your friends pictures , because the .@@ k@@ im file else would be very large . here you can tell the size , as you say that every picture is at most 800 pixels high and wide . &quot;
&quot; if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu file import@@ ing ... select , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the ex@@ por@@ ated database as described in described . &quot;
&quot; the assistant to import@@ ing consists of four steps . first , you must select which images you want to import , then , in which folder you want to import images to import images . &quot;
&quot; it may be that you are able to person@@ alize the category persons who is called to imported file , while this category is called for your database . therefore , you will be imported in the third dialogue window , which categories which are imported into your database . &quot;
&quot; in the fourth step , you can download the categories of imported file with the categories of your current database . an example can be seen on the picture . &quot;
&quot; it has to be easy to browse and view images : if you want to view images , you would like to view images of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depic@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will place the various steps away ( 1 ) Cre@@ ate the information about your pictures , via ( 2 ) the flow and prestige , up to ( 3 ) advanced themes and adapt@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Photo@@ album was started as a program for the pamper@@ ing of your pictures . it has been extended and today , your videos . at many places this book will be crossed over pictures , but frequently this also includes videos with one . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; stores all of its information in the file index@@ .@@ x@@ ml to the top folder of their images . this is a simple XML file , you can copy to a disk or re@@ visions in the CV@@ S . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; re@@ members the folder where your images are stored and used it automatically . if you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , so you can start another folder tree ; with the option -@@ c . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / Company / index@@ .@@ x@@ ml . &quot;
&quot; through the menu entry settings k@@ photo@@ album ; Set up to a window , with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; change the different settings options . &quot;
&quot; left you see six different symbols , with which you can view the settings for viewing and the options for the viewer . for each attitude , you can call for a detailed pressure on the F1 button and a click on the desired option . &quot;
&quot; in was described as you can set for each picture various properties , e.g. persons , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums . &quot;
&quot; to see the dialogue , which is used to process already existing groups . for each existing group you can select a lab@@ eling and a symbol . &quot;
&quot; in the section the sub@@ categories were already mentioned . in the dialog options , you can set up complete membership groups , i.e. , for example all members of a group at once in a group instead of all the groups of a Medi@@ gli@@ eds as stated in . &quot;
&quot; in view the settings options , which are available to you for fixing the member groups . with the above mentioned list you can choose the category you want to configure . in the left window notes , you will find a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories . &quot;
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; shares its modular system with other graphics applications such as digi@@ tization and G@@ wen@@ view . this module is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; KDE ; image Plugin interface . nutri@@ ent information can be found on the homepage of Ki@@ pi .
&quot; the modules can be called by the modules and are not described in this manual because they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; but most modules have a help page which you can call on the modules itself . &quot;
&quot; as the modules are used among several applications together , it may be used to test the modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; demo database , you can either get new modules first using the demo database using the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album demo &lt; user@@ input &lt; &gt; or via the menu help . say not , I would not have war@@ ned ! &quot;
&quot; the applications used to use the modules via K@@ IP@@ I , are very different , allowing some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not work . this is the disadvantage if you share functions with different applications . &quot;
&quot; the main difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications , which also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications are not supported in albums : it is an album just a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this kind of order is not supported for some modules the order according to albums , so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; thus sim@@ ulates &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the latest album , that simply corresponds to the current view , so all the pictures that show you the picture show now . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the current album , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , the modules also includes a list of albums . here goes &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as follows : &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s Browser shows the content of a category , for example all persons , then each entry in this category represents an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; or it will be the category that you have specified in the Settings dialog as a category for virtual albums , so if you want to use the category person , will be chosen as if you would have chosen people to view and pass this module . &quot;
&quot; as some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the settings dialog and select in the area modules , which modules should be loaded . &quot;
&quot; on the picture you can see an example of a starting screen , once you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; with your own pictures . &quot;
&quot; as you are used by any other KDE application , you can see completely up a menu and a tool similar . in the section we &apos;ll find no information about your pictures . in the section we &apos;ll show you no information about your pictures . in the section we &apos;ll show you on this window , now click on this window to show you an overview of all existing images . &quot;
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to see any picture with notes . this includes information about the people who recorded on the picture etc . you can set each image either individually or for a larger number of images certain comments at the same time . if for example on all pictures Jes@@ per is recorded and all pictures were recorded in Copenhagen .
all these notes can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in section . if you want to see these comments when you use the built @-@ in viewer .
&quot; in view three lists with a text field by typ@@ ing people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; because you will always use it once you enter information about your pictures . &quot;
&quot; the following idea is to shift the images within the list : if you are illustrated for example a family party , and on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 persons are shown , so you can find that the names are moved to the top , the people quickly find and assign . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to list a alphabe@@ tical list , click on the icon for sor@@ ting by date under the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected comments for each picture individually , you might want to edit all the selected images and provide these images with ann@@ ot@@ ings . click in this case simply click on the above and back @-@ buttons , which are under the preview of the picture on the right . &quot;
&quot; if you have multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all of these images and to use the menu item multiple entries at once with a note . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . moreover , San Francisco and Los Angeles lie in California . &quot;
&quot; on the picture you can see a browsing window of the USA as an over@@ group . to show you that it is an over@@ lap , a special symbol is displayed . &quot;
&quot; in context menu of connection , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over@@ - or sub@@ category . additionally , you can also insert an entry to a category in order to sort this to a sub@@ category of this entry . please note that you just sort your categories alphabe@@ tically . &quot;
&quot; you can move the single elements of the dialog by moving the bar that form the upper edge of the frame , click and move it . you can also take a part of the window by moving it outside of the window . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted the look of the window so to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the button Options ... that offers you the opportunity to store the current layout and appearance of the window . &quot;
&quot; you can also hide a frame completely . if you want this window to be displayed later , please use the button options ... and then window a / screen . this procedure will see you in the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select the entry images in the browser , you will find an overview with thumb@@ nails of the currently selected images , or all pictures if you do not have a filter here . you can see the size of the thumb@@ nails , by simple and drop the mouse with the middle mouse button , configure . try it simple . &quot;
&quot; if you leave a picture on the background of your desktop , this image is furnished as background image for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; once you click on a picture , this is displayed in the picture . if you have not opened a window with a photo viewed , a new display will be created . &quot;
&quot; you can also delete pictures in the image show , simply select the appropriate images from you want to delete or select either the removal button or select the Edit menu . now you can see the window you can see in the picture . &quot;
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can also use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; namely images you can download on the hard disk . of course you have to record the images anywhere else . in the picture you can see the pictures of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required pictures can be loaded from the hard disk .
&quot; images where the right upper corner is cut off , are not stored on the hard disk . for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , however , the thumb@@ nails can show you the preview of these images . however , you can also view this pictures with the picture . &quot;
&quot; as you see , this feature you need to copy files from folders and again copy it . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if you do not wish to avoid the inser@@ tion of your images , please buy a larger disk to save all pictures . &quot;
&quot; in the menu images you will find a sub@@ menu with the name of privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy that you want to do for other un@@ accessible , and click on current view in the menu privacy . alternatively , you can also view all the pictures that can see your little sister , to control the menu and the menu entry all except current view . &quot;
&quot; so you have specified , which images are to be hidden in the case of the case , just select the menu entry to your little sister , making all the pictures you have blocked out , click on lock . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to set a password that must be given to un@@ lock the images . to set up this password , simply select password in the menu privacy . &quot;
&quot; please remember that this photo protection is not very safe . for example , all images on the hard disk and the others can access the file index@@ .@@ x@@ ml , the password can not be familiar with or k@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar to honor the view of private images . &quot;
&quot; the reason why you can manage all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and hours over hours so , of course , that you want to look at some point . for this reason , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; about a picture _ and video viewed . these can be viewed from the preview as described in . &quot;
&quot; the viewer can see you in . it shows of course the picture , but additional all the information you have to enter about the picture , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it made , etc . &quot;
&quot; if the inf@@ obo@@ x on the upper part of the image you want to see , so you can easily drag and remove what information is displayed and whether all of these options are to be displayed correctly . all these options are available after a right click on the viewer , you can see below . &quot;
&quot; some words in the Inf@@ obo@@ x are under@@ lined . if you click here , see , find suitable entries to this . if you have selected all the pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you were selected from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; if you have loaded several images in the viewer , you can change between them and go back , by using the buttons image high and image . you can jump to the first and last image with Pos@@ s@@ 1 and end . these functions are also accessible from the context menu . &quot;
if several images are loaded in the viewer you can run it as a slideshow . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; loads a new image after a few seconds . how often it is controlled a new image by using the C@@ trl key and plus / min@@ us .
a very useful ability of the spect@@ ator from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is it used in full screen mode . in this mode the viewer uses the complete place on the screen . use the button button to switch in full screen mode and back .
if you use the viewer you can move into the image into the image and zoom out . with the minus button you can easily zoom out the Plus button again in the middle of the picture and displays the result of the zoom .
&quot; with the point button , you can reset your zoom so that the image will not be zo@@ om@@ ed . with the equ@@ ali@@ ent key puts the zoom , so that every pixel is equivalent to the screen a pixel of the image . &quot;
note that the only zo@@ om@@ oper@@ ations will work with videos that are in and out with the plus and the key .
&quot; with the fil@@ ming from the context menu , you can turn the image . this does not work with videos . you can make notes on the current image with the menu item comments from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; if you have a look at it , you can get a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten on the picture . at the moment you can watch the watch and enter configuration dialog of the picture , but you might just drag the image and view further images . &quot;
&quot; another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to see the images on paper . to see which photos you want , you can start the viewer with the images and watch them as well or bad as you see one after the other . &quot;
for the two examples above there is the possibility to provide images with characteristics while watching them . characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can set a characteristic that you press the corresponding letters . in see an image where the features A , B and C are set . &quot;
&quot; once you have set features on your images , you can see in your browser . so you can see all the images you edit , print or whatever your images are described , so you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do . &quot;
&quot; categories and special features can display in the preview view . if you want to view categories in d@@ re preview view , then you can press features to the pictures by simply push the letter for the characteristic that the image was selected . this can be seen here : &quot;
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case allows you to paint &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; on the picture to paint .
&quot; the painted is not saved with the image , but in the database . on the way you can remove your stomach later . &quot;
in the picture you can see a picture on the painted . to turn off the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; to finish the painting from the context menu . to finish the cross in the tool bar at the top of the window .
&quot; to work with &amp; po@@ v@@ modeling , you have to be able to work with the application of the program &amp; Pov@@ ray ; not complete , but the documentation of &amp; Pov@@ ray ; should you be read and understood . &quot;
&quot; in the building tree , you can select individual objects . then their properties are shown in the object properties and displayed the object in the wire model . &quot;
&quot; you can also select multiple objects simultaneously . but not the sub@@ object of an already selected object , since all sub@@ objects already selected with the object . &quot;
&quot; to add a new object to the object tree , select the position you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the toolbar or select a menu entry in the menu item . &quot;
&quot; gives multiple positions , the following un@@ fol@@ dable menu is finished so that you can choose the right position : &quot;
&quot; with delet@@ ing from the menu bar under Edit or from the context menu of the right mouse button , you can remove selected objects from the scene . &quot;
&quot; if you have changed properties , click on users to accept these changes . if you have invalid values , a message will be displayed using a bug description . then you can click the input errors and click on users or change the changes with Cancel . &quot;
&quot; if you enter the path to the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; -@@ user documentation in the set of dialog , you can call the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; -@@ reference to the ordered object with the help . &quot;
&quot; you need the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL username to use this property . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.5 contains already the user documentation . &quot;
&quot; if you edit a texture , or edit a portion of a texture , you can preview a preview in the peculi@@ ar view . &quot;
&quot; click on Pre@@ view in the peculi@@ arity view and a small example of the scene is selected with the selected texture . as default , the entire texture you want to ren@@ ders ( for example a texture in a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , cross the local texture . &quot;
the screen@@ shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
&quot; when a transformation will be chosen , the control points and there will be a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shift . you can change the shift through hand with the mouse inside the whole window . &quot;
each object has a visible level of visibility . you can specify this value relative to the refl@@ ecting level of the superior object or as absolute value . objects will only be displayed when they are selected or their refl@@ ecting stage of the scene of the scene of the scene .
&amp; po@@ v@@ modeling ; has a window order as pre@@ setting . the object tree and view of object properties are displayed on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
&quot; if you do not like the default window order , or if you need a different arrangement , you can set them arbitr@@ arily . you can also save several shut@@ ters and easily switch between different arrangements . &quot;
&quot; to anchor a window over or under a present view , drag the initial water to the upper or lower edge of a view . a rect@@ angle then shows the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the trial to the right or left side of a view . the new view will then be anchored on the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height . &quot;
if you want to arrange multiple views to one another in the middle of another view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the card reader on top of the views .
&quot; the last possible window order are cl@@ ums@@ y views : views which are not anchored in the main window . to view a view from the anch@@ oring , drag the trial to the desktop or click on the small to the left top of the arrow bar . &quot;
&quot; to close a view , click on the small cross in the connector bar . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between arrow and cross . &quot;
&quot; you can insert additional views in the main window . in the menu view , you will find entries for any type of views . new views are narrow , you can anchor them in any place . &quot;
the current window screen can save you with view window order ... and save it . it will be a dialog box in which you can save the window order under an existing or new name .
&quot; if you created a scene , you can ren@@ ders them ren@@ ders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for ren@@ dering , this program has to be installed correctly . this version is currently not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; version 1.0 is not supported . &quot;
&quot; to ren@@ ders the current scene , click on the icon Ren@@ ders The symbol ren@@ ders in the tool tool or select the menu entry view ren@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; a R@@ ender mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; Pov@@ ray ; s ini @-@ files . it sets the image size and quality of ren@@ dering . if you want to insert a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert any number of R@@ ender modes , from a quick preview up to full pictures of the highest quality . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the icon The R@@ ender settings in the tool bar , or in the menu view of R@@ ender modes ... select the following dialog : &quot;
&quot; each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , but sense is a name that can detect the properties of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in the map size , you can enter the width and height of the straight picture . if you just want a small area of the picture , choose the cursor section and give the image cut to ren@@ dering into the input fields . &quot;
&quot; in the Com@@ bin@@ ational field quality , you can choose the properties which uses &amp; Pov@@ ray ; for ren@@ dering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user refl@@ ections . a detailed description of the R@@ ender features can be found in the user &apos;s Guide to &amp; Pov@@ ray ; . &quot;
&quot; when a picture comes with just a beam each pixel , there are often different mistakes . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or co@@ fen@@ cing effects in curves and lines , in addition , sometimes details are not indicated if they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing . &quot;
&amp; Pov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of this mistakes . in general see images with this property better .
&quot; turn anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calculated and connects &amp; Pov@@ ray ; more than a beam each pixel . this technique is called super @-@ sampling . &quot;
&amp; Pov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as standard is an adap@@ tive method ; adap@@ tive because the second method is adap@@ tive and adap@@ tive because every pixel is increasing and adap@@ tive because the recru@@ iting scheme depends on the calculated color values .
&quot; if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray output a beam per pixel . if the difference between the color values to the neighboring pixels , then both pixels are calculated by the tracking of a certain additional number of pixels with super sampling , at a lower@@ ing of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays each Pixel . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixels is calculated : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values of red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values of red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then : &quot;
diff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 beams per pixel . if the difference between the paint values the vor@@ ed threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub@@ pixels , which will be followed individually and checked for further sub @-@ division . the maximum depth of the record can be used with the repository . &quot;
&quot; another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the production of smo@@ kers for the beam process , called J@@ ero@@ ing . if you switch de@@ fl@@ ing , altered &amp; Pov@@ ray ; the rays with a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
&quot; the last setting for quality of the ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; Pov@@ ray ; , the diff@@ use of light @-@ reflection . it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property . &quot;
&quot; on this map card you can set whether the Alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent , if the corresponding rays have no object met . &quot;
opens a new window for displaying the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; -@@ Con@@ sole Output . if &amp; Pov@@ ray ; unexpected , you can find the reason for this here . &quot;
&quot; to import a &amp; Pov@@ ray ; -@@ Sc@@ ene , select the menu entry ... and select a file in the dialog window . &quot;
&quot; currently , &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling , does not support the complete command of &amp; Pov@@ ray ; if you occur in import@@ ing error messages or war@@ nings , a dialog window displays a list of all messages . &quot;
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; import this source code from the two special comments / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ end .
&quot; you can drag objects from object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; Pov@@ ray ; this adds the source code of the object into the editor . to import objects into the scene , just highlight the source code in the editor and drag it to the object tree . &quot;
with copying and inser@@ ting in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; and in your editor you can insert source code for &amp; Pov@@ ray ; also included .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is Pov@@ ray or x @-@ Pov@@ ray .
&quot; if you click on help in the property view , opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling , the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . put here the path to your documentation and the version . supported the versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Pov@@ ray ; looks for external files ( for example altitude field data ) in the paths to the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; -@@ libraries . if you include files which are not listed in the folder of the scene , you will also need to enter the path to these files here . if a file comes in different paths of the library , the first found file is used . &quot;
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for viewing the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for viewing the selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type label .
&quot; you can adjust the object @-@ cat@@ ching of the points to the p@@ ush@@ button in the context menu of the wire model views . you can adjust here the R@@ aster separately for changing , scal@@ ations and screen@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; larger values result in a more accurate wire model and thus a better nails for the displayed objects , but require more time for ren@@ dering . for some objects such as the ball you can adjust the detailed stage for two directions . &quot;
&quot; if you cross the High details for advanced proj@@ ections , all wire model views are further divided when the camera uses an advanced projection . advanced proj@@ ections are all proj@@ ections with exceptions from the perspective and the vertical proj@@ ections . this property is a better approach for proj@@ ections , but requires more time to ren@@ dering . &quot;
if you want to display wall a wall behind the objects is rounded . the wall is displayed in a box pattern made of two adjustable colours .
if you want to display ground flo@@ ppy is a floor below the objects . the floor is represented in a box pattern made of two adjustable colours .
&quot; if you tick cant@@ on , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method used for ren@@ dering of scenes . the values of depth and sw@@ ell@@ ar can be used . precise information about the parameters can be found in the section R@@ ender modes . &quot;
&quot; on this page you can change existing shut@@ ters or create new window regulations . in the section window regulations , how you can create and store shut@@ ters . &quot;
the Com@@ bin@@ ed field standard tab : displays all existing shut@@ ters . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; uses the selected window order to start the program .
the list available in the existing window arrangements shows all existing shut@@ ters . a new arrangement allows you to create with the button add and select a selected arrangement with the button Rem@@ ove .
every window order is identified by the name . the name must be clearly and must not be empty .
the list below shows all views of the chosen window order . new views can create with the button add and select selected views with the button Rem@@ ove .
&quot; the location of the new window . with new slot , create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with un@@ used anchor , you get the window under the existing window , with the previous view and cl@@ adding the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window . &quot;
&quot; so you have just installed &amp; Pov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling , and now you would like to follow without more accurate knowledge of the two programs . if you can create the ultimate however simple scene , among beginnings , taking very popular : a ball on one level . &quot;
&quot; but you should consider the following war@@ nings carefully before you complain that you as a result is only a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should note these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you do not adjust any camera , no rules can be applied to ren@@ dering , as a result you will receive a black image . &quot;
&quot; if you do not insert any light sources , your whole scene is in the dark , and you only receive a black image . &quot;
&quot; if you have all installed error @-@ free , take a look at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model ; the following pres@@ et rules : &quot;
&quot; take a little time to get to know the menus and the available symbols of the tool available . read the documentation , so that you can expect an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program . &quot;
&quot; you will have to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and also its application . &quot;
&quot; &amp; po@@ v@@ modeling , starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you must first remove all the objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu editing . so you now have a scene without objects . &quot;
&quot; the wire model display shows how the camera considers the whole scene , which you create . in particular , you notice the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the ren@@ der@@ ns of the scene . &quot;
&quot; the tree tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if they click on it , see the contents of the camera properties which can be found in the various parameters of the camera . in the user documentation to &amp; Pov@@ ray ; find more details . &quot;
&quot; change nothing to the basic settings of the camera , this is later instructions reserved , but note that the camera is in view of the camera . just click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired place . &quot;
&quot; if you press the Button user or the entry button , change the wire model and the object tree immediately according to these settings . as a result they see here the scene from the perspective of the camera . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . you could add a qu@@ ader ( inser@@ ting body Qu@@ ader ) and the size on x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ulative approach to solving this task . &quot;
&amp; po@@ v@@ modeling ; actually offers a simpler option . you can use an infinite level as the ground :
&quot; a good advice : choose the level in the object tree , change the name and then press the button user or the entry button . in the object tree the new name is immediately displayed . &quot;
&quot; the wire model display now also displays the level , although at the moment it is only a limited end@@ ent layer . if you ren@@ ders the scene , extends the plain to the horizon . &quot;
&quot; if you view the tree @-@ tree , you will notice that you can click on the icon + prior to object . in this case you will find only the default options for each new object : scal@@ ability , rotation and shift . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the object properties . &quot;
&quot; in this scene , you should move the floor to exercise a unit among the horizontal line , just to get to know some of these parameters . choose the shift and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; just choose the floor to set its material properties . there are many different materials , but select a bit of different materials at the moment . &quot;
&quot; in both cases , a dialog will open in which you can select how the object is inserted . please choose the property . the Pig@@ ment is then displayed in the object tree ( name = floor pigment ) , with a click on the button preview you see how the Pig@@ ment now looks . &quot;
&quot; of course , the preview of pig@@ ments just shows a Matt@@ es of black material because you have to enter settings for the Pig@@ ment . just think that you can check the appearance of materials at any time with one click on Pre@@ view . also give you the colors for the pig@@ ment . also , there are many possibilities , but do now take the easiest way . &quot;
&quot; if you do not preview any color on qu@@ ader and ball , please click on the button user and then call the preview . &quot;
&quot; the material for the floor is right now . if you want your image now with a click on the icon , you should get the following result : &quot;
&quot; of course , this is not the far@@ my@@ th you have expected . here are another settings necessary . in the color list you have to do two new attri@@ bute . then edit this entry twice ( you can also do this again , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
choose in the object tree and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
&quot; this step you should already carry out , as you should understand the basic methods of &amp; po@@ v@@ modeling ; they have already understood . the ball is just as simple as the ground : &quot;
in the view of the object properties you can instantly change the settings . Set the value for the radius : to 1 ( do not forget the input button or the button to press ) so that the bul@@ let go over the ground . otherwise you have moved the floor to a unit down .
&quot; of course , the ren@@ dering is now a strange result : as previously mentioned before , the ball surface appears like a Matt@@ es of black material . Set in the following step a suitable material . &quot;
&quot; if you have chosen the ball , you can now indicate a material . as already in the soil , enter the ball a pigment as color : &quot;
choose a first object and change the name for example in sphere of pig@@ ment . click on ball pig@@ ment and then select the values as follows :
&quot; but you can reach the effects , if you take the time to stop some Fin@@ ish properties : &quot;
then change the values as in the following screen@@ shots and click on users or press Enter .
&quot; the settings shine @-@ effect and reflection is already partly good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if metal : still not selected : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good impression of what opportunities you &amp; po@@ v@@ modeling , offering . hopefully you have already learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ tra@@ y@@ cing is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
&quot; when you paint a scene of ray@@ trac@@ tions , the Ren@@ er hyp@@ othe@@ tical beams from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. , from the camera being reflected and broken down the visual effects of the light sources in the scene and like atmosph@@ eric effects such as fo@@ g . thus the scene pixel is adapted for pixels . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you will not see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you see the scene . without a light source you see nothing , the image is just black . obviously , each scene needs to be rounded , some light sources and at least a camera . &quot;
in the usual file dialog you can select your file . Pov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the default file dialog you can select a file that you have previously done with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ;
&quot; whenever you open a new model or create , the file is inserted in this sub@@ menu and replaced the oldest entry in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have already saved the model , it will be saved under the same name . it is a new file , you need to enter a name and space . &quot;
marks the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage will be rejected .
you can only select this menu item only if you have not stored stored changes in the scene .
repeat the least un@@ covered command . this menu entry allows you only then select if you have used Edit back .
saves the current window order and opens a dialog in which you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing arrangement .
&quot; in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; po@@ v@@ modeling , here you can change the look , the keyboard short@@ cut and the default behavior . &quot;
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cuts . you can change or add new commands with this option .
opens a dialog to set up the tool tool . you can add and remove tools with this option of tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; -@@ commands .
&quot; a B@@ ump @-@ map is a way to adjust consuming surfaces without model each b@@ ump on the surface , and without changing the geomet@@ ric form of the object itself . &quot;
it is common to use the same file for a b@@ ump map as well as for a texture map .
&quot; basic bodies are simple geomet@@ rical shapes , which you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are created from doz@@ ens or even hundreds of these basic body . these models are then further edited to give them a realistic appearance . &quot;
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel base , using an image file as color card . &quot;
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ Show ; is a comfortable image viewed and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select pictures to display .
images can either be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is very easy . the file browser lists files that you can see with clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the key return .
&quot; you can set whether any picture is to be displayed in an own window , or if all images are to use the same window . &quot;
&quot; if you are searching for a specific file , simply type the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . when a suitable file name is highlighted , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing or &amp; ES@@ C . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog box - &amp; ku@@ ick@@ Show ; there are five cart@@ ons cards . in three of them , General and editing and slideshow , you can set the working method of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ Show ; set in the two others , short commands for the browser , the short@@ cuts for the respective window can be defined . &quot;
&quot; this is selected , then the images will be opened in full screen mode . if the image is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background color , which you can further down below . pres@@ et is not a full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; this point is activated , loads &amp; ku@@ ick@@ Show ; already the next picture in the folder , while you still view the current picture . this reduces the delay when you choose the next picture , and is particularly suitable for a slideshow . &quot;
with this option &amp; ku@@ ick@@ Show ; in the end the name of the last opened folder . the next start opens &amp; ku@@ ick@@ Show ; this folder in the browser window .
&quot; click on the colored bars to select a background color . this is used in order to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in the window , the window appears larger than the image , the background is filled with the selected color . &quot;
&quot; you can &amp; ku@@ ick@@ Show ; such as set up , that only some of the data types are displayed , which can also display the program . &quot;
&quot; with this option , the display will be enlarged for large images to the full screen . this option is switched as default . &quot;
places whether the slideshow is to begin with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
&quot; the time span between the change in a slideshow . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the sli@@ ders or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . the default setting is 3 seconds . &quot;
&quot; the number of re@@ peti@@ tions . this value is set to 0 , the slideshow will be repeated until they are broken down from the user . to change the value , you can use a new value to the input field or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . the default setting is 1 . &quot;
change the keyboard short@@ cuts for the different operating modes of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ Show ; in the Cart@@ ridge Short news for the display area and short commands for the browser .
&quot; with this option , turn off between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folder and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in one window . &quot;

&quot; &amp; show@@ f@@ oto ; is a project that is supported by a community . that means that users and developers will help each other . if you are a more common user of &amp; show@@ f@@ oto ; we will answer you questions to other users from &amp; show@@ f@@ oto ; and hopefully , you will soon ask questions to other users from &amp; show@@ f@@ oto ; and hopefully , you will soon have questions to other users . in this mailing list , you should be quite powerful . &quot;
&quot; the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ f@@ oto ; to participate , it is the developer mailing list to join the developer mailing list by &amp; show@@ f@@ oto ; &quot;
&quot; &amp; show@@ f@@ oto ; try to give you so much control over his work procedures as possible . there are many options to access the behavior of &amp; show@@ f@@ oto ; to set up these settings , you have to set up settings in eight pages . you can change between them by clicking on the symbols of the left side . &quot;
&quot; in the area of exposure indicators , you can select the color that is displayed when the under@@ carriage or over@@ exposure indi@@ k@@ ator should display the colors with what you should show in contrast . submission should display a bright colour and over@@ exposure a dark colour . &quot;
the main window of &amp; show@@ f@@ oto ; owns a side@@ bar on the right edge that provides you with important information and actions on the selected pictures . the same side@@ bar can be found in the image processing . you can also view it in which you click on one of the five riders :
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an application for the sc@@ ans of pictures that no longer power than pictures to sc@@ ans and p@@ added .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application for the sc@@ ans of images who do no longer power than pictures to sc@@ ans and ab@@ used . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; can be saved for each picture to save a dialog with automatically generated names and format . the user can also display the pictures in front of the file .
you can check the status of support of your scanner at the SA@@ NE projection page by entering the necessary information on this search page : http : / / www.s@@ ane @-@ project@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; with the command sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner was not opened or if no standard scanner is specified then becomes a dialog to choose the scanner .
the user can select the scanner scanner and press OK to open the scanner .
the further settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) covers these options not particularly .
&quot; to take a picture of the image , the user can only start a pre @-@ slip and then look for scanning range for the final scan . the pre @-@ slip is started by the Pre@@ view button . &quot;
&quot; to select the image better , the user can move into the image and out of the current selection . it can also set the zoom into the window . &quot;
&quot; when the image has been selected , the final image can be read with the Scan button . &quot;
&quot; when you save a preview in the settings , then the image is pressed in a preview pane , as below is displayed , then the picture is saved and sn@@ lie ? en leads to a break@@ down and you will return to the main window . &quot;
&quot; through the button settings , the name can be opened in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here . &quot;
&quot; the user can view the image if desired , before saving . in this case the option before saving a preview show . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be deduc@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; this setting allows them to select the way to select the type such as &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; pictures to save the dialog before each one @-@ called picture . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite , this automatically opens with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you have to ask for saving a file name . &quot;
&quot; this setting defines where the pictures can be stored in the option storing without a file name , then this folder will be used as standard for dialogue with saving . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the kno@@ b ... &quot;
&quot; this parameter defines a picture pre@@ fix for the automatic par@@ amount of images and it is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog to save . the automatically stored image receives a numer@@ ical suff@@ ix of each time is stored , when a picture is saved . the string # # is replaced by the numbers . &quot;
&quot; the user can customize the storing quality . this value also changes the compression value while saving . if select the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used . &quot;
the kno@@ b help starts the KDE help with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; -@@ manual . the Button About the KDE About the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to finish &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite .
&quot; &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is licensed under the GPL , and the lib@@ ks@@ ane library , which is used by &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite . attention : li@@ bs@@ ane is licensed under the GPL with an exception . &quot;
&amp; AMAR@@ OK ; used as all other programs keyboard short@@ cut . below you will find a list of this p@@ unch and its function . the global keyboard short@@ cuts Set up by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window and select Global keyboard short@@ cut by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window and select short commands ... select .
you may also set existing multimedia keys so that they work as &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; -@@ short commands . this way you make your keyboard to &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; -@@ Control Centre .
&quot; the D@@ CO@@ P interface of AMAR@@ OK has many general functions that are mostly in other KDE programs . this section consists of six parts and should describe the D@@ CO@@ P features of collection , context @-@ browser , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists and scripts . an example call for the D@@ CO@@ P function , could look like : &quot;
AMAR@@ OK supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; KDE ; . in addition , AMAR@@ OK still has some own command line options . &quot;
&quot; you should give the user a feedback , if the script can not be executed because of any absence of dependence . please check in your script if all required modules are available and use dialog , so that the user ID , why a script is not running . &quot;
starting &apos; corrupt &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Er@@ ror error = &apos; basket ( KDE bind@@ ings for Ruby ) from k@@ de@@ bind@@ ings v@@ 3.4 is this for this script . &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit
&quot; in the folder Scrip@@ ts , you will find a lot of templates scripts in many different languages . you can use them as a basis for your own scripts , or simply control the required functions . you will quickly find that writing of scripts are relatively simple . &quot;
&quot; with the help of D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can be shared with AMAR@@ OK and AMAR@@ OK . the easiest way is the use of the command d@@ co@@ p ; which every KDE installation should be installed . &quot;
most scrip@@ ting languages allow the align@@ ing of external programs and commands . this is usually used as ex@@ ec &gt; relatively easily . here is an example in Python :
&quot; &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; sends noti@@ fications to all ongoing scripts . for this reason , scripts should be constantly monitor and responding to events . of course , a script should also ignore the events if there is no use for it . &quot;
&quot; configure the script to display the setup dialog . to save the save and loading of the setup data , each script must take care of each script itself . when a script is started , AMAR@@ OK the work folder will be stored on the folder where all data should be stored . &quot;
tr@@ ack@@ Change sign@@ alized that a new piece is played . the script could now be downloaded &amp; eg ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions further information about the new piece ( for example the metad@@ ata or the piece length ) .
vol@@ um@@ e@@ Change new@@ Volume sign@@ alized a change of volume . the new volume is an int@@ eger between 0 and 100 .
&quot; customize Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu item@@ ti@@ le . Inclu@@ des the path to the selected files of the playlist , when a user @-@ defined menu item can also be transferred to the script to remove the d@@ co@@ p AMAR@@ OK script re@@ mov@@ e@@ Custom@@ ized It@@ em ( sub@@ menu item@@ ti@@ le ) . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; it ends , or if the user stops a script , sends &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to do e.g. Au@@ fr@@ aming work . this signal includes e.g. the saving of data or configuration settings . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ah script management can also install script packages that can be downloaded , the user &amp; e.g. ; by a web@@ server name ( .t@@ ar ) , which can also be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ b@@ z@@ 2 ) , so that the user can see the archive clearly as a AMAR@@ OK script package . &quot;
&amp; AMAR@@ OK ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the Advanced Bro@@ ok@@ script . for this reason you should name your script packages right .
&quot; the main cri@@ pts must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar @-@ Parameter -@@ p to get the file rights : &quot;
&quot; when your script package is ready , you can upload it on www.k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.org and link to the Wi@@ ki Skri@@ pts page from &amp; AMAR@@ OK . for your entry to KDE @-@ apps you should use the category AMAR@@ OK ; script Use . &quot;
&amp; AMAR@@ OK ; is an audio player for &amp; KDE ; &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; has many useful and powerful functions and still is surprisingly simple to use .
&quot; with &amp; AMAR@@ OK , you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus instead of using endless menus . with &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; &apos;s collecting browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds . &quot;
&quot; maybe you have already some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which you want to hear ? then the playlist is exactly the right for you . and if the decision is still hard to choose the dynamic mode and the intelligent play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria . &quot;
&quot; AMAR@@ OK has an excellent support for Ap@@ ples iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers IF@@ P and many other useful functions make them OK to the advanced audio player . AMAR@@ OK is intelligent , sexy and dirty - exactly the right to experience your music ! &quot;
&quot; usually , one has to enter in the basic folder of the AMAR@@ OK sources to compile and install the OK button : &quot;
&quot; since &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake use , you should have comp@@ iling no difficulties . if you encounter problems , please report it in the &amp; KDE ; mailing lists . &quot;
&amp; AMAR@@ OK ; has the most applications some options that you can enable or disable the configure script using the configure script . this is a list of available options .
&quot; for some of the comp@@ iling options , certain dependen@@ cies must be fulfilled , so that they can be used in the section system requirements . &quot;
&quot; enabled de@@ bug@@ ging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to be in the development of &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; you should full use full . &quot;
&amp; AMAR@@ OK ; can be set up without effort to set up dialog . the setup dialog has multiple card @-@ cards to set up the various functions from &amp; AMAR@@ OK .
&quot; player window pic@@ tured the player window in addition to the playlist , or off . if the option is switched off , only the play@@ lists ( play@@ g@@ t@@ Ju@@ K ) will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; use bar@@ ometer : this function is only available , if &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar was compiled . the option will switch the experimental function of the voting bar@@ ometer . &quot;
&quot; atmosph@@ eric strength : this function is only available , if &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . this will change the color scheme for the mood bar@@ ometer . &quot;
voting files in the music files : this function is only available when &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . otherwise the .@@ mood files in the storage folder of the appropriate music files . otherwise the .@@ mood files in the Settings folder of &amp; AMAR@@ OK ( usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / AMAR@@ OK / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) .
external browser : lets you choose which browsers from &amp; AMAR@@ OK to be started when a browser is required .
&quot; other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser , which is not located in the list above . &quot;
&quot; playlist when saving , save the current playlist automatically with the end of &amp; AMAR@@ OK . activate this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current playlist during loading . &quot;
&quot; relative paths for manually stored playlist : if you activate this setting , &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the memory location of the playlist , use . otherwise , the absolute position of music files is saved . &quot;
&quot; up @-@ up @-@ to @-@ date piece of play is visible when the play@@ lists are visible , in order to keep the play@@ lists at the running window always in the visible window area . &quot;
&quot; when changing the context , switch to the context @-@ browser automatically displays the context @-@ browser as soon as the next piece is played . &quot;
in the section appearance you can adjust &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; the section is sub@@ divided into three parts .
&quot; in the fonts section , you can use the use of different fonts in &amp; AMAR@@ OK . you can select fonts for the following area : play@@ lists windows , player window and context browser . click on select ... , so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog . &quot;
with the selection user @-@ defined color scheme you can define yourself the Qu@@ al of the choice and can specify a color scheme . use the registered color scheme for front and background color .
&quot; to continue playing with the start , that &amp; AMAR@@ OK , after the program start playing automatically with the piece on the spot , with which it was stopped during the last finish . &quot;
the sub@@ window on @-@ screen display allows you to disable the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display you can use the O@@ SD display and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly .
&quot; the first option is the font . click on select ... to select from the dialog to select the desired font for the O@@ SD . the An@@ xi@@ feld shadow causes , that the text in the O@@ SD sh@@ aded . &quot;
&quot; our own colors will give you the opportunity to adjust the O@@ SD colors for scrip@@ ture and background . a click on the color @-@ surfaces opens the dialog for color choices . if any colors do not use , the pres@@ et &amp; KDE uses are used . &quot;
the input field text presents the text shown in the O@@ SD . by typ@@ ing places the O@@ SD can be adapted to your needs . below you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
the screen screen is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . this allows you to specify on which screen of a multi @-@ way monitor environment should be released .
the card card audio output allows you to select an audio @-@ driver from the selection field . some drivers will enable further entries in this map card .
the card collection will be used to set up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
&quot; here you can select the folder that should be downloaded &amp; AMAR@@ OK to browse through music files . to select a folder into the collection , beside his name . this section also contains links to display , such as with the selected folders . &quot;
browse sub@@ folders : this causes that &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; both the crossed and their sub@@ folders to music .
&quot; monitoring : allows &amp; AMAR@@ OK , to monitor the selected folder on changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . furthermore , a incre@@ mental search will be done to make the necessary changes to your collection . &quot;
play@@ lists import : causes that &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; all found play@@ lists in your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection then appear later in the playlist browser .
the part Coll@@ ecting database is used to select a database for the collection . the Com@@ bin@@ ations field driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ ql . if My@@ S@@ ql is needed for further establishment in the sub@@ window My@@ S@@ ql setup .
&quot; the paragraph My@@ S@@ ql setup is used for setting the database for &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; it is set to enter Port : the network port , under which the database is accessible , under which the database is made . name : is the database name , which the connection is made . &quot;
use user name : and password : the data required for the connection to the database is required .
the card card pay@@ .@@ f@@ m uses the support for loads .@@ f@@ m . &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; can provide the names of sponsored pieces to a load @-@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations concerning the current piece .
&quot; here , enter your username and password for your pay@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you do not have a profile , you can register one on the loaded .@@ f@@ m website . &quot;
&quot; to send out pieces and thus update the profile : this setting allows it &amp; AMAR@@ OK , the names of the sponsored pieces to your load @-@ profile . &quot;
&quot; similar interpre@@ ters are viewing : after activation of this setting , &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; a list with similar interpre@@ ters to be played at the same time . note : you do not need a load @-@ loaded profile to use this function . &quot;
&amp; AMAR@@ OK ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; eg ; Linux ) . further information can be found in the summary of the functions and gallery with screen@@ shot .
&quot; AMAR@@ OK only needs the package k@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other KDE packages . you must have k@@ deli@@ bs so installed ( including the programs included , because &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; needs some of them to find such as modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide on how to get k@@ deli@@ bs minimal . &quot;
&quot; some features such as O@@ SD stops ahead that your f@@ enn@@ erman@@ ager holds the relevant standards of a es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will thus work , but flu@@ x@@ box will work for example , but we are trying to support AMAR@@ OK on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because they represent an excellent development environment . &quot;
&quot; probably , one of your files will take a mistake in the Tag@@ Li@@ b library to days . you can see the file wis@@ ely by clicking in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / AMAR@@ OK / collection _ scan@@ .@@ log . after that , you can delete the file and create the collection again . &quot;
mostly lies that Tag@@ lib when reading the Met@@ a @-@ Info from this file cr@@ ashes . please report this bug to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developer under bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; if you use MySQL as a database , you can try SQ@@ Lite . the support for this in &amp; AMAR@@ OK , is a bit exhausted . &quot;
&quot; make sure that all of &amp; AMAR@@ OK , used by the same comp@@ iler version . if for example &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; with GCC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b , but with GCC 3.@@ 3.@@ x , then this leads to the editing of the met@@ a @-@ information . &quot;
&quot; if you use KDE with art@@ s@@ d , then disable automatic . off , if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or do not use any value of 1 second . &quot;
you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail will automatically open at a crash ) . if it comes to a frequent crash , the error will be guaranteed . &quot;
&quot; this is that many program details will write data as U@@ TF @-@ 8 into the met@@ a @-@ info , but do not record the problem as Uni@@ code script . the following Perl script fixes the problem . &quot;
&quot; # ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; &quot; The file $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib@@ - &gt; new ( $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ) ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; error when writing the tags from $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; &quot; $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; U@@ TF@@ 8 ) ; &quot;
this script uses the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be installed using this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos;@@ install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &apos;
&amp; AMAR@@ OK ; s icons in the status bar ( random mode ) see KDE 3.@@ 4.0 always . this is a well known bug in KDE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes you can click the Status De@@ activated on Gra@@ u and semi @-@ transparent . note that in some cases you have to click on a symbol until three times click on a symbol until this setting has its effect .
if you get this mistake : amar@@ ok@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ Pix@@ map , then check if AMAR@@ OK the correct Q@@ t library . this allows you to see with ld@@ d &apos;@@ which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BAR _ gre@@ p Q@@ T . &quot;
&quot; to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ating Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that AMAR@@ OK is the right version first . &quot;
there are some ways . most installation problems clari@@ fied by the help of a experts your Uni@@ x@@ - or Linux distribution . you can also use help with other users or in the developers . use them the forum and IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ de@@ .net in the channel # AMAR@@ OK .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please enter there only one mistake if you &apos;re somewhat at the Beh@@ ance of an error in AMAR@@ OK .
after the start of &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; only a blank playlist appears as there are music pieces now ?
this is easy . use the file browser on the left side and open the folder you want . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
&quot; to keep the interface intui@@ tively , the start of sub@@ window will be converted into the Statis@@ tics window . you will find it under extras statistics . &quot;
the meaning of these symbols has changed with AMAR@@ OK 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are calculated for the evaluation by the user while the points are automatically calculated .
to evaluate pieces must be displayed in the playlist the list of the playlist and select column . click anywhere in the new review column . you can also use the short@@ list of Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works when AMAR@@ OK in the background .
&quot; select the files you want to remove , and then click on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then select a playlist from the un@@ fol@@ dable menu . &quot;
drag a playlist file with the mouse to the playlist and let them fall there exactly how you can make it with other files too . as simple is that : - )
&quot; in the tool of the playlist , right next to the Add button , you will find the button playlist . click on it . &quot;
probably the program x@@ m@@ ms @-@ config is missing the program x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel and install &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; new . take a look at lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ alis@@ ations . &quot;
the equ@@ ali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( above the right mouse button ) . also you can find it via the menu bar under extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
&quot; no . yes , this really is true ! none ! &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; uses one from the back@@ end independent approach , so the actual question is what media types supports G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we support you pretty much every conceivable audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even add text and PNG ! &quot;
&quot; it may ! maybe use Fed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which are not supplied in default no MP3 deco@@ ders ( from pat@@ ent@@ legal reasons ) . the solution : old @-@ F2 , g@@ g : Red@@ hat mp3 KDE , input aste &quot;
start the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . na so ... &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; plays MP3 &apos;s from : - )
if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa . a mix@@ er allows several applications to use the device at the same time and can be used simultaneously audio . this can be reached by a sound card with hardware mix@@ er ( e.g. SB@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( e.g. SB@@ Live ) . take a look at the assistance of D@@ SA for AL@@ SA .
the output of this command should help you find the problem of problem and a solution . for g@@ Stre@@ amer you may need to specify a different s@@ ink ( e.g. oss@@ om ) .
&quot; this does &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; already , you don &apos;t forget that media is first de@@ co@@ ded , you would just see a wh@@ ist@@ ing . G@@ stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ co@@ ded them and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
&quot; also X@@ M@@ MS de@@ co@@ ded the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can print directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine . &quot;
use either the G@@ stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open control centre Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System ( warning , see next point of FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ s@@ wr@@ ap@@ per su@@ id is set : &quot;
&quot; at KDE 3.@@ 2.@@ X there are problems with C@@ SD code@@ cs that can cause re@@ gest@@ ed play . read this error report . read this error report . please read this error report . enlarge the Sound Pu@@ ff@@ ers in your AL@@ SA @-@ furniture file .@@ as@@ ound@@ r@@ c can also help . &quot;
&quot; either do not use the Arts driver , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install KDE Multimedia completely to get the faster Arts code@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; pres@@ um@@ ably use the Arts driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine @-@ driver has been greatly optimized for Analyzer ) , or reduce the size of the Arts buffer in control centre and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . each smaller the buffer , the less income react to visu@@ alis@@ ations . yes , this is a mistake , please help us to fix it . &quot;
&quot; G@@ stre@@ amer is installed , but when I want to switch to the G@@ stre@@ amer driver , cr@@ ashes &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; why ? &quot;
&quot; after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you must register all the components . run G@@ ST register to register all the G@@ stre@@ amer components . &quot;
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if this not helps you can also ask the IR@@ C channel # g@@ stre@@ amer .
&quot; try this ( finish AMAR@@ OK previously ! ) : - Upload you down , compile and install it . then run the module folder with G@@ ST @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run G@@ ST register again . start now &amp; AMAR@@ OK . &quot;
please tell of it under bug@@ s.@@ k@@ .@@ org. if you have a complete list of proposals and wishes please send them the best to our mailing list : AMAR@@ OK @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ s@@ ource@@ forge@@ .net .
&amp; AMAR@@ OK ; is an album of the British Mike vintage field . I like it very and find that the name sounds good . also the name the magical K ... : )
thanks to D@@ CO@@ P that is already possible . place an alarm in your calendar program and let you run with the alarm of this command : d@@ co@@ p AMAR@@ OK player play
&quot; this command leaves &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; playing back , make sure that &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; runs before you go to bed then you will be washed away from the soft pot@@ ato of music that you have stopped in front of the bed . &quot;
how can I get the current title in &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; ongoing title when you &apos;re on another computer ?
if a functioning SSH environment is present you can proceed as follows . diesel command gives you interpre@@ t and titles of the current piece : SSH -@@ i ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ R@@ SA ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ user name AMAR@@ OK player now@@ Play@@ ing
replace IP address with your IP and your user name with your username . this implies that your identification in the file ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ R@@ SA is present .
the visu@@ alis@@ ations can be separated from &amp; AMAR@@ OK ; click on the keyboard and the current Analyzer opens in an independent where changing windows .
the combination of string + right mouse button puts one piece in the client order sequence into the queue in queue . by pressing the entry table after a search in the playlist the first search results will be played and the search returned .
&quot; OK , the player window and the playlist have tri@@ ck@@ rich functions , but what about the icon in the system @-@ section of the control bar ? &quot;
click with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; on the title of a browser . in the context menu you can select which browsers are to be displayed .
my personal folder $ HO@@ ME is located on a N@@ FS drive . after the start of AMAR@@ OK the collection database cannot be created and on the console you will appear many error messages .
&quot; the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; AMAR@@ OK , does not work with N@@ FS . either you need ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / AMAR@@ OK to a local drive , or use amar@@ o@@ K@@ s MySQL support . &quot;
&quot; insert the CD , then click on the audio CD in the menu . it opens a file browser with multiple folders . to use it in the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them into the desired destination folder in a con@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic code , take files from folders mp3 or og@@ g . &quot;
&quot; Q@@ Str@@ ing@@ List values = query ( Q@@ LE@@ CT play@@ counter , creat@@ ed@@ ate , &quot; F@@ ROM statistics &quot; &quot; W@@ HER@@ E ur@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; &quot; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( &apos; s ) ; &quot;
&quot; basically , this fits the previous rating with a dimin@@ ishing value , based on how often the piece was played . the more often the piece was played , the less influence has any individual rating on the final result . &quot;
&quot; you can enter the review for a piece of yourself by clicking with the right mouse button in the playlist window . then , select the evaluation of a piece of the same as all other attributes , namely by clicking with the right mouse button on the piece and edit editing : review or edit F2 . you can edit the assessment also in the dialog metad@@ ata . &quot;
&quot; the developers do not want to show you when you have to publish a stable version of AMAR@@ OK . this means , KDE packages have created a fixed release plan that can &apos;t be put together with the short notice plan of AMAR@@ OK . &quot;

&quot; open dialogue &quot; &quot; Burn &quot; for the current project . this dialog is basically the additional button burning , the &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; for burning the medium , can only open when the project contains data already . &quot;
opens the properties dialog for the current project . here you can create many project related settings . each project type has different possible settings that will be described above the What is this ? help ( reachable via the right mouse button ) .
this entry will only be used with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it is useful when you use files for a multi @-@ meeting CD . this is useful when using files for a multi @-@ meeting CD . it is useful for you to be used as help so that you can see the files already existing files and folders .
&quot; this entry will only appear with an active data CD / DVD or video @-@ DVD project . this function is called &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; , imported files from the current project . this function remo@@ ves no files from the medium , it bl@@ ends just the previously imported files back . &quot;
&quot; opens the CD copy dialog . this allows also to create an image of a CD to another medium . alternatively , you can also burn just an image of a CD to another medium . alternatively , you can also want to burn u@@ tilizing instead of normal cop@@ ing . you should also prefer to copy CDs with def@@ ective sectors or video CDs . &quot;
&quot; opens the DVD Copy dialog . this also allows copying DVD to another medium . alternatively , you can also burn just a picture of DVD to another medium . alternatively , you can also burn just a picture of a DVD with the help of copying . alternatively , the target medium must be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source media in the original form . &quot;
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ R@@ W . this allows you to delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ R@@ W .
&quot; opens the dialog to form@@ atting a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) form@@ atting , making the content completely deleted . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the writing mod@@ i over@@ write and incre@@ mental . &quot;
&quot; bur@@ ns an earlier CD @-@ image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c -@@ file as a data source that is then immediately supported by pressing the burning button . ( N@@ ero * .n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , therefore you have to use other tools such as Nr@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . ) &quot;
bur@@ ns an earlier DVD subscription . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso file as a data source which then can be burned down by pressing the burning button .
&quot; a previously started DVD video can be converted . this dialog window usually appears after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used can also be used . it contains information about the original video , enco@@ der settings and even possibilities for changing the size and cutting black edges . &quot;
displays information about the covered medium . this information is displayed in the content view and include properties of the medium e.g. size and title @-@ length of CD or DVD .
&quot; shows a list of the tool used by &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; when an entry is crossed , the tool is currently visible in the main window . &quot;
&quot; when this is crossed , a small bar on the bottom of the window appears . it contains information about the status of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not crossed , the status bar is un@@ folded . &quot;
&quot; switch folder view or folder . the folder view contains an overview of your folder and CD / DVD drives . if the content view is activated , whose content is displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media information , locking and un@@ locking the drive or throw of the medium . &quot;
&quot; switched on view , or out . the content view enables the extract and opening files into the project view . the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , provided a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view . &quot;
&quot; the head@@ line in the project view is a or off . the head@@ line is a narrower area , which contains only visible when the project view has no real function , it looks just pretty and separates the project view clearly from the remaining views . &quot;
&quot; this opens a dialogue window to change the keyboard arrangements for &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after one has chosen the commands in the upper part , you can adjust the keyboard order to go down . &quot;
&quot; this starts the K@@ 3@@ b ; setup assist@@ ants . this allows the correct permission to burning CDs and DVDs . therefore , system administrator must have to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) . &quot;
opens the settings of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; here you can work general programs . almost all functions of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; should work on an@@ hi@@ eb . this dialog is meant to person@@ alize and tuning the program .
&quot; &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; KDE ; -@@ applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; -@@ interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script . &quot;
&quot; to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; features , you can either use the command line program d@@ co@@ p , or the somewhat more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in functionality , therefore rather your taste and the way of your task is decisive in which the programs you specify . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter we take note that you can use the command line program d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; features , you need to make sure that &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; then you have something like the following at the console : &quot;
&quot; besides the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; features , all &amp; KDE ; -@@ program realized , supported &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts that are described below . &quot;

&quot; &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ reader for &amp; KDE ; and with him , you can easily be stored and stored in MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG files . also other formats are possible depending on the En@@ coder which is installed on the machine . &quot;
&quot; &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the interface of cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( comp@@ ress files on the hard disk ) and by many enco@@ ders ( compressed files ) . currently , l@@ ame for O@@ G@@ Gs and FLA@@ C ( comp@@ ress ) have to be installed from the Linux distribution ) . further enco@@ ding can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) . &quot;
first the titles of the &amp; CD are read and stored in WAV files on the computer ( loss@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
are usually comp@@ ress in a second step these WAV files ( usually one per title ) compressed into the MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG format or also in other formats as the loss@@ less FLA@@ C .
&quot; for the first step , the reading of the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this has to be done now . &quot;
&quot; the second step must be installed for the second step ( for MP3 ) , O@@ gg@@ Vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ding packages already exist , but it is very likely not necessary to compile some of the Linux distribu@@ tions . however , only the enco@@ ding packages will not be used . however , if FLA@@ C is not used , its installation is also not required . &quot;
which Ko@@ di@@ er@@ er- / File Format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction over Ko@@ di@@ erer , audio quality and compression factors . &quot;
&quot; a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : how already said , used &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read the protection of audio data ; if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; it is not possible to avoid any protected audio CD ; if not prevent the mechanisms of cop@@ ing protection . avoid the purchase of cop@@ ing protected audio CD ; s ! &quot;
&quot; while the set @-@ up needs to be done only once ( the setup dialog can be found so often , the daily handling of a &amp; CD ; it will be explained in the hard drive . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the sl@@ ender approach of the user interface , which you can often stum@@ ble at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; can convert to many formats - depending on which Ko@@ di@@ erer programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) &quot;
&quot; can &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB from the internet , or can work completely without network , with everything is collected manually . &quot;
&quot; this is just a short list of commands of the main window . on the page step by step example , more information , how this program is used as well as screen@@ shot with descriptions of the tab@@ s for the configuration of the program . &quot;
&quot; starting the CD@@ DB request of the CD @-@ Data according to the establishment of request in the CD@@ DB . ( this can be locally or online , the latter case must first be made connection to the Internet . ) &quot;
start reading and - if a En@@ coder is configured in the tab enco@@ ding settings in the set @-@ up enco@@ ding - the enco@@ ding .
&quot; opens a sub@@ menu with a list of available En@@ coder , so that the selection can be read with another En@@ coder than the standard version . it is to be noted that previously the En@@ coder is configured in the tab enco@@ ding settings in the set of dialog . &quot;
opens the file manager so that an already selected file is selected instead of a full &amp; CD ; add and to co@@ ad .
opens the setup dialog to configure the type of notification ( such as protoc@@ ols , Pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for programs ( how to read the &amp; CD ; finished ) . &quot;
&quot; opens the main input dialog of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different card cards ( such as En@@ coder , for setting up the en@@ co@@ ders ) . here you need to go before the program can be successfully used ! &quot;
this chapter describes audio quality , enco@@ ding and comp@@ ress@@ ors and helps you choose the right Ko@@ di@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information should be lost , a loss@@ less audio format is needed . besides FLA@@ C there are also other such as &quot; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; which may possibly be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are the low compression rates and barely available commercial devices that can play these files . &quot;
&quot; under the audio formats , the information through data comp@@ ress depending on their psycho@@ ak@@ usti@@ ble model are the most common . O@@ GG today have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 kb@@ ps ) , but above this bit@@ rate the differences are less important as both Ko@@ di@@ ers are very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; o &apos; not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is still supplied with most distribu@@ tions for free , but there are open license questions &quot;
+ high up to very high quality quality ( at high resolution ) but compared to O@@ GG slightly deeper quality in low bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music belongs to one computer or computer @-@ based music system and / or when one of the few existing O@@ GG @-@ play@@ tools are present .
&quot; MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special car stereo system . today - initially , 2009 - support these devices mostly only the MP3 format . &quot;
a short list with parameters to audio quality and resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This attitude is good transparency for most people and most of the music
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This attitude should usually offer for most people and most musical compositions acceptable transparency , and has quite high quality . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 kb@@ ps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 kb@@ ps for complex tunes and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 kb@@ ps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . needs always 256 kb@@ ps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos;@@ = 128 kb@@ ps C@@ BR shared stereo , compression rate about 11 128 kb@@ ps for all pieces of a title . good Gen@@ ug for music of young people , portable devices and auto@@ oster@@ e@@ o@@ installations . but not good enough for better Hi@@ Fi stereo . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ kb@@ ps C@@ BR . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you necessarily want to have the absolute highest quality without regard to the file size , then select this setting . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; CD ; information , which manually entered or retri@@ eved from the free@@ DB via the Internet , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / used with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the enco@@ der program to generate the folder and file name as well as the properties of the music files . &quot;
&quot; in connection with enco@@ ding programs , there is often a combination of programs for the enco@@ der and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the co@@ di@@ ers explain the switches for these programs . &quot;
e.g. to add the &amp; CD ; title to the keyword ( English : day ) when MP@@ 3@@ s with l@@ ame is to be added ; the switches has to be added by l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; the result looks like this : &apos; ... &apos; tt { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button @-@ drawing in assist@@ ants ) :
&quot; this is what the free@@ DB is : a free database where persons can download the audio @-@ CDs , so that all other information can download instead of the machine : &amp; CD ; title , artist , names of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not by the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal , but I am legal , but I am not attorney . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; yet no one can prevent the artist nor the music company . however , all information can be associated with a b@@ um@@ mel through a &amp; CD ; business , physically or virtual . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is actively an acc@@ ord . for the use of free@@ DB can not be used as the used in the system . in this type of configuration , it appears , the e @-@ mail address will not be used by the server ( This can only know the programmer who has checked the code . ) &quot;
&quot; there are in many countries copies of the main database . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; used for the use of free@@ DB , the geographical position should be used in the next section of the Spieg@@ el@@ server . this saves bandwidth on the network and resem@@ bles the load between the machines . &quot;
a visit to E@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mir@@ rors for the online call of &amp; CD ; information while reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created for monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which output range is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
&quot; there are rum@@ ors that this cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used to know in source code .... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD ; it was always the best choice for reading audio CD ; it has always been installed , that the cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed first if this is not done . &quot;
&quot; for storing the selected WAV files , the enco@@ der and thus selected file format . at first opening are pre @-@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss@@ less compression for audio data ) on the tab for setting up the Ko@@ di@@ erer . other Ko@@ di@@ erer can be added on this tab . &quot;
the Ko@@ di@@ erer package must be installed by the Linux distribution before the Ko@@ di@@ erer . this is also necessary for the pre@@ defined co@@ di@@ erer . more information about Ko@@ di@@ erer are located in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
&quot; after installing a Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers , more information about his switches can be obtained through the input of a command like l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a con@@ soles window ( eg ; console ) . &quot;
&quot; this can have many causes . check the device name &amp; CD ; / DVD drives , the writing and reading for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) installed , both programs with a command line in a terminal . this could give an indication of what is wrong . &quot;
check if you do not want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; read the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
&quot; there is one chapter with one step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; have read the complete manual , everything understood , however , are somehow still uncertain what to do is ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by example , and you will get enough information to set the program exactly what you want . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we will start the program for the first time , all set up and read our first &amp; CD . we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; using MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) of 224 to 256 kb@@ ps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 keywords ( tags ) . &quot;
&quot; it must be cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . at least , it is not necessary to compile the source files you can of course always do . &quot;
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd is and that you have str@@ ing@@ ed upon it ( eg ; by trying to copy with the con@@ quer@@ or something into it ) .
&quot; the first section covers the basic set of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , something that probably only is done once and &quot;
&quot; the second section describes the procedure to read a &amp; CD , which must be repeated for each one @-@ saving &amp; CD ; &quot;
&quot; here we define the usable enco@@ ding of the music ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 kb@@ ps ) , as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 kb@@ ps ) and which structure is used to use the free@@ DB to download the &amp; CD ; data from the Internet . &quot;
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not be able to read them from any reading a &amp; CD ; change when once the appropriate settings are found . &quot;
the device @-@ designation is handed over to the les@@ see program to read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces can be read .
&quot; frequently , / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD @-@ Drive is available , so helps a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the entries available for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot;
the card @-@ card general settings . here &apos;s not much to do . here it can be defined for an additional conversion . in our example everything will be shown as shown as in the screen@@ shot .
&quot; only For full information , please select , so that you will be informed if information about the creation of keyword ( tags ) are missing . &quot;
the card card CD ; settings . simply both entries select . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD automatically download the Internet from a free@@ DB calculator .
note : the computer must be connected while reading the &amp; CD ; to connect to the free@@ DB server in order to connect to the free@@ DB server .
&quot; the second drop @-@ field is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry is found instantly the reading of the &amp; CD ; it is possible to change the reading name / fil@@ en@@ ame / en@@ ame name or tag entries , they can be easily changed with the database entry and the ID@@ 3 @-@ tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; KDE ; Tag@@ us . &quot;
&quot; apart from this example , if you want to manually enter it : if you want to manually enter the selection fields and free@@ DB will not use this twice . however , this can be selected using free@@ DB locally in the Off@@ line mode , the two selection fields must be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following map card . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB is for us free@@ DB . these are settings for the data request , for the call of the &amp; CD ; information of the free@@ DB server about the Internet . how does the system , which data is to get the CD ? read the section about free@@ DB . put everything in the screen@@ shot . &quot;
&quot; mode : we have not downloaded the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server . &quot;
CD@@ DB @-@ Server : please go to the CD@@ DB server and look after a mirror server in your vicinity . on this way the load is distributed among the computers . this setting will work as a first attempt .
&quot; both function equivalent to the server , but there are many fire@@ walls of 88@@ 80 standard , maybe more luck with the protocol 80 , since the &amp; HTTP ; protocol is usually open to surf the Internet . &quot;
in this example we do not want to transfer any &amp; CD ; data to the free@@ DB server .
simply take the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure that the folder / tmp on your computer exists )
&quot; number of simultaneously active pieces : sorry , there is a reason why more than one simultaneously in just an existing drive ? parallel reading and code ? the author doesn &apos;t know , therefore just try . &quot;
&quot; CD ; after reading the last piece , you will throw out about the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process . &quot;
&quot; user @-@ defined folder for temporary files : if you specify this tab , then the path is specified / folder to be stored in which the WAV files will be stored . this folder will not be useful when you don &apos;t want to do the files in the private folder . if you do not forget this folder , if you want to do something with the WAV files . &quot;
&quot; all , just enter as it is on the screen@@ shot . the command is somewhat long , under circumstances something must be bent to the right to see everything . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , it is a set for very good audio quality , even for very good Hi@@ Fi stereo . the compression rate is average about 224 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption . &quot;
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the restriction on the production of tags to version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1 . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; ID@@ 3 &apos; Tag@@ ger for &amp; KDE ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input line ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
put the rest like in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside this example :
&quot; number of simultaneously to co@@ di@@ cal WAV files : with a Dual@@ core or Quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor engine can be tried , more than a WAV file at the same time . &quot;
&quot; this is , we just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; this configuration is used as standard for each reading of a &amp; CD ; when you have chosen the organisational structure of your music , you will never need to change it again . &quot;
&quot; in this section is described , as the process of the les@@ see of the &amp; CD ; on the hard disk drive . we will create MP3 files . the folder structure , as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data of the free@@ DB will need to be described in this section , must be repeated for each selected &amp; CD ; to be repeated . &quot;
&quot; since we use a &amp; CD ; do not use the screen@@ shot a little different from the data for a &amp; CD ; with successful of free@@ DB files . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manual , instead of sending them out of the internet . comments will point to the differences . &quot;
try not the &amp; CD ; this example is to be found . it is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this handbook .
&quot; if this is not done yet , so the &amp; CD must now be defined in the drive , which was defined in the main window . &quot;
&quot; after a short moment the pieces and their length in the window should be listed , just as in the screen@@ shot . this only when the &amp; CD has been identified ; as an audio CD ; it could be identified and by cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
if this does not happen then you are searching for questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section on the default settings .
&quot; attention : if the &amp; CD was successfully fet@@ ched by the free@@ DB , all titles of the pieces are already completed and also the name of the artist and the album is shown . &quot;
&quot; in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; key for your &amp; CD ; there will be a window built , and you can select the database entry that best suits your &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; if you do not have the certificate for the automatic query of free@@ DB ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in dialog for the settings ) , you can also manually trigger by choosing the first button in the toolbar . if you do not have a local database but you need the data from the internet , you need the connection to the Internet . &quot;
e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD @-@ Editor - input of the CD @-@ data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; refresh title &apos; to the rest of the data in the input field &apos; album &apos; .
the artist must no longer be given in the input field &apos; refresh title &apos; unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece .
the sub@@ comment field can be used for the individual comments of ini@@ di@@ ligence per piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply to all pieces of the CD . &quot;
&quot; attention : after the successful call of the data from the free@@ DB , the CD Editor is not empty , but it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor . however , it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor ( e.g. if all words with major letters start or not ... ) but also to check if there are any unwanted comments . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ tags . this is limited the length of the fields on 30 characters for the comment , album and titles of a piece and on just 28 characters for the comment section . if you have an unlimited field length , at least in the tab enco@@ der settings ; take a look at the tab &quot; basic settings &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; you can change the tag information of the created files later on all times with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags . &quot;
tags will not be supported by all enco@@ ders or file formats . see in the help to Ko@@ di@@ erer to find more information .
&quot; simply select an entry that obviously is obvious with the style of the ad@@ missible CD ; this example is not important , since we do not transmit the &amp; CD ; -@@ data anyway , for further information go to the Website of Tr@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or R@@ ap for example are to be found at rock . &quot;
&quot; after choosing &apos; OK &apos; you return to the main window , simply click on the line with the second piece . &quot;
the window of the CD editor will be shown again and you &apos;ll see that the fields for the album have already indicated with the entered data . simply specify the entries for the fields of the current piece . enter the title of the piece to any case and other information you wish .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed to the same way until you have given all the title data of the &amp; CD ;
attention : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the free@@ DB . it is already sorted in one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the factory list . note that the artist and the album will be shown above the denom@@ inations .
&quot; note that it has a check @-@ signs prior to each line of a piece . only the titles are selected , select that all pieces are selected , or click the button Show all pieces select at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at one time . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on the button selection of the exit process , this window appears to confirm . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow the way . &quot;
&quot; click on the tab orders to switch to the order window . it is in the upper left half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool . &quot;
this is the window to check the orders . the first piece is being read straight on the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed on the left bottom of the window in the status line .
&quot; this error can be seen if you are trying to work with an enco@@ der , which you have not yet installed . pieces that have not been successfully co@@ ded with a red &apos; X &apos; in order list . &quot;
&quot; by the way , the folder for the tmp file and the target folder are not what we have entered here in example . do you have checked if you write access to the folder for the temporary files and the target folder ? ; - ) &quot;
&quot; now , it is clear that the error occurred directly after the end of the first piece . &quot;
&quot; the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the enco@@ ding of pieces 1 into the format MP3 . this is the status of the status of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
&quot; the author of the program has not found configuration settings to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that is configur@@ able , the result is un@@ clear . the used computer with a AM@@ D@@ 64 seems to have no problem with simultaneous reading and code ( of however two different pieces ) . &quot;
&quot; now the last title is read , while another piece is co@@ ded , and a third order in the queue of the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers stands . after the last piece is co@@ ded , a small window with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window appears . &quot;
&quot; for successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , you need &amp; KDE ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compression audio files such as MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the Ko@@ di@@ erer of your choice . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; it is maintained today within the &amp; KDE ; CV@@ S as part of the dem@@ ic package , however , you can download from there an anonymous copy here . most distribu@@ tions contain already a pre @-@ compiled package , since &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; a part of an important &amp; KDE page . if you read this , you have probably already done it ... &quot;
&quot; this section is directed to people who compile from source files , and not for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you are searching for help as the program can be customized to your needs , then the following is correct for you : &quot;
&quot; one program calls for many different programs , has many variations of settings . best read the step by step example to know the options and settings . it shows screen@@ shots of the different card maps of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example . &quot;
&quot; hello , still to read it ? even if only the help menu has been cli@@ cked to the first order of the program , without any point of view as it will go on from this somehow empty screen ( especially if at the time of the program boot no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ? &quot;
what is it ? who reads this has probably already started the program . it should somehow look like this :
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately , no e @-@ mail . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is meant as the first version of a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator . who is also always something useful to add or change it . at least only after the contact with the author . and if you read this , he did this section and is therefore agreed with this suggestion . &quot;
&quot; strange if it was able to get you the source file from &amp; KDE ; SV@@ N , then you do not need these information , but ... &quot;
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kar@@ a@@ ok@@ esp@@ an from &amp; KDE ; in addition to others it has not have some properties which are other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players don &apos;t have .
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; KDE ; supports also the &amp; Linux ; ultr@@ as@@ o@@ und @-@ project drivers , which is needed for CIS cards . AL@@ SA is included as soon as it is supported a sequence . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , so it is easy to follow the piece . &quot;
graphical representation of the activity of any MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the penet@@ rated buttons on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you can drag in &amp; KDE ; any MIDI file from a &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window on K@@ Mid .
supports the two existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( lyrics or tex@@ tures ) . K@@ Mid is automatically the used procedure .
&quot; seat support . if you end &amp; KDE ; during the play@@ ful of a song , K@@ Mid starts again with the same song again . &quot;
&quot; supports external MIDI @-@ syn@@ thesi@@ zer , AW@@ E , FM and CIS cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P -@@ driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first , you can select opening ... from the menu file . it appears the usual file dialog with which help you select the desired song . &quot;
you can also drop a file from a &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; window into the &amp; k@@ mid @-@ window . this works also with multiple songs at the same time .
&quot; to play a piece of music , open it and enter the button playing in the tool item , select the entry from the menu item or bed the Le@@ ert@@ ank . &quot;
&quot; please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts , as soon as you draw it on the &amp; k@@ mid ; ( with multiple pieces they will be added to a collection and then re@@ played each other . ) &quot;
&quot; once &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece of playing , you can jump at any point by using the middle mouse button and drive with the controller . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song is too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows left and right of the Tem@@ po@@ inters and so you can change the play@@ speed . to return the original pace , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
&quot; the Le@@ ert@@ apes has two tasks : if one piece is played , a pressure on the Le@@ ert@@ paste like a pressure on the button break or selecting the menu entry into menu pieces , thus dis@@ rup@@ ts the void during no piece is starting , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback . &quot;
&quot; lyrics can be stored on two types in a music piece . some pieces use tex@@ tures , others use Li@@ ed@@ tex@@ tures and again other both . some pieces have no text : - ) &quot;
&quot; in &amp; mid @-@ mid ; you can set what events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is used automatically , so you don &apos;t have to manually set the entry Autom@@ atic text selection automatically . however , you have the possibility to change this when you want to see the other way . &quot;
&quot; if you want to set an event type , choose from the menu settings to see the entries of text events or songs . the same function also have the keys 1 and 2 . &quot;
a collection is a list of MIDI files which you can summar@@ ize . these will be played in the row after . in this section how you can use collections efficiently .
&quot; to create a collection , first open the collection manager . these can be found in the menu collection under the point . click on New and give the name for the collection . &quot;
you can also copy a existing collection by clicking copying and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection is included at the beginning the same songs as the original one .
&quot; if you have more than one collection , you can adjust the bags in the collection manager . &quot;
in the temporary collection all songs you want to add to any other collection .
&quot; when using the application , this collection will not be saved . concerns that if you add many pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song with the button adding a song , with which help you select the desired song . &quot;
a second method to add a song depends on the adjustment of automatic adding to the collection .
&quot; if automatic adding is enabled , a piece of opening ( using the file opening or drag &amp; drop ) automatically added to the active collection . &quot;
&quot; when Autom@@ atically Add to the collection is not activated , when opening a piece the temporary collection is activated and pun@@ ished . this collection then will be added to the continued pieces . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you must open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click on removing . &quot;
&quot; you can select the order in which the songs can be played . if you select the number from the sub@@ menu subscription sequence of the menu Coll@@ ections , the songs are played in the order , as they have been added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; when you add songs or select or select random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ established . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the selection list above the kar@@ a@@ oke text . &quot;
&quot; to jump to a song further , select the button next song , the entry next song from the menu piece or push the button arrow to the right . &quot;
&quot; to jump around a song back , select the button item , the entry table from the menu item or push the button arrow to the left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collecting collection and click on the button . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not play any role since it is stored when leaving &amp; k@@ mid ; not saved . &quot;
&quot; this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thesi@@ zer , which are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ map General @-@ MIDI events in events that understands the syn@@ thesi@@ zer . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI map that leaves all the events of the typ@@ s Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the type Change patch to Tru@@ mp@@ et , and therefore always a trumpet sound if originally a piano should play . &quot;
&quot; if you only have a sound card , you don &apos;t need MIDI map , because all sound@@ cards GM -@@ compatible are ( incl . AW@@ E - and CIS cards , FM @-@ devices and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there are no programs to create MIDI maps . you need to edit the appropriate file of hand ( with your favorite editor ) . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI map is a text file , which saves all required conversion for playing a piece . &quot;
&quot; each section may only appear once , except the K@@ EY@@ MA@@ P section that may appear as often as desired . pre@@ condition for this is that each appearance has a different text id ( see below ) . &quot;
De@@ fine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D De@@ fine K@@ EY@@ MA@@ P &quot; Name of Key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D De@@ fine K@@ EY@@ MA@@ P &quot; A further Key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D De@@ fine CH@@ ANN@@ EL@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D Options ... EN@@ D
&quot; you see that De@@ fine is needed to show that a section begins ( except for Options ) and EN@@ D that the end of an interface is reached . &quot;
&quot; please send me your map file as an e @-@ mail , so that I can offer you in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can offer devices that are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ compatible . &quot;
this section is indicated as the pat@@ ches of General MIDI to your specific keyboard . the general use looks like this :
&quot; please note that the left side of the equ@@ ation is ignored . it is believed that the GM pat@@ ches are in the right order ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order and also do not leave a line for one of the 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; the optional all Key@@ s@@ To M is needed to put all sounds , who need this instrument to do with the number M ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with clay 60 ) , which is similar to the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section : &quot;
&quot; so if now a MIDI file is to play a note with Patch 127 ( Win ) , it takes a patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , regardless of what sound is in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that here with the term drum patch the patch is meant , where every sound is another Per@@ c@@ sion@@ ist ( drum , Marac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one that means sound the sound height of the always the same drum , ( as him possess some key@@ boards ) . &quot;
the K@@ EY@@ MA@@ P section is needed to show how sounds are pic@@ tured on a specific channel or instrument .
&quot; as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section , the sequence of lines is very important , as well as their presence . you have to create 128 entries . &quot;
you can define multiple key@@ maps for each channel and each instrument . you only have to use different names in the first line .
Key@@ maps are used mainly to form tones on the per@@ imeter channel . take a look at the supplied Key@@ maps .
&quot; this section can be used to form some channels to others . if you want to exchange the first and second channel , simply make it easy on the CH@@ ANN@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards , which have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; Midi devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ ANN@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section therefore has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , built according to the following pattern : &quot;
&quot; N is the channel which will be displayed on the channel . if you use the key@@ map option , the key@@ map must naturally continue to change in the file . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all the events will try to change the patch on this channel . in this case , then patch x is used . &quot;
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful for example to always use the per@@ imeter patch on the per@@ k@@ line channel .
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ can be multip@@ lied , in which relation Pit@@ ch Ben@@ der @-@ events are multip@@ lied with the value , this is used with the formula n * ( r / 4@@ 09@@ 6 ) and then only passed . the value 4@@ 09@@ 6 is used , so that in the map file no de@@ al@@ gam@@ ma is available ) . &quot;
&quot; this setting is needed because GM is that a keyboard , the Pit@@ ch Ben@@ der event will play with the value 4@@ 09@@ 6 to play a tone higher . unfortunately , try some key@@ boards to play two sounds up to an oc@@ t@@ ave higher . to find the right value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI map , simply open the MIDI settings . these can be found in the menu under Settings , point MIDI settings &quot;
&quot; the channel view is a window with a whole series of piano boards ( one for every MIDI channel ) . on these pi@@ anos , you will see which sounds are just played . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the channel view also to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel , there is a selection list where you can select an instrument that is no longer green but red to view that no more the original instrument is used . &quot;
the channel view has ( until now ) two different views to view the played sounds . view in the menu Settings below the point of channel view : settings
&quot; the speed @-@ LCD shows the speed to play with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the pace of a song . if you find e.g. , a song is too fast to follow the text you can slow it . to change the pace left and right from the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file that contains information on how to play a piece of music . it contains the notes , the rhythm , the speed , the speed , the speed , the speed , the speed , and etc . thus , the same MIDI file can lead to very different results , just as two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways . &quot;
&quot; well , I can &apos;t want to use anybody , &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs some 50 KB , while having a good syn@@ thesi@@ zer you get a similar sound quality . at a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything . &quot;
&quot; this can happen if you have compiled a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) of &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support you need to download a source distribution and install ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s home ) &quot;
&quot; I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I have no desire to add all files individually . &quot;
&quot; agree , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . open the folder you want to add in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; select all the files , and drag them onto the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window . &quot;
activate previously the adjustment of automatic adding to the collection . otherwise the files are added to the temporary collection .
you can click the arrow key on the left of Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow the playback . to restore the standard temp@@ o you can double click on the LCD .
I have on a &amp; KDE ; working surface a &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ( if I want to play a kar@@ a@@ oke file ) or if I want to play a car@@ a@@ oke file ( if I switch a car@@ a@@ oke file ) or to play a file only in the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window and drag the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ;
&quot; if you just want to listen to a file without adding to a collection , turn the setup automatic adding to the collection , and the new ; file will add to temporary collection . opening files &quot;
&quot; let us take you , you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . just want to play the first file up@@ loaded to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this a MIDI file . &quot;
then join B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid to create and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people have sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . all thank you ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , anim@@ ates me that , further on &amp; k@@ mid ; to program . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ J@@ im@@ en@@ ez ; in the third year , so I am not much free time for my hob@@ bies , but I &apos;m trying to take a bit of time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to collect a bit of time . as hob@@ bies I have programming , MIDI files , making music and show sentences . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know where they can download MIDI / kar@@ a@@ oke files , if you want a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you just want to make me happy , write to me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is.@@ es
&quot; you really make a huge pleasure for me if you send me a postcard from your residence or a MI@@ DI@@ - / kar@@ a@@ oke file from a local group , if you want to send me a postcard or a MIDI file ( if you want to send me a MIDI file , but if you want to contact me since I might have the file . &quot;
I wrote &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and I don &apos;t want to get money in my spare time . I therefore want to stress that I just get further programm@@ able because / when I get feedback from users ( post@@ cards or e @-@ mails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Kr@@ ler - Beh@@ ind the error that the pick @-@ up at AW@@ E cards was too high .
&quot; my thanks also goes to Jose L@@ us San@@ chez for the test of the CIS support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ ek@@ er , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Thor@@ sten Wes@@ er , Ulrich Cor@@ des and everyone who sent me a patch , a fault , or even a sup@@ por@@ tive e @-@ mail . &quot;
and of course my thanks also applies to all this excellent musicians on the net that give us this wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ a@@ oke files .
&quot; in addition to this , &amp; k@@ mid ; also on his homepage can be found at http : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is.@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .html . you can also find links to pages with other kar@@ a@@ oke songs , &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesi@@ zer , since the sound quality depends much on your sound@@ card . it is not the same if you use a FM device or a AW@@ E card . &quot;
&quot; if you have no sound card , you have to compile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DEM@@ O _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you could not hear a sound card unless you can of course listen to music . &quot;
&quot; if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; KDE ; -@@ mailing lists or send a fault directly to me . &quot;
&quot; a simple interface for M@@ Player , Ph@@ ono and FF@@ M@@ pe@@ g . the program is used to play video files from the M@@ Player or PH@@ ON@@ ON supported formats , as well as play DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera . &quot;
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished as &amp; KDE ; on this computer has been installed .
&quot; for additional help please check out The KDE website to new versions , or send the question to The &amp; KDE ; User mail@@ ings list . &quot;
&quot; the application window is formed from so called and@@ oque windows . there is always the window with the central view . either there is the window with the playlist . and finally , there is a information window that will only be displayed when information in it . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to make your favorite connections under the book@@ mark book@@ mark , but this are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played according to each other , you should use the category Dau@@ ghter playlist . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to obtain an additional hierarch@@ ies . if you copied an entry , its group and all its sub@@ groups to the current category is copied and the reproduction starts with the cli@@ cked entry . &quot;
&quot; the categories &quot; &quot; Current piece &apos; , television and thum@@ ous playlist can also be changed by direc@@ ting the XML configuration files . of course , one can only do if &amp; km@@ player ; it is possible to select the different files in the directory ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / apps . in addition , the different files in the directory ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / apps . &quot;
&quot; after changing XML files , the menu has to be selected from the same playlist and either the user mode selected , or another category selected . &quot;
all changes will be lost when the user mode or another group will be selected without the playlist .
as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; km@@ player ; some functions can only be switched by changing the XML configuration files .
the animation at the startup and finish can be disabled by the editing of ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ err@@ c and changing &#91; general Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ struc@@ ted option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be easily inserted . &quot;
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; km@@ player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / km@@ .@@ x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / ex@@ it@@ .@@ x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
&quot; the animation at the La@@ unch does not need to be short , it is automatically termin@@ ated by opening a different source . this would be dis@@ disturbing during the end @-@ animation , the user can therefore finish the application a second time . &quot;
a simple example of an Start animation can be the ads of a favorite shots : &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; m@@ g D@@ ur / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; meet ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; in the directory tests / some examples of S@@ MI@@ L are supported by &amp; km@@ player ;
&quot; there is a tab to configure M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; km@@ player ; here , the path from the M@@ Player and the storage size of the data stream from the network and other things can be adjusted . &quot;
a different tool for Trou@@ blesho@@ oting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool @-@ tool from km@@ player . here is the output of m@@ player visible .
&quot; there is no rider for this ren@@ dition in the configuration dialog of &amp; km@@ player ; . everything must be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ c . here is an example like a &quot; flash &quot; with the module sw@@ f@@ de@@ c @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa is played : &quot;
&quot; &apos; Flash &apos; can be played inside &amp; km@@ player ; it can even be inserted in the special field , for YouTube in the playlist XML . &quot;
&quot; in order to play the &amp; km@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; km@@ player does need to reproduce the &amp; km@@ player ; module as a service provider for the m@@ ime @-@ type ideas / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave flash in the set of dialog file regulations . &quot;
&quot; the Con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; km@@ player ; is in a con@@ soles application to search and after error messages can occur when loading the browser module library . if there is no mistakes , the back@@ end issue within &amp; km@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to always be a given back@@ end for a particular m@@ ime type ( naturally only if this has been identified ) , this must be done by manual change of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ c . for example , PH@@ ON@@ ON all og@@ g files will be re@@ play : &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ player ; can be installed from TV cards , either via M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be configured to use the scanner and the TV channels can be edited manually or the configuration file can be edited manually . &quot;
&quot; for configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( video data record ) settings in the km@@ player is the dialog in settings under - &gt; sources &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there , ports should be identified ( e.g. is PAL for West Europa ) , the correct name probably has a DV@@ B in it . &quot;
&quot; since the V@@ DR support of km@@ player can use only X@@ Video ( probably this kind of playing video equipment under Linux is the only one working ) . for this reason , the vide@@ o@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension for the X server function must therefore be used in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) , which is also included in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) . &quot;
&quot; internally are used by KM@@ Player for the sources of different names . at the time of the creation of these documentation , this dv@@ d@@ nav@@ source , ex@@ pi@@ source , t@@ v@@ anners , t@@ v@@ scanner , t@@ v@@ anners , v@@ cd@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . if they are activated , they begin with the playback of the playlist . &quot;
are there hints such as I le@@ verage my CD@@ ROM drive when I remove from him ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
&quot; yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is available as a user root after integrating the device . here is definitely sure to place that / dev / c@@ drom on the CD@@ ROM drive shows . &quot;
X@@ ine starts slowly and why each time my CPU must be tested on their performance ?
note : the answer is over@@ taking . k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the last stored value only the first time is x@@ ine the CPU .

new users have no worries . it is just a brief description of the functions and further information on this will be given in the section .
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; offers - just as other source Edit@@ ors - the high@@ lighting of the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . thanks to the modest appearance of output commands . however , it will be noticed by the modest appearance of the output file . however , you can save it by the modest appearance of the output file . &quot;
&quot; with automatic adjustment of the environments , when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) of &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically created a space ( for input of the text ) and the associated line ( e.g. \ \ &apos; { command } ) . this function can be de@@ activated in the menu ... La@@ TeX commands . &quot;
all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; Lat@@ ex ; author@@ izes the sub@@ divisions of the document into the following elements ( part is the most part and subtle item ) :
&quot; in the view of the document in the structural view , the individual elements can be seen through a mouse click on the respective box and be viewed . &quot;
in the creation of one &apos;s own &amp; Lat@@ ex ; files can be very helpful . once a DVI ; -@@ file &#91; ger@@ Ã ¤ te@@ ase file &#91; straight &#93; with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ viewer to the corresponding line in the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code .
&quot; a DVI ; file contains a description of the format , and also other information such as the font and is adjacent to PDF format type of &amp; Te@@ x ; or &amp; Lat@@ ex ; and there are many tools for viewing , conversion and printing of DVI ; files for various systems and scent . &quot;
&quot; when using the R@@ Ã ¼ s , the elements of the DVI ; file attached to the editor is shortened and once upon an element in the DVI ; -@@ source code was cli@@ cked on a section in the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code has been cli@@ cked at the corresponding place in the DVI ; -@@ viewers . &quot;
Master document : this function is used in working with multiple files . with a Master document the work with other integrated .@@ tex files will be simplified . with the use of a project a project can be set to project project settings .
quick @-@ making : the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; -@@ HTML text is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if no error in the source code are ) .
&quot; map : in this mode , the DVI ; -@@ file on the n@@ es@@ are@@ â &quot; . &quot; &quot; and there is no call of &amp; oc@@ ular ; according to the fast @-@ making . &quot;
&quot; when viewing the edit tool , the three gro@@ wers have been designed for quick installation of the document in parts , chapter , sections , sections , sections , ... The ver@@ itable &amp; Lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands for the sub@@ divisions are : &quot;
&quot; the drop @-@ field More is for example of articles such as key words , Fu@@ Ã . notes or references . the available options are : &quot;
&quot; name : with this command a name for a section , an image or different element is created . &quot;
cover : will be used to reference to a fixed name ( selection ) a selection field .
&quot; when using a quotation is indicated a selection list with liter@@ ary entries . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex , this is only necessary if the file is necessary to create a project . for the author has good experience with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; -@@ files can also be written in &amp; k@@ ile ; by hand . &quot;
&quot; the last drop @-@ field with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ e is used for setting the font size . it enables you to define the font , the joint notes , etc . there are the following letters : &quot;
&quot; with the call of &amp; k@@ ile , two choices for the creation of a new document by selecting the document type and fixing settings . 2 . the document can be written by reason at hand . &quot;
&quot; the stap@@ les after the command \ \ Docum@@ ent@@ class included the settings for the command . the settings &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; lays down the font size . it is not defined at the beginning , this can also be done in the text . &quot;
&quot; once the above source code has to be entered into instance , the &amp; Lat@@ ex has to be compiled . the easiest way for this is the use of the men@@ tile leg or button fast . &quot;
the source code must be stored before the comp@@ iling . &amp; k@@ ile ; for storing the storage automatically .
&quot; the comp@@ iling of the document commands should be sear@@ ched in the log according to the errors . when using quick construction , &amp; oc@@ ular ; automatically started . this is not the case , should also be observed . &quot;
&quot; one environment ( English . environment ) is a text that is treated differently than the remaining document . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ &apos; { environment } , \ \ &apos; and \ \ &apos; { Environment } . &quot;
the settings are only used within the area ( of \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ &apos; { environment } ) . there are no circum@@ cis@@ ion ( number ) for example within one environment .
&quot; there are many opportunities offered to the read@@ ability and usability of the document . it enables you to place certain fonts , hair pressure , hair pressure , under@@ wear , etc . these commands may either end with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment . &quot;
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the spa pressure and is long as long as it is closed until he is closed with a \ \ &apos; { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in one set can be displayed with \ \ emp@@ h { word } cur@@ sive .
\ \ Qu@@ ote : created a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ begin { Qu@@ ote } and ends with \ \ &apos; { Qu@@ ote } .
&quot; after the background to write the source code with the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; -@@ label language , now follows a step @-@ step guide for the creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; &quot;
&quot; as soon as the assistant was given a little text , a few adjustments for the better read@@ ability of the document should be accomplished . a quote , a few places in the fat and cur@@ ant pressure and a po@@ em to apply to see the differences of these commands . &quot;
&quot; once the document was viewed , using Editor View or Str@@ g E can return to the editor ( by internal viewer ) . with an external viewer , whose window must be closed . &quot;
&quot; once the DVI ; -@@ file was created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try and don@@ ate . &quot;
DVI ; is a remote file format ( engl . D e V ice I n@@ dependent ) . these files are created by &amp; Te@@ x ; or &amp; Lat@@ ex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .d@@ d@@ vi output such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF transform@@ ers or computer screen saver . &quot;
for printing a &amp; DVI ; file are the same steps as for the creation of the document ( see ) . during the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - then the document can be printed using the file printing ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is right ) .
the tool displays the transformation of the DVI ; file into other formats . as soon as the DVI ; file from the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code has been created , the transformation into washed out other formats by means of the b@@ umps . &quot;
the prior @-@ looking for direct jump from the editor to the related position within the DVI ; -@@ file .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Bin@@ Ã ¤ r@@ files . for this purpose only Modern under settings K@@ ile has set up ... Tools B@@ auen .
&quot; in order to equi@@ p the pre @-@ search , the mouse pointer must be positioned in a line of the source code and check back on prior notice . the jump to the corresponding place in the DVI ; -@@ viewer is then done . &quot;
with this feature in &amp; oc@@ ular ; with a click on the middle mouse button in the DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Document of &amp; k@@ ile ; must be set ; in &amp; oc@@ ular ; as text editor set ( settings oc@@ ular setup ... Editor )
&quot; should the use of quick construction of &amp; DVI ; -@@ viewer does not exist , an error can occur . should be a mistake , this is displayed in the log file or in the news window . &quot;
&quot; the log source file can be used in the source code . in the editor , the icons can always be used in which the errors appears to be cli@@ cked to click the faul@@ ty line , must be cli@@ cked on the errors in the log regulation and &amp; k@@ ile ; jump to the faul@@ ty line . &quot;
&quot; once click on the corresponding button in the toolbar , a window appears to choose the template template for the document . &quot;
&quot; when selecting a empty document , a document can be used either from scratch or the wizard for quick creation of a new document . more information can be found in the section . &quot;
&quot; accessed users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates enables you to place in &amp; k@@ ile ; created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new template , either an existing &amp; Te@@ x ; - / Lat@@ ex ; -@@ file requested or a new file will be created . &amp; k@@ ile ; can create a new template using an existing document and selection of file template from document . &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document , a template using a file will be replaced by other data ( e.g. name or string coding ) . this variable enables you to set up settings in settings . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which string labels are replaced by which variables : &quot;
&quot; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ TC@@ LA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ : this string is being replaced by entering documentation . typically , it is used as follows : \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ TC@@ LA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ &#93; { article } . &quot;
the easiest way to create a template is the use of assist@@ ants and the acc@@ ord of the commands in the editor . once the document is created in this way the following steps have been completed :
&quot; when creating a new document , your own template can then be selected instead of the standard . &quot;
a template may be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; a simple way to create a template should be looked after one on the internet and the steps described below described below .
&amp; k@@ ile ; uses &amp; K@@ ate ; as an internal editor . &amp; K@@ ate ; is a text editor for programmers with the possibilities of reading and herd of many different types of text files ( including &amp; Lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . there are many settings for you directly from &amp; k@@ ile ; and out of it .
to learn more about K@@ ate &amp; K@@ ate ; and his opportunities should be attracted to K@@ ate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; enables you to place the book directly with the reading of the chapter with the editor of &amp; K@@ ate ;
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; offers a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; instruction which can be called for La@@ TeX reference which can be found in &amp; Lat@@ ex ; use and their syntax .
a double @-@ click with penet@@ rated C@@ g button to select the &amp; Te@@ x ; -@@ word to select the &amp; Te@@ x ; -@@ word to select \ \ par of \ \ par \ \ big@@ . only \ \ par .
when loading the text with penet@@ rated lin@@ ker mouse button the selected text is automatically copied into the clip@@ board .
&quot; when using the arrow buttons , you can create parts of the source code in the editor window . &quot;
&amp; k@@ ile ; has the possibility to browse the most different types of source texts and to highlight them . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands from normal text and also the mathemati@@ cal form@@ ulas are highlighted by another color . &quot;
&quot; many assist@@ ants can also place a member of book@@ marks within the text . this is highlighted for its own type of book@@ marks within the text . the men@@ ace on the jump to the next or last spr@@ int . this is also highlighted , so that they are automatically generated by the first input of a drawing . &quot;
&quot; the editing is probably one of the main pe@@ al when using a program such as &amp; k@@ ile ; although &amp; K@@ ate ; already outstanding opportunities for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code , for the writing of one &amp; Lat@@ ex ; special commands for their selection . under Edit select the following commands for the text selection are included : &quot;
&quot; select a complete paragraph ( group of lines , which is contained on both sides a blank lines ) . with a paragraph there is not a text including through the tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands and all other lines of the source code . the only preventive thing in &amp; k@@ ile ; is thus that the price @-@ place is separated by two empty lines . &quot;
select the word under the current cursor position . this selection also has an extended meaning since this command also &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands with a return ( * ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
&quot; for example , one part of the document can be removed from the button . &amp; K@@ ate ; offers the key c@@ trl . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers its own commands for a faster delivery . under Edit Rem@@ ove the following commands include : &quot;
remove a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; k@@ ile ; is included in the description to edit them .
&quot; it has already been pointed out that environments play a central role in &amp; Lat@@ ex ; therefore , offers &amp; k@@ ile ; for further commands under the surroundings for another simple work with &amp; Lat@@ ex . &quot;
with this command there will be j@@ ump@@ ed to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to the hotel .
with this command will j@@ ump@@ ed to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the command to the treasures .
&quot; if the cursor is before or within the command \ \ begin { surroundings } , there will be j@@ ump@@ ed to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; when entering a lot of wast@@ es ambient commands , the command can quickly be lost . this command was close to the last setting , so that the frozen ambient structure is not possible . &quot;
&amp; k@@ ile ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ groups that are determined by stap@@ les { ... } . under Edit TeX group there are a few important commands that correspond to the Edit environment .
with this command there will be j@@ ump@@ ed to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the fl@@ ashing bracket .
&quot; with this command , the command will talk to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the wel@@ ded cl@@ amp . &quot;
when the cursor is before or behind the wel@@ ded cl@@ amp of a &amp; Te@@ x ; -@@ Group # located to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
&quot; when entering a lot of wel@@ ded groups @-@ brack@@ ets can be lost quickly the Ã ber@@ th anniversary . this command was close , so the n@@ ested structure of the &amp; Te@@ x ; -@@ groups are not justified . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; Lat@@ ex ; two simple beginnings are used in &amp; k@@ ile ; the sign &quot; &quot; for two simple beginnings is used . &quot; &quot; the sign &quot; &quot; for two simple beginnings is used . &quot;
this automatic entry of double characters can be set under settings K@@ ile ... La@@ TeX - and are sign@@ posted .
you can also use L@@ Ã ¤ n@@ der@@ specific settings ( e.g. n@@ german or french ) and thus German or French characters . there are also many other languages .
&quot; when it comes to Shift , input , the current position within a lists ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or item@@ ize ) is located in a lists ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or item@@ ize ) , but at the same time the command \ \ item . &quot;
within a tables - close to the same line ; the current line with \ \ \ \ \ with a close @-@ end back@@ casting .
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to support pre @-@ asked &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or Custom @-@ defined environments . this enables you to set up under settings k@@ ile ; set up to La@@ TeX .
&quot; some users m@@ Ã ¶ r the columns in tables , environments and thereby all the E@@ t character ( amp ; ) seeks to emp@@ ow@@ l ; for the next tab@@ ulator in the dar@@ ker line . although this tab@@ ulator is not the pert@@ inent to the columns position of the current tab@@ ulators . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; K@@ ate ; already offers a good source code , this in &amp; k@@ ile ; for special commands ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) are still extended . all of these modes can be set up different ways of working under settings K@@ ile . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning a new environment with the command \ \ begin { surroundings } , &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically the command \ \ &apos; { surroundings } according to a empty line ( for the text ) . &quot;
&quot; when the return of the R@@ Ã ¼ ck@@ key , the last letter is removed from entering and must be mist@@ aken by entering another letter also smaller . &quot;
&quot; all commands will be written with a brief description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions are supported by a command of a command . alternatively you can be a jump to these positions by using the spr@@ int button . &quot;
under settings k@@ ile ; Set up @-@ to @-@ date settings for these lists are being carried out . it enables you to place different wh@@ ales for these lists ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands as well as guar@@ dian of the general language used .
&quot; the command mode is for the finishing of environments not far . there are always a large number of letters with \ \ begin , and the call of the completion mode will be used as often , that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for spreading the environments . &quot;
&quot; when calling the complete editing mode or the keyboard button , the command to the optional , and it appears \ \ begin { . afterwards , the environment can be continued automatically and ended up by entering the entry key . &quot;
&quot; after this is done , the environment is automatically closed again . once &amp; k@@ ile ; recognis@@ es that it is about a lists environment , it is even a first \ \ item command . &quot;
under settings k@@ ile ; set up ... k@@ ile ; linking settings to these lists are used . this mode uses the wound mode for the complete mode of the complete mode for tea and lat@@ ex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands .
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; supporting user @-@ defined lists of deport@@ ations that will be replaced immediately by L@@ Ã ¤ n@@ g@@ ings , the exam@@ ple@@ .c@@ w@@ l , which includes the exam@@ ple@@ .c@@ w@@ l , for example the entry L = \ \ La@@ TeX . &quot;
&quot; for example , the letter L will be entered and the word completes mode , the letter string or the keyboard short@@ cut Str@@ g + Alt Le@@ ert@@ aste , the letter L is replaced by the string \ \ La@@ TeX . &quot;
&quot; indeed , you are not helpful for automatic contrac@@ tions in a document more than once . it offers &amp; k@@ ile ; for all already written books . &quot;
&quot; this mode can set up in the menu @-@ men@@ tions K@@ ile ... K@@ ile Open@@ ed wr@@ inkl@@ es can be set . here , the gay value for the ad can be set . &quot;
&quot; the complete files enables you to place the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / fashion / complete / fashion / the Persian home folder , Dic@@ tionary , or Te@@ x . &quot;
&quot; the dialog graphics designed for graphics as easy as possible . to see the foundations of the basic @-@ format , the sections should be observed and observed . &quot;
&quot; PS -@@ files are not as well known as PDF files , but offer a superb basis for a few &amp; Post@@ Script pages . the PDF output will be arranged and then you can be converted into a PDF file with ps@@ 2@@ pdf . &quot;
&quot; to place the result of the work , it must be compiled to create the source code . all construction tools are group@@ ed in the men@@ tions of creating comp@@ iling , creating and create a summar@@ ized . &quot;
&quot; for the comp@@ iling the source code , such as &amp; Oc@@ ular ; or the further conversion can be used the keyboard short@@ cut out by Alt ; 3 , by Alt ; 4 the DVI ; -@@ file in a PS -@@ file and by means of old ; 5 the PS -@@ file is seen . &quot;
&quot; when using the command quick construction is usually called a viewer after the comp@@ iling . should not be used to be used , every time a new window will be used . &quot;
a new project will be asked for the project about the project .... here you will find the following information for the project :
&quot; in addition to the file name window , the relative path must be specified from the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file . &quot;
the Script function of &amp; k@@ ile ; allows the utilization of EC@@ MA@@ Script -@@ Ko@@ de . scrip@@ ting scripts can be managed in the sen@@ k@@ right bar .
the API scripts are not yet developed and enables you to place yourself in further versions of &amp; k@@ ile .
&quot; first , it has to be said to be the most important setting of scripts in &amp; k@@ ile ; a system @-@ wide object ( = k@@ ile ) with the following methods : &quot;
&amp; Lat@@ ex ; is a quite distinct system in which the basic functions will be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers a lot of different aids for supporting users .
&amp; t@@ et@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ live ; are delivered with many documents . in it contain a documentation for the contained packages and another &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference .
&quot; a fully integrated speech nz . &quot; &quot; Fre@@ un@@ de@@ â &quot; &quot; is not just a description of all the programs ( but a few important packages ) but rather it is ideal for searching for a specific form@@ atting . as it is a very large document , it is in &amp; k@@ ile ; in three important book@@ marks . &quot;
&quot; due to the amount of documents with those &amp; t@@ et@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the finding the right document is not always easy . as possible help , the little use of the doc@@ t@@ k , which provides a database with all the &amp; k@@ ile ; delivered documents and here for a graphical surface . &quot;
all documents are divided into categories and the lowest advantage is the search for pack@@ et names or keywords ; are then only the results displayed .
a double @-@ click with the mouse or the layout of the Le@@ ad paste the viewer for the document .

&quot; the version 3.2 of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; all these tools use comm@@ ander as surface and lib@@ x@@ ml@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ sl@@ t as a base . the combination gives quick , efficient , complete and productive tools . &quot;
&quot; everyone who has worked with the &amp; KDE ; documentation has worked , know pro@@ c and how outstanding it is . we do it still a piece , we give it a graphical interface ! simply click on a terminal ; simply the icon for the XML processor cli@@ cked and finished ! &quot;
&quot; this application expects an index@@ .@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if index@@ .@@ doc@@ book is located in the balance of work folders . if not , then remove the current work folders and enter the folder in the field of other folders . &quot;
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML files are deleted every time when d@@ pro@@ c is started .
&quot; as already said , everyone who has worked at the &amp; KDE ; documentation has already worked , knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; there is now a great graphical interface for it . &quot;
&quot; if the straight opened file index@@ .@@ doc@@ book is , then they just let the current work folder chosen . if not , then choose their current work@@ folder and enter the folder where index@@ .@@ doc@@ book is to be found . &quot;
&quot; when it comes to an output on the screen , its file fails . please check the errors and try again . &quot;
&quot; if the file is already marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , then they let the current file simply be raised . if not , delete them at the current file the tick and select the veri@@ fi@@ able file via other file - file selection . &quot;
&quot; if they just want to know if the file well @-@ formed , click the Well @-@ formed review choice . &quot;
&quot; for use one &amp; D@@ TD ; , which is specified in the &amp; XML ; ( Internal ) , otherwise &amp; D@@ TD ; ( internal ) , otherwise &amp; D@@ TD ; ( external ) , and specify the place of &amp; D@@ TD ; and XML ; scheme as well as for the Relax@@ NG review is required as well as for the Relax@@ NG test ; in the file selection required . &quot;
Ja@@ argu@@ ably , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL ; -@@ processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ ml@@ 2 library . &quot;
&quot; should the file be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , then they will be selected , then they leave the current file simply selected . if not , remove the selection of the current file and select the file to be processed by means of the other file sel@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; enter the name of the file , as the result is to be named , and the file is usually stored in their home folder . &quot;
&quot; the plugins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; la@@ det , have a little to do with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even if the plug @-@ system is very powerful . you can use the plug @-@ in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this plugins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI elements . more about it can be found below . &quot;
&quot; to install a plugin or part @-@ part , we begin using the plug @-@ in menu . thus , the following dialog will open : &quot;
this dialog enables to manage all the included plugins and add new features . we describe each &amp; GUI ; -@@ Element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plugins is used without a memory location &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path to the search of the plug @-@ in .
often working on a project several persons in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties -@@ dialog .
the name and email messages are self @-@ explan@@ atory . Nickname is the nickname name of the user and serves to uniqu@@ ely identify .
one member can have multiple roles in the project as well as sub@@ project leader as well as sub@@ project manager .
the user can choose to look for themselves from the list of team members who he is . this happens by placing the team member from the list and the button translated as well . the currently selected member ( their identi@@ ties ) appears f@@ ett after you are : text .
&quot; nickname and setting of own identity are important in terms of news and comments . see for further information on remarks . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the overview of her team , there is another advantage by taking advantage of the members of the team : it can be created an event for information to the team leader if something particular happens . see for further information . &quot;
&quot; event actions are actions which will be executed when something specific in the project happens . an example would be seen as much someone worked , or a script that is saved to the CV@@ S as soon as they add a file into the CV@@ S as soon as they are added to the project , etc ; &quot;
&quot; on the page event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project project settings dialog , you can create and deleted events . &quot;
an email will be sent to the receiver in the recipient list . the addres@@ see can be a team@@ - or sub@@ project manager . see where such ladder can be set up .
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
&quot; enter comments is simple . it can either select the note entry from the editor context menu , or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation key word in a comment area followed by default text . &quot;
&quot; remarks can be sent a determ@@ in@@ able member of the team . in this case , the syntax of the team member is a role in the project consisting of the following possibilities : team leader manager sub@@ project manager After the enrich@@ ment and sub@@ project leaders should be cited as in the following examples below . &quot;
&quot; nickname and roles are independent of large or small , but id@@ ols around the brack@@ ets and the : make the comment invalid . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scripts and form@@ atting languages , D@@ TD @-@ agn@@ os@@ tic is and web@@ based form@@ atting and scrip@@ ting languages supported . &quot;
&quot; the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here are only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings treated , a short description for the others can be found . &quot;
the settings can be set up by default Qu@@ anta . diesel dialog extends over some pages that will be dealt with each other .
the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; regarding tags including car understanding can be modified . the entries are :
large / min@@ de@@ ation of tags : large / Klein@@ bl@@ ings of automatically fitted tags . normal Groß / min@@ de@@ ment means that tags are as inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
&quot; large / min@@ de@@ e of attributes : large / Klein@@ bl@@ ings of automatically attached attributes . normal Groß / min@@ de@@ ment means that the attributes are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; optional tags automatically close : if raised , will be optional for tags , for which the final day is optional , this immediately after the &amp; gt ; added . &quot;
not optional tags automatically close : as above for all other tags with the exception of the simple tags .
start and closing day automatically update : if switched on will be changed the corresponding day with@@ changed and vice versa .
automatic shut@@ down of acc@@ ent signs : controls the automatic conversion of the acc@@ entu@@ ated characters in the corresponding enco@@ ding during inser@@ tion .
&quot; M@@ IE types : Mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for detection of different types of files . using the default standard , the default settings can be recovered . &quot;
standard string coding : the enco@@ ding of newly created or in other way than with file opening files ( where the enco@@ ding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) . this setting here is broadcast from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
&quot; standard D@@ TD : the selected D@@ TD is used for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ TD has not been recognized . this setting here is spread by the same in the project characteristics if a project is loaded . &quot;
&quot; creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; creates regularly backup copies , so that with a black@@ out or crash at the next start of the program the document can be recovered from this backup . however , it is not the same as the saving of the file . also for any stored documents is regularly created , according to the time provided . &quot;
&quot; the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the Edit@@ orial area or its own view ( or the documentation in a map , which makes it possible to view the documentation and the source code at the same time . &quot;
put the window settings on the default back next start is useful when the user interface come through changing the MDI modes and and@@ air / depend on views to each other . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameters .
the warning @-@ section range serves the control of the possibility to disable the display of war@@ nings by sending out more questions .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can also specify the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the sync behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source text view in shared mode .
&quot; here , the par@@ ser and the structure tree , which represents the illustration of the par@@ ser node in the document , in detail can be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; in the mouse click on the structural tree , the following action is possible to modify the action by clicking the structural tree with the mouse buttons to change it . &quot;
&quot; in the field of structural tree settings , the visibility of k@@ not@@ s can be opened automatically in the tree , the actu@@ ality of the tree and how deep when changing the structure tree is set to be set automatically . blank no@@ des are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are found in the present document no element has been found . &quot;
&quot; the area for the fix@@ ation of abbrevi@@ ations ( a type of templates ) which can be un@@ folded in groups , each can be divided for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s is valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it can be a valid group for PHP to be used than in a group valid for Jav@@ ascript . &quot;
&quot; here you can manage the plugins . plug @-@ ins are managed by the third page , which can be re @-@ used by any part @-@ capable application , most known &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; when inser@@ ting one plug @-@ ins must be specified : &quot;
&quot; address : the path to plug @-@ in , if it is not in a standard place like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib . &quot;
&quot; entry : this information is transferred to the plugin at the start , so it can open the current file , the associated folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folders . &quot;
&quot; component @-@ L@@ ese &quot; mode load : check whether the plugin is denied the load . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ parts are usually refuse to shop , if this option is not chosen . &quot;
&quot; check the plug @-@ in : is this enabled , then test@@ et &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; whether the entry level is right then if the plugin is not available at the moment , but it will be installed later . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; starting from version 3.3 , the bug fixes was completely new . the support for the db@@ g Deb@@ ug@@ ger was implemented , as well as the support for the db@@ g Deb@@ ug@@ ger . instead of it was implemented a de@@ bu@@ gger plugin concept , which enables different implementation of the plugins . &quot;
&quot; currently , only a plugin is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; included . &quot;
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gg@@ ers for a project starts with the selection of a suitable debut plug @-@ in in the project settings . with the Options button next to the de@@ bu@@ gger plugin , the specific settings can be changed . &quot;
&quot; if a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ user interface : &quot;
a view in which the variables is displayed in the content of super@@ vised variables . usually appears in the left dock .
&quot; a view that are listed in which all holder points , with line numbers and conditions are listed . usually appears in the lower dock . &quot;
a view that is shown in the output ( as in HTML ) of the Deb@@ u@@ gg@@ ers . usually appears in the lower dock .
&quot; depending on the supported features of the Deb@@ u@@ gg@@ ers , everything or part of the following functionality is available . &quot;
&quot; with this action the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger , if necessary , or they share the plugin with , on deb@@ ating demands . this action is triggered by default if a project is opened by default , which must not be respected in the normal case . &quot;
the counter@@ part to Deb@@ ug@@ gen session started the session . closes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or ends the foli@@ age to requirements .
sends a HTTP request to the server for a de@@ bug requirement . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to see the current document . the output of this requirement is displayed in the view Deb@@ ug@@ ger edition .
&quot; points the de@@ bu@@ gger , starting with the execution of the scripts , and information on the super@@ vised variables as well as the currently run @-@ up line continuously . if this happens when the script has been completed , the script will start before starting the script will start with the requirement . &quot;
&quot; points the de@@ bu@@ gger , with the execution of the script , without giving information to excessive variables and the current line number . if this happens , while a script is transferred , the execution will continue , the execution begins as soon as a request is provided . &quot;
&quot; the de@@ bu@@ gger leads the next instruction on the script , without entering the functions or include the include . &quot;
&quot; the de@@ bu@@ gger leads the next instruction on the script , whereby if possible in functions and include into error messages . &quot;
&quot; points the de@@ bu@@ gger , to transfer the instruction and go to the next one , as if there would be the current one . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog by which a variable or an expression can be given , which should be monitored . the super@@ vised value appears in the variable view . &quot;
&quot; with this dialog , a variable can be given or a new value of a variable . &quot;

this chapter describes how to adapt &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to suit your needs and how to help &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; can help better .
docum@@ ent@@ type E@@ di@@ tier@@ pak@@ ete ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; abilities &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; skills like car completion and cul@@ p@@ ens ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web@@ development , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two ways , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages and &amp; CSS ; s consist of two parts , the tag folder and the work@@ pieces . work@@ pieces contain two data types , which include text and instructions faster in a document as a user ever could . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing D@@ TD . see in details for conversion . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how to create Tag@@ XML files , then the &amp; E@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool @-@ producing . short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; &quot;
&quot; Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ day ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of the company , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the day shows the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . work@@ pieces enable fast inser@@ tion of tags in a document without danger of writing . &quot;
&quot; day @-@ Fol@@ der is nothing but folder . they contain only the &amp; E@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c , and the Tag@@ XML files . day folder carry the name of the sign@@ age language and version , so available . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict ) &quot;
&quot; the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML and declar@@ es whether they are necessary , or not . although not all necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible , so that other users have a better insight and more information when working with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about possibilities and limitations are explained in a simple manner .
&quot; this is the root element of an Tag@@ XML document . it can contain only once in a document , but it can contain the definition of many tags , but otherwise nothing else . &quot;
the type of tags is a script function . when using it is called &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; a argument of the function . ( only Family 2 )
only for the day type class is valid . the name of the base class for this class . ( only Family 2 )
only for the type of Meth@@ od is valid . gives the name of the class where this method is owned . ( only Family 2 )
&quot; if yes , the day has a common attri@@ bute group and the attributes within this tags can be added to any other day . ( only Family 1 ) &quot;
sets a text into the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; -@@ day . that is a just element type element .
&quot; describes a attri@@ bute to a tags . this element can occur only once for each attri@@ bute . it defines the name and type of the attri@@ bute . additionally , it contains other tags to describe how this attri@@ bute to be displayed &amp; etc ; This is a just element element . &quot;
&quot; are the source code used for the attributes in the tag editor , and in the attri@@ bute tree . &quot;
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p Metho@@ den@@ name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to reach the data source .
&quot; requires source = d@@ co@@ p , an interface and a method name . the arguments that will be transferred to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ on % , that means the name of the current tags . &quot;
a hop@@ per day which group@@ ed the elements of a list . it can occur for one attri@@ bute description only once . it is a just element type element .
sets the position of the attri@@ bute texts of a tags within a dialogue . this day can occur for each attri@@ bute in a dialog only once ( e.g. for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; -@@ day ) . the item is empty .
returns the position and size of a field in the dialog . this day should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Day ) . this element is empty .
gives a list of elements that may occur inside of the defined tags . this element is an only element type .
there is a list of elements that one day finish . this element is an only element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; -@@ declarations : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 enco@@ ding = U@@ TF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ased and closed .
&quot; spaces affect nothing but pay attention to &amp; and &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; Tool@@ tip &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; replaced . this will be replaced , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
to review the diary files is the Tools dialog up in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ window to start and over@@ check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . another dialog will appear to follow its simple instructions .
&quot; currently , this function is not yet available . currently , check only when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
in the following an example of a family 1 diary file . this file describes the &amp; D ; schema &gt; -@@ Element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; -@@ schema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this diary file is to be schem@@ atic .
in the following an example of a functioning family 2 diary file . in this file a &amp; PHP is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this diary file is to be over@@ load@@ .@@ day .
&quot; &amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; day name = &quot; &quot; version &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; function &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; function &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; type &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the &amp; E@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; -@@ File is just quite simple and there is an editor for it , accessible via D@@ TD &apos;s D@@ TD settings . this can be edited through di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created with the following entries : &quot;
&#91; general &#93; Version = use 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = D@@ TD HTML 4.@@ 01 Tran@@ si@@ tional / / EN ) nickname = The simpl@@ est name of D@@ TD . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Tran@@ si@@ tional ) . if not stated , the name is used as Nickname . &quot;
an action can define with settings actions ... click on New action leads to the same dialogue :
the keyboard short@@ cuts . with clicking the button user @-@ defined can be assigned a keyboard short@@ cut ; with K@@ one is the current keyboard short@@ cut .
&quot; the simpl@@ est actions . it can be inserted in the detailed settings and added to the action of the action , this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position . see the example below . &quot;
&quot; this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually script , but it is not limited ) that will change the document or use the document ( or parts of the document ) , the quick start dialog or the different View in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ CO@@ EPs . &quot;
&quot; first , the name of the script and interpre@@ ter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ home / my@@ scrip@@ t.@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir with the command line : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / Scrip@@ ts in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variation that can be used in the command line : &quot;
% f : we will be replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file , file will be removed : / from the document names . &quot;
% pi@@ d : will be replaced with the P@@ ID of current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance runs , the text is unique to the P@@ ID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the external script . &quot;
&quot; the parameters for this event , usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the above listed methods , a script input of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus may accept a script input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; at the default field entry can be determined , which is to be sent to the default one . &quot;
selected text : the selected range of the document will be sent to the script . the % input variable is usually useful only with this attitude .
&quot; according to the input , the output of the executed application is led . there are two types of issue : normal output , based on the standard version ; error messages , which shall be done to the default output written by the value of the drop @-@ output issue : &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags in logical groups . in given case it is not too many , so it is not too many , so you can create a tool similar to the name of the n@@ ups . &quot;
&quot; once a tool generator is added , you need to add and configure your actions . select Settings . &quot;
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New action button at the bottom of the window start editing mode .
fill in all the necessary fields and add them to the most suitable tool .
&quot; complete everything and , if the day attributes , and you plan their use , activate dialog &quot; day when available , so that a input during using the promotion is possible . &quot;
ignor@@ ant ! is this a ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? replace it before we have difficulty .
&quot; to create a symbol that the action is better represented , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ correctly ; select graphic other programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ con@@ form ; uses standard 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size others . &quot;
&quot; please note that the created symbol does not only help you to remember what the action is doing , but also all the other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P . &quot;
&quot; with regard to that the day start , is called , I decided to create a starting kno@@ b as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually interpreted as los , rigid , further interpreted ) , or should at least , a message to the user are sign@@ aled ; click on the tag in the current document . &quot;
&quot; after creating the symbol , it must still be connected to action . this happens over the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selecting the desired action . beside the text field is a button , press it . &quot;
&quot; select the folder where the stored icon is located , select it out and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; press the button and put them with other tags , so there is still what is , or confirm with OK to complete . &quot;
suppose you want to supplement some usual &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; functions to work bars supplement or it should set it in a better overview by some separ@@ ators in several groups . open the tool set to set up dialogue on settings tool . make sure that the desired work@@ piece is selected .
&quot; I would like to choose the Tren@@ ner ( very left above ) for my factory list . following the selection of the item , the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the tool tool . &quot;
&quot; for example , I would like to preview a quick way to access the con@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add it to the tool . &quot;
&quot; please note how the separ@@ ators support the group@@ ing . anyone who do not know my work@@ piece , could believe that the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button the opposite of the start button . &quot;
&quot; the new tool @-@ tool must be tested by pro@@ ving all symbols , to ensure that everything works . &quot;
&quot; back in the right folder . after new XML does not exist , it will be stored in the right folder . please adjust its &amp; E@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; so that their tool displays ( s ) if a file is open from the corresponding type . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the chosen extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user is the ability to add documentation for scrip@@ ting language or the form@@ atting language that you like most . therefore , this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation for my personal use . &quot;
&quot; before you start your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory check if anyone has done this for you . &quot;
&quot; there are two parts in this process . first , you have to search for existing documentation for form@@ atting and script / etc . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . then we have to leave the do@@ cr@@ c file here . &quot;
&quot; # KDE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = pf@@ ad , relative to this file , # Sec@@ tion@@ 1@@ .html section 2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1@@ .html ... &#91; context &#93; = Sec@@ tion@@ 1@@ .html ... &#91; context &#93; = Sec@@ tion@@ 1@@ .html ... &#91; context &#93; = Sec@@ tion@@ 1@@ .html ... &#91; context &#93; = Sec@@ tion@@ 1@@ .html ? 1 = tag@@ 2@@ .html ? 1 = tag@@ 2@@ .html tag@@ 1 = tag@@ 2@@ .html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 2@@ .html ? 3 = tag@@ 2@@ .html
&quot; the tree defines the visible part of documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you can now see in the &amp; PHP ; documentation as something : &quot;
# KDE config File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element Top Element = index.html Get@@ ting Start@@ ed = H@@ tion@@ .html ... Language Reference = Basic syntax . ... Basic syntax = langu@@ ag@@ e.@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .html ...
note the # before Get@@ ting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this shows that it is about sub@@ folders in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for chess labels ( except for reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
you notice that the contents of the directory is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and then consistent at the upper end of the building view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folders will be displayed ! ) .
blank spaces affect nothing but pay attention to &amp; and &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; Res@@ cue files will be replaced .
&quot; the contents section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which is intended for setting the context of the context of context . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; H for context aid would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context menu ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the fil@@ ming lines . &quot;
&quot; a simple list of separated context @-@ elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , this is the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) . &quot;
now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c as well as for $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc / apps / qu@@ anta / doc / apps / qu@@ anta / doc / apps / qu@@ anta / doc / apps / qu@@ anta / doc / apps / qu@@ anta / doc / apps / qu@@ anta / doc / apps / qu@@ anta / doc / apps / qu@@ anta / doc / apps / qu@@ anta / doc / apps / qu@@ anta / doc / apps / qu@@ anta / doc / apps / qu@@ anta / doc / apps / qu@@ anta / doc / apps / qu@@ anta / doc / apps / qu@@ anta / doc / apps / qu@@ anta / doc / apps / qu@@ anta / doc / apps / qu@@ anta / doc / apps / qu@@ anta / doc / apps / qu@@ anta / doc / apps / qu@@ anta / doc / apps / qu@@ anta / doc / apps / qu@@ anta / doc / apps / qu@@ anta / doc / apps / qu@@ anta / doc / apps / qu@@ anta / doc / apps / qu@@ anta / doc / apps / qu@@ anta / doc / apps / qu@@ anta / doc / apps / qu@@ anta / doc / apps / qu@@ anta / doc / apps / qu@@ anta / doc / apps / qu@@ anta
&quot; if you &apos;re sure that these are good and worth to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation have been used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . you will not be rich , but proud to have worked on the best web development platform . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you are not alone . it is possible to divide the resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , work@@ pieces with promotions , scripts ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; the resources can be sent by e @-@ mail to friends , partners or otherwise . at different places there is an email menu entry as D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , in context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts . &quot;
&quot; the resources can be up@@ loaded into our main archive , from where all others &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ users can download them . the contributions are reviewed and only available when our team needs them as accurate and usable for the publication . thus , the origin of the resources are ensured , both for our team as well as for the later users . &quot;
&quot; when up@@ loading , you are asked for their Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase for their private g@@ pg keys ( the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase will not be stored ) , or in the case that you have multiple keys you may want to stay . in the dialog New resource ( URL preview can be empty ) and click OK the up@@ loading . &quot;
&quot; the upload can upload by the menus D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , upload work@@ pieces of files and folders in templates and scripts . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , even before installation , investig@@ ates &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the ignor@@ ance of the resource through testing of integrity and signature . if the integrity given and the resource correctly is signed , a message appears with the indication of the origin@@ ator of the resource . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to convert in XML @-@ languages , which is currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it may be necessary because hundreds of day files can be needed in the tag@@ XML format . there is the simpl@@ est way to convert a D@@ TD automatically into a D@@ TE@@ P package . &quot;
the conversion can be started by D@@ TD Download and Convert D@@ TD . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the D@@ TD description which shall be used . afterwards the following dialogue will appear :
target directory : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! doc@@ type Defini@@ tions : the drawing board that is in ! doc@@ type Day like HTML Public - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / D@@ TD HTML 4.@@ 01 Tran@@ si@@ tional / / EN http : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / ht@@ ml@@ 4 / lo@@ os@@ e@@ .d@@ t@@ d
&quot; adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P according to conversion : if enabled , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; according to the conversion den &amp; E@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; -@@ editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this possibility . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . to understand this and get full use of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this chapter attempts to bring them exactly these concepts , without their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; little benefit . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the working area divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction affects a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; global elements are available for everyone , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; stored , available in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; stored in the joint folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this allows the group of administrators to ensure the various work@@ pieces , actions and patterns in the global tree , which are then available to each in a multi @-@ user environment . &quot;
local elements represent a personal collection of web development tools for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and work@@ pieces . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are available only within a particular project . this can be anything of &amp; CSS ; -@@ patterns of the tool used with special actions especially for the files of a particular project . simply told this is the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project .
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ MDI ; consists of some main areas : the editor window , the building views , the cardboard boxes , with info and the tool of the tool . please suggest you in , and for further information about these areas . &quot;
&quot; you can click the map @-@ leader with the right button of the right mouse button to delete a context menu with the current documents , or upload or up@@ loading of the document , jump to a book@@ mark or execution of CV@@ S commands to the current document . &quot;
&quot; right click in the Edit@@ orial area lead to a further context menu regarding the edited documentation , such as basic processing steps ( copy / paste / paste ) , processing the word under the mouse cursor or opening the file , when the string pointer under the cursor is called a file . &quot;
&quot; at the top of the editor &apos;s tool , the tool of the editor is currently taking shape &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Tran@@ si@@ tional as a standard for which a set of work@@ pieces is shown . in the course of the further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the tool used to be adapted to the new functions and associated user requirements . &quot;
&quot; the use of work@@ pieces is really easy . if they want to insert the same day , for example , then click the icon that the day represented . now they can insert the data for this straight , then click on a day to insert several attributes ( like anch@@ ors ) , you can fill in a dialog different fields . &quot;
&quot; the building views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow it to navigate in the information to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to navigate them , to open and to pass . in the display with cart@@ ons are available for files , project , Samples , scripts , attributes , and documentation construction . &quot;
&quot; project management is a powerful tool , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; prepared this view displays all the files in the project and allows the vulner@@ ability of the files in the project by means of right mouse click . actions such as Add , removal , up@@ loading or deletion of the files from the storage media can be performed using the context menu . &quot;
&quot; another option of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : images , programming , a whole website &amp; etc ; There are all options open . &quot;
&quot; templates can be divided into three categories , depending on which context they are used . the category is used by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ employment area . global templates are always available , local templates are only available in the project . more to templates is found in the project . &quot;
&quot; here you will find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of the integration in Global , Local and project works also here . by clicking on the right mouse button , further functions are available , such as the script to start , edit or send an email . &quot;
&quot; with this view , one shows the internal structure of the active document . by links @-@ clicking a module , the cursor is set to the position of the item . by right @-@ clicking a Elem@@ entary opens a list of commands in terms of navigation and collection of the tree . &quot;
&quot; this tree appears under the other construction views . with him can change some quickly attributes and nam@@ esp@@ ace , which allows the change of all available attributes with just a few clicks . &quot;
&quot; here is the complete documentation on the Web @-@ Technik for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; by the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you can create your own documentation and by adding a folder doc to a project cannot be edited and looked at . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; two cartridges at the bottom of the window , can be reached via the us@@ eless information : the news window and the problem window . &quot;
&quot; this cartridge presents information about each in Qu@@ anta running script . thus , for example the D@@ TD of the current document and all changes to D@@ TD are displayed . &quot;
&quot; this cartridge show all errors in the marking of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; scripts that are executed , give all the error messages ( so there are ) in this window . &quot;
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; work@@ pieces are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command . the chocolate surface is the possibility to define own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ;
&quot; a further function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , is the ability to send a tool tool by e @-@ mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; sends the tool @-@ like in an e @-@ mail , they can secure it in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; like any other back and load ! &quot;
&quot; it is reasonable , if you want to customize the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ files placed on your system . it has a number of options to get to the configure script . for a complete list of options , enter . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not run here . &quot;
&quot; if you have problems at the startup of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check whether your path contains the &amp; KDE ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that no older version of &amp; KDE ; 3 in the P@@ AT@@ H before her am folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the KDE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; was optimized for a rapid web development and combines a well @-@ proven development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
&quot; during the effort to create the best &amp; HTML ; -@@ editor , the developer of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , began to deal with a close idea , if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; an independent , expan@@ sive Mark@@ up @-@ language editor ? well , this would make him absolutely great web development tool for &amp; KDE ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; no longer limited to re@@ ines &amp; HTML , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now you can define it on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then it should be &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for it should be the suitable &amp; IDE ; &quot;
&quot; now , to the above claim must be recorded that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; KDE , developing community , which is why someone else has developed ? thanks to the &amp; KDE ; -@@ rum@@ ours is not only this everything possible , but it allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; thus to expand how they need it for their needs . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; allows web@@ developers to increase the use of intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( MDI ; ) . this can make the productivity of almost every task . by using the comm@@ ander it is possible &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . ( more about them can be found in . )
&amp; qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web@@ development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and has been developed quickly to a mature editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; qu@@ anta ; Plus is not connected in any way with commercial versions of &amp; qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GPL @-@ licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more in the details of the documentation is with help : / qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or k@@ help@@ center help : / qu@@ anta run ) . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ anta ; is currently developed and cared for by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon sequ@@ it@@ ur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time when you open a file , which is not on the oldest entry . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to save code parts and all files as templates for later use . you should try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project pre @-@ storage file , only a bug is reported . &quot;
&quot; converted from the clip@@ board there special characters for &amp; HTML , so that they are displayed correctly and not understood by the browser as form@@ atting instruction . &quot;
convert the text from the clip@@ board in &amp; URL ; -@@ Sub@@ scription which is the correct way to inser@@ ting special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s is used primarily for inser@@ ting &amp; URL ; s in the anchor tag .
switch the block@@ selection of or off . that allows you to select text blocks with the help of the &amp; Shift ; taste key .
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; -@@ Script error messages are available !
looks for a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined settings to help you .
displays the news window or not . this is the window where you can see the display of scripts and de@@ bu@@ gger .
&quot; initial and closing of the problem of problem at the lower edge of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window , as soon as you switch to the structural tree . &quot;
displays the toolbar icon on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
&quot; if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with the entries of the previous or next , depending on the position of the cursor in the document . &quot;
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu group@@ ed following the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ projects are stored with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presenting a dialog to inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied into the project directory .
&quot; searches the project directory for new files that could be there . this allows for example to copy graphics files into your project folder or folder , and add them to the project . &quot;
loads the files in your project on the server high . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; KDE ; and whether you have further inputs / output modules ( K@@ IO Sl@@ aves ) .
settings how &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project manages . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ projects can be found here .
invites a project workshop . these are stored in project you / tool@@ bars and are only available in this menu if you assigned to this project .
&quot; a dialog to save your tool similar . allows you to select the type of tool tool : locally or project . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog to add a new tool system . actions must set the name . actions must be saved by means of actions ... or you will be saved by the tool of tool material , whether you want to save the tool of the tool . &quot;
&quot; delet@@ es a tool from the view area . it does not delete them from the hard drive . if you have not saved the tool , you will be asked if you want to do it . &quot;
this allows you to send their own work@@ pieces to someone ( maybe to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ team so that the tool change is available in the next publication ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool .
enables the up@@ loading of work@@ pieces on the main server where everyone can access it . see in .
download a &amp; D@@ TD ; who made you or any someone else and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own typ@@ ing format .
&quot; download / refresh of the entities from the &amp; D@@ TD ; if this global is not available , without the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this global is not present and a sp@@ elling in the global KDE folder is not present . &quot;
&quot; this menu contains a list of tags available in the currently loaded work@@ pieces . if the standard ( HTML , ) work@@ piece is loaded , there is a sub@@ menu standard , which contains the list of tags / actions on this tool . &quot;
&quot; allows access to the current day settings dialog , if there is one thing . this entry is always available in the menu tags always , followed by &amp; D@@ TD ; -@@ specific sub@@ menu . &quot;
&quot; activated or de@@ activated the intelligent inser@@ ting of tags . currently , this works only with ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ ting implies that this day is denied the rules in this place . &quot;
&quot; in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plugins are listed below the listed menu items . click on it . click on the activation of the activated plug @-@ ins . &quot;
select the Syn@@ tax@@ able mode for the current file . the list of available app@@ liance schem@@ ata depends on der@@ ate ; -@@ version .
&quot; select the type of line identifi@@ er . very useful when you know people , the other OS @-@ platforms to develop . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh . &quot;
checks the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; D@@ TD ; using the external application tidy .
immediate switching between the different types of the interface . by some limitations in the KDE libraries that may sometimes need time or unpleasant graphics . recommended the card @-@ card mode that is also the default setting or the sub@@ window mode , the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this menu provides an entry for each open sub@@ window . with a selection of a single window , the corresponding sub@@ window will be activated . &quot;
the display of the status bar at the lower edge of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window .
&quot; the changes in this dialog takes any application that use the K@@ HTML Part , including the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ web browsers . &quot;
is the behavior of the editor &apos;s behaviour . in the documentation of &amp; K@@ ate ; you can find details .
&quot; a dialog will appear where you delete entries from the tool , or which will change and change the sequences . &quot;
&quot; this should generate a help according to the environment of the mouse cursor , but it is not yet implemented . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project the developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form you will find here the way . &quot;
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory , and should be completed best from top to bottom , as after filling out the project name the whole directory structure for the rest of the project will be completed automatically . all these paths and author information fields can be completed later with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties . &quot;
&quot; here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , file will be filled automatically . &quot;
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Project file . by default she has the name of the project in small letters and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
&quot; here you can access the server address of the machine , to which you want to access to local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exam@@ ple@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) is possible . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , this field is empty , the default settings of the selected protocol may be used . depending on setting the remote computer could be an adaptation necessary . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder where the templates will be stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default , if a common collection of files used for various projects should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder where the tool used for the project is saved . it is a relative path to the project and default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files can be used for various projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
this allows to insert files from the local file system into the project . it can be selected several files or a whole folder .
&quot; this setting is great if you have static web content , you can download and change it . with ser@@ ing script ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to go differently . &quot;
&quot; exercising if files are to be involved somewhere in the main folder of the project . if a project will start from scratch , not an@@ h@@ ooks . &quot;
&quot; with this option , all files and folders will be displayed within the main folder and you can make a precise selection according to the d@@ une . &quot;
&quot; this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by clicking the h@@ ooks , p@@ egs from the project . &quot;
&quot; the last screen of the new project assistant contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can upload in the menu with project properties in the menu profiles in the menu profiles , or with the keyboard short@@ coming Shift ; F@@ 7 are changed . &quot;
some settings correspond to those in the project assist@@ ants and are described in described . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of file names ( plac@@ eholders possible ) which can be re@@ trac@@ ed to project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
&quot; supplementary option to top , also files that are listed in .c@@ v@@ sign@@ or are excluded from the project . &quot;
the project view that is loaded at opening the project . in can read more about project views .
this allows the desired de@@ bu@@ gger selected . currently only Gu@@ bed is supported . more information about Gu@@ bed can be found in . the de@@ bu@@ gger Plugin can be set with the Options button . in this case the bug fixes is described .
&quot; in the sub@@ window profiles , high @-@ loading profiles ( see in ) set as well as the display of a building control for the content of the server for each profile , by integrating a separate building view for each profile . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window Team configuration , project members can be added , processed or deleted as well as a mailing list . see in the details . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window event , one can switch event actions and add these actions to change or delete any event actions if a previously certain event occurs , such as the f@@ uses of a file . see in the details . &quot;
&quot; by default &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the last project that was opened . this behavior cannot be affected . &quot;
&quot; to open another project , select project ... from the project project or the icon project open from the tool generator . the dialog project will open and allows selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension . &quot;
&quot; when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; closed , the project file will be automatically saved . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; modified files will take place . the same happens if you are a new project . &quot;
project management gives free access to the files in the project . there the files can be managed in the current project .
&quot; folders are equally , however , the entries are opening opening and opening with ... in the right button with the right mouse button : &quot;
here you can choose different profiles . the profile contains information about the place of highly ad@@ missible files . see below .
&quot; enables removing the current profile . if only a profile is present , the button will end to prevent the removal . &quot;
the password is kept in the core memory and will be forgotten during programming . this possibility is useful when the most common file is needed and the rather un@@ secure password on the disk does not store in question .
&quot; this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog , if you change your opinion prior to the up@@ loading . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many wedding profiles can be created and thus upload the project ( or parts of the project ) to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed : &quot;
this is the name of the server to be copied to the files . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address function .
&quot; the transfer protocol for the up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; KDE ; and the installed K@@ IO sl@@ aves . at least , you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs . &quot;
&quot; the port for transfer . normally , this does not have to be changed except the network administrator does not conduct a service to the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your anxiety @-@ wave , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it according to your discretion . the password is saved on the disk , so it can not be read easily , but everyone with programming knowledge can be easily seen in the plain text . &quot;
a project view is only one set of files and tool similar . it can be loaded into a project many views that can be loaded into a project that means many files and work@@ pieces and replace the currently open files and tool @-@ related files .
&quot; views can be downloaded or deleted in the menu project or the project workshop , easily accessible or deleted . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with which one has to do most . this helps not only increase productivity , but also allows adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to the own working method . &quot;
as already mentioned above are work@@ pieces in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; best compared with the menu tool tool @-@ designed . use and add . the adding of work@@ pieces is treated below in the section adding of work@@ pieces .
&quot; the tool @-@ producing and the symbols on this can be configured either by context menu ( right click on the tool @-@ measure ) , in which new action can be used , which results in the dialog box , which can be specified in dialogue where actions can be visible on this or other tool of tool . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a tool @-@ tool , in addition the entries have been removed and action is indicated that are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
the tool @-@ producing and the actions on them can set up in the menu with settings tool ... and settings actions can be set .. adjusted .
&quot; templates are contained in the main docum@@ ent@@ ette , code cuts and files for link@@ age . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used templates as a m@@ ural fil@@ es@@ ystem with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or any one to the system &apos;s existing directory in the storage area . templates are available in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in about the restrictions you imagine the fil@@ es@@ ystem . &quot;
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions attached to any template before using .
&quot; binary is all that is not pur@@ er text , so images , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; s , flash files &amp; etc ; s , can be found in the storage space under global templates . further information on the templates is available . &quot;
&quot; documents can be created by any text type . based on these templates , new documents can be created . usually a simple sm@@ ells for the purpose and organizes the work in appropriate ways to be efficient . some examples can be found in the storage room under global templates . see you for more information about the templates tree . &quot;
&quot; this kind of templates is useful , if not a new document based on a template but the same text area can be found again in the documents . you can find everything from a comment on a complete menu on Jav@@ ascript or Perl base . some examples are available in the storage room under global templates . see you for more information about the templates tree . &quot;
&quot; as the name says , these templates for all websites referred to as templates . they are a collection of different documents that can be organized in a folder structure . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; design a document structure according to Bel@@ i@@ eben ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc . ) and select file as template As a local template store .... &quot;
&quot; once that happened , you notice that ( even if it was saved as a project location ) the template is not visible in the project tree . take a look at the pre @-@ storage room under proj@@ ectors . &quot;
&quot; select Text in your document and click File As a template to save as a local / project location . alternatively , the selection can be done simply by hand and put down on the construction of designs . &quot;
&quot; the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only copy in a pre @-@ storage folder . it allows all of the file administration functions to be used , so about drag and drop or inser@@ tion via the file tree by Kon@@ quer@@ or . &quot;
&quot; you can select a folder to the right click on a folder to the right and backup Site template to create a name for the template and backup . by default , it can be saved as local or global template as a local or global template . &quot;
&quot; proj@@ ectors enable a very target @-@ oriented approach . you can insert head@@ lines and foot@@ lines or dynam@@ ically create , create files or link with them . in addition , you can easily connect to some things when using templates in projects very deep@@ est . &quot;
the pre @-@ storage structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / . and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ anta / . each of this folder corresponds to one of four types of containers as described above .
to set the behavior of a folder chart with the right mouse button on the folder and select the following dialog box in the context menu . the following dialog will appear :
&quot; a selection field with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is abstract as soon as El@@ ter@@ ity attributes is intact . &quot;
&quot; this is enabled by default and fits all except the stem cell chart . if a root folder would be dis@@ abling , unless they would be explicitly activated . in case of a normal folder , the bl@@ ah would appear with something like text module . if nothing appears , one is probably in a regular folder . &quot;
allows pre @-@ employed or subsequent text for templates in this folder . this could be general head@@ lines or foot@@ lines for all templates for a particular project and enables copying contents into a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ lines a whole presentation already with the suitable head@@ lines / foot@@ lines .
&quot; in addition , you have to show right mouse button ( to show right mouse button ) via a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and paste templates from one place to another . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; Source text editor available via the menu View . the first mode replaces the HTML window in two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor .
the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor works as follows : he invites one document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ page and a cursor appears . then you can edit and switch to the source code editor in which the changes introduced in the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor in the source code are visible .
&quot; when working with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor on a document , which contains &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor . it is not possible to edit them directly with the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor . it is not possible to edit them directly with the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor . there is no plans to change these behavior . &quot;
&quot; the second mode works exactly as the first one , except that at the same time the changes are activated in the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor synchron@@ ously runs in the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor synchron@@ ously runs on the active cursor from one window to the other , whereby the position in the document is maintained . &quot;
the synchron@@ isation distance between V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and the source text editor can be adjusted by synchron@@ isation following a click or automatically . in the selection can be configured in addition the recommendation : a small sp@@ anne for fast computer and a large sp@@ anne for slow .
&quot; suppose you want to change the title of the website , the tools you want to choose according to the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor is possible , as soon as a new document with the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor is created . this is used to change the suspension of the associated code . this allows you to change the following : &quot;
&quot; Met@@ a @-@ tags , the storage of information about the document itself , i.e. key words for internet search engines . Met@@ a elements can be added below or removed by pressing the two buttons below or removed . one click on the list allows the change of the content , e.g. key words on the column names and keyword key 2 on the content column . &quot;
CSS @-@ rules are the new way to design the provi@@ dence of pages in browsers . you can add CSS rules with the buttons below the list . the Edit of CSS rules are currently not supported .
&quot; it is possible to include an external CSS @-@ style , by clicking on the file button and select the corresponding file . &quot;
&quot; the use of the cursor is as described in a text processing , by filling with the arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the cursor is working as usual . text can be inserted by typ@@ ing and deleted using back@@ packing or removal . &quot;
&quot; the inser@@ ting of tags will be done in the same way across the tool used as in the source text editor , e.g. if an anchor tag is not removed , surrounded by text , each other converted anchor is removed . &quot;
some work@@ pieces like the tables @-@ wizard or the lists assistant are disabled . you will work later in &amp; V@@ PL ; work in this release the tables or lists of work bars are used .
&amp; x@@ sl@@ db@@ g ; is a tool for the investigation of style templates . in contrast to other programs for sty@@ lists the search for certain elements is possible and the execution of the sty@@ ling can be pursued .
&quot; to be compiled &amp; x@@ sl@@ db@@ g ; successfully compile , need except &amp; KDE ; still the libraries lib@@ x@@ sl@@ t , li@@ bex@@ sl@@ t and lib@@ x@@ ml , which are in a typical installation of &amp; KDE ; already available . &quot;

x@@ sl@@ db@@ g contains the complete path from a fil@@ en@@ ame without a path of file name . fil@@ en@@ ame in the same folder as the top loaded file name .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .@@ x@@ sl is the following input possible :
&quot; in this command , this command is checked for a partial or complete agreement with a pre @-@ name named QNAP ME or a given name name . &amp; eg ; template corresponds with any QNAP ME , which includes the string template . &quot;
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the given &quot; QNAP ME &quot; will be added to the rules which are defined by the specified nam@@ esp@@ ace . X@@ SL : test@@ 1 &amp; eg ; extended to http : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 199 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a ques@@ tion@@ able holder must be dis@@ solved for the related UR@@ I and C@@ line number . this will be automatically executed when loading the first template by x@@ sl@@ db@@ g . holder points will be re@@ checked shortly after starting a running time .

there are many graphic tools for the compar@@ isons . why so &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain just why I wrote .
&quot; the mer@@ ging was very complicated , because one of the entries had made a lot of changes , and at the same time corrected the obj@@ ection . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result had numerous conflicts in the mer@@ ging . &quot;
&quot; the program used by me only showed me the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly changed inside these lines . and there was no indication of the places where you might only change the revers@@ ing of this change was a small night@@ mare . &quot;
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; was able to present differences within one line and changes to white signs . later many more useful functions have been added .
&quot; if you want to compare quickly text , simply copy it into the clip@@ board and paste it into one of the comparison window . &quot;
&quot; a function has made a lot of work , the compar@@ isons and mer@@ ging of folders . this function is related &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; nearly into a complete file browser . &quot;
&quot; also 3 @-@ way mer@@ ging will be fully supported . this is useful when two people work independently in one piece of co@@ de and changes . the original file ( the base ) helps you edit the original file . in this editor , you can edit the result even directly . the screen@@ shot shows three qu@@ ell files in combination : &quot;
&amp; pc@@ 3 ; helps you also with the compar@@ isons and together complete folder . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folder gathering :
&quot; &amp; @-@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences in and conf@@ using the possibilities of today &apos;s colour monitors . if you need to check it , you will be able to check this function . &quot;
&quot; differences in white signs and tab@@ ulators are visible . if lines only differ in a certain number of white signs , one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no hass@@ les more , if J@@ em@@ and the inser@@ tion changes . ) &quot;
&quot; if a file is equal , and the other is different in one line , then displays the color which is different . red color means that both files differ . &quot;
&quot; if all of the files have the same name , but in different folders , you can easily make yourself the file name by using just the fil@@ en@@ ame of the first file . example : &quot;
diff@@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 2 k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 2 folder 2 folder 1 folder 2 folder 1 folder 2 folder 1 folder 2 folder 2 folder 3 folder 3 folder
&quot; the opening dialog allows the manual type of fil@@ en@@ ames , selecting the file browser ( file ... ) or select a last opened file from the installation list . you do not have to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C , the analysis of the differences are done with two files . &quot;
&quot; using the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you choose a folder , the folder will be chosen , for B and C , however , a folder , then uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ame from A in the two other folders . &quot;
&quot; when gathering is crossed , the input field is active for the goal and it is not necessarily required to set an output file . you can also save this step later when saving . &quot;
the set @-@ button opens a dialog with settings . here you can define options before you start using the same / assem@@ bling .
&quot; sometimes you do not want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to choose text parts from the clip@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison begins then immediately . in opening dialog you have to select no files , you can simply shut the dialog with the Cancel button . &quot;
you can also pick @-@ up and use : drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparative window .
&quot; which idea is behind it ? sometimes , a file contains e.g. several similar features . if you want to find out how much of these features are , it would be a relatively large effort . they would only need to copy two corresponding files , they can easily copy and compare it . now you can easily copy the relevant sections , and then compare . &quot;
note : currently you cannot draw anything from &amp; diff@@ 3 ; only the case can be supported by text into a comparative window .
warning : some Edit@@ ors interpret and put text into another program as output and inser@@ ting ( instead of copying and inser@@ tion ) . in such a case your original data could be lost .
&quot; in the upper part of each texture , the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that windows C is optional . ( note that window C is optional . ) ( if the path to a file is to rest . then a small relief window will display the full name . ) &quot;
the three source windows are assigned the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color Green and C is mag@@ enta . ( this preferences can be changed via the Settings menu ) . ) &quot;
&quot; if a difference is detected , one sees at the color which file is different . ( colour for conflicts in the settings ) . ( colour for conflicts in the settings ) . ( colour for conflicts in the settings ) . ( colour for conflicts in the settings ) . ( colour for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files . this is in the next section ( gathering ) well . &quot;
&quot; links next to the text is the coll@@ ar column . if differences were found , the column shows the corresponding color . in some programming languages , the colour is not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + for example , white signs can only be found in string and comments , for the processor and in a few , rare individuals . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line , which separates from the text , is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no lines . if the line cap@@ tion is activated , the line is displayed at broken lines . &quot;
&quot; the result window ( under the German version ) also has a info line with the wording issue : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; amended &#93; if you have edited the result . usually it contains text , but often it contains conflicts . &quot;
! ! ! to all conflicts dis@@ solved is the saving de@@ activated ! ! ! ( use the buttons Spr@@ inge to night &apos;s throw / un@@ solved conflict to find the even remaining conflicts . )
&quot; if only two comparison windows are used , each difference must also be solved a conflict of manually . &quot;
by clicking on a click with the left mouse button in one of the windows the line belonging to the row will be displayed in all windows and the first line of the group will not be visible . this group is then highlighted the current group . it is highlighted with the color background color for current area and each on the left appears a black beams .
&quot; sometimes through automatic mer@@ ging or by manual editing no more row will be left in the group ; then there is only a plac@@ eholders for the event that you can change your opinion and maybe again a different source . this text does not appear in the final saved file , nor in a mark@@ ings that you might copy and paste elsewhere . &quot;
&quot; the text &amp; lt ; summar@@ ized ; however , in the clip@@ board , if you copy such text from the result window . go carefully with this function . &quot;
&quot; note : when using the sources , the options ignore or ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + comments are activated , changes in numbers or comments are dealt with as white signs . &quot;
&quot; navig@@ ating mainly to the scroll and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you use in one of the window , you can also use the arrow buttons , at the beginning , end , str@@ g @-@ beginning and str@@ g end , you can also click on the vertical picture bar by clicking on the ver@@ ge . &quot;
in the eye window you can also use the other buttons to edit . with the insert button you can switch between one @-@ feet and over@@ write mode . ( pres@@ et is the plug @-@ in mode ) .
one click with the left mouse button to be synchron@@ ized with the view of all windows at the beginning of the respective group ( as already in the section together and the ed@@ itable output window was explained ) .
&quot; the tool &apos;s tool contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ picture above ) , to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ above ) , to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ above ) , to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ above ) , to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ above ) , to proceed as a conflict . therefore , there must be differenti@@ ated between those and un@@ equal conflicts . &quot;
&quot; to copy the mark@@ ings to the clip@@ board , you need to copy the copy button ( Str@@ g @-@ C or Str@@ g inser@@ ting ) . if this option is automatically copy , automatically paste into the clip@@ board and the manual copy does not copy , because you could replace the content of the clip@@ board . &quot;
&quot; line @-@ line are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix @-@ versions use a line @-@ line sign \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use the line feed files , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not using binary files . &quot;
the options and the list of the most commonly used files will be automatically saved and restored when you start the next start . ( menu setup - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 ) .
&quot; choose a font with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialogue also provides writings with variable width to choose from , you should not use it . ) &quot;
&quot; if you activate this option , differences are shown in short font . if the chosen font does not support this representation , nothing happens nothing . &quot;
&quot; on systems with only 16 or 256 colours , some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be illustrated clearly . on these systems the button settings automatically poses an odd colour . &quot;
&quot; if this option is enabled , the typ@@ ing of the tab@@ ulator button is inserted by the appropriate number of space characters . otherwise a tab@@ ulator is added . &quot;
&quot; when entering or return return , the inser@@ tion of the previous line is automatically used for the next line . &quot;
&quot; if this option is enabled , each choice is automatically copied to the clip@@ board . the manual copy into the clip@@ board then falls into the clip@@ board . &quot;
you can select which line type you prefer to save . the default value is the generally usual choice on the operating system .
&quot; when using the same files is tried &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , all of all identical lines in the source files can be ignored . the second step compar@@ es white characters . the second step compar@@ es white signs cannot be ignored . in this step white signs will not be ignored . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) store a car charger &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a line feed &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , others again store only one line feed . if this option is enabled , was@@ p . during the merger , this option must be disabled . in default this option is de@@ activated . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is de@@ activated . in the first part of the analysis the numbers and related characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . in the result the differences are still displayed , but they are treated as white signs . &quot;
in the default setting this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated as changes in white signs .
&quot; intensively , after still smaller differences . the option is enabled in the default setting . it is effective with complicated and large files , but slowly with very large files . &quot;
&quot; in the Autom@@ atically re@@ skip mode , this setting how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next un@@ equal conflict will be continued . &quot;
sol@@ ves all conflicts in white signs by using the selected file used as a source . ( pres@@ et is useful when white signs can be used as a source . if you need this only from time to time then take advantage of the Autom@@ atic selection also conflicts in numbers or comments when the options ignore or ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + -@@ comments .
these options are covered in the chapter to scan folders and carry out a combination . look for details under documentation regarding the directory comparison and composition .
&quot; if a file is stored and already exists an older version , the original version is attached to the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if already one such b@@ aking file is existed with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without any further backup . &quot;
&quot; adap@@ ts the language of the user interface . the change of this option affects not the currently running program . you must stop and re@@ boot , so that the change is active in the KDE version of &amp; @-@ diff@@ 3 ; not available , because the language is used globally via the control centre . ) &quot;
the following enco@@ der settings can be adjusted for each entry separately . if you are enabled this option for all entries the upper setting is used .
&quot; in the selection of fields for enco@@ ding , a short notice what the local enco@@ ding is published . ( this can not be changed here and has a purely informal character . ) &quot;
adjust the file enco@@ ding for source files . this affects how special characters are treated and interpre@@ ting . as the enco@@ ding for each file individually adjustable and can be compared and merged with different enco@@ ding .
&quot; if you have edited a file , you can set the enco@@ ding to save it . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre@@ fabrication , they may not work with your code@@ c . ( e.g. , your files 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code can be used only with 8 @-@ bit Uni@@ code . ) With this option one can define the enco@@ ding of the output of processing commands . &quot;
&quot; turn this to supp@@ ress a change of changes in white signs in the text or over@@ sight . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments , if the options ignore or ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + -@@ comments . ) &quot;
&quot; this selection is only available when you compare three files . in normal mode , all the differences are displayed in a color @-@ shaped over@@ s column . but sometimes you might want to see differences between two of three files . after selecting A &amp; B ; C , A &amp; B ; C , in addition to the normal yet a second over@@ sight@@ ed column with the required information . &quot;
sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines . bl@@ ends the less important windows . ( this option is in the window @-@ menu . )
sub@@ ordinate the comparative window side by side or over@@ each other . this can also be useful for ads of long lines . ( this option is in the window @-@ menu . )
&quot; sometimes , you consider the differences and then decide to bring the files together . a simple click will start running the file name and uses the file name of the last source file as a pre @-@ set name for output file . ( if this function is used to run the merger , then the name of the last used equipment will be retained . ) &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it will be handed down to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then , the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can use your own preferences which corresponds exactly to your requirements . you can use this function for example to cut interference . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file it is transferred first to this external command ( see above ) , then the output of the command is used only when using the command processor . you can write your own preferences , which corresponds exactly to your requirements . each input line must have a related issue . &quot;
&quot; the thought behind it is to enable the user more flexibility when setting up the Di@@ ff results . however , there will be an external program , and most users would like to program it . the good news is however , that in most cases sed or per@@ l completely suff@@ ice . &quot;
use this pre @-@ processing command to convert the entry into large letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ .
CV@@ S and other version control systems use some keywords in order to add automatically created character sets ( info : / c@@ vs / key@@ word Sub@@ stitution ) . * \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; while you experiment with sed , you might begin to understand it and perhaps you like this regular expressions even . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
&quot; Ig@@ nor@@ ing of numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of a further processing commands for c@@ row . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 345@@ 6@@ 78@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos;@@ je@@ ure &apos;s character between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , so practically deleted . &quot;
sometimes you might want to perform several locations at once . then you can use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the compositions from each other . for example :
&quot; instead of sed , you can also use something different such as per@@ l . per@@ l -@@ p &apos; s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / Re@@ duction / switch &apos; aller@@ gens are used at per@@ l some details differently . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) needed , per@@ l needs only ( and ) without the leading &apos; \ \ &apos; . example : &quot;
the data according to the normal Pre@@ processor will maintain for the display and to maintain . the further operations only change the data that the line @-@ al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ m sees .
&quot; note : in rare cases , if you use a normal Pre@@ processor , the line output is the output of the normal Pre@@ processor as input . &quot;
&quot; the processor commands are very useful , but as with any function , the text changes or differences hidden , you can &apos;t notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case . &quot;
&quot; often , programmers have to edit many files in a folder many files . for this reason you can compare and merge with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folder re@@ cur@@ sive and merge together . &quot;
... makes for each object a suggestion to work together ; you can customize the proposal before the start
... can sim@@ ulate the mer@@ ging changes and demonstrates the sim@@ ulated changes without really perform them
... guides selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 button )
this is very similar to the compar@@ isons and assem@@ bling of individual files . you just need to enter folder on the command line or in the dialog file .
&quot; when three folders will be merged , then folder 1 as a base is used . if no target folder was used , uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , do not start the merger . to select the merger , you need to select the appropriate menu entry or press the F@@ 7 button . ( more details follow . ) &quot;
&quot; during reading the folder you will be informed a small news window on the current progress . if you cancel the folder , only the files are listed , which were compared to that . &quot;
&quot; when this is done in the folder , displays &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left @-@ hand side ... &quot;
each file and any folder that was found during the scan is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually presented together . you can double folders by clicking the + / - click on the object or by clicking the arrow keys for left / right . the directory menu contains two functions all sub@@ directories and all sub @-@ directories with which you can rechar@@ ge all the folders or folders .
&quot; if you double click on a file , the file is started and it appears as a comparison window . &quot;
the icon in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
&quot; if the file type is different in the other folder , then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detailed window to the selected object . in such a case the coll@@ ap@@ hr action can not be selected automatically . if the merger will be started , you will be informed about problems of this kind . &quot;
&quot; as shown in the above picture , are used in columns A / B / C the colors red , green , yellow and black . &quot;
&quot; however , the colour is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different . &quot;
&quot; folders will be considered as identical , if you are identical content as it is identical . you also have the same color . in folders , the age is ir@@ relevant for its color . &quot;
&quot; the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ diff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf spring which is only green , then yellow , and later when it is old , red . &quot;
&quot; a and C identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B not exists , delete the target , if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; a and B identical are , but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the aim , if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; B and C identical are identical , but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the aim , if it exists ) &quot;
... a , B and C not have the same dat@@ at@@ ype ( e.g. if A a folder and B a file is ) : error : contra@@ dic@@ tory dat@@ at@@ yp@@ es . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , the coll@@ ater@@ al cannot be started . &quot;
... a and B not have the same dat@@ at@@ ype ( e.g. if A a folder and B a file is ) : error : contra@@ dic@@ tory dat@@ at@@ yp@@ es . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , the coll@@ ater@@ al cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; the mode for synchron@@ ize is active if only two folder and not a explicit target folder , and if the option directories are active . then sel@@ ects &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action so that the necessary action are identical . if for an entry ... &quot;
... a and B exist but not identical are : together and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as the visible file name for the output file only B ; directly after the merger is copied &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
&quot; when two folders will be merged and the option of re @-@ use is activated ( uns@@ afe ) the date of the files and suggests the newer file to copy . if the files are different , but the date is identical .. Sol@@ ange such errors can not be removed , the mer@@ ging of the folder can not be started . &quot;
&quot; while the merger will work one file after the other . you will have the status column , and accordingly other messages , if the merger has been completed , you should make a final review and see whether the status is in order everywhere . &quot;
&quot; if in the set of dialog the file @-@ method of full analysis is chosen , K@@ diff@@ 3 other columns will display , no white and white conflicts . ( the column for solved conflicts will only be displayed when three folder is compared or merged . ) &quot;
&quot; you can either merge the straight entry ( file or odds ) , or all entries at one time . if you have selected all summar@@ ized actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start the merger . &quot;
&quot; note : if you have not specified any target folder , then in the three @-@ folder gathering mode C is used as the target , with a two @-@ folder gathering will be chosen as the target and synchron@@ ize with A and / or B as a goal . &quot;
&quot; if you have chosen a target folder , please check whether all entries are displayed in the target folder . there are some options to be displayed in the folder structure . check these options to avoid un@@ happy surprises : &quot;
to make all entries together : select directory file / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the keyboard short@@ cut ) : select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
&quot; if by contra@@ dic@@ tory data types still exist , a message appears to the faul@@ ty elements . you can then select a valid action for them . &quot;
&quot; when you merge all entries , a dialogue window appears with the options to sim@@ ulate and break down . &quot;
&quot; select sim@@ ulating if you want to see what would happen , without which really changes will be made . you will then get a detailed list of all actions . &quot;
&amp; G 3 ; then causes certain actions with all entries . if a manual procedure is needed ( together a single file ) then opens a cl@@ amping window ( note the screen@@ shot ) .
&quot; when you are finished with a file , you will once again launch directories or press F@@ 7 . if you do not yet have saved a corresponding dialog . then results and k@@ diff@@ 3 ; his work with the next post . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a fault , you will see a message and detailed status information . at the end of the list you will see some error messages that continue to select the cause of the problem . so you have the option to select another action for the entry or to resolve the problem in another way before proceeding . &quot;
&quot; if some entries have been merged individually , see themselves &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and results in the later assembled all the entries . even if here the merger will not be considered . only if you change the merger action , these entries will be merged again . &quot;
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu settings - &gt; K@@ User 3 setup ... ) now has a section called folder gathering with these options :
only files that match the indicated patterns are displayed in the element tree . separate plac@@ eholders &apos; : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( eg * .c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default folder must not match this pattern .
&quot; files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the elementary tree ; it can be used more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ o . &quot;
&quot; files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the elementary tree ; it can be used more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ o . &quot;
ignored files that would also be ignored by CV@@ S . many components are ignored by CV@@ S . the great advantage is that this folder specific with a .c@@ v@@ sign@@ or file can be set . ( look at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ signals . )
&quot; in some fil@@ es@@ ystems files have a file attri@@ bute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems , a file is hidden as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files are to be displayed in the elementary tree or not . this option is switched on in default . &quot;
&quot; on links to files : if the option is switched off , symbolic link@@ ages are compared . if the option is switched on , the files are compared to which the links show . this is disabled . &quot;
&quot; on links to folders : if the option is switched off , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is switched on , the links like normal folders will be dealt with and re@@ cur@@ sed . ( note that this option is switched on a folder of a link to itself . ( note that this option is switched off . ) This option is switched on in the default . &quot;
&quot; results a complete analysis of each file by and displays the statistics columns . ( the number redeemed , un@@ common analysis , and essential analysis . ) The full analysis is slow as a simple binary analysis , and much s@@ lower when it is applied to files which does not contain text . ( give an appropriate anti @-@ pattern . ) &quot;
&quot; if you compare a large folder over a long network , it may be faster to compare only the change of change and the file size . however , it costs a certain degree of safety . please use this option in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; similar to the change of change . there is no real comparison instead of that . the files are considered as identical , if they are equal in size . this option can be useful when copying the change date . please use this option in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ating the sync mode when two folders are compared and no target folder has been specified . in this mode , the proposals are identical to the merger , that the results are stored in both folders . this option is switched on in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; if there are differences , the copying of the newer file is proposed as an action . ( this is regarded as uns@@ afe because it is provided that the other file has not been changed . you should consider this in any case . ) This option is switched in the default . &quot;
&quot; if a file or a folder will be replaced or deleted , then the original version will be ren@@ amed and receives the extension .@@ orig@@ . if an old backup file with the .@@ ori@@ g extension has already existed , it will also affect the normal composition of single files , not just the merger folder . this option is switched on in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; normally , the folder gathering will remain visible in the merger of individual files ; you can shift the window parts with the mouse . if you do not want to switch the window and text window , you can switch to the window folder button in the window and switch between folder &amp; text window between the two views . &quot;
&quot; probably you prefer to compare a file simply by double click . nevertheless , you can run a single file to run directly from the folder menu . once you save the result , the status will be done and the file will not be merged if you run the folder . &quot;
this status will however be lost if you read the directory again : read the directory menu : new
KDE supports network transparent with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ diff@@ 3 uses this for reading files and folders . in this way you can specify files and folders for opening that are on local or remote computers .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on a FTP server . the second command line is compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax than local files and folders . a few things you should consider :
&quot; a path can be relative . or .. This is not possible with URLs , these are always absolutely . &quot;
special characters must be m@@ asked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , Leer@@ label &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file with the name / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes through the used protocol . it follows a short list of constraints : &quot;
&quot; or it cannot be distinguished if a link indicates a file or folder . then , a file is accepted as a link destination . ( FTP : , SF@@ TP : ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no way to edit per@@ missions or change of change . therefore , the per@@ missions or change of change from original . ( note the option confidential the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . ) &quot;
&quot; currently , the major use of use is currently being the differences in K@@ Devel@@ op . K@@ Devel@@ op starts first always the built @-@ in differences . to start K@@ diff@@ 3 , press right mouse button on the differences @-@ viewer and then select In K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part view from the context menu . &quot;
normally it is needed &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two full input files . if it is used as a C@@ part . it takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the names of original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then starts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file .
&quot; in the Con@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and preview the context menu preview in - K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work if not any of the original files exists . moreover , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the creation of the patch file . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; @-@ diff@@ 3 ; as part run , it only supports the compar@@ isons of two files , a very small work@@ piece and menu . the interplay or the compar@@ isons is not supported in the K@@ Part mode . &quot;
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ diff@@ 2 ( now He@@ ist ) are already . in addition the name K@@ diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can run as the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff tool collection .
I &apos;ve been using GPL programs already very long and have learned a lot by playing into the sources of other programs . this is my thanks to all programmers who have gone this way or go to it .
&quot; you have compiled the program from the sources and the configure script will probably not be informed the right pre@@ fix to KDE , but then KDE can find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ ADM@@ E file you can find more information on this topic . &quot;
&quot; if only the number of white signs differ , these lines are treated as identical ; however , the line is not identical to each other , the line is considered as not identical . if similar lines appear next to each other , this is a dence , this one is the case . &quot;
&quot; the editor is noticed for any difference in the files where it begins and where it ends . that is necessary to fix a conflict simply by clicking in the source code and selecting the button A / B / C . however , this important information is lost when the result is simply saved as text file and it is too much effort to discour@@ age an own file format that could store this information . &quot;
the effort for this was so far too big . you can restore a particular version always by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger amounts of text should be used another editor .
&quot; after removing text is suddenly lt ; No sr@@ c left , and the text does not delete . what does this mean and how can this be removed ? &quot;
&amp; pc@@ 3 ; uses many colors to highlight of differences . even more high@@ lighting would be conf@@ using and missing the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and bug reports arrived by colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
&quot; to use all functions of &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; you need accommodation , KDE or later . &quot;
information on how to use K@@ diff@@ 3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage .

&quot; to compile and install &amp; diff@@ 3 ; on a system with &amp; KDE ; to compile and install , use the following command in the basic folder of &amp; diff@@ 3 ; -@@ Distribution : &quot;
KDE @-@ dir gives the folder in your system to install in the KDE . if you &apos;re uns@@ ure you will find more details in the RE@@ ADM@@ E file .
&quot; da &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake use , you should not have any problems with comp@@ iling . should nevertheless report difficulties , please report on the &amp; KDE ; -@@ mailing lists . &quot;
cut ( Str@@ g @-@ X or Shift ) copies to the clip@@ board and delet@@ es the selected text . insert the text from the clip@@ board at the current cursor position and replaced the current market position .
&quot; only differences : files that are identical in all folders , not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the target folder . &quot;
&quot; ( in the current program version , you have to re@@ locate the folder to these options to read the folder with the function . ) &quot;
&quot; there are only entries displayed to display the differences . however , the target folder will not be copied into the target folder . if the target folder will not be copied into the target folder . ( the behavior will probably be altered in a later program version . ) This option is switched on in the default settings . &quot;
&quot; note the buttons to choose the source with the label A , B and C below the menu bar . when you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group ( if they are not already present ) , they will click on the button according to the button . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . Under@@ differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white signs . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; p@@ ager , shows a mini @-@ show of all virtual work@@ spaces . it is quite convenient to change the current programs on the work areas to change their size , to finish or move it . this works both within a working area as well . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; p@@ ager , can display all virtual work@@ spaces , as well as the current applications running . the applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and another . &quot;
&quot; with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved inside &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both within a working area and on other work@@ spaces . &quot;
&quot; the context menu depends on how the right mouse button will be cli@@ cked : if on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; however , the context menu has been cli@@ cked on an application within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; however , the context will appear to maxim@@ ize the symbol and the name of the application as well as the entries , maxim@@ ize , on work@@ space and finish . the commands make the following : &quot;
maxim@@ ises the application window on the full size of the desktop . appears only when on an application was cli@@ cked .
drop the application to select virtual desktop . appears only when on an application was cli@@ cked .
&quot; if this connection is marked , the window can be moved within the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other work@@ space . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , are displayed in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the names of virtual work@@ spaces appear . &quot;
&quot; crosses this field leaves the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the numbers of virtual work spaces . is it along with the name , the names of folder will be provided , &amp; eg ; 1 . working area . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , the background of each desktop is also shown as background in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed out , the running programs will be displayed as a small window in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise , only the empty work areas are shown to allow their selection . &quot;
here the view of the program window will be selected . simply shows the window with its standard symbol and pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . remark : Pix@@ map is recommended only for very fast systems .
&quot; here , the arrangement of the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager is determined : classic leaves &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ n @-@ R@@ aster appear , like from P@@ ager applications in some other plastic managers ; Wa@@ it shows all virtual work areas in a horizontal and sen@@ iors in a sen@@ k@@ right row , which is very well suited for the presentation on the desktop . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; p@@ ager , can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager Mini@@ ature range in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be modified in size , which can view the window as symbols or with their content and move it outside the control bar . &quot;
click the right mouse button on the right mouse button ; and subsequent output of switch @-@ switch ... makes the dialog settings appear .
&quot; at the moment , this cannot be modified in the dialog settings . you can do this manually : &quot;
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ p@@ ag@@ err@@ c with any text editor like e.g. &amp; ke@@ dit ; or VI@@ . if you don &apos;t have to log in as a user root or write to your system administrator . in this file you have to enter the key wind@@ ow@@ ment mode and assign it to this one value . possible values are :
&quot; da &amp; k@@ p@@ ager , part of the package base , you need a functional installation of the KDE packages . &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ mag ; is a screen lu@@ pe . you can see with &amp; k@@ mag . this application is interesting for different users : it includes artists , Web @-@ designers and people with a vision . this documentation is meant to be a complete manual for the use of &amp; k@@ mag . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that will constantly be extended by new features . it is optimized for use on high @-@ performance machines . &quot;
&quot; when you go &amp; k@@ like , a window appears as above . the main window of the screen is described . below this window appears as a larger window .. The image that is displayed in the larger window , is an enlarged area of the screen and is listed as a selection window . &quot;
in the default setting increased &amp; k@@ mag ; the area around the mouse pointer as an event@@ ful Lup@@ e . alternatively you can get a selected screen range in the screen window ( selection window ) or the surroundings of the mouse button at the screen ( eg ; on the left side of the screen ) .
&quot; if you want to avoid that the mouse pointer is shown in the enlarged window , select the setting of mouse pointer . please note that the mouse cursor is still not able to detect the form of the mouse cursor . this is always the standard KDE ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ mouse cursor . &quot;
&quot; in the selection window , you can move the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouse keys and change its size . this can be done in the following ways : &quot;
move the mouse cursor over the larger window and keep the left mouse button pressed so you can move the content of the larger window and move it with the arrow keys .
&quot; if you additionally click the &amp; Shift ; taste , or use the &amp; M@@ MB ; you can move the window window . &quot;
&quot; with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the selection window will remain firm and just move the lower right corner . &quot;
&amp; mag ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer to insert in a file to insert it later in other applications ) to rot@@ ate the image and much more .
starts or stops the update of the display . the update of the update causes the required CPU time against 0 .
&quot; select the actu@@ alization rate ( Very low , sc@@ ing , means , high ) . the higher the actu@@ alization rate , the more CPU time is needed . &quot;
in this mode a selection window will be shown . the selected range is displayed in a window .
&quot; &amp; k@@ mag ; uses automatically your ordered short@@ cut to store files , opening a new window , printing , new@@ com@@ ads ( with the button document again load in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , enlarge and los@@ ers &amp; etc . &quot;
k@@ mag also known as &amp; k@@ mag@@ ni@@ fier ; is a screen shot . you can use &amp; k@@ mag@@ ni@@ fier ; to use a range of screen to view the small printed in a paper or a photo . this application is hin@@ dered for different people of benefits : from research or artists to the Web@@ designer or se@@ ams .

&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulated a mouse click , as soon as the mouse cursor is a while on the same place . it is intended to help people to suffer the R@@ SI syndrome ( re@@ peti@@ tive @-@ influ@@ enza syndrome ) and those of each mouse click pain@@ s . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulated a mouse click on the same place as soon as the mouse pointer a while on the same spot . it is meant to help people to em@@ ulate the re@@ peti@@ tive discour@@ age ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and those of each mouse click . moreover , it is possible to em@@ ulate it with the mouse . this requires little practice . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain , which arises in the clicking the mouse . unfortunately , you may also be caused by the mere evidence of your computer . unfortunately , you may have a doctor if this is not done . &quot;
&quot; to make it even clear@@ er : even if &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pain@@ s avoid that when clicking with the mouse is caused by clicking the mouse , us@@ eless . and as with all ergonomic aid equipment : the result can be different for everyone . &quot;
&quot; the use of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and leads a mouse click , once you break the movement short . &quot;
&quot; is the intelligent tra@@ verse activ@@ ates , makes &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a break after it is running the mouse button . now move the mouse by the end of the movement . this way , you can run it up to the end of the movement . in this way , you can run it up to the end of the movement . this smart move requires a little practice , but you get used quickly . &quot;
&quot; these wo@@ unds must be hidden after the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click . &quot;
&quot; is intelligent re@@ loc@@ ating , the shooting time is set up ( 1 / 10 s ) active . here the time is set , the &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after the shut@@ ters of the mouse button , before it leaves the mouse again , if there is no evidence of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports the clicks by mouse @-@ postpon@@ ement . this function will now be activated by a break , followed by a break , a click with the right mouse button . a lengthy click . these movements are started in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stream / km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time is started , but they can later be changed later . &quot;
&quot; if the sound is delayed , you can move &amp; KDE ; to move the reaction times , choose sound system and here the tab in general . there is a sli@@ der sound system and here the rider in general . there is a sli@@ der sound buffer that you can adjust to a lower level to shor@@ ten the answers . &quot;
&quot; this setting is marked , is marked &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at each start of &amp; KDE ; at each start of &amp; KDE ; available . this function is currently available only under &amp; KDE ; available in GNO@@ ME or other window environments , please drag the relevant documentation to find out how to start a program automatically . &quot;
&quot; all settings sets back to the values that were set up when opening the dialogue . have you already pushed the button user @-@ pressed , the settings are placed on the stand after the last press release of users . &quot;
&quot; best use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first use with the pres@@ ets . especially the intelligent tra@@ verse should be switched off at first . if you then click on the automatic mouse button , you can later increase the intelligent move . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; KDE ; at sounds . &quot;
&quot; first , you should be aware of which places a mouse click without effect remains : the clicking on the neutral components of windows or on places in the browser window , which do not display any link , does not cause any unauthorized reactions . you can therefore use the mouse in such places until you want to use them again . &quot;
&quot; if your mouse bu@@ cks , you should clean@@ se your mouse . it is usually pretty simple . the tri@@ ck is usually clean , but also the roles that come with the mouse ball . &quot;
&quot; first , you must take out the mouse ball . as that happens , is of mouse to mouse differently . it should be quickly clear if you see the under@@ side of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the roles . these are on the sides of the Lo@@ ches which was inserted in which the ball was inserted . the tri@@ ck and the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ings can be easily cr@@ ashed with a flat blade or the sm@@ ing@@ ern@@ acle . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations , the operating system dis@@ rup@@ ts the execution of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if in this case the intelligent adjustment was started , that is that &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the surgery can no longer end by leaving the mouse button . &quot;
this happens when you use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; using another window manager and move a window .
&quot; the solution to this problem is that you have to execute a mouse click . here , the status of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; return and you can work as usual . &quot;
problem : if you enter text tries to run &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continues mouse clicks and sets the cursor to another place .
&quot; solution : use the mouse to place the cursor , where you want to place it . but let the mouse give rise to a neutral area of the desktop , if you don &apos;t want to create a ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ cking reactions . so you do not want to create a keyboard short@@ cuts . safe zones for the mouse cursor are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the tool tool and the cover lines of windows . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with the intelligent tra@@ verse , but I do not create it to edit the text . &quot;
&quot; the intelligent move is an advanced function of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time to copy it into the clip@@ board , to copy it into the clip@@ board and paste it again or any other action you want to move into the clip@@ board . but it will probably only have problems to prepare it . here are some advice to this : &quot;
&quot; use the smart move not only if you just start using &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to use text instead , follow the mouse button on the other end of the text and keep the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and again click the mouse button again . &quot;
&quot; use the audi@@ ble mouse click . thus , every@@ time , when &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse presses a sound like a mouse click . later , you can use the smart grids without the audi@@ ble mouse click . but this requires some exercise . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use the X@@ Test enlargement for &amp; X Window ; that should be the case in most system . &quot;
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and speaker and this is correct .
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; bed the mouse @-@ mouse as soon as the mouse pointer is short @-@ har@@ med . this program was developed for people who suffer at R@@ SI syndrome and those of the bl@@ asts of the Mau@@ sta@@ sten pain . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured so that there is a certain time waiting for that a goat process starts , before the mouse will start automatically . in this way it can also be done with the mouse . &quot;

&quot; &amp; km@@ outh ; is a program , with the mu@@ gs user can speak their computers for themselves . &quot;
&quot; with the program &amp; km@@ outh ; you can let the computer speak the computer for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the course of propositions , which should be talked again . &quot;
&quot; on the first page of the wizard ( left screen@@ shot ) , enter the command , which will be used later for the voice output of text . further details can be found in the description of the set @-@ up catalog . &quot;
on the second page you can choose the default text box . from the text@@ box books you can often choose text passages without type it . the text pass@@ able can of course be edited .
&quot; on the third page ( right screen shot ) , you determine the dictionary for the vocabulary . &amp; km@@ outh ; reads the KDE @-@ documentation of the selected language to determine the frequency of each word . additionally , you can match the word list with an Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly the words can be recorded in the vocabulary . &quot;
the main window of &amp; km@@ outh ; is clear and essentially a input field for the keyboard hub of your propositions ( the lower white box in the screen@@ shot ) and a sli@@ ce memory of the already sung phrases ( the upper white box in the screen@@ shot ) .
&quot; if you have a km@@ outh ; correctly you can enter in the input field , you can hear in the input field you want to listen to the exp@@ iration memory . you can select from the propositions which should be talked again . &quot;
&quot; with the menu entry settings characteristic ; set up the settings dialog of &amp; km@@ outh ; this dialog contains two card cards , voice output and settings , the page of Wor@@ ship , as well as the page K@@ T@@ T@@ SD language . &quot;
&quot; in the input field of the map voice , enter the command to call for voice @-@ generator . in the field field below the input field , insert the drawing firm to be passed on with the text to the voice generator . &quot;
&amp; km@@ outh ; knows two types to pass the text . select the connector box when the text is made to be passed as default to the voice generator .
&quot; if the box is not selected , the text will be passed as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command to the voice output depends on your language generator . this command can be found in the documentation to your language generator . examples for this you will find in the app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; using as a language service will be used as a language service ; as the first try to pass the text on this page . the kt@@ ts@@ d language service is a &amp; KDE , the other settings on this page is further developed and the choice of this option is useful , even if K@@ T@@ T@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
&quot; with the first selection field action after the selection of a text cycle , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cuts or by choosing a text cycle in the menu text box format or in the bar for text pass@@ agen@@ books . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of So@@ fort , the selected text passes directly talked and additionally entered into the memory memory . with the selection of In the input field the selected text cycle is first entered only into the input field . &quot;
&quot; with the second drop @-@ field shot of the editing window for text pass@@ agen@@ buch , you can specify whether the text @-@ mail book when closing the editing window will be automatically saved . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of text pass@@ codes , the book will save the book . if you choose changes will not be saved . select on saving , will be saved &amp; km@@ outh ; ask whether the text message can be stored . &quot;
&quot; the page Wor@@ ship supplement contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries on the vocabulary . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; km@@ outh ; a selection field , if this list contains more than a dictionary . with this selection field you can choose the currently used dic@@ tion@@ aries on the vocabulary . &quot;
&quot; with buttons on the right , you can delete dic@@ tion@@ aries or export the order of books or export them into a file . below the list you can set the language in the input field and set the language for the dictionary . &quot;
&quot; for this source the desired language ; &amp; km@@ outh ; read , then read the &amp; KDE ; and documentation . the frequency of the individual words will be obtained simply by lower@@ ing of the occurrence . in addition , you can compare the text list with an Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary , in order to just add correct words into the new dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with this option you can merge the available words of dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; km@@ outh ; asks for what dic@@ tion@@ aries are brought together , and how these weight@@ ed shall be . &quot;
&quot; with this option you place a new , empty dictionary with no entries to . da &amp; km@@ outh ; new entered words automatically into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary over time . &quot;
the main area of the window for the processing of text pass@@ codes is divided . in the upper part the text @-@ pass@@ agen@@ books are shown as tree structure .
&quot; in the lower part you can edit a selected item . if you choose a text track , you can change the text flow or the related keyboard short@@ cut , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; actions such as new text passages or books add or select selected text passages and books , you can either reach the selection in the menu bar , in the tool tool or via a fol@@ dable menu . &quot;
&quot; the order of text pass@@ codes or text passages , you can change by hand with the mouse to the new location or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; -@@ button . &quot;
&quot; the chosen text is cut off and copied into the clip@@ board . if in the input field , a text section is selected , this is used , otherwise the selected areas of the drive storage . &quot;
&quot; the chosen text will be copied into the clip@@ board . if in the input field , a text section is selected , this is used , otherwise the selected ranges of drive storage . &quot;
&quot; the currently active set is spoken . if text is located in the input field , this is used , otherwise the selected sets of failure . &quot;
&quot; this menu entry is displayed , a movable tool used with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed directly under the menu bar . by mouse click on the left button and hand side can be moved to another place . &quot;
&quot; is this menu entry handed down , a narrow bar in the lower part of the main window with hints about the status of &amp; km@@ outh ; displayed if not crossed , this status bar is un@@ folded . &quot;
&quot; this menu entry is displayed , a movable bar for text pass@@ agen@@ books arranged with entries . the bar is placed directly under the tool window . by mouse click on the left @-@ hand side and to@@ es the tool can be moved to another place . &quot;
&quot; probably you have the command for the voice output is not correct or incomplete . open the settings for the voice output , and enter the command for the voice output on the map voice output . ( see setting dialog for language syn@@ thesi@@ zer to further details . ) &quot;
&quot; Festival is a voice @-@ edition of the University of Edinburgh . currently , only English , Spanish and W@@ alis@@ isch supported . the license allows to use the festival for free to use and without restrictions . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is believed that festival in the folder / usr / local / festival is installed . the command to the voice output is then : &quot;
&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a in &amp; Java ; written language generator . currently , he only supports the English language . the license allows to use Free@@ T@@ TS free of charge and without restrictions . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is believed that Free@@ T@@ TS can be installed in the folder / usr / local / fre@@ et . the voice output is then possible with one of the three following command examples : &quot;
&quot; for the third example , the option must be switched as standard input . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . ) &quot;
&quot; M@@ BRO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it conver@@ ts a list of ph@@ on@@ emen in a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to release the text in Ph@@ on@@ eme . the license allows it to use M@@ BRO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications . &quot;
&quot; in our example H@@ adi@@ fax uses H@@ adi@@ fax to convert the German text in Ph@@ on@@ eme for M@@ BRO@@ LA , under the assumption that H@@ adi@@ fax and M@@ BRO@@ LA in / usr / local / hadi@@ sts fax and / usr / local / mb@@ ro@@ la are installed . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately H@@ adi@@ fax likes the last sign of the text , so that an extra character must be displayed . the full command is therefore elaborate as in the other examples : &quot;
( Cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BAR _ / usr / local / mb@@ ro@@ la / de@@ 1 / de@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; art@@ s@@ play / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written into a row . the option data as standard input must be switched on .
the voice @-@ on @-@ dem@@ on of &amp; KDE ; ( K@@ T@@ T@@ SD ) is a &amp; KDE ; -@@ further language service provided by all &amp; KDE ; -@@ applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ T@@ T@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different language output systems .
&quot; as the attitude of the voice @-@ generator is done only in the K@@ T@@ T@@ SD , you must only use as a language service as a language service in &amp; km@@ outh ; &quot;
&quot; to adjust the site K@@ T@@ T@@ SD language service , which is in the setting dialog of &amp; km@@ outh ; appears when K@@ T@@ T@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; km@@ outh ; successfully use , you need a voice generator ( and of course &amp; KDE ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; km@@ outh ; requires about 15 MB memory ( and in addition to memory for the voice generator ) , but depends on your computer and its configuration . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ outh ; is an application with the people who cannot speak , text by the computer . it will be saved a list of already sung phrases that can be re @-@ handed over again and again . &quot;
note that &amp; km@@ outh ; no voice syn@@ thesi@@ zer contains . on the computer has to be a voice syn@@ thesi@@ zer .

&quot; &amp; kt@@ on ; - the voice output system of &amp; KDE ; - is an of modules of existing service , which allows everyone to use text about the &amp; D@@ bus ; interface . &quot;
&amp; kt@@ u ; is a particle system in &amp; KDE ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; KDE ; -@@ programmers ready to be equipped with which their applications with T@@ TS skills . also the users provides interesting possibilities .
&quot; read of texts ( or parts thereof ) in the text editor &amp; K@@ ate ; , even if &amp; K@@ ate ; in other &amp; KDE ; -@@ applications embedded . &quot;
&quot; the voice output is carried out via the program speech disp@@ at@@ cher , the different background program such as es@@ peak , festival , &amp; etc . &quot;
enables the generation of language editions on the command line ( or with Shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; aid program .
&quot; in Z@@ UK@@ UN@@ FT : support for Speech @-@ up languages like Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Speech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Met@@ a @-@ Language ( SM@@ ML ) . &quot;
&quot; the voice output of &amp; KDE ; , an application without visible window , the T@@ TS @-@ services via &amp; D@@ Bus ; offers . &quot;
an application with &amp; GUI ; for the configuration and equipment of kt@@ ts@@ d on kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr in the system section .
a module for the web browser &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; for reading the texts of a website or parts thereof .
a module for the text editor &amp; K@@ ate ; with which a text file can be read completely or partially .
&quot; in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; KDE ; ( http : / / bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) you can find the list on http : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) , you can also find the list on http : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ info / KDE @-@ accessibility . the developers can also be found in the IR@@ C ( ir@@ c.@@ k@@ de@@ .org , channel # KDE accessibility ) . &quot;
marriage you &amp; kt@@ on ; you may need to install program speech disp@@ at@@ cher and set correctly . see also
&quot; when the first start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr or long as long as no speaker are installed , the card card will be displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker , the card card will appear . see . &quot;
&quot; most T@@ TS @-@ Syn@@ thesi@@ zer offer different languages and voices , so also different male or female , or such that can differ in volume or speed . you can also use multiple variants for a syn@@ thesi@@ zer , voice , generation , volume and speed . you should at least one speaker before you &amp; kt@@ u , since the program speed disp@@ disp@@ at@@ cher is otherwise used the standard driver . &quot;
various speakers for the same syn@@ thesi@@ zer are comparable to several print performance for the same printers .
&quot; if you click on the cart@@ on board in kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr , the card card will be displayed automatically . it also appears automatically when you start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and not yet set any speaker . &quot;
all already furnished speakers appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear on top of the list . the highest speaker is used for the voice output if an application is no speaker .
select a speaker from the list and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
select a speaker from the list and click on this button to change the settings below . see below .
&quot; select a mouse click on this button , and click on this button to push the speaker in the list a line further down . the sequence of speaker in the list is also determined its priority . &quot;
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; desktop system .
&quot; choose here a proxy type , there are three male and three female voices as well as a junior and casual food to choose from . &quot;
&quot; click here , appears on the new speaker on the map card . to change the settings of this microphone , click Edit . &quot;
&quot; now you can use &amp; kt@@ u ; already almost use . go back to the map card and check whether language output is activated ( K@@ T@@ T@@ SD ) , so that the T@@ TS service can be activated ( K@@ T@@ T@@ SD ) . click here . now , click on the map orders to create text orders and manage text orders . &quot;
&quot; if you have set up at least one speaker , you can start the voice system from &amp; KDE ; click on the map @-@ card reader to open this map card . here you can set some general options . &quot;
&quot; select this document , to activate the &amp; kt@@ u ; this start is successful , the card @-@ T@@ TS order is displayed and you can create text orders and read it . see . remove the mark@@ ings , becomes K@@ T@@ T@@ SD and the T@@ TS @-@ System of &amp; KDE ; de@@ activated . &quot;
&quot; if kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is finished , runs &amp; kt@@ u ; further , provided in the field of language output ( K@@ T@@ T@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; this connection is marked and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr will automatically appear in the system range of control bar , it dis@@ appears as soon as the pre @-@ read is completed . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this series , you can start text orders , stop and resume . &quot;
&quot; with buttons in this series you can read the current text in the &amp; KDE , or open a text file to read it . you can also change the speaker for an order . &quot;
&quot; click on users or OK , then all changed settings are taken on all sides . &quot;
the card orders will only be shown when K@@ T@@ T@@ SD has started . to start K@@ T@@ T@@ SD , click on the map @-@ card and tick the voice output ( K@@ T@@ T@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; KDE ; , you can read the text of the displayed website . check the text , which should be read and select in the main menu Tools text . after a short time the voice output should begin . &quot;
&quot; it is almost always logical to mark the desired text of a website . you can also skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; -@@ thrilling lines and other un@@ visible brands are also read . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; K@@ ate ; the extended text editor of &amp; KDE ; , you can read the text on it . check the text , which is to read and select in the main menu Tools text . then the voice output should begin . &quot;
&quot; this also works , if &amp; K@@ ate ; in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or , or in &amp; qu@@ anta ; &quot;
&quot; K@@ Noti@@ fy is the retro@@ spective system of &amp; KDE , which you notified about you about you . you can also read the text of this messages also by &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IR@@ C program of &amp; KDE ; , you can set up different types of messages . you can also set up a message when entering an IR@@ C channel , in which your nickname occurs . with &amp; nbsp ; you can then read the IR@@ C retro@@ spective text . &quot;
&quot; supports a &amp; KDE ; -@@ program K@@ Noti@@ fy , a menu entry will appear in the menu Settings of this program . the possible settings for K@@ notification differ depending on the application . &quot;
&quot; filter for drawing up a good opportunity to correct and correct , is a good example . it is a good example . you removed the Tags br and b from the news , the K@@ Mail , and also the expression / local / In@@ box , since this in most cases can be accepted as provided . read also . &quot;
filters are one of the advanced skills of &amp; D ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ on ; are filters not required .
&quot; in Fil@@ ters , text will be processed , before he will be sent to the program speech disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for improving the pron@@ unci@@ ation , in order to select a suitable language and speaker or to deal with certain defects of voice syn@@ thesi@@ zer and their votes . &quot;
&quot; to understand the working method of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distingu@@ ishes four types of texts . &quot;
&quot; the edition of Screen Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it will be read in all other orders , and maintains this orders . if the output of the screen reader is pre @-@ read , the raised orders will be continued . &quot;
warning have the next priority . this level is important messages like &amp; eg ; processor will be too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will be continued after the issue of warning .
&quot; messages have the next @-@ edge priority . a message canc@@ els normal text . &amp; km@@ outh ; is an example of an application , which can be used . during you &amp; eg ; a long text on a web page , you can see with &amp; km@@ outh . &amp; KDE ; -@@ aler@@ ts are also news . read it . &quot;
&quot; the rest are simple text orders . each order , which you encounter from the card orders is a text order . K@@ S@@ ay@@ it is an example of a applications that uses text orders . text orders are intended for the output of longer texts , which have no particular ur@@ gency . &quot;
&quot; all four orders are processed in queue , except the output of Screen Re@@ aders . if an application reads the output of a screen Re@@ aders , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just such a pre @-@ reads , this issue is raised and finished . &quot;
&quot; first , you must know that filters will never be applied to the output of screen reproduction . they are applied to normal warning , news and text , as well as on &amp; KDE ; -@@ News . &quot;
filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . at the moment there are three types of filters .
filters are executed as modules . in the future there can be even further types of filters .
&quot; drawing parts of a text by other text . to replace them , you can either use as words or as regular expressions , which enable the use of chat @-@ how : - ) through text or for forming messages from &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; or &amp; mail ; in a better compreh@@ ensible form possible . &quot;
&amp; XML ; -@@ conver@@ ters use a X@@ SLT @-@ file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format to a different format . in the scope of &amp; X@@ HTML files are included in the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML .
&quot; using appointments , you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program , which sent the text to &amp; kt@@ u ; if you have to read a female voice , you can read text from KDE messages about it . &quot;
&quot; each of these different filters has adjustable rules , according to which it is applied to a voice output . if the filter is determined that its rules does not apply , he will continue the text unchanged to the next Filter . &quot;
&quot; if a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; KDE ; -@@ notification of &amp; kt@@ on ; will be edited by all the activated filters , which were set up on the page below . the filter is carried out in order in order from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; this shows the list of the furnished normal filters . it is not enabled by a filter , it is not enabled and is not used . filter will be processed from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; click here to add a new filter . select the type of the filter , and it will be shown below the following furnishings . &quot;
&quot; for setting up character sets , you must enter a list of words or regular expressions as compar@@ isons . these patterns are found in the text then the text will be exchanged against the corresponding sub@@ text . large and low @-@ resolution will not be observed when compared . &quot;
&quot; enter a name for your filters . this name can you choose any number , it needs to be distinguished only by the name of the other filters . &quot;
&quot; this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the drawing chains in the column , and replaced it in accordance with the string of the column . the list is shown in the sequence from top to bottom . &quot;
click here to move the marked word or the regular expression in the list .
&quot; with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file to store or delete the current list from a file , the entries are attached to the existing list . &quot;
&quot; here is a language entered here , the filter is only used when the speaker for the text order is one of the languages listed here . you can also select multiple languages if you click the &amp; C@@ trl button . &quot;
&quot; here is a value entered , the filter is only used when the text comes from one of the given applications . you can enter multiple programs separately by comm@@ ata . example : conversation , k@@ mail &quot;
&quot; the application ID check@@ up programs get you away with the q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; D@@ bus ; -@@ Num@@ bers must leave you away . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID Cop@@ ete @-@ 34@@ 32 , you may only enter copy . &quot;
the string filter is only applied to the text when all conditions apply with an entry in the box dialog box when match . are all input fields empty , the filter is applied to all texts . &quot;
&quot; in comparison of words used the drawing reduction filter regular expressions in the shape \ \ s word \ \ . the words must therefore be limited by separ@@ ations ( blank spaces ) . &quot;
this manual contains no instructions for writing regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; KDE ; -@@ editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; expressions &amp; # 160 ; expressions can be found in the pack@@ deu@@ ti@@ ls .
&amp; XML ; -@@ conver@@ ters translate / XML ; with the help of X@@ SLT files from a format to another format . X@@ SLT ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such surveys . it can only be installed on well @-@ shaped XML . the aid program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c must be installed on your system .
enter the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the ambient variable P@@ AT@@ H also reaches x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
&quot; using the microphone filters , you can send texts to a specific speaker that is set to a specific speaker , or to a speaker with certain properties . you can specify the example that texts by k@@ mail can be read by a female voice . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; kt@@ on ; a text on the filter passes , there is a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected by means of speaker features , which is selected by the speaker . the speaker is selected , and the characteristics of the speaker on cardboard card . with the speaker , you can over@@ write the selected speaker . &quot;
&quot; here is a value entered , the filter is used in case the text contains the entered regular expression . is installed on your system of &amp; KDE ; -@@ editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; to view it with one click on the button to view help in the entry . &quot;
&quot; to achieve a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; here you place the characteristics of your desired microphone . if the text complies with the above filter conditions , the speaker will be chosen to view the desired requirements . click on the button to the right to view the dialog box . &quot;
use these buttons to store or load your microphone settings or delete all settings .
the microphone filter is only applied to the text when all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen Filter if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
&quot; the voice @-@ output API , from &amp; KDE ; , with the programmer may give their applications T@@ TS @-@ abilities . applications communicate with K@@ T@@ T@@ SD about &amp; D@@ bus ; . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ T@@ T@@ SD module API , with the voice syn@@ thesi@@ zer to K@@ T@@ T@@ SD will be added , so that this syn@@ thesi@@ zer can use . &quot;
the following section contains a brief description of the &amp; KDE ; -@@ D@@ bus ; -@@ interface of the voice output API from &amp; KDE ; . complete documentation for both APIs can be found on the KDE ; Acc@@ essi@@ bility webpage ( http : / / accessi@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .

&quot; here , text of the text read and option a language code such as &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ; &quot;
there are even more commands that you can use . for a list of all orders you give

none of the named language syn@@ thesi@@ zer supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesi@@ zer for my language ?
&quot; I have set the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ forming filters , but when using the module for Festival will not be read . &quot;
&quot; due to a mistake in Festival 1.@@ 95 , you will need to install the ( male British ) voice of Rab _ di@@ phone to do so if you do not use this voice to read about web pages . make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c will not be installed and over the ambient variable P@@ AT@@ H . &quot;
&quot; certain signs or punc@@ tu@@ tions seem to cause error when syn@@ thesi@@ zer , so all propositions are over@@ spr@@ inkl@@ es or only Kau@@ ts@@ es . what can I do against it ? &quot;
&quot; first , make sure that the option sign up for the appropriate language is set for the appropriate language . there are problems with certain signs or words , these may possibly be solved by a string filters . &quot;

K@@ T@@ TS works with any language syn@@ thesi@@ zer which can be started on the command line in a &amp; kon@@ sole ;
&quot; the list of the above languages can be incomplete or obsol@@ ete . therefore , drag the description of syn@@ thesi@@ zer to the supported languages . take a look at the website of the site ; according to information , which are not yet in this handbook . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; &quot; uses a adap@@ table module architecture for language syn@@ thesi@@ zer . if you want to expand the use of another syn@@ thesi@@ zers , contact the developer team . &quot;
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter is not mandatory . Debian User may install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
&quot; to comp@@ iling , you need a current development environment from KDE ( version 3.4 or newer ) including the packages k@@ deli@@ bs and the developer files for the program &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot;
&quot; if you have downloaded the source texts from &amp; kt@@ on ; from the source text archive for k@@ de@@ accessibility , or downloaded for each night to date Tar@@ ball , and install the program with the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before you use &amp; kt@@ on ; use , check whether speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher works with your language syn@@ thesi@@ zer correctly . this is why you can use the shell script @-@ conf file . &quot;
&amp; kt@@ u ; in &amp; KDE ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ u ; it is the first version of &amp; @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr is to be developed so much that the setup of speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher is directly possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed .
&quot; a long text will be dis@@ placed in individual sentences . the user can go , repeat , repeat the output or crash . &quot;
&quot; if an application is sent to &amp; kt@@ on ; there may be the properties of the preferred microphone for the output , the language is English and its gender female , this is used , otherwise , the best appropriate speaker will be chosen . if you want to learn more about how &amp; that is chosen ; a speaker will be chosen , you will be able to see you . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the cart@@ on board for adding , and then click on the list to insert a speaker to the list , the card @-@ card set is shown . as an example , the setting up of the module for Festival Interactive is shown below . &quot;
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path is included to Festival in P@@ AT@@ H you just have to enter festival .
&quot; select the string coding for text , who will be handed over to Festival . in voices that will automatically be made . generally , the Western languages ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 use , eastern languages like Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; with these sli@@ ders , you make volume , intercom speed and sound height of the synthe@@ tic language . if you can not select some regul@@ ator and be displayed this grey , the voice that you choose not to choose these settings . &quot;
&quot; some voices such as multi@@ sy@@ n voices need to be loaded on due to their size several seconds . if you load this connection , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ T@@ T@@ SD , so that the first set is faster syn@@ thesi@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; if this connection can not be selected , you do not have a spokes@@ person ( or forgot to click on users ) . &quot;
&quot; this connection is marked with the start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is shown at the start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr . otherwise , after starting the icon is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; if this connection is marked and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is not yet available , it appears in the system range , once K@@ T@@ T@@ SD will read a text in the system , once K@@ T@@ T@@ SD will read a text . this gives you the possibility to read or manage it in any other way . &quot;
&quot; here are all orders listed in queue , along with the application that has set the order , the number of propositions and the straight set . the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the map card . &quot;
&quot; with buttons in this series , you can choose according to the order that is selected in the list below - or go back . ( but not every order consists of several sentences ) . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on OK , all changes of settings ( also on the other card cards ) and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr will be reduced to the icon in the system section . click on this symbol to display the program window again . &quot;
&quot; if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the map audio . see also . &quot;
&quot; here , only text orders are performed and managed . issues of Screen Re@@ aders , war@@ nings and messages are not displayed . further information about the identification types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in . &quot;

the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules which are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you have to find out which device works with you . in doubt you choose standard .
&quot; on this map , you can set up special promotions that will always be executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processed four types of language entries : &quot;
&quot; the edition of Screen Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it is presented to all other orders , and maintains this orders . after the output of the Screen Reader has been pre @-@ read , the raised orders are recorded again . &quot;
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important messages like &amp; eg ; processor becomes too hot reserved . a warning holds the output of messages and normal text . this orders will be continued after reading the warning .
&quot; News have the next priority . a message canc@@ els normal text . &amp; km@@ outh ; is an example of an application that speaks messages . if you have a long text on a website , you can welcome you with &amp; km@@ outh ; nevertheless someone welcome you to enter the room . &quot;
&quot; if a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen Re@@ aders , adds &amp; kt@@ u ; the audio output in queue . &quot;
this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both introduc@@ tory sound is active as well as introduc@@ tory message will be played by the introduc@@ tory sound before the introduc@@ tory message .
&quot; the settings on this cardboard card apply only for normal text orders . for messages , warning and the editions of Screen Re@@ aders there are no special promotions , if this is interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &quot;
to release with &amp; kt@@ ts ; K@@ Noti@@ fy messages to read , start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and click on noti@@ fications . the map noti@@ fications appears . &quot;

&quot; the Speech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to mark text for a voice output , the voice speed , the voice speed , the sex speed , of the voice and sound height . SS@@ ML is a part of Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , an additional W@@ 3@@ C standard . &quot;
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in the basic functions . the following limitations are present :
&quot; you must install the Rab _ di@@ phone voice ( bri@@ tish male ) , since this is the standard voice that uses the Festival in the output of SS@@ ML . &quot;
&quot; if the settings for speed or audio is set in the festival configuration dialog , not on 100@@ th % , SS@@ ML text is usually very mon@@ ot@@ on spoken . &quot;
&quot; &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; &lt; ? XML version = &quot; &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &lt; ! Doc@@ s = &quot; &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; &quot; ? &gt; &lt; !

&quot; there are two kinds of filters - normal filters and typ@@ ing limits filter ( SD@@ B @-@ Filter ) . SB@@ Ds under@@ share text into individual sentences . this can also be trac@@ ed up , not all the text order . thus you can also stop or stop or stop and break , even if the voice syn@@ thesi@@ zer does not support this directly . &quot;
&quot; here you can see the typ@@ ing limits filter . on the first start of &amp; kt@@ u , it is automatically set up a proposition limit filter automatically . you can change its settings or add further typ@@ ing limits filter , beginning it is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; most easiest to learn how to try the setup selection , and enter text to read . check the card details and check out how the selection of Spe@@ aker has changed , otherwise you need to have more than one spokes@@ person , otherwise the filter is un@@ effective . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ u ; then faster with the pre @-@ read , since only the first set has to be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long , &quot;
&quot; you will then stop text files on the map orders or break @-@ off , even if the voice syn@@ thesi@@ zer has not supported this function . &quot;
&quot; for these reasons , the normal sc@@ atz@@ ation filter is automatic set out if you start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off only . change nothing at this filter , unless you know what you do . &quot;
&quot; typ@@ ing limits , compare text with a regular expression for s@@ atz@@ ating and add a tab@@ ular code 8 ) at the typ@@ ing limits ( dec@@ imal numbers , are automatically removed from the text ) . note that the standard proposition is automatically re@@ tains the character string filter . &quot;
&quot; sb@@ d filter will never be applied to &amp; KDE ; -@@ messages ( none ) , warning , news or the edition of Screen Re@@ aders . &quot;
&quot; if you purchased from Ver@@ don &apos;t want to insert the normal S@@ atz@@ ati@@ cal filter , you can insert this again by loading the file standard _ sb@@ dr@@ c ; included file standard _ sb@@ dr@@ c . &quot;
&quot; on the map card , you can over@@ write the microphone settings for the application . the card card will be displayed if &quot;
use of the standard # ( the top on the map card ) . in other words : there are no talk properties .
&quot; using the appropriate microphone , which shows all properties of an equipped microphone . if you do not delete or edit the settings of the microphone . otherwise , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker made , the most likely the featured properties are con@@ stituted . &quot;
select the method to enter the desired microphone properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
&quot; select the characteristics of the desired microphone . if this property does not play any role , you indicate nothing . &quot;
&quot; select this document , if the property should have priority over other properties . you can also set several mark@@ ings here . &quot;
&quot; since the language is a critical factor when entering the issue , this property is rarely used as a priority feature . you might want to indicate the attri@@ bute language , is before you know that a certain application text is sent in another language than that in the working environment . &quot;
&quot; to use all properties in the subject speakers , which corresponds to the following text , click on the button @-@ button @-@ speakers and then use on speaker , which corresponds to the following . &quot;
in this case 0 is 0 for the last text order in queue . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number is input 0 required ) .
&quot; kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr falls immediately when it is started . I have compiled Deb@@ ug support , but I do not get back@@ tracking . &quot;
G@@ stre@@ amer is over@@ thrown and is finished . probably you have to register G@@ stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x is the command G@@ ST register @-@ 0.8 . if the problem is not solved , possibly a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ stre@@ amer installed . you can try to update gen@@ Stre@@ amer or uninstall . &quot;
&quot; the audio output via AL@@ SA does not work when I play music at the same time with another application music . if I receive a text order , fri@@ ert &amp; kt@@ ts ; a message appears : it appears to open PC@@ M . &quot;
&quot; on your system there is the problem that conflicts at AL@@ SA occur , which can prevent a simultaneous opening of several PC@@ M devices . references to possible solutions can be found on the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ project@@ .org . &quot;
I have loaded an additional voice for the festival from the internet . I installed them and can use it in Festival but kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr does not show this voice .
&quot; add in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / festival@@ int / Vo@@ ices the new voice . as a guide , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; when you have found the voice to the developer . &quot;
&quot; on the map audio there is a setting speed . so this works , the program is so@@ x installed and on the ambient variable P@@ AT@@ H . some syn@@ thesi@@ zer@@ modul@@ s like Festival Interactive offer an setting for speed . depending on the chosen voice is this active or in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; the settings for the microphone speed will be ignored when it is controlled ; &amp; HTML , has its own tags . ) De@@ activate either the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; according to &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are totally brave , change the .@@ x@@ sl file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ according to @-@ SS@@ ML @-@ forming filters , and set up the microphone speed . &quot;
&quot; I do not create it that websites are read with a female voice . I have a female festival spokes@@ person , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the websites with a male voice . &quot;
at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta the day S@@ able GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . thus festival does not reproduce the X@@ SL file to converting SS@@ ML to S@@ but the GEN@@ DER @-@ Tags . the same applies to the VO@@ ICE tags .
&quot; I added a drawing filter filter and now I can move in &amp; kt@@ ts ; no more extrac@@ tor , or go back . on the map @-@ press orders the order is visible only from one sentence . what do I do wrong ? &quot;
&quot; sign @-@ mark ( point , Fr@@ age@@ characters , pe@@ a and Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on ) you may not be fil@@ tered . use for these characters instead a filter for typ@@ ing unlimited detection . &quot;
AL@@ SA ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; Sound Architecture ) . AL@@ SA is installed on most systems with &amp; Linux ; already installed . ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ project@@ .org )

&quot; some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA conflicts at the audio output . if your system also counts , you can not play music and read a text . &amp; nbsp ; free@@ zes also , if you find a text order and then another start . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) . &quot;
&quot; with Stand of July 2005 , a@@ Co@@ de has not yet supported a real break . if you keep a text order in &amp; kt@@ u , the current set shall still be read yet . &quot;
&quot; the audio program so@@ x is used for general adjustment of microphone speed , but otherwise not necessarily necessary . Debian users can install so@@ x with the command apt @-@ get install so@@ x . the program is already included on most &amp; Linux ; -@@ CDs already included . &quot;

&quot; before you use &amp; kt@@ on ; please check whether your language syn@@ thesi@@ zer correctly works . follow the instructions you have with the syn@@ thesi@@ zer . &quot;
&quot; Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thesi@@ zer , whose source code is revealed in general . the quality of the voices is generally good , and there are several voices and languages . with many voices you can play volume , speaking speed and sound height . &quot;
&quot; you have to install at least one language . help to read it in the instructions that will be delivered with festival . would you like to read web pages , you have to install the ( male British ) voice of Rab _ di@@ phone . &quot;
&quot; for these voices , you have to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on the transmission . &quot;
&quot; this voice sets up Festival 1,@@ 95 beta or newer . the voice is still in an early stage development . un@@ pack the software at the festival / lib / Vo@@ ices / Russian / . if you have the Russian voices , you need to enter Russian votes for the voices ms@@ u _ ru _ n@@ sh _ di@@ sh _ di@@ sh _ di@@ sh _ di@@ sh _ di@@ sh . choose a Cy@@ ril@@ lic _ di@@ sh ( 8 @-@ Bit@@ - ) enco@@ ding as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
Festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux ; -@@ distribu@@ tions . look for festival therefore first on the CDs of your distribution .
&quot; if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the option has to set enco@@ ding to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the option has to set enco@@ ding to a 8 @-@ bit Ky@@ ri@@ ll@@ able as an example of KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
Festival can be used together with the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ syn@@ thesi@@ zer . then he takes over the l@@ exi@@ kal@@ ine analysis and &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; creates the audio output . the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ program and the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; no complete language system is . &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; generated language from Di@@ ph@@ on files . you need additional software to create these di@@ vers . Festival creates this from &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; required Di@@ ph@@ one@@ . t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also create from German texts . further information can be found here .
&quot; with this method , additional W@@ rap@@ per Code will be added to Festival in order to use &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ voice files not in the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ folder will not be installed in the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ folder , but in the folder festival / lib . &quot;
IM@@ S German Festival is a changed version of Festival for German &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ voices . required is either Festival Version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first install Festival and &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; then load MS German Festival of
&quot; directions can be downloaded in the RE@@ ADM@@ E file in the package that you have downloaded . ( for use with Festival 2.0 , you need to translate the festival correctly ) . add the following lines to the file festival / lib / sit@@ es@@ it@@ .@@ sc@@ m . &quot;

on some systems you have to edit the file / etc / festival@@ .@@ sc@@ m . add the correct path to / usr / local / mb@@ ro@@ la / . at the time of creating this handbook the German de@@ 4 , de@@ 5 , or de@@ 6 voices do not work with IM@@ S German festival . &quot;
this method uses special code to give the language about Festival with a Czech &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; and then install Festival and &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; and ensure that both work . then download Festival @-@ Czech
un@@ zip the program with t@@ ar into a suitable folder and create the Lexi@@ book . the exec@@ utable file festival must lie in your P@@ AT@@ H .

&quot; on the map device setup , choose one voice and set the paths to &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; and t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o correctly . &quot;
EP@@ OS is a freel@@ ancer language syn@@ thesi@@ zer for Czech and Slovak language . it is a simple language syn@@ thesi@@ zer with even better language quality . with this voice syn@@ thesi@@ zer you can adjust only the volume .
&quot; start kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr . on the map card speakers click Add . select the Czech or Slovak language and ep@@ ox@@ y T@@ TS @-@ language syn@@ thesi@@ zer . if the ep@@ o@@ chs programs do not enter into your P@@ AT@@ H , enter additional parameters for the programs . type in a &amp; kon@@ sole ; EP@@ OS -@@ h or say -@@ h to get more information . &quot;
&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener language syn@@ thesi@@ zer , which has been written in &amp; Java ; i.e. you need to install the &amp; Java ; Virtual Machine on your system . with &amp; Java ; can neither audio @-@ height , volume or microphone speed . &quot;
the command module allows you to use &amp; kt@@ own ; with any voice syn@@ thesi@@ zer that can be switched on in a &amp; kon@@ sole ; on the command line .
&quot; best use a command to send the voice output to a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) , instead of sending the output directly to the audio file . &quot;
&quot; this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ cont@@ rol@@ center ; that allows management of network interface , Rout@@ ing@@ ings and the DNS settings . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ cont@@ rol@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ cont@@ rol@@ center ; can be called by selecting K Menu k@@ cont@@ rol@@ center ; can be called .. &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; -@@ package was developed to enable users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way , as other settings from the &amp; k@@ cont@@ rol@@ center ; create a simple interface for the following tasks : &quot;
after installation a new module network settings in the &amp; k@@ cont@@ rol@@ center ; displayed . the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ cont@@ rol@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in &amp; K@@ Menu ; started .
&quot; it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install and configured . physical devices and their drivers have already been installed and configured , thus &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the tool at all shows and setting the network properties . &quot;
&quot; in most cases , drivers for the network hardware and other devices are added to install &amp; Linux ; with installed and set network devices later , the drivers must be loaded through adaptation of the following files , according to the kernel version , &quot;
&quot; the module network settings is loaded , if the option network settings in the &amp; @-@ cont@@ rol@@ center ; index selected is selected . at the startup of the module network settings , this , the platform used on the system automatically detect . &quot;
&quot; if the platform cannot be recognized as the platform is not recognized , the platform will be chosen from the list , which corresponds to the distribution and the Rel@@ e@@ as@@ best@@ os best . by selecting the setting non @-@ again queries the setting will permanently be made . at the next start of network settings , this option will automatically be set automatically . &quot;
&quot; changing the network settings is possible only in the system administration mode . previously , all the options are grey , what does the settings can only be considered to change the change is not possible . in the system administration mode you can access by clicking the button system administration mode at the right bottom of the module . it is the input of the password . &quot;
&quot; in the system administration mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three riders : &quot;
the tab network interface is used to manage network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . from the rider network interface the following tasks can be performed :
setting the Settings network interface can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and click the button interface ... in the dialog device .
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the button @-@ wide settings displays the dialog with further options . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of Autom@@ atically the TCP / IP settings are taken from a DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , TCP / IP settings are required for the system simultaneously . in the selection list , either DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , according to the system , selected . &quot;
with the selection Manual can be performed without DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP the TCP / IP address . in the input field IP address the desired TCP / IP address must be specified .
&quot; this setting is marked , initi@@ alizes the system the network interface with boats . if the initi@@ alization is not allowed , this option should not be activated . &quot;
the values given in this dialog are displayed as the properties of the device in the device .
it should be ensured that the IP address is not already used in the network . the input of an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; kon@@ sole ; you can notice whether the desired address is already in use . in doubt the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched on according to your needs . switching of a fixed network device is activated by selecting from the list and click interface ....
network devices can be activated or switched on according to your needs . switch off a activated network device by selecting from the list and click interface ....
outlines the IP address of the computer in the local sub@@ network that communic@@ ates the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ network .
&quot; when the computer is present more than a network interface , the interface has to be selected to the net , in which the gateway computer is selected . &quot;
a computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the appropriate IP address . this is necessary because computer can only understand IP addresses . if the computer dis@@ solve this name into an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 45.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
&quot; the calculator can be added manually to the nam@@ esp@@ an nam@@ ing solution . entries can be added , removed or altered wer@@ den@@ .@@ DNS @-@ entries can be converted into a list with buttons , or flo@@ oring in the list with buttons . &quot;
&quot; by clicking the button &quot; &quot; Add ... from the group computer to the nam@@ ing solution can be added a DNS server . it will add the dialog of Die Neue Nam@@ eser@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; first , you must enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the button Add . the entry will then be inserted in the list . &quot;
&quot; from the group computer , select one entry and then click on the Edit button . it will be displayed on the Edit button . &quot;
the list of well @-@ known calculator describes spell @-@ to @-@ IP address for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily with boats when no DNS server will be available . in small , remote networks it can replace the DNS server . &quot;
&quot; normally the list contains some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses are supported . these are still in the test @-@ being version of IP should replace in the future version 4 . &quot;
enter the IP address of the familiar computer and click Add .... The New alias dialog is displayed .
&quot; enter the name of the known computer and click the Add button . if the known computer has several alias name , de button adding several times and enter the further alias name . &quot;
select an entry of a nam@@ or familiar computer from the list and select Edit ... The dialog acquain@@ t@@ ances will be displayed .
&quot; it can run one of the following tasks , then by clicking OK , the list of static hosts will be updated . &quot;
the settings made in the module network settings are not immediately effective in the system . to activate the changes must be set in a &amp; kon@@ sole ; the following command must be set .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is http : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ s@@ ource@@ forge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source code . &quot;
&quot; for installation of binary distribu@@ tions ( mostly rpm packages ) is enough , if &amp; KDE ; and Q@@ t are installed . &quot;
the installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users . it &apos;s easy to download the rpm package and install in a &amp; kon@@ sole ; with rpm as follows :
&quot; alternatively , a tool can be used with graph@@ ically surface such as k@@ package or the installation tool for their distribution . &quot;
&quot; for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; KDE ; not , but in addition , the development packages with libraries and other things are required . &quot;
&quot; this is recommended only experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should do this . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology is given in the second , all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf , changed configuration files . &quot;
this section can not replace knowledge about IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small ( home - ) network is provided .
&quot; currently , IP networks with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) has never found great distribution . from IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to continue in the near future . this description is currently concentrated on the widespread IP@@ v@@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; one of the most important information is aware of which IP address of a network interface is . in foreign networks , on &amp; eg ; workplace is the network administrator , which is a valid IP address , or if available , the IP address may not be selected easily . &quot;
&quot; when setting up an own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected for this purpose to avoid IP address tiles with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwarded to the Internet , therefore their any use is possible . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the internet for such machines can be made by setting up a gat@@ ew@@ ays . &quot;
for smaller networks usually addresses in the range of 19@@ 2.16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the area is large enough for networks to 250 computers large enough .
&quot; in addition , the m@@ esh can usually set up on 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all machines are in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.@@ 0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second @-@ back @-@ address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own computer ) . the standard route is required for IP re@@ direc@@ ting . &quot;
the grid address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine . usually the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned an own so @-@ mentioned lo@@ op@@ back interface that works like a closed circle .
&quot; in this part , the configuration files are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; and where they are stored in the various distribu@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; this file will sometimes be dynam@@ ically changed at DSL connections , so that it is not surprised if in case of active DSL connections to other content than specified there . &quot;
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; is known that this file will be sorted by scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another stand as expected can occur .

&amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; is an application with which you can run other programs according to a schedule in the background . it is a graphical interface for the &amp; UNIX ; system program cr@@ on .
&quot; when starting &amp; k@@ cr@@ on , you will see a list of already registered tasks and relevant environment variables . if you use &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; as root , this will appear both for all users of the system and for system internal tasks . each folder can be stopped and folded . &quot;
&quot; in a de@@ activated task , program name and parameters are not displayed and under description appears de@@ activated . &quot;
the variable environment variables provide the otherwise existing environment variables for all listed tasks except in force . with a de@@ activated variable appears as a description disabled .
to create a new task you first select the tasks -@@ folder . go then in the menu to Edit New .... Alternative can also click with the right mouse button to select ... select or C@@ trl ; N press .
enter here the name of the start@@ ling program . you can either select a rel@@ ational or an absolute arrow names . if you want to search the program first you want to select ...
select the minute ( s ) to which the task is to be executed . with &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; you can specify the minutes in fifth .
&quot; if you specify both Mon@@ at@@ day ( s ) as well as a week@@ day . if you select the task on the 1st and 15th and Sunday , the program will run independently of the week@@ day and also on every Sunday of the months , no matter what date they fall . &quot;
&quot; as in creating new tasks , changes will only be active when the cr@@ acker was saved . &quot;
&quot; to cut a task , they first choose the right task . go then to edit . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can click on the task with the right mouse button and select C@@ trl ; X . &quot;
to copy a task first select the task to copy it . go to Edit copy .
&quot; alternatively , you can click on the task and select copying , or click C@@ trl ; C . &quot;
&quot; to add a task , first one must first be cut or copied to the clip@@ board . only then , you have to add the tasks to the folder . then please select the tasks to edit . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can click with the right mouse button on the tasks of the folder and insert C@@ trl ; V . &quot;
&quot; to make changes to a task , select first one . go to the Edit menu item .... &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can click on the task with the right mouse button on the task and edit , or you press C@@ trl . O. It will then appear the dialog task in which you can edit , as described above , the chosen task . &quot;
to delete a task please select the required task . go to the Edit menu item .
&quot; to enable or disable a task , select it , and determine the condition with the menu item activation . in@@ active tasks are marked with in@@ active in their description . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can also click on the task with the right mouse button on the task and select activ@@ ating that program name , parameters and description can be displayed correctly . &quot;
&quot; to perform a task immediately , select it and then go to Edit Now . &quot;
&quot; to create a new environment variable , you first choose the variable folder . then go to the menu item New .... &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can click on the variables -@@ folder and select New ... or you press C@@ trl ; N . &quot;
enter the name of the variable . you can also select one from the list of the most commonly used environment variables ; click on the arrow next to the field for the variable names .
to send e @-@ mails from the posting program to another than the normal address
&quot; as in creating new variables , changes will only be made when the cr@@ acker was saved . &quot;
&quot; to cut a variable , they first choose to remot@@ ely variable . go then to edit . &quot;
&quot; to copy a ambient variable , you first choose to copy the variable variable . go to Edit copy . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can click on the variable and select copying or click C@@ trl ; C . &quot;
&quot; to insert a ambient variable , first one must first cut or copied into the clip@@ board . only then the option is inser@@ ting at all . select the variable button to edit . then enter the variables &quot; folder . &quot;
&quot; to change a variable , you first select the variable vari@@ able . go to edit _ alternative , you can edit with the right mouse button on the variable and change ... Select , or you press C@@ trl ; O .@@ It will then edit the dialog in which you can edit the variable . &quot;
&quot; to delete an ambient variable , you first choose the variable . go then to edit . &quot;
&quot; to activate or de@@ activated variable variable , select them , and place the condition with the menu item Activ@@ ated . in a de@@ activated variable you will appear under description De@@ activated . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can also select with the right mouse button on the variable and select activ@@ ating . make sure that the name and value of the variables are displayed correctly . &quot;
&quot; if all tasks and ambient variables have been given or altered , you need to save the cr@@ ont@@ ab . select the menu item File Save . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can press C@@ trl ; S press changes or supplements to tasks or variables will only be active . &quot;
&quot; it appears the standard KDE , press dialog . if you select excer@@ pts , see that there are two additional &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; -@@ specific options in print dialog . &quot;
prints the cr@@ acker from all users on the system . this option is accessible only for users to have extended per@@ missions .
&quot; cr@@ on , for example vi@@ x@@ ie @-@ cr@@ on . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses the command cr@@ ont@@ ab , to change the schedules of the user . &quot;
&quot; a Posi@@ x @-@ compliant &amp; UNIX ; , for example with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands from &amp; UNIX ; to know time and date . &quot;
&quot; &amp; nbsp ; is a backup program for band@@ age on the basis of t@@ ar . it offers the possibility to save several Archives on a tape . the second goal was to answer a question that asked my wife : how much longer it takes , if you secure ? &quot;
&quot; before a band can be used , it must be involved from &amp; k@@ dat ; this can be done in three ways : &quot;
&quot; &amp; nbsp ; don@@ ult the band back and reads the pre@@ ten@@ se information of the ban@@ ker . recognis@@ es , and kis@@ sed ; the fore@@ play on the tape do not , you will be asked if the band is form@@ atted . &quot;
&quot; recognize &amp; k@@ dat ; the fore@@ play , looks for the right index on your disk . can this not be found , you will be asked if the band index is to be created . &quot;
&quot; it all went smoothly , change the symbol for the band@@ ing work , to view that the band was involved . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the content of the belt will now be sear@@ ched through out@@ coat of the entry for the band . &quot;
&quot; before the throw of the belt , first of all , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to achieve this . &quot;
&quot; &amp; nbsp ; gives by a change of symbol for the band , that the integration of the band has been solved and displays a corresponding message in the status bar . the band can now be raised without danger . &quot;
&quot; before a band of &amp; nbsp ; used , it must be dated from &amp; k@@ dat ; form@@ atted . &quot;
&quot; a band@@ ing must be form@@ atted before you can use it . this process does not correspond to form@@ atting with &amp; k@@ dat ; this process does not have to be form@@ atted before using the band . Flo@@ ppy band@@ ing works usually set a form@@ atting of the ban@@ ker , DAT drives on the other hand . &quot;
after entering the band name and the capacity is driving &amp; k@@ dat ; with the form@@ atting of the belt . all the data on the band will be lost ! after completion of the form@@ atting process the band will be automatically mounted and ready to use .
&quot; before you encounter the backup process , you must select the securing files . this can happen in three ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in the local file tree . it will only be saved to this file or folder .
select a backup profile in the tree . it is only secured within the profile specified in the profile .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the so selected files and / or sub@@ folders are secured .
right click with the right mouse button on the local file tree and select in the menu ...
&quot; once the backup was initiated , the dialog will open for backing up . in this dialog you can once again check the selected files and change the settings for securing the backup . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings , the dialogue will be secure . the dialog shows the progress of the backup including the data rate and the remaining time . &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it is only checked the selected file or folder .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the band with a tick . there are only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders .
right click in one of the archives and select the menu entry ....
&quot; once the test process has been started , the dialog settings will appear for checking . in this dialog you can once again check your selection and change the work folder for checking . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for checking , the dialog will appear . this dialog shows the progress of the examination process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; before you can restore the restore , the files must be recovered , which will be restored . this can occur in two ways : &quot;
&quot; select a file or folder in one of the archives , which belong to the entry for the band@@ age . it will only be restored the selected file or sub@@ folders . &quot;
select the desired files from one of the archives with a tick . there are only the so selected files and / or sub@@ folders recovered .
right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select in the menu re@@ manufacture ....
&quot; once the restore process has been started , the dialogue will be started for restoring . in this dialog you can once again check your selection and change the work folder for recovery . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for recovery , the dialogue will be re@@ build . this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time . &quot;
sometimes it proves to be necessary to create the band@@ index@@ ed file based on the belt contents . this process delet@@ es all existing index files for this band . you can create the index on two types of tape .
here is a backup profile with the straight selected files and default settings . you can make a backup profile the following settings :
the current working folder in which the backup should take place . the list of securing files will be automatically updated according to the selected working folders .
&quot; for all folders listed under backup files , that only those files are stored on the same file system , as the folder . folders which are stored on other file systems , you can enter separately under backup files . each entry is considered by t@@ ar regardless of the others . &quot;
&quot; perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , it will only be secured files that have since changed since then . &quot;
the name of the file that is used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
delet@@ es the snap@@ shots before the call of t@@ ar . this causes that all files are secured and a new snapshot file for the next backup will be created .
the functionality of the buttons ; and lt ; and lt ; files was not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
the settings allows you to set up the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . the following settings can be made :
the complete path to the device driver for the band@@ ing process ( usually / dev / T@@ ape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ viewing variant of the belt system .
&quot; is this setting active , transm@@ its ; before the band is involved the command mt load to the drive . with some drives , this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be carried out . &quot;
&quot; is the option switched on , tries &amp; k@@ dat ; the design from the band@@ ing work . possibly , this attitude does not work with all belt drives . &quot;
&quot; if the option is switched on , when the integration of the integration of &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically use the band . do not use this option at Flo@@ ppy @-@ Stream@@ . &quot;
&quot; if the option is switched on , tries &amp; k@@ dat ; the hard@@ ships support variable block sizes . no matter whether this attitude is active or not , you have to say &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the block is required for your band@@ age . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; nbsp ; a band form@@ atted , it writes a file at the beginning of the ban@@ ker . this file should only put a memory block on the tape . the content of the file is composed of : &quot;
&quot; ( N byte ) The band ID . the format of this string is dat@@ ner@@ name : seconds , whereby the name of the full name of the system is form@@ atted in which the band has been form@@ atted in which the band has been form@@ atted in which the band has been form@@ atted . &quot;
the band ID is used to use a file with the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat / .
&quot; the remaining files on the band are pure t@@ ar -@@ Archive , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - t@@ ar can operate . even other t@@ ar versions should work , as long as it is not concerned to incre@@ mental f@@ uses . &quot;
check the content of a backup card . this symbol is only active when a band is involved .
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; KDE ; -@@ viewer for system protoc@@ ols . the program is suitable for un@@ experienced users who can &apos;t know where you can get information about your system , or where the system enables the various protocol files . furthermore , this system allows quick access to the example of information on issues that occur on your server . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what your computer is in the background makes . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified description of the protocol files of the own system . the program is suitable for un@@ experienced users who can &apos;t know where you can get information about your system , or where the system depos@@ ited the different protocol files . &quot;
&quot; in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users the quick access to information on issues that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore tries to provide some advanced functionality , using the protocol files of certain programs can be fil@@ tered and evaluated . &quot;
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions exist among others :
&quot; support for many different types of log files , for the format of the sy@@ s@@ log server and for Sam@@ ba . &quot;
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this handbook .
&quot; as you see in the following screen@@ shot , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions available with which help the single protocol @-@ lines of a protocol file easily fil@@ tered and sort . the individual possibilities to sor@@ ting and filtering will be shown in the next chapter of this handbook . &quot;
&quot; after the start , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; firstly the most important protocol file of the system - the system logs . it will not appear in the folder / var / log , for the normal user usually no justification for reading . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filter bar in order to filter according to a selected criterion or on a given string . the list of the log lines will automatically be displayed , so that only log file containing the filter lists . in the default setting it contains the log @-@ line only displayed when in one of the columns containing the drawing string of the filter search ri@@ ffs is included . &quot;
&quot; you can of course also select another entry at this point . the string sets of the filter system logs in accordance with the name of a process , and enter it in the filter bar the name of a process so shows you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all protocol @-@ lines which were sent or created by this process . &quot;
this option is enabled in default settings and helps to detect the important protocol lines . protocol @-@ lines of the stage will be displayed with a striking color as the protocol @-@ lines of the step note . the colored display of protocol lines can be switched on dialog .
&quot; if you want to display only certain process ( for example in the system protoc@@ olls or in cr@@ on protocol ) , so you can examine the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process . this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as to start the sam@@ ba server . in this case you use Filter@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can jump the option To new lines in the context menu of the main window , to display all new additions lines . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows the display of several protocol files in separate sub @-@ windows . to open this feature , use the entries in the window to open and manage additional sub@@ window . once you choose a sub@@ window , select a log window to display . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on http : / / k@@ system@@ .@@ forum @-@ so@@ ftw@@ are@@ .@@ org.
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; find also in the following folder of &amp; KDE ; Subversion archive : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; KDE ; -@@ Archiv
&quot; welcome to &amp; KDE ; System V In@@ it editor , rather known ( and in the following also so named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . this section gives a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . &quot;
&quot; the system V In@@ it develops rapidly to the standard for controlling the program , while driving the system in the &amp; Linux ; world . and that &apos;s why it is easier to use , more powerful and more flexible than the traditional BSD -@@ In@@ it . &quot;
I will not go further on historical aspects ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it : - ) .
&quot; the In@@ it @-@ binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc This is therefore important because maybe someone could try to make a machine on System V In@@ it , without a new installation and new form@@ atting . therefore you must ensure that the old In@@ it was removed from there , if there was there one . &quot;
&quot; the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it differs from the BSD in@@ it , that the configuration files in a sub@@ folder of / etc are instead of / etc . this folder is called r@@ c@@ .d@@ . D@@ ort you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following further folder : &quot;
&quot; in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a lot of scripts . basically , you need a script for any system service that you want to start the system or change at a different run@@ level . system services include such things like network , N@@ FS , &amp; send@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such stuff such as set@@ serial which will only be started . such views belong to r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
&quot; r@@ c.@@ local should be stored on the part of / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems possess this file , even if there is actually not much use for it . you can also create a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run a bit to do with the serial port . &quot;
the kernel is searching for various points after the program and starts the first that he finds .
the standard Run@@ level is registered in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . you should see a line like the following :
at this point you can take a look at the second column and probably determine that the pres@@ et Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab by hand and then change the 3 . be very careful when you &apos;re going to rest@@ art the system and execute the following :
&quot; but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you enter ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you probably see something like this : &quot;
you will notice that there are no right files in this folder . instead each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d .
how does and stop in@@ it actually system services ? very simple : each of the scripts is written so written that there is an argument like start and stop . you can actually start this scripts from hand on the command line :
&quot; this would hold the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the one K includes , the script will be called with the argument stop . if he includes a S , the script will start with the argument start . &quot;
&quot; some people want to set up a simple way to set machines for many purposes . I could have &amp; eg ; a server -@@ Run@@ level , that leaves only htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; send@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc ; run ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc ; starts . &quot;
here you learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another pointer is simple to not be trivi@@ al : simply drag an entry from the area of the available system services on one of the six run@@ level to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
&quot; you can shift scripts , even between Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n or change the position inside a levels by moving it somewhere else . this is only if you prefer an entry from the area of availability system services . &quot;
&quot; note : entries are postponed if you choose these into a new area . to select it only to a new Run@@ level , you must explicitly select copying from the menu Edit or from the context menu and even then if the same entry has previously existed in the target area of the action . &quot;
&quot; the sor@@ ting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you have to edit the sor@@ ting numbers of the converted entries before you try again to insert the system service . &quot;
&quot; note : at present , there is no way to restore entries that were thrown into the tr@@ ash . be careful . &quot;
&quot; you can use the tab@@ ulator button to activate the different work areas ( Available system services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor keys to make a choice or below the previous one . &quot;
&quot; to move an entry to another Run@@ level , move it to the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ trl ; X ) and paste it into the desired run@@ level with inser@@ ting ( with C@@ trl ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to change the sor@@ ting number or the name of a portable manual , press the button button to switch between different fields . connect the dialog button to accept the changes , or press ES@@ C to change the changes . &quot;
&quot; because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the menu file require a confirmation before being executed . &quot;
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . pres@@ ets will be placed in the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) . otherwise they are stored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; restored changes to the pres@@ et settings are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
&quot; I experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n , and now the machine starts continuously . what can I do ? &quot;
enter the LI@@ LO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in the single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the standard Run@@ level on a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be in order ) .
&quot; I provided some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution under Run@@ level X , but they will not be executed . &quot;
&quot; if you use &amp; Su@@ SE ( D@@ LD ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc , which are only available in these distribu@@ tions . please read the details in the manual of distribution . &quot;
&quot; the type , such as system services are started in these distribu@@ tions , however , simpli@@ fies the configuration for the proprietary set programs of these distribu@@ tions , but unfortunately no standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you use a different distribution : please check whether all the configuration files are available , which are required from the system service ( as &amp; eg ; Apache or htt@@ p@@ d ) just end without notice , if their configuration files are not present or false . &quot;
&quot; the meaning of &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use any other distribution , please send me information about the Run@@ level so that this handbook can be added . &quot;
this documentation is based on &amp; user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
&quot; to begin with &amp; user ; it is sufficient , the chapter adaptation of &amp; user user ; to read . &quot;
&quot; after you have made changes , you need to store them . either use the appropriate icon of the tool item or the entry save in the menu file . &quot;
&amp; user user ; is an easy application . the main window consists of two card cards and user interface . to edit the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry . it appears the dialog user or group properties .
&quot; some cart@@ ons are only presented when you have extended system settings . only if you have extended system settings for users , a card card will be made , in case you have individual settings , if shadow password or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as in BSD @-@ Uni@@ ces are installed . &quot;
the map password will appear in case shadow -@@ passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as in BSD - Uni@@ ces are installed .
this card card appears only if for at least a built @-@ in file system ( Qu@@ ota ) is enabled and initi@@ alized ( recogni@@ z@@ able to the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the fil@@ es@@ ystem ) . here you can change parameters for each user parameters .
these parameters can be set individually for each file system . the current fil@@ es@@ ystem is selected using the field of fil@@ es@@ ystem .
&quot; the card @-@ card group provides information about the group related to the selected user . the standard group that belongs to the user , can be found in the primary group . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by entering them in the large field . &quot;
&quot; the dialog properties of the group contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list . &quot;
&quot; to add a user or group , select Add from the menu user or group or click on the suitable add button to select the selected user or the selected group . &quot;
&quot; with this module you can install the LI@@ LO boot manager , remove the boot password , remove and change the time up to the boats of the standard operating system , remove the standard control system , remove , change operating systems , change , change , change and more . &quot;
