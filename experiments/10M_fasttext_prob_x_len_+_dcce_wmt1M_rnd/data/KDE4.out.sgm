<seg id="1525">"--preset insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you necessarily want to have the absolute highest quality without regard to the file size, then select this setting."</seg>

<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is needed to show how sounds are pictured on a specific channel or instrument.</seg>
<seg id="1667">"as with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as well as their presence. you have to create 128 entries."</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple keymaps for each channel and each instrument. you only have to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used mainly to form tones on the perimeter channel. take a look at the supplied Keymaps.</seg>

<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful for example to always use the perimeter patch on the perkline channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">"the value for PitchBendercan be multiplied, in which relation Pitch Bender-events are multiplied with the value, this is used with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then only passed. the value 4096 is used, so that in the map file no dealgamma is available)."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"this setting is needed because GM is that a keyboard, the Pitch Bender event will play with the value 4096 to play a tone higher. unfortunately, try some keyboards to play two sounds up to an octave higher. to find the right value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid."</seg>

<seg id="2415">"probably you prefer to compare a file simply by double click. nevertheless, you can run a single file to run directly from the folder menu. once you save the result, the status will be done and the file will not be merged if you run the folder."</seg>

<seg id="2959">"the Init-binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc This is therefore important because maybe someone could try to make a machine on System V Init, without a new installation and new formatting. therefore you must ensure that the old Init was removed from there, if there was there one."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"the SysV Init differs from the BSD init, that the configuration files in a subfolder of / etc are instead of / etc. this folder is called rc.d. Dort you will find rc.sysinit and the following further folder:"</seg>
<seg id="2961">"init.d contains a lot of scripts. basically, you need a script for any system service that you want to start the system or change at a different runlevel. system services include such things like network, NFS, & sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such stuff such as setserial which will only be started. such views belong to rc.local."</seg>
<seg id="2962">"rc.local should be stored on the part of / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems possess this file, even if there is actually not much use for it. you can also create a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run a bit to do with the serial port."</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel is searching for various points after the program and starts the first that he finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The standard Runlevel is registered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can take a look at the second column and probably determine that the preset Runlevel 3 is. if you want to change / etc / inittab by hand and then change the 3. be very careful when you're going to restart the system and execute the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how does it start all the right scripts? if you enter ls -l in rc3.d, then you probably see something like this:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no right files in this folder. instead each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the directory init.d.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How does and stop init actually system services? very simple: each of the scripts is written so written that there is an argument like start and stop. you can actually start this scripts from hand on the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would hold the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the one K includes, the script will be called with the argument stop. if he includes a S, the script will start with the argument start."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people want to set up a simple way to set machines for many purposes. I could have & eg; a server -Runlevel, that leaves only httpd, & sendmail;, network & etc; run; & kdm;, network & etc; starts."</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointer is simple to not be trivial: simply drag an entry from the area of the available system services on one of the six runlevel to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">"you can shift scripts, even between Runleveln or change the position inside a levels by moving it somewhere else. this is only if you prefer an entry from the area of availability system services."</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries are postponed if you choose these into a new area. to select it only to a new Runlevel, you must explicitly select copying from the menu Edit or from the context menu and even then if the same entry has previously existed in the target area of the action."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you have to edit the sorting numbers of the converted entries before you try again to insert the system service."</seg>
<seg id="2976">"note: at present, there is no way to restore entries that were thrown into the trash. be careful."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the tabulator button to activate the different work areas (Available system services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a choice or below the previous one."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"to move an entry to another Runlevel, move it to the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and paste it into the desired runlevel with inserting (with Ctrl; V)."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"to change the sorting number or the name of a portable manual, press the button button to switch between different fields. connect the dialog button to accept the changes, or press ESC to change the changes."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the menu file require a confirmation before being executed."</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. presets will be placed in the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc). otherwise they are stored by & ksysv; restored changes to the preset settings are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">"I experimented with the standard Runleveln, and now the machine starts continuously. what can I do?"</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO -Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in the single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the standard Runlevel on a reasonable value (3 should normally be in order).</seg>
<seg id="2984">"I provided some system services with & ksysv; for execution under Runlevel X, but they will not be executed."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"if you use & SuSE (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc, which are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of distribution."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"the type, such as system services are started in these distributions, however, simplifies the configuration for the proprietary set programs of these distributions, but unfortunately no standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"if you use a different distribution: please check whether all the configuration files are available, which are required from the system service (as & eg; Apache or httpd) just end without notice, if their configuration files are not present or false."</seg>
<seg id="2988">"the meaning of & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use any other distribution, please send me information about the Runlevel so that this handbook can be added."</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation is based on & user; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">"to begin with & user; it is sufficient, the chapter adaptation of & user user; to read."</seg>
<seg id="2991">"after you have made changes, you need to store them. either use the appropriate icon of the tool item or the entry save in the menu file."</seg>
<seg id="2992">& user user; is an easy application. the main window consists of two card cards and user interface. to edit the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry. it appears the dialog user or group properties.</seg>
<seg id="2993">"some cartons are only presented when you have extended system settings. only if you have extended system settings for users, a card card will be made, in case you have individual settings, if shadow password or for example / etc / master.passwd as in BSD-Unices are installed."</seg>
<seg id="2994">The map password will appear in case shadow -passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd as in BSD - Unices are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card card appears only if for at least a built-in file system (Quota) is enabled and initialized (recognizable to the file quota.user / quota.group on the filesystem). here you can change parameters for each user parameters.</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each file system. the current filesystem is selected using the field of filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="2997">"the card-card group provides information about the group related to the selected user. the standard group that belongs to the user, can be found in the primary group. furthermore, the user can become a member in other groups by entering them in the large field."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"the dialog properties of the group contains a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list."</seg>
<seg id="2999">"to add a user or group, select Add from the menu user or group or click on the suitable add button to select the selected user or the selected group."</seg>
<seg id="3000">"with this module you can install the LILO boot manager, remove the boot password, remove and change the time up to the boats of the standard operating system, remove the standard control system, remove, change operating systems, change, change, change and more."</seg>
