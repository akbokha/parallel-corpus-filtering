&quot; although I had visited the USA for at least once a year , I would now live there for the first time . &quot;
and that was very exciting for me .
my love of America is extremely big .
&quot; like many of my generation I have grown up with American films , I have read American music , American authors and operated his sport . &quot;
&quot; indeed , this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly because of a American film journalist . &quot;
&quot; as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , like he played the Gr@@ ay Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican , with the help of Julia Roberts as Jura @-@ Stu@@ n@@ aten the m@@ ori@@ der@@ ian conspir@@ acy of a oil stomach , who were interested in finding his interest . &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; free after meth@@ od Man , &quot; it was , as if that is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that is what I want to do with my life . &quot;
and the year that I lived in Arizona had only strengthened my admir@@ ation for the USA .
&quot; I always said : &quot; &quot; America is the only country where I have ever lived whose diversity is so inviting that you are always who you are and it &apos;s easy to find acceptance within a community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
I had even written a very dirty love of his size .
then Donald Tru@@ mp came .
a lot was written about the xen@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his asc@@ ension is for me as he goes with his bott@@ dies .
&quot; he never keeps his opinion behind the mountain , how to say so beautiful . &quot;
&quot; he says exactly what he thinks about how a former colleague has expressed , and explains publicly his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ sin@@ ans and women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , people responded to his statements and voted for him . &quot;
&quot; the 13 million voices , which he won by the re@@ publi@@ can elections , was the highest number that was nominated by the party nom@@ inate candidate . &quot;
I was speech@@ less .
&quot; who are the Americans who support these big@@ otte person , I asked me ? &quot;
I could not bring my voters with the people that I met in Phoenix during my time .
&quot; as for example , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , Director of the journ@@ alism programme that takes people from all over the world , a deep belie@@ ver man , with whom I was talking about Islam and his past . &quot;
&quot; also voted Tru@@ m@@ ps World illustration not with the author of Peter Bh@@ atia , the current editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bh@@ atia and I met us with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours with it to watch the &quot; Phoenix &quot; &quot; in the game . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ m@@ ps intoler@@ ance also stands in contrast to the gener@@ osity that I lived at Sandy B@@ ahr who fought for her life for the environment , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like her son . &quot;
&quot; still it fits to the commitment of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helps with a lot of patience and grace to me and my colleagues helped us to get used to the complexity of the American life . &quot;
&quot; then there were Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors who helped me much with my career . &quot;
these people and those caused by them to deep@@ en values my love for America .
&quot; while Tru@@ mp has its way to nominated the nominated presidential presidential data ground , they used to give me a stop and the counter to its limited vision of America . &quot;
however it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
&quot; on 8 November 2016 , more than 50 million Americans , mostly wives , the presidency of a man , despite - or perhaps due to his cont@@ emp@@ t compared to non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the confrontation with the idea that people have voted for Tru@@ mp because they have either lost its racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were ready to overlook these things , broke myself almost the heart . &quot;
perhaps it is totally to describe the Tru@@ mp &apos;s voters as R@@ assi@@ sts .
&quot; to arrange the people said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation . &quot;
&quot; this is super@@ ficial and respect@@ ful , and suggests an in@@ ability to understand those who act in a different way and think . &quot;
it shows the people that their worries and fears about the h@@ ectic changes in their churches are not taken into account .
could it be that these voters do have voted for Tru@@ mp because they want to reg@@ ain control over a country that she has disappointed ?
&quot; in other words , they might want to say they are important in this America ? &quot;
maybe .
&quot; however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick who look the cru@@ el decision to raise a man who look down with cont@@ emp@@ t to those who look differently than he . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( m@@ m. d. as much as &quot; rechar@@ ge of the White against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities &quot; ; &quot; words from white in play@@ grounds on the wh@@ ites and wh@@ i@@ pl@@ ash ) , as it was the great Van Jones , just what America did so great . &quot;
&quot; millions of people around the world appreciate the American Ideal - no matter whether my@@ th or reality , it is still a powerful idea - what faith or background you have always like , America welcomes every welcome . &quot;
&quot; for this country chose as its president , twice the Son of an Ken@@ y@@ ers , whose history , as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible . &quot;
&quot; but with the choice of Donald Tru@@ m@@ ps , there is a huge majority of the white Americas , and says : to hell with diversity , religious freedom and the whole concept of plur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in the America after 9 / 11 , the white man is back on the ruin , they say . &quot;
&quot; in all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Kh@@ an , the father of a soldiers who has fallen in Iraq , and what he said in the eve of the election . &quot;
on a manifestation for Hill@@ ary Clinton had Mr. Kh@@ an a word change with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp , would have my son , captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; Mr. Kh@@ an . &quot;
the quantity answered with a sign@@ alling &quot; no ! &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; br@@ aces the amount . &quot;
&quot; have Lat@@ inos a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; &quot; answered them . &quot;
have A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; &quot; rie@@ ve them and their voices were lau@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; would someone else , who is not like you , a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a record and sound@@ ed strong &quot; NE@@ IN &quot; !
&quot; Mr. Kh@@ an closed with the words : &quot; &quot; God be thanks , Mr. Tru@@ mp , is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot;
&quot; the land , for which his son was fallen , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; this is now Tru@@ m@@ ps Land , said the message . &quot;
&quot; and all the people who look like Mr. Kh@@ an , could not find a place in this new America . &quot;
and that breaks me my heart .

&quot; that music , which is played in both places not just the life of children , but also a very close connection with ... &quot;
music that lives with the fall
&quot; Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large gar@@ b@@ age dump , only 16 Kilom@@ eters south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial town , which is very popular among the tourists , but worlds from the nearby pre@@ dominant ruins and its world @-@ famous kitchen . &quot;
&quot; for several years now the La B@@ anda de M@@ Ãº@@ sica ( Musik@@ ban@@ de ) in the municipality : one of children and adults &apos;s existing sym@@ ph@@ ony orchestra , which has found an opportunity to overcome the surrounding poverty . &quot;
a music school with 100 students has become the central interest for the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote on this project :
&quot; the municipality located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico , is known for its drugs abuse and the ban@@ ana violence . &quot;
&quot; however , this changed after an accidental meeting with a French pil@@ ots who started a musical project and the youth offered so a rare hope . &quot;
&quot; the young band members take their commitments opposite the music group very seriously , the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI : &quot;
&quot; once they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the above roads to follow their great passion . &quot;

music from refuse
&quot; more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura - a village that is practically located on the largest gar@@ b@@ age dump of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments which are made of re@@ printed waste material : &quot;
&quot; music with re@@ prepared instruments , which consist of local fixed waste materials , made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ e@@ ura , where the recycling under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ Ã¡@@ vez have started to transform parts of the crash into instruments . &quot;
&quot; the instruments im@@ i@@ ble violins , viol@@ as , C@@ elli , double b@@ asses , guitars , trump@@ ets , trump@@ ets , tromb@@ ones and percussion that were all produced from the rub@@ b@@ ish . &quot;
&quot; the re@@ pertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ical and Latin American music as well as music of the Be@@ at@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article in the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ Ã¡@@ vez reminds of a local ec@@ ologist and Musi@@ cians of the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura , to the early days : &quot;
&quot; first , it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ sals and we had to know at the same place , the children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact parents because many of them do not live with their children . &quot;
this changed as F@@ avi@@ o something that he had never seen before : one out of waste .
&quot; today , there is a whole orchestra that plays on instruments from re@@ prepared material and that is called The Recy@@ cl@@ ed Orchestra . &quot;
a documentation of &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic gar@@ b@@ age dump ) shows the musical performance on :
the world generates around one billion tons of refuse .
those who live with him and from him are the anger - like the people in Cat@@ e@@ ura , Paraguay . &quot;
and here they turn it into something beauty .

the orchestra has played his music even before Pope Francis :
these ost@@ African countries show how technology and teamwork can be successfully fought against illegal fishing
photo Â© Fish @-@ i Africa - a project that fighting illegal fishing fishing .
&quot; this article , written by Emma Bry@@ ce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports about international , practic@@ able solutions for environmental problems . &quot;
the re@@ publication is done within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for sharing content .
&quot; in West Africa then was known that this ship had already operated in liberal waters of illegal fishing fishing , before it was the other coast of Africa . &quot;
&quot; the East African countries were here accordingly , and had little gen@@ ei@@ sts to welcome a legislative bre@@ cher of this kind in its co@@ asts . &quot;
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Kom@@ ors , Moz@@ ambi@@ que and the Seych@@ elles mobil@@ ised rapidly against the ship . you may refuse to place one of their ports , and wei@@ gh himself to give him an old fishing . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ur@@ suddenly was the prime minister surrounded by countries that you simply remember anything else , &quot; Bene@@ dict Ki@@ il@@ u , a leader of the Ken@@ yan Fisher@@ ies Authority . it is part of a team that discovered the ship &apos;s time and followed . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : it was not able to catch fish there . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , it has also been forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liber@@ ia , because of the lo@@ oting of fish stocks . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , the criminal practices crossed and protects resources , Fish @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the N@@ RO stop Ill@@ egal Fishing ( Ill@@ eg@@ ale fisher@@ y ) . &quot;
&quot; the members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the six countries who had driven the prime minister from their waters at that time . &quot;
&quot; &quot; this means that we have eight countries who are equ@@ ali@@ able and work together . they exchange information and stand out each other , where it comes to illegal fishing , says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts project En@@ ding Ill@@ egal &apos;s Fishing . this project offers Fish @-@ i technical support . &quot;
illegal fishing is tr@@ apped by definition un@@ regulated : what is caught is hidden because it is extremely difficult to get rid of it . this is illegal fishing a main cause of over@@ fishing from regions .
&quot; by deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard to existing laws , through which certain habitats and species are to be protected by means of illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems , which have a delicate equilibrium . &quot;
&quot; but while actions against illegal fishing has been hin@@ dered by bureaucr@@ atic hur@@ dles , and also through the sn@@ ail hur@@ ting , with the information between individual countries , so the actions today occur in real time , with tr@@ ackable on Fish @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; there , the individual countries can exchange existing licenses with each other for example , news to di@@ gest@@ ure activities or details that you noticed during a port spectrum . &quot;
&quot; fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very attentive when they move around the open sea , using satellite data . &quot;
&quot; this allows the authorities to feature ships which fish in the botan@@ icals territories . also , just let themselves discover that a ship invites its colored fish on the road to other ships . &quot;
&quot; in the ide@@ case , such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license where they were travelling and possibly also whether they have a criminal case . &quot;
&quot; countries that are against illegal fishing , may refuse the acceptance of such ships in their ports , which means that ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they can even go to the numbers of pen@@ alties , as in case of prime minister . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is then about substantial financial losses for the owners , which means that illegal fishing fishing will not be more enjoyable . &quot;
&quot; and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , leader Director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is an advisory firm which supports fighting illegal fishing in Africa and also supports Fish @-@ i . &quot;
a closed Front
&quot; the platform was created to attract estimated 20 million USD in lost turnover , which penet@@ rate the eight members of the network H@@ ISH @-@ i every year because of illegal fishermen that penet@@ rate in Eastern African waters . &quot;
&quot; Ost@@ afrika has one of the most productive t@@ una fish species , present because of the region &apos;s commercial fishing from around the world . under these also the illegal fishermen . &quot;
&quot; their practices such as actions are as the sailing under false flag , counter@@ f@@ eit licence names , the fish protected species and the fishing in nature conservation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they use this lack of international co @-@ operation and make the weaknesses of a complete organised control system &quot; , &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; formerly a ship was illegal and a country could not say &apos; you could not walk my harbour . &quot;
&quot; but another country could say &quot; &quot; come to me &quot; . &quot; &quot; and exactly this leg@@ ends I tried to close a fish @-@ i . &quot;
so far the closed front works .
&quot; since its foundation , Fish @-@ i was involved in more than 30 studies of susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; it has covered criminal networks , which had been distributed on counter@@ f@@ eit licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has been tr@@ apped and found . &quot;
&quot; due to its cooperation with Inter@@ pol , the international authority to combat crimes , Fish @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing over large distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; some of our studies lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; it builds a system , the fish @-@ i is to help di@@ gest@@ ed ships conc@@ iser . &quot;
photo with friendly permission of Fish @-@ i Africa .
&quot; fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which will always be further developed , also helps to hide the illegal ships . &quot;
&quot; &quot; the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and its position , &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , boss analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ g@@ g M@@ at Tracking , an NGO , which also deals with fisheries data and Fish @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; some of the ships turn off for example their automatic identification systems , with which they can no longer be developed by satellite . &quot;
Cop@@ eland helps to build a system that connects different information levels each other . it should help fish @-@ i to find criminal ships with greater precision .
a model program
but Fish @-@ i &apos;s Team African nations are actually taking influence on this undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that . &quot;
&quot; recently , Sky@@ Truth has jointly opened the Platform Global Fishing Watch platform : a platform that can offer satellite data and can be displayed around the world &apos;s position . &quot;
&quot; &quot; meet together with the neighbors to get a better picture of it who does . &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources for examining . &quot;
&quot; we should do this on a global level . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts have to run a similar project , where a global system allows persecution of ships . &quot;
&quot; there are signs that Fish @-@ i &apos;s activities can not only feel crime , but they are p@@ inn@@ ed . &quot;
ships which had previously used without a licence and hardly to count with consequences you know that they will be observed .
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in Fish @-@ i participated in a 33 % increase in fisheries sales , since fishing boats have more licenses for sale . &quot;
&quot; after Fish @-@ i Somalia has helped to put Gre@@ ko 1 , the insp@@ ectors found there on board tow@@ ing networks , whose use is prohibited . &quot;
photo with friendly permission of Fish @-@ i Africa .
&quot; other countries do not notice these successes . &quot; &quot; the effect is as strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; in West Africa , we will disappear several hundred million dollars by illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; there are six countries that have joined in 2015 , so called West Africa Task Force . also they are fighting illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model as fish @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; With security is the target , even more of such initiatives and structures also arise in other regions , &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently , Fish @-@ i &apos;s youngest member country will report his first major triumph : in October it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship which was on the wrong flag . and not only the ship was also used without a license , which is now prohibited . &quot;
&quot; the ship was also penet@@ rated into bot@@ bot@@ tled waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with the rec@@ ess of rules against Gre@@ ko 1 , a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; for Fish @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time the proof that such a special , collaborative effort to protect the oceans works in the whole world sea . Emma Bry@@ ce is freel@@ ance journalist and lives in London . there it writes on the topic of environment , technology and nutrition . &quot;

the road movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they apply as a protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum on the president of the President NicolÃ¡s Mad@@ uro .

&quot; after the government of Venezuela had rejected the application of the opposition to a referendum on a referendum , in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country brought together into the emp@@ t@@ iness that gathered themselves together on the streets . &quot;
under the has@@ ht@@ ag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( approx . : the return of Venezuela ) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them .
&quot; the debate is led also in other parts of the country - among other things in the flat area of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ des regions MÃ©@@ rida and T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira , in the central northern Bundestag Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isl@@ a Margar@@ ita in the State of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a . &quot;
the political and economic situation of the country deteri@@ or@@ ated continuously in the everyday life of the Veneto region by an ac@@ ute lack of food and medication .
&quot; many representatives of the opposition looked at the Am@@ t@@ sen@@ th@@ ood of the current President NicolÃ¡s Mad@@ uro , the chance of a fundamental change ; ultimately , the attitude of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ anne d@@ Ã­@@ az , co @-@ acting with Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ izes the context of the government &apos;s context : &quot;
&quot; within the framework of social , political and economic crisis , in which the inflation rate and tissues has been valued at 500 % to the annual financial statements and in which a serious and far @-@ sufficient lack of food and medicine was considered the only way to re@@ conquer its institutional structures and close a new governance body . &quot;

particularly large waves sm@@ ote the message about polished repres@@ sion in the centrally located city of Marac@@ ay .
&quot; the demonstr@@ ators went back into the local cathedral , in order to protect themselves according to the police and armed fears of the government . &quot;
&quot; hours later they were able to leave the cathedral again , but the protests went further . &quot;
&quot; in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the An@@ den@@ State T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira : &quot;
&quot; the women in T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira do not bear tube , because you could see something else , what many nationalities do not have ! &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , an inf@@ o@@ fi@@ k makes the round , which forms the extent of supp@@ ression per day : &quot;
thus the dictatorship of the country has been oppressed .
many representatives of the government had ques@@ tioned the validity of the demand for a loss procedure - this was now proven in the eyes of many through the presence of inn@@ umer@@ able people on the street .

&quot; others evaluate these protests as a further step in the fight against a government that made a little bit against the devast@@ ating economic crisis , and prefer to leave critical voices . &quot;
they took us so much - but also the fear !
the mar@@ ches always take advantage of frequency and intensity .

&quot; this is an adap@@ table version of a interview recorded by Ale@@ jo G@@ Ã³@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 at D@@ Ã­a a D@@ Ã­a , a Argent@@ ine@@ an after@@ math . &quot;
the interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to join the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ inian town of CÃ³rdoba . &quot;
&quot; as meanwhile , Qui@@ j@@ ano said Qui@@ j@@ ano now in the context of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ ber@@ a process in the province of CÃ³rdoba against his father . &quot;
&quot; in the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were examined , which were committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an army . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
&quot; starting at the BÃ¼r@@ de , the same name as his father to carry up to the brutal mil@@ e@@ per@@ ations in the prison La Per@@ la that he was at the age of 15 , he has suffered enough . &quot;
34 years he kept the family pro@@ long@@ ation for himself .
in the situation back then I believed that was in order .
I felt like a sal@@ mag@@ ent .
as a child with 15 years one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
&quot; at that time , I could not realize that my father was a th@@ ief , folk and mur@@ derer . &quot;
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was G@@ end@@ ar@@ et@@ eri@@ am@@ y . during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship from 1974 till 1983 , a time of state terrorism , was his father from 1976 to 1978 Deputy Comm@@ an@@ de@@ ur of the Myst@@ eries of 141 in prison La Per@@ la . &quot;

&quot; but this is not the history of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the op@@ pres@@ sor , which was indic@@ ted for kid@@ n@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and the kid@@ n@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year child . &quot;
&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ x@@ anos son , a man who had experienced the extent of the atro@@ cities which he had experienced as a boy , and said before a federal court against his own father . &quot;
his story shows how great power has a parent for his child and how this child chose one way of salvation .
from the sports hall to the military base
&quot; when my father began to take me to the military base , I often went with us into the sports hall . there I was made friends with a boy , the martial arts . &quot;
all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ white photo and ur@@ ged me to identify my friend .
he said :

&quot; therefore he offered me to go back to the sports hall . some days later , he took me to work on the military base . &quot;
&quot; he said to me , I would be disc@@ rep@@ ent . &quot;
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine . for so my Father had moved me .
on the military base I had to destroy papers which had heard the prisoners .
&quot; these were all possible documents : university closures , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda , books , simply everything . &quot;

&apos;@@ da dr@@ on are tor@@ tured the prisoners &quot;
my father took me in total vi@@ erm@@ al to La Per@@ la with - everything in 1976 .
at the first time and during the last time he left me at the entrance of the car .
&quot; when he took me the second time , he command@@ ed me to exit . he led me to a bar@@ ac@@ ke , in the cars , furniture , television , refriger@@ ators - simply everything possible - stood . &quot;
everything of it was stolen .
&quot; he gave me a little into a blan@@ ket P@@ ck@@ chen and command@@ ed me to wear it for the car . when I opened it opened , I saw that there was a great cl@@ ump of silver . &quot;
on that day I went to the other end of the Bar@@ ac@@ ke where the stolen items were completed and signed me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed out an open space and said :
since dr@@ au@@ ght the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
&quot; I split into and saw a li@@ ege , on the human being tor@@ tured . &quot;
it looked like a field bed and metal springs .
&quot; later I found out that it was attached to the end of a Kab@@ el . the other end was attached to the body of the person , which was straight there . &quot;
&quot; it is rare a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , ski@@ ppers him with water and j@@ ed him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts in gen@@ it@@ als . &quot;

the structure there was dr@@ au@@ ght there ... like a dirty win@@ ch .
&quot; years later , when my father stood under house arrest , came the same smell from his room . &quot;
I realized the smell immediately and I was clear that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget that smell .
and I asked me : how is it possible that a person can do so much suffering from another so much ?
I knew that these people were killed &apos;
&quot; when my father took me for the third time for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were captiv@@ ated with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and were carried out and eyel@@ id . &quot;
&quot; he spoke with &quot; &quot; Ch@@ u@@ bi &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ Ã³@@ pez , a civilians who was also charged in the trial ) and I used the opportunity to take a look at La cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; in the background I saw a number of matt@@ resses , on which naked men face with the face down - all were captiv@@ ated by hands and feet . &quot;
in the vicinity of the entrance people still lying on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; when my father commented that I saw at the prisoners he said , &quot; &quot; what gu@@ ck@@ st thou so , Ar@@ sch@@ loch ? &quot;
I depri@@ ved &quot; Why did you meet me ? &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed by soldiers and buried .
I know that because my father told me at home .
&quot; besides La cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms that have been referred to as offices . &quot;
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero there was a man assembled and killing .
&quot; ( according to survi@@ vor@@ s , the Jor@@ ge Rom@@ ero was indic@@ ted by the Jor@@ ge Rom@@ ero who also was indic@@ ted in the La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ ber@@ a process , the students Ra@@ Ãº@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) . &quot;
&quot; in the following video Em@@ ilio F@@ essia , the head of the memorial La Per@@ la , through the former folk chambers . &quot;
&quot; the way where you came here , is also the way to which the ent@@ led here came here . &quot;
&quot; if you look on the map , see that they took about this route and then were tor@@ tured for the first time . &quot;
&quot; here , their names were changed and they got a number assigned as part of the process of emp@@ t@@ apes . &quot;
&quot; if they survived the torture , the prisoners were cast into cu@@ d@@ ra until the arrangement of the top came to be laid . &quot;
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of men and the dis@@ appearance of their corp@@ ses in most cases .
the &quot; War &quot; War &quot;
my dad brought all sorts of stolen things with home .
at that time in the age I had no cl@@ ue what the &quot; war@@ dness &quot; - as she called it - was .
&quot; but when I was later on the military , I was in the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie - it was clear to me that war is a bay@@ onet or perhaps military signs which one has fought a enemy that one has fought . &quot;

&quot; but if one goes into a house and the fridge , the turn@@ table , clothing , paintings , money ... sti@@ r , then this is not a war but V@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
this is theft .
&quot; I have always asked myself how my father , the head of security forces could participate in this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I don &apos;t understand it .
&quot; I was also Officer at the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter into a house , and to ste@@ al everything in it . &quot;
I don &apos;t understand how my Father could do that .
&quot; once again , he called a crime and I answered : and you , who are the cars on the street ? &quot;
you are not a crime ?
&quot; he explo@@ ded before W@@ ut , suggested me and cri@@ ed : &quot;
&quot; if you go so far , then I will find you and get rid of you . &quot;
so we need no one another !
so my father was .
I have no single memory of him .
&quot; when I said in the process , I showed a photo from at that time , on which I took a jacket and a roller pul@@ p . both had my father from La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he brought back clothing to home . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the defense , a competi@@ tor had been in this crime . I res@@ ist , no problem , they can put me to the burden what they wanted . &quot;
I was anyway there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the dis@@ ruption of the body is the last ab@@ ob@@ ble act &quot;
&quot; now , where I am older , I find Reu@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; I have children . if one has only children once , one recognizes the value of a life . &quot;
one develops and realis@@ es that it is wrong to kill .
I went even so far to say :
&quot; well , you have ex@@ hal@@ ted each other during the dictatorship of the dictatorship . but why let the corp@@ ses disappear ? &quot;
why children do it ?
one day my father brought a girl with home whose mother had been killed .
&quot; it was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl . &quot;
&quot; I always asked myself the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
&quot; however , one could just have put into prison . &quot;
&quot; I guess it was simply decided to kill these people , but what their corp@@ ses disappear ? &quot;
had these people not even families where to pass their ster@@ n@@ ingly over@@ remains ?
the dis@@ ruption of the body is the last ab@@ ob@@ ble act that can be done to a man .
&quot; my father told me when democracy was re@@ introduced , they took machines to eliminate the ster@@ tal remains of the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were dis@@ assembled and caused somewhere - no cl@@ ue , where . &quot; you will never find something &quot; , &quot; said My Father . &quot;
but something remains of course .
I have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
only to make it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the g@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just told the truth about 20 crime - including my father .
&quot; the thought , to view my father , was born during a conversation , when he was under house arrest . &quot;
&quot; I made him pro@@ bes because of all the atro@@ cities , which I had to experience . &quot;
then he suddenly said : &quot; I do not know . I don &apos;t have killed anyone . &quot;
&quot; I felt internal razor and asked me to the whole up@@ scale patri@@ ot@@ ism , and the &quot; Western and Christian emotions , &quot; which they said , actually were well . &quot;
then I cri@@ ed :
how can you tell us ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed a horri@@ ble crime and you were forced to join me as a child .
he re@@ jects only &quot; Na then click &quot; . &quot; &quot;
that is exactly what I did .
in 2010 I bought the first ad .
I had finally realized that he was a crimin@@ als .
nobody can pre@@ ach me that I was pre@@ taken . I finally said against my own father .

a translation errors makes older people in Kyoto too &quot; fur@@ tive car drivers &quot;
&quot; the sign with the translation error in a centre in Kyoto , where one can extend its leadership . &quot;
the photo was spread in social media .
elabor@@ ation of the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened center in which one can extend its leadership in the last month , witness to a very particularly mis@@ happy translation . &quot;
&quot; on a shield was the Japanese word &quot; &quot; Me@@ ans &quot; . &quot; ( Korean sh@@ a ) , the &quot; &quot; older Auto@@ drivers &quot; means , &quot; unfortunately - perhaps also with mal@@ icious back@@ wards &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; fur@@ tive auto@@ driver &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was to read the wrong translation from 1st to 20th of September to electronic ads in the input field and in the building itself .
&quot; elabor@@ ation of the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine , which has often been shared in the social media . &quot;
&quot; the mistake was the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident Ky@@ otos , fallen . he was also aware of the local tim@@ ings to it . &quot;
the Kyoto Newspaper Kyoto Shim@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; this is an ins@@ ult to older people and in an international city like Kyoto , simply unacceptable &quot; , &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot;
&quot; the faul@@ ty English translation was initially removed . the name &quot; &quot; object driver &quot; &quot; was later replaced by the appropriate if also gram@@ mati@@ ze not completely correct name &quot; &quot; El@@ der drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older Auto@@ drivers &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the police of the pre@@ f@@ ecture Kyoto ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation errors . furthermore , they explained that the bug had already included in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked on their correctness before it was published . &quot;
a blo@@ gger reported as follows :
&quot; we are sorry that older people felt by the insufficient correction ( the translation ) of our part , &quot; said the Police . &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ cast News gave a bit more detail with the phenomenon of the &quot; fur@@ tive &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; the word &quot; terrible &quot; was den@@ o@@ unced as un@@ adequate description of older drivers . according to the police there are the percentage of older motor@@ ists who are involved in accidents , but certainly cause for concern . &quot;
&quot; in the pre@@ f@@ ecture , Kyoto for example were caused by 19.@@ 460 accidents of sen@@ iors . this corresponds to a percentage of 10 % . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , caused sen@@ iors 1,@@ 8@@ 03 from a total of 11.@@ 850 accidents . &quot;
so that their share rose to 17.@@ 7 % .
&quot; while the number of accidents has decreased in total , the proportion of sen@@ iors caused inci@@ dents in the same period . &quot;
&quot; the nam@@ ing not mentioned re@@ porter brought in the release of the article comments in the light , which show what prejudi@@ ces some Japanese are seem@@ ingly against older drivers : &quot;
&quot; the article on Yahoo with the translation errors , including the following comments : &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; terrible auto@@ driver &quot; &quot; ) about not the reality ? &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; so far the translation is actually not , or ? &quot;
- &quot; I do not think that is a real translation error .
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; in all over Asia is so widespread
translation errors are widely used in Japan and throughout Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a true foundations for these bizar@@ re errors in English .
photo of Flickr @-@ users Andrew .
the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are mani@@ fold .
&quot; to over@@ set , one needs two important skills : passive language skills , to understand the starting text and to be active voice knowledge to transfer it into the target language . &quot;
&quot; the latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is in native language . generally , the conviction that translator is in the target language - not in the pron@@ unci@@ ation - native language . &quot;
&quot; thus , a Spanish speakers should translate into the French , for example from English to French - not from the French language . &quot;
photo of Flickr @-@ users Karl Baron .
&quot; many Japanese companies do not employ workers with English as native language , the translations into English . this may be attribut@@ able to incorrect understanding of the over@@ set , cost reasons or the relatively low number of English speakers , which may learn Japanese . &quot;
&quot; some companies who do not have foreign employees , yet leave translations @-@ based internally . then the Japanese staff , whose English knowledge are made as the best one to be made , no matter how good or bad his language skills are really . &quot;
photo of Flickr @-@ users Karl Baron .
machine translations are also widespread - often with funny results .
the wor@@ r@@ alled and pu@@ zz@@ ling sentences created by machine translation will show that this technique may not substitute for a long time . this applies to some languages very special .
&quot; some of the most strange English phrases in Japan , including the pu@@ zz@@ ling prints , which often use T @-@ shirts or po@@ ckets , are only used for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or even understood . &quot;
photo of Flickr @-@ users Joseph Br@@ ent .
&quot; translation errors may be acceptable or at least harm@@ less . but from large companies or by the government who have funds to guarantee higher standards , you can express careful translations . &quot;
the City of Kyoto uses a serious source of their translations in the future .
Venezuela : protests and cement measures on the internet and television
&quot; main page of the portal &quot; &quot; Nav@@ eg@@ ar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( Fre@@ ies surfing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institute of Press and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; on Friday morning , 7 April , mel@@ ez@@ ed internet users , that they could not have access to the online transmitter Vi@@ vo@@ play . &quot;
&quot; later , other users wrote that the internet presence of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV was also no longer accessible . &quot;
&quot; other online transm@@ itters of protests in Car@@ acas , which were organised by op@@ posi@@ tional groups that contra@@ dic@@ ted the government of NicolÃ¡s Ma@@ du@@ ros . &quot;
&quot; the protests began at the beginning of April , after the Supreme Court resolved the Parliament and transferred the tasks of the Parliament on the exile and the Supreme Court itself . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos d@@ Ã­@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a Tr@@ ac@@ er@@ ou@@ tes , published the results of a Tr@@ ac@@ er@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection is cool@@ ed , and received the U@@ ches , VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet . &quot;
# Zen@@ sur : enabled your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages ven@@ ez@@ ol@@ an@@ ic provider are once again locked .
this is from the site of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
&quot; offers like Vi@@ vo@@ play are popular among the vene@@ ers with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest . &quot;
traditional media have been in@@ vari@@ ably since 2014 with reporting on protests . at that time the Commission will continue to report them with money la@@ under@@ ing and lock@@ ings when the Commission would continue to report this as a call to violence .
without cable TV and informative national television channels I have signed up again at @ vi@@ vo@@ play@@ net .
amazing that still is cheaper than two litres li@@ on@@ ade to buy .
&quot; local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro later confirmed that not only Vi@@ vo@@ play through a blocking of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) un@@ accessible , but also two other online channels . this also applies to the website to which the National Assembly transfers its meetings . &quot;
&quot; earlier research institutes of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , we had to make use of the local internet provider . this is a technique by which the DNS server requests of certain domains has failed . &quot;
&quot; if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server fails or denied request from the call of such a website . &quot;
we confirm a DNS @-@ locking : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ vo@@ play@@ net &quot;
&quot; V@@ PI@@ TV , a third blocked channel , the transmission on Thursday , 6 April , set , as the V@@ PI@@ TV cam@@ er@@ aman El@@ vis Flor@@ es , which took place the protests in Car@@ acas live . &quot;
Flor@@ es was be@@ aten as he was in a police force .
&quot; eight hours later , he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went back to show . &quot;
&quot; although some channels are accessible via YouTube , it was also reported that the government regul@@ ates the Internet connections : thus the vene@@ ers of the access to oral reporting of the current events in the country will always be ag@@ gra@@ v@@ ated . &quot;
in Paraguay many girls will get to get a training
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was as a child a cri@@ ad@@ ita . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
&quot; today , Tina for the rights of children and g@@ athers witness to other cri@@ ad@@ itas , which were just as they were victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot;
photo by Cec@@ ilia Ro@@ jas . use with friendly permission of Kur@@ dish .
&quot; the following article is the abri@@ d@@ ged version of a report by Kur@@ dish , which is published by Global Vo@@ ices with friendly permission of the authors . &quot;
&quot; the article is part of a series with the title &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ elas que &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; F@@ lying cows , dec@@ aying schools &quot; ) , published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household , where they did not live together with the family who lived there , eat . &quot;
&quot; shortly before her studies at the university she returned to the house again and heard , like the owner of the house of pride above she said . &quot; &quot; she is like a daughter for us . &quot;
&quot; who has become something out of something , &quot; said she . &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated in this house as a daughter .
&quot; when she was ten years old , she started to work as cri@@ ad@@ ita for the family . as cri@@ ad@@ itas , in Paraguay you can work in Paraguay which are forced to work to go to school . &quot;
&quot; the shop is very simple : a large family with little money over@@ gives her min@@ der@@ son &apos;s son or her min@@ der@@ less daughter to another , abundant family . in exchange , the child receives food , a training and a roof over the head . &quot;
&quot; however , what is not mentioned , however , that the children do not have to do countless days of household work that will never be paid and victim of abuse and failure , and all that in the context of a contract that cannot lift up . &quot;
&quot; this as a cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go , practical experience is widespread in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints of human rights organisations . &quot;
&quot; after completing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , she spoke with Cri@@ ad@@ itas - especially young girls have been affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - sam@@ pled stuff , resear@@ ched and p@@ ran@@ ged . &quot;
&quot; they tried to name things in the name , because the feeling of gratitude that the Cri@@ ad@@ itas is vacc@@ in@@ ated , guarantees the silence . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , explains al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , the family , who have their daughter in the faith that they can complete their training to improve their position in society and make something out of itself , to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family , who takes the girl in himself and whose exploitation is justified by faith that they would give someone someone else , who would otherwise not be hungry , perhaps even hungry . &quot;
the victims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; if the girl is mis@@ ed , his family will experience many years later . &quot;
sometimes they will never learn about it .
&quot; in January 2016 , this has got a relatively un@@ familiar phenomenon in January 2016 , which takes place in par@@ ked in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen households , but a face . &quot;
&quot; as Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº came to hospital , her body showed traces of he@@ ap . shortly afterwards she died . &quot;
she was 14 years old .
&quot; she was cri@@ ad@@ ita in the household of the former military tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as official member of the registration office . &quot;
&quot; Mar@@ Ã­n lived in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ Ã­a , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants , 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n . &quot;
&quot; end of January 2016 he proposed Fer@@ re@@ ira as long as with a stick to Mar@@ Ã­n , until they had fat@@ al injuries . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
some days later the media reported about the incident .
they stressed that the mur@@ dered child was a cri@@ ad@@ ita .
organizations such as UN@@ ICEF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the deeply rooted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ical society of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go for the death of the girl .
&quot; they recorded the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of sla@@ very . &quot;
several dozen people came to Protest@@ ant together and demanded that there will be no more Carolina . in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widely used in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay are more cows than children registered , &quot; said Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
without Pap@@ ers it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
&quot; without official documents it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live . &quot;
the neighbors of the couple and almost 60 civil society organisations called for a gener@@ osity examination of the case .
&quot; they want the Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder on the girls , which was to be condemned to 30 years of prison . &quot;
&quot; if the case comes before judgment , the case of Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n could be se@@ ated - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay is a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go court . &quot;
the everyday life of a Cri@@ ad@@ ita
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ itas will not only be exploited , they also live isolated from other girls in their age . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old , when the Far@@ bik , in which her father had to sign up and her father lost his work . &quot;
&quot; their brothers had to work out all and began to sell , on the street or on the market sweets to earn money . &quot;
but they all went further to school .
only Tina was sent as cri@@ ad@@ ita in the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n .
in the house of their employers Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day .
&quot; in doing so , she had to share the time so that you still have time to learn . &quot;
she stood up at 5 o &apos;clock in the morning and prepared the breakfast for their employer .
&quot; for example , they clean the fridge , clean the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor . &quot;
&quot; when the school was at the end , she went back home and had time to learn . &quot;
&quot; the more they had finished with learning , the more free time she had . &quot;
&quot; however , this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says , she had never had hungry , but I was not allowed to get more books from the library of the household as food from the fridge . &quot;
&quot; the library was well equipped and belonged to the hostess , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party that was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do stra@@ ess@@ ner , which was belonged to the opposition from 1954 until 1989 . &quot;
&quot; at some finish of the H@@ var@@ eng@@ a , beside him stand and guidance from Op@@ posi@@ tivity as &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo &quot; . &quot; &quot;
he tried to convince them to convince the reports of the official media about the regime of dict@@ ators .
&quot; he held her for intelligent , but not with her . &quot; &quot; the host had not found someone who spoke while he spoke about politics while talking about politics . &quot;
&quot; they allowed me not often to visit my family because they were the opinion that I was able to learn that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , which would be back to the indigenous group of Guar@@ an@@ Ã­ , to return home to her mother tongue Guar@@ an@@ Ã­ . &quot;
&quot; their Lord fear@@ ed that they had the formation they had , to lose again , explains it . &quot;
&quot; it was however completely clear that they had paid for everything they had paid by them , with their hard work . &quot;
&quot; also at school Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was dis@@ discri@@ min@@ ated . &quot; a thing about which almost never spoken , are har@@ ass@@ ment and the sc@@ ans that cri@@ ad@@ itas are exposed , if they go to school . &quot;
&quot; because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents , a cri@@ ad@@ ita . &quot;
I was able to invite anybody to my home . I had no friends in the school or in the neighborhood .
&quot; in my youth , in time where friend@@ ships arise , I felt particularly clear that I belonged to any group . &quot;

&quot; in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group in which you can show job vac@@ ancy for cleaning and inf@@ ests in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; the administration of the group is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city bear@@ er in the As@@ unci@@ on district . &quot;
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a little companion for my little daughter who plays in the morning and in the afternoon with her .
for learning .
please contact you .
&quot; starting from Monday , if possible . &quot;
&quot; the ad got five &quot; &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; &quot; and many comments . &quot;
a woman from the place Ã@@ em@@ by wrote that she could have a long @-@ year girl and gave their phone number .
&quot; another woman who also came from Ã@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year round . &quot; &quot; she likes little children and is very pretty . &quot;
&quot; in the third comment was written by &quot; &quot; a girl from the inland , who wants to work . &quot;
then switching the summary in the ad once again :
&quot; dear girl@@ friends , I have found a lot . I look at whether it works with her . &quot;
&quot; thank you , I write again if something is . &quot;
the business was complete .
in pro@@ log to the report Cri@@ ad@@ itas , Â¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ Ã¡n@@ do ? &quot;
&quot; ( cri@@ ad@@ itas , as long still ? ) , a collection of witness , former Cri@@ ad@@ itas , writes or@@ ti@@ z : &quot;
&quot; in the course of our history , we have managed to dism@@ iss systems such as sla@@ very , Cu@@ Ã±@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the early history of Paraguay . therefore , it is not to justify that many girls and boys put himself in a system of sla@@ very , where they become easy victim for abuse and exploitation . &quot;
the social inequality in Paraguay and that for the show are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
legisl@@ ations writes Egyptian users of social media to register at the government

published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
&quot; six@@ ty Egyptian parliament@@ arians , have recently agreed to a bill for government regulations regarding the use and utility of social networks . &quot;
&quot; when he is adopted by Parliament , beneficiaries , users must register social media in Egypt with a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the law , then a place would then be set up , which is commissioned to give citizens a permission to give social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months with acceptance of the law , user would have to register at the site with their right names and personnel numbers , to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; if it is failed to do so , this could bring a sentence up to six months in prison or an ATM . &quot;
&quot; the bill design , consists of six par@@ ag@@ ra@@ fen and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt independent curve , defines social media as a &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application , which runs through the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice , video surveillance and text . &quot;
&quot; it is un@@ clear how the law being en@@ forced when it is assumed , as the draft authorities should be imposed on how the Egyptian authorities should impose on how the Egyptian government should not register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not able to guarantee regulation on the level of social media companies . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , parliament@@ arians of parliament and promot@@ er of the legislation , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received from the telecommunications Ministry for a user name and a password to come through the firewall , the Facebook blocked . &quot;
&quot; this could mean that Egypt is planning to make a firewall at the national level around Facebook . due to which it would be required for Egypt , and Egyptians , information on their identity to access the network . &quot;
&quot; however , it is not known that such plans are ins@@ ist . &quot;
experts and experts on site are scep@@ tical concerning the technical power capability of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Tech@@ nolog@@ ist ( in German &quot; conduc@@ tive researchers &quot; ) the Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egypt initiative for personal rights &quot; &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
&quot; I doubt the technical capacities and the understanding of every authority in Egypt concerning things , which have to do with technology . &quot;
&quot; in my opinion , they imagine that just as they have r@@ ape the physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online . &quot;
&quot; if I take it seriously , then that it means a strong surveillance system to monitor citizens who apply a permit or not . and this means a crazy system to monitor the activities of the people and also to lead them to a court process . &quot;
this is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; to be adopted as law , the draft must first be discussed at the legislative election of the Parliament and the constitutional committees before it goes into the plenary debate . &quot;
&quot; whether its acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not , the draft &quot; stands in line with a pro @-@ military thinking in parliament , in whose sense the control will be maxim@@ ised and ensured that no disc@@ ret@@ ool is present on the screen , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;
&quot; last year , the German unification of Tam@@ er El @-@ Sh@@ ah@@ aw@@ y established a legal situation against cy@@ ber crime against cy@@ ber crime , in which a li@@ fel@@ ong sentence for those intended to thre@@ aten the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest &quot; . &quot; &quot;

&quot; a sub@@ species of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards that belong through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian Leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . they are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are due to Wil@@ der@@ ei , the loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat , as they can always find less lo@@ ot , je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed . &quot;
why is this particular type of le@@ op@@ ards so important ?
&quot; like R@@ aza in the video shows , &quot; the Persian Leopard is the only remaining smo@@ b@@ tier in the Kur@@ dish ecos@@ ystem , and the health and the thr@@ ust of the ecos@@ ystem also depends that a huge smo@@ other is available . &quot;
&quot; the chance to see a Persian Leop@@ ards actually in the free wild , is low and goes against zero . as the team in the video is therefore determined that they have a shot of a large cat in the camera , breaks the R@@ aza in pure joy . &quot;

&quot; in the beginning of March 2017 , documented the progress made for the Nor@@ the@@ ast Japan , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o , which were made in the last six years to re@@ build the life of those who had been affected by the &quot; tri@@ une catastrophe , &quot; a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a had triggered the disaster . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung has its headquarters in Sen@@ da@@ i , which is located in the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was a permanent pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in Japan , which had to experience the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami . &quot;
hundreds of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighboring pr@@ un@@ ek@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a and I@@ w@@ ate became inev@@ it@@ ated because the ts@@ un@@ ami had disappear whole coastal cities from the map .
&quot; in addition , the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a lived a nuclear accident , but on this reason , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their houses . &quot;
the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o shows from the local point of view which progress has been made six years later to re@@ build the life of local residents .
the detailed report of the paper includes both statistics of the Japanese re@@ constructions as well as survey results of those concerned themselves .
&quot; housing in Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate &quot;
&quot; K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung reports that until December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned spare parts ( see you , &quot; &quot; sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate were finished . &quot;
&quot; the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures could record Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , here 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed . &quot;
&quot; I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , from where Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a with 70 percent is the final light . &quot;
&quot; even six years after the catastrophe , ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ated from Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ accommodations ( see you , Kaz@@ ets@@ u ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) into final sub@@ houses . &quot;
after the thre@@ e@@ fold catastrophe almost 80 000 people were forced to live in Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ accommodations .
&quot; in December 2016 , 36 000 people lived from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a and Iv@@ v@@ him@@ a and Iv@@ v@@ him@@ a . &quot;
&quot; nearly 40 percent of Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a in 2011 , Ev@@ ac@@ him@@ a live in emergency accommodations , from where he was more than 75 percent of the ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ated accommodations that were lod@@ ged after the disaster in Beh@@ ind accommodations , were inhabited in final houses . &quot;
for I@@ w@@ ate the number is here at 34 percent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ tures .
&quot; as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper was able to determine , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , which were affected by Un@@ gl@@ Ã¼ck , their doors until December 2016 again opened , which makes almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ences is far more difficult . &quot;
&quot; while almost 100 percent of the fishing industry in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i have now been operating again in Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a , only 30 percent of the fishing industry in operation . &quot;
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the atom@@ ar accident have drawn in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures agricultural land .
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas , whereby only 66 percent of the sugar land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed Ash@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a . &quot;
&quot; it is unlikely that only a result of nuclear is , because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of non @-@ destruc@@ tive land of Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a lie in the &quot; nuclear zone &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism also has recovered over again , but also here Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a remains back far here . &quot;
the tourist figures in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are back to 90 per cent on the same stand as before the un@@ happiness . Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a on the other hand can have only 75 percent .
&quot; however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants , it is more difficult to earn their living . &quot;
is the locals prepared for the next big earthquake ?
&quot; in order to determine a whole picture , the newspaper conducted numerous surveys among the native population and among the ev@@ ac@@ uation . they asked them over the state of re@@ building and also how their sensation over the ts@@ un@@ ami risk has changed . &quot;
in their introduction of the article the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o led a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness under the native population .
&quot; the survey carried out that 8@@ 3.1 percent of the or@@ atory resident , measures have taken to be prepared to be prepared for future earthquake and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is . &quot;
&quot; however 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respon@@ dents , that still not enough in terms of disasters prevention has been done . &quot;
how it stands for those who had to be ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ated from the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a
&quot; in its output to the anniversary of the earthquake , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung has also strengthened its attention to the situation of ev@@ ac@@ u@@ him@@ a . &quot;
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a had to experience not only the huge earthquake and the devast@@ ating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the pre@@ f@@ ecture Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a was also witness of the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hic , atomic accident , the Japan ever had to experience . &quot;
&quot; from 160 000 ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a , almost 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2016 , a little more than 23@@ ,000 people returned to Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a , in permanent spare parts houses . &quot;
&quot; after the stand of 2017 , 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a live outside of their home pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; in the cat@@ astrop@@ hic areas , most of the ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ated accommodations , which are still in Beh@@ ind accommodations , older than 50 years old . they have to compete for re@@ build reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a with massive construction projects . this is a building projects which are part of the Olympic Games that can take place in Tokyo . &quot;
the world is small : our Pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
&quot; if one encounters people from other countries that speak another language , the differences seem to be bigger than the simil@@ arities . &quot;
after a while we often recognize that one more links than it seems at first glance .
&quot; these global connections are important , since they challenge our prejudi@@ ces to expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small . &quot;
&quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices pod@@ cast , we look at exactly these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we handle topics , which often get fewer attention than they deserve . &quot;
&quot; we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members , who remember one moment in which they have felt very strong with someone over voice and country borders . &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ oniki Kri@@ kon@@ i speaks about the simil@@ arities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gh@@ erman speaks about the time where she worked with people from all over the world in London , and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences that he collected in a small village in Madagascar . &quot;

a Brazilian student at the age of 33 has been delivered this week into the intensive care station : last Friday made him a police officers during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with a stroke of prot@@ esters in a Protest@@ ant against austerity .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , the social sciences studied at the Federal Ministry of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s , has suffered a sk@@ ull @-@ brain trau@@ ma and several fac@@ tions . &quot;
doctors worked on this Saturday and now have moved it into an artificial compression .
its condition is considered critical .
the local sculp@@ tor Lu@@ iz da Luz took photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus that spread within a few days rapidly in Brazil .
on the pictures also the face of the police officers are also identified with a stroke . the man was identified as August@@ o Samp@@ ai@@ o .
&quot; after the incident , the military police officers were known in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s that Samp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended to completion of the investigation of the incident of the active service . &quot;
the pictures show the police officers as he strikes in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with its impact on the face of the students Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Luz ) .
would a police officers said by a prot@@ esters and land on the intensive care station would be his face six months long in television and the whole repres@@ sion would therefore justified .
&quot; the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ neur@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , distributed by Lu@@ iz da Luz in which you see how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officers and several sanitary briefly on it . &quot;
&quot; another video with the same scenes , but from another perspective is also filmed in social networks . &quot;
in the clip shown clip you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
&quot; for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in a different state , they have donated 10,000 Brazilian re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) to stay part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow for his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , while he is in hospital . &quot;

police over@@ handles
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s was not the only state in Brazil in which it came to brutal police force against demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; police continued in protest in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had erected a stage for Red@@ ner , rubber and t@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; the representative Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police via loud@@ speakers on violence against demonstr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; this also includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country . &quot;
&quot; once again , the Brazilian media is wo@@ unded by putting the focus on another , unexpected protagon@@ ists : a window screen . &quot;
&quot; the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo , specifically reported on a broken glass window to create an illustr@@ ative image pages . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the O Glo@@ bo is a title story with one in Brand set bus . &quot;
&quot; there is no pl@@ au@@ sible journ@@ alist reason , more about a broken shut@@ ters than on the protests of people who serve the defense of a special thing to report . &quot;
this must also be understood if one is strictly damaged against any form of atomic damage .
&quot; also here , the term &quot; &quot; V@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; is given the term &quot; &quot; V@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; a absurd meaning , and the typical violence of the military police are caused by head@@ lines with the title &quot; &quot; demonstr@@ ators on confrontation with the police &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Ill@@ umin@@ alization villages in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Ã@@ l@@ var@@ o Re@@ yn@@ oso almost hundreds of sugar cane fabri@@ ken in all over Cuba the doors ( Photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the People &apos;s municipality of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ i , located in the western Cu@@ ban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as el Central - in Spanish Zu@@ ck@@ erm@@ ost - regardless of that there is no n@@ enn@@ able sugar on site . &quot;
&quot; it is two years ago , when the activities were placed in the sugar cane fabri@@ cated . &quot;
&quot; after the proceeds the sugar cane industry in the region were silent , and the factory lay down and after its facilities , until only the sm@@ ells made of steel and concrete remained . &quot;
about 272 workers had to re@@ inv@@ ent itself .
some changes the work .
&quot; other res@@ ig@@ ni@@ ed and pen@@ od@@ les daily to the factories , which still war@@ med . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ene , a soldi@@ er veter@@ an , who is up every day at 4 : 00 p.m. in the morning , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not care to sleep . &quot;
&quot; he heard that there are a long in@@ active time in the east of the region , which are after a long in@@ active time since they were preserved . &quot;
that was something he was not expected .
&quot; N@@ ene reminds itself exactly that in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ i , I would receive the sugar cane factory , but the promise was not kept . &quot;
&quot; the sugar cane industry already contra@@ dic@@ ated the pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , the low market prices , the in@@ effic@@ ien@@ cies , the poor management decisions and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , production was 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than 1910 . &quot;
&quot; the message would have been a motive for the country a few decades ago , but the bad harvest are already no new . &quot;
why was the Cu@@ ban sugar cane industry turned off ?
the old railway sti@@ ff of the church looked better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the reduction of sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane fabri@@ ken were technically out@@ dated , and hardly competitive , they were un@@ sustainable for the country . &quot;
the initial idea was to focus production on the most efficient factories that the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes .
they left only the factories left to produce the sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the moti@@ fs that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar farms and the sugar crisis on the world market .
&quot; nevertheless , the sugar @-@ price increased from about a decade ago . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 to 2025 the price of un@@ refined sugar has to stay between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pounds , according to the report published by the OECD and FA@@ O , the agricultural and food organisation of the United Nations . &quot;
&quot; if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3,@@ 6 million tons ) , the pipe of raw @-@ export is roughly 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; the present day will certainly enter into the history , which were the first words of the Cu@@ ban president F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
&quot; from there on , the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry . &quot;
&quot; in the following years , the stand@@ still came from 98 sugars in the following years , more than 65 million people received their full vote for further education . &quot;
the same happened in the sugar Factory Greg@@ orio Arl@@ Ã©e Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ i on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto PÃ©@@ rez worked since 1967 in the factory .
&quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldi@@ er , about the closure of the factory , the word he is most repeated , &quot; fraud . &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents are the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory was bre@@ ast@@ ed .
&quot; in order to get the place , they formed a full @-@ time working group . &quot;
&quot; before the first floor year , the first letters began to come . &quot;
&quot; it was officially recorded documents , which would only be removed from the parts that would be removed , the addres@@ see and the date . &quot;
all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro only the minister was able to participate .
from there the responsibility was handed over and the letters came more and more frequently .
Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the bre@@ ast@@ ed factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the still in operation . &quot;
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waiting for the retirement in another plant , the Bor@@ is Luis Santa Colom@@ a . &quot;
&quot; he was opposed to his will in the stand@@ still of the factory , where building he helped to participate . &quot;
&quot; with each part , the he removed , dis@@ assembled one of his 31 working years . &quot;
the best developed industrial area developed by Cuba and the most important working group .
&quot; in many cases , no alternatives for employment and services were generated by the plants in the municipalities where they found themselves . &quot;
&quot; we will never know if during the Mam@@ mut speech of 21 October 2002 , the dam@@ er president saw in the eyes of the present individuals , when he was guaranteed for the areas whose factories were no longer running in operation for five years . &quot;
the price of the population for the closing of sugar mol@@ ds
since 2004 sugar cane is only extrac@@ ted high by grinding .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; after two years the folk community of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich found that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; as the sugar cane factory closed , or better said than they began to le@@ f@@ ade them , they also listened to paved the streets , and dis@@ advant@@ aged other companies . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy other factories had to come up . &quot;
they were given to spare parts .
&quot; without future prospects , many young people left the region . &quot;
&quot; in the area , a food factory was created , whose production serves not even for the care of the community . &quot;
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant will continue to be im@@ posing .
&quot; at the end of 2016 N@@ ene came back to the factory Bor@@ is Luis Santa Colom@@ a , the ruins of the place where he began to work . &quot;

they have had it for ten years .
&quot; N@@ ene came into pensions with 65 years , not because it is lacking in power , but because he is bitter . &quot;

&quot; as part of the N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an @-@ Tour , since 2014 Work@@ sho@@ oters mobile ton@@ studios directly to schools and youth centers , to bring youth groups of son@@ g@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live presentations . &quot;
the original workshops were led by the ped@@ ago@@ gues David Ho@@ d@@ ges who lives in Montreal and worked in Nord @-@ Que@@ bec with ten C@@ ree communities and then worked with the C@@ ree Hip Hop Group The North@@ stars together .
&quot; the workshop thus increases the young participants in conversations such as &quot; cultural identity , language , confrontation , love , self @-@ acceptable . &quot;
&quot; these questions are inspiration for songs and videos , where the young people are the main actors . &quot;
&quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of W@@ inn@@ eb@@ ago in the U.S. state Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , called the history of highway 16 , also &quot; highway of t@@ ears , &quot; in the almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or mur@@ dered . &quot;
the cases were largely un@@ enlight@@ ened .
&quot; the next video of Nem@@ aska C@@ ree First Nation uses the motive of a video game to convey , how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs , despite the influences through globalization . &quot;
&quot; many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people are not always able to master the languages of the First Nations . &quot;
&quot; in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i C@@ ree First Nation took place , the chor@@ us will be sung on C@@ ree . &quot;
the young people received some help from Gary Jol@@ ly from the North@@ stars Hip Hop Group that gave them a bo@@ rop@@ he in dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay C@@ ree .
&quot; on the Fac@@ ebook page of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an stands at the St@@ rop@@ he , as well as translation into English , which is translated into German : &quot;
sometimes I feel like nobody ever interested in me .
but I try to continue my days on earth
that is the day where you will take our cry
because we have lost our way to our lives in life
but I believe that we will rise up in one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
this way they can grow and also lead by our youth .
so they can do that what is the creator of God
&quot; in the comm@@ ent@@ ance , the reader and supporters of the C@@ ree @-@ Language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also has a post and adds the st@@ rop@@ he in Sil@@ en@@ eburg ( which is published on his blog and published here with permission ) : &quot;
plastic meals are not only shown in the restaurant

in Japan you can see almost every restaurant plastic dishes .
&quot; to show potential customers what exactly on the menu stands , are displayed in the vicinity of the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( see you , &quot; &quot; Plas@@ tic models of the dishes &quot; ) of each food which is served in this restaurant . &quot;
the customers see these plastic dishes and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the making of these plastic dishes .
&quot; in the Tokyo district Capp@@ ab@@ ashi , there is a variety of these small companies that produce even those plastic dishes W@@ im Wen@@ del in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a over 20 years ago . &quot;
&quot; for most Japanese , these plastic dishes usually are so common that they do not even want them once again . a new trend is turning it today in con@@ spic@@ uous mobile phone accessories and other gad@@ gets . &quot;
at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome published the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos that demonstrate this unusual tw@@ ist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin .
&quot; now in special sale : new with plastic pipes decorative cell hing@@ es , as they are shown at K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ yu Kauf@@ haus . &quot;
&quot; many of these artificial food were converted to kit@@ ebo@@ ards , as in this case , refriger@@ ation magnets : &quot;
here are a few sho@@ ch@@ illed refriger@@ ators for a new exhibition at Tokyo station .
the new boom of the f@@ ences is becoming increasingly complex .
in this case a imperi@@ al @-@ don ( a popular travel bowl with seafood ) is transformed into a cell phone .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we have found a mobile phone a good use .
also this part we have made for the exhibition at Tokyo railway station .
and here is an apple that is called your mobile phone :
&quot; designed to watch like an apple , with a cand@@ le for the mobile phone , this is already a great design . &quot;
and this is just the beginning of a growing flight into the strange .
&quot; some mobile phones and mobile phones enable you to produce your own artwork . in this case , i@@ kur@@ a or sal@@ es@@ tial is used , a popular T@@ opp@@ ed is served with white rice . &quot;
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
&quot; are there someone who would say : &quot; Wow , cool , now I can decor@@ ate my mobile phone with sal@@ mon ? &quot;
I believe I will probably be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also accept a less@@ er @-@ defined form to surprise for example colleagues or family members .
our latest mobile phones has the form of mel@@ ting the ice .
&quot; in addition , there are also travel balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , ear@@ rings and manuals from dried sal@@ mon . &quot;
other sk@@ ur@@ ri@@ le plastic meals can be viewed at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter &apos;s has@@ ht@@ ag # 1 .
&quot; if you like to know more about the origin of this trend , then this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi who dedic@@ ates the reward of the restaurant industry . as for example with sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ i@@ u . &quot;
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic meals are actually made .
a Mexican project tells the stories of the survi@@ vor@@ s of struggle against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the struggle against drug dealers . &quot;

&quot; in reports and foreign media about the &quot; &quot; fighting &quot; &quot; fight against drugs &quot; in Mexico , the pre@@ mise and transm@@ issions regularly arise in statistics . however , they do not reflect on the scale of the human tragedy , which this fight against itself . &quot;
&quot; the coverage of drug bos@@ ses like El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ Ã¡n , the head of the Sin@@ alo@@ a @-@ Kart@@ ells , the stories of the victims of the conflict completely in the background . &quot;
&quot; on the day after a violent incident , someone can hardly look at the trau@@ ma or the congreg@@ ations that have learned to live with pain . &quot;
&quot; there are behind each Lei@@ che , behind any bone occurs in the hundred secret tom@@ bs , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wo@@ unds might never cure . &quot;
&quot; that is why the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico is the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vivi@@ r C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; with the drug wholesale &quot; ) , which is said to give these victims a voice and telling stories about the criminal prosec@@ ution authorities and cart@@ els . &quot;
animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico describes the project so :
organised crime cannot only be afraid of our lives .
the effects are far more profound .
&quot; for example , when shops close , because they are threatened by drugs and have to drive whole churches so many kilometers to buy something like milk . &quot;
pain of the victims
a video with the title &quot; vi@@ das que cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; like fear life &quot; ) tells about these stories .
&quot; one main fig@@ ur is Guadal@@ upe , a father , which leaves each weekend secret tom@@ bs according to his son . &quot;
&quot; or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ Ã­@@ gu@@ ez , which lost only one day to her father , her four sisters , their husband and two of their ne@@ ph@@ ew . &quot;
&quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves today for the task that we have put ourselves to go back , and go to gra@@ ves , according to the people we loved . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric shop in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
&quot; on October 15th he should be back again , but he never came again . Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it is very hard for me , because I am now alone with three children who need training . &quot;
&quot; there is also my mother , which is also here with me . &quot;
at the moment she has no income .
&quot; you are the insurance of my father , but he won &apos;t get paid out because that demand a mort@@ ality . &quot;
where should we get it ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; we do not only need to show the faces of those who are afraid of fear . we must show international community the conflicts , the collapse and the state of state . &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ HB , a les@@ ress of animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the State of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexican . &quot;
&quot; your contribution reminds us that man should never consider force as normal , no matter what form it occurs : &quot;
I now know illness and sens@@ ational journ@@ alism already for a few years .
I arrive at newspaper ki@@ os@@ ken each day and see the title pages with pictures that can actually only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ als or from files of specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
&quot; sometimes I feel the feeling as if I am the only one , which is disgu@@ ised or sad . it affects how a lack of respect towards the person who belonged to this body once . &quot;
I cannot be equal to it or consider this as normal .
it writes on :
&quot; no , it is not normal that my 10 @-@ year C@@ ous@@ in thinks that he is sc@@ co ( German : drug vend@@ ors ) if he is great . and it is also not normal that people songs go about the &quot; hero@@ in &quot; of criminal off@@ ences , when they go through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me it is , as if they have lost those who have lost somebody and those who are afraid to them . &quot;
&quot; I see our weakness , if stories to blo@@ ated figures in a statisti@@ c . &quot;
the in@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness of men is incredible for me when the death of six people and the dis@@ infection can be justified by 43 students in a neighbour place that they were .
I think they are trying to talk of such trag@@ e@@ dies if they are not stir@@ ring and silent .
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the paper &quot; four months of ext@@ or@@ tion in the main city district : how a family with dr@@ ones became apparent , until it was destroyed by the end not only the business but also their family apart . &quot;
&quot; you think about everything you lost , and how some people can change your whole life in just a few days . &quot;
&quot; the pain never goes , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear goes back high when you are alone . &quot;
habits have changed to telephone numbers too .
&quot; we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary . &quot;
&quot; the further we are removed , the better . &quot;
the castle shows their report with the words :
&quot; we want to be arrested that the others are arrested , for you do not know when to lead you or kill yourself . &quot;
&quot; I asked myself in these terrible days , whether wines would solve my deep@@ ened feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot about how to we@@ pt . I have to learn to live with the pain . &quot;
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ Ã©r@@ rez Vega published the post &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez : one of violence signed . &quot;
&quot; in the introduction , he raises questions on how : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who has been mur@@ dered by organised crime ? &quot;
how is it to grow in a settlement at the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
&quot; he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care about her . &quot;
br@@ yan is a Wa@@ ise and he tells he had to teach himself how to make a egg co@@ oks , pot@@ till@@ as and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies , who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the river with water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for the whole life of violence and had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old he told him that his mother disappeared .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
&quot; his childhood had been gone for two years before , when he was just a few blocks from his home , the blo@@ ody body of his father saw , that was shot by armed men out of a pre @-@ driving car . &quot;
&quot; as Br@@ yan born , the situation in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was as follows : &quot;
br@@ yan was born 2006 as violence through organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez .
&quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was the most vulnerable city in the world due to the number of mor@@ als for public safety and the government of the United States . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 alone , the Prosec@@ ut@@ or 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to the cut 8,@@ 5 Mor@@ den per day . &quot;
these are just some of hundreds of thousands of stories that leaves the organised crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country .
only few stories live in view of getting new head@@ lines . this project reminds us of those we cannot forget .
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vivi@@ r C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; has called &quot; &quot; Animal journ@@ alism @-@ Project Nar@@ co@@ data in life , whose goal consists of the complex information behind the failed struggle against drugs , which has paved the country over the last four decades , in a compreh@@ ensible way . &quot;

&quot; the fact check is important at a moment in which it is about to lift up a sm@@ ells , or f@@ ake a f@@ ake . &quot;
&quot; but how is the years after something the first time is dis@@ placed ? content in social media , no matter whether true or un@@ true , ten@@ ds to continue to exist . &quot;
take this photo of a terrible accident in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( DR Congo ) .
&quot; since its first release , it became mis@@ lead @-@ wise to be@@ ad trag@@ e@@ dies that actually have taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this false p@@ airing of picture and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First D@@ raft News - denied not the fact that there are abundant reporting of events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
but it raises questions about our desire for pictures to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
&quot; in 2010 , a tank @-@ cars under@@ carriage the place S@@ ange on the east of the DR Congo , ki@@ pp@@ te and explo@@ ded by 230 people . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war in Africa , the second largest country has been negl@@ ected and thus managed . the streets in the region were turned into dangerous paths full of stroke , which were difficult to sail . &quot;
&quot; typically , the char@@ ms fell to the victim of the tank . &quot;
&quot; h @-@ representative described a fire ball , the doz@@ ens houses covered , including a cinema in the vicinity , that was full of people who showed the football world championship . &quot;
houses are scattered and shortened corp@@ ses in the streets .
many people were bur@@ nt to the ignor@@ ant .
&quot; a picture with the title &quot; &quot; This is Nigeria &quot; . &quot; by Im@@ g@@ ur @-@ users My@@ s@@ tical Mon@@ key , 12 January 04 Multiple photos of the incident form the gray scenes of this day . &quot;
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of fo@@ al body that are mounted on the ground while people are watching them .
but here the story does not find its end .
&quot; over the years the same photo has been recorded several times on social media , blogs and other platforms , but not related to the trag@@ e@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what was not happening in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 B@@ ok@@ o Har@@ am the B@@ ok@@ o Har@@ am the ent@@ leg@@ alized Nig@@ eri@@ an villages B@@ aga and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
eye witnesses reported dr@@ as@@ tically by atro@@ cities in front of which they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and cor@@ rupted in streets and prayers .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were mass@@ aging . &quot;
&quot; the numbers could not be confirmed , but no one was back to count corp@@ ses , &quot; said a resident to Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; many were dis@@ si@@ zing , shot or burned . &quot;
only with satellite channels the follow @-@ up could be formed .
&quot; the reason for the attack was also un@@ solved , but the army @-@ based in B@@ aga was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt of the B@@ ok@@ o Har@@ am , country to win ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot;
and here the image of the Democratic Republic of the Congo were again visible when it was evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack was presented :
this is Nigeria .
&quot; a mass@@ ac@@ re for 2,000 people took place two days after Paris . &quot;
you are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; in fact , this ab@@ usive use of the image from the Democratic Republic of Congo has only been documented in a number of failure . Africa Check has documented the orders of Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in all of these cases , the image was presented as a cover for mass@@ acres . &quot;
&quot; another step further bringing personal comments such as this example , the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to deliver arguments . &quot;
the image from S@@ ange also joined in conjunction with the de@@ adly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a flash message , published by the United Nations , those who were able to flee , r@@ ape , and a number of dead , some through comb@@ us@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; while others reported by the violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Post@@ s such as the following on which these descriptions were related to photos from the DR Congo : &quot;
&quot; this picture comes from an Saudi @-@ Arabic , the 2012 fal@@ seh@@ ood , the President of My@@ an@@ mar@@ s thri@@ lls , mon@@ ks and politicians would have participated in the ass@@ ass@@ ination of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . additionally , she had used the image from the DR Congo to use this information . &quot;
&quot; the original fee , which was last accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be called here . &quot;
&quot; other news organisations , the AF@@ P as their source , were also sus@@ cep@@ tible to consider this statement , but had not brought the image from the DR Congo . &quot;
the global range of false information
traces of this false check@@ ups range up to the years 2011 and 2012 and actually come back from all over the world .
&quot; using a &quot; &quot; set picture search &quot; &quot; you can see how far more information can cross borders . &quot;
a revers@@ ed picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has been found under 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( stand of 3 May 2017 ) 344 images found the same image from the DR Congo very similar .
&quot; they come from a mis@@ ch@@ mas@@ ch private pages , platforms social media and community and national publications and are in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek , Greek and Portuguese . &quot;
some have passed false reports that have tried other attempts to de@@ press@@ ants .
&quot; we have examples of the ab@@ usive use and associated with the respective countries , based on which page they were published . therefore , we want to display the range evident than through the language alone . &quot;
&quot; from the listed countries listed below ( which in some cases have also been connected with one another ) , several examples were used for ab@@ usive use . &quot;
here are some cases that are now fully divided ( on the map in Orange ) :
map : News Fr@@ ames .
examples of the official cou@@ pl@@ ings of the picture from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
&quot; the or@@ an@@ ised countries point out on pages or servers , via the examples of counter@@ f@@ eit@@ ing or fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot;
&quot; the countries in Gra@@ u are examples , which are available according to the metad@@ ata and information that are available via Tin@@ Eye , probably also counter@@ f@@ examples . &quot;
&quot; as a reminder , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) . &quot;
&quot; Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image from the DR Congo has been posted in an online discussion forum ( set itself to Algeria and interested Arab@@ s ) as part of a thread to the &quot; War of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot;

&quot; this article from 2014 to students , who were brought to by the B@@ ok@@ o Har@@ am , published by now , the Catholic close side of An@@ Ã¡@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , has explicitly declared that the picture does not exist by the notes , but it claims that there is a &quot; similar ji@@ hadi@@ st attack &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as the image later in connection with the mass@@ ac@@ re of B@@ ok@@ o Har@@ am , in circulation , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to res@@ ist that there were connections to Nigeria . &quot;
&quot; Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ Ä±@@ y@@ or@@ fer@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ yu@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria bur@@ ns the world sleeps ) . &quot;
&quot; the picture of the DR Congo supplied , provided with this T@@ witter@@ has@@ ht@@ ag , on and redeemed a discussion among Muslims after the mass@@ ac@@ re of B@@ ok@@ o Har@@ am 2015 and the ports on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to achieve that their communities were these events , the mut@@ ist in the name of Islam , a greater attention . &quot;
&quot; United States , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; the image has been clo@@ cked as a cover for the mass@@ ac@@ re of B@@ ok@@ o Har@@ am 2015 ( and more than 9.@@ 300 times ret@@ we@@ et@@ et ) . but the messages , which were connected with it , were up in no religious context . &quot;
&quot; instead , the goal was to pay attention to the relative number of dead and a comparison of media reporting in comparison to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
Vietnam ( Indon@@ esian ) , 2014 . &quot;
&quot; after a message which was alleg@@ edly been written by a &quot; &quot; P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mart@@ os &quot; &quot; over the Nig@@ eri@@ an mass@@ ac@@ re , over@@ thrown the discussion as this here on Vietnam@@ ese and explained it to fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot;
&quot; from the message , in which the picture of the DR Congo has been included , the organization of Clark &apos;s Mission@@ aries and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mart@@ os . &quot;
&quot; there are other confirmed examples of faul@@ ty use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;
&quot; on other accounts , Ag@@ greg@@ ators and pages in the following countries ( on the cap in Gra@@ u ) are also no longer fully trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China . &quot;
( data entries with URLs and tim@@ e- / dat@@ e@@ stamp exist on the web cra@@ w@@ ler and de@@ mar@@ ches them on image files in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
&quot; in all these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original success of 2010 , the image ultimately carries a correct description , but the original application is not available or accessible . &quot;
frames and pictures
there are two strong themes or frames ( ir@@ radiation ) that draw these Post@@ s . the first frame is focused on religion .
&quot; the photo was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the murder of Christians with Muslims or - to defend the Muslims , the murder of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts . &quot;
a second fr@@ aming uses the image to discuss how a African life is evaluated in comparison to a European or French life .
religion to be understood and the value of human life is both important . therefore it is worthwhile to examine how images are used in connection with these efforts .
&quot; however , a deeper question is what happens if readers cannot give these pictures no longer faith . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are many people who have un@@ inten@@ sely affected the water around a tragedy . &quot;
&quot; sug@@ ger@@ ated this mood of the mis@@ - and fal@@ seh@@ ood , that actual atro@@ cities did not come true and narrow it the real Gre@@ ys of what actually happened in the DR Congo , in Nigeria and in Myanmar ? &quot;
the spread of violent images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( here for example ) .
one argument is that the back of images is equivalent to recognize the tragedy . sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims .
&quot; at the same time , the concern is that rap@@ ts@@ ame pictures and audience des@@ ensi@@ tiz@@ ing and give them the ability to emp@@ athy emp@@ athy ( such as this study , the sear@@ ched to help others to help others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there is a lot to debate about violent representations in the news media , the fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news @-@ reporting . &quot;
Tech@@ nolog@@ ist experim@@ ented with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; . you will thoroughly think about the situation where a picture is somewhat more sug@@ ary , which actually can be dis@@ solved by context or completely ab@@ usive manner . &quot;
&quot; however , any examination of false subsidies should also consider how international they can be . &quot;

the &quot; Un@@ transl@@ atable &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages

&quot; a blog with the name Un@@ transl@@ atable ( e.g. un@@ matched ) stri@@ ves to provide language lab@@ ors a selection of words from all over the world , which are difficult or not to translate at all . &quot;
such words are in any language : they express certain situations or feelings that often are very complex or specific .
&quot; some of these infl@@ atable words are already well known ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) , and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ oth@@ esa ) . &quot;
but all resist@@ ers are stu@@ b@@ bor@@ n@@ ly every attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; one word or an expression does not suff@@ ice , why a complete explanation and sometimes a context is required to understand exactly what to do with this one word . &quot;
these unique words have already collected a long time in an online list .
&quot; most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , during the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ transl@@ atable &quot; Steven B@@ ird decided to focus on small languages . &quot;
&quot; in the blog you can find out words from the VAT language of V@@ anu@@ at@@ u , as follows : &quot;
v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Bem@@ bo you for your parents in recognition of how to make you afraid in your younger years .
words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language which are spoken in parts of Brazil as :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The convenience or pur@@ ity that you feel , after you have washed away on cold days in the sun . &quot;
in Bir@@ ds own words from his blog about :
they depri@@ ve other cultures , enth@@ r@@ ash other thr@@ ust length and wake up our new gi@@ vers . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you can influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page , even more of this &quot; un@@ think@@ able &quot; words publish and show how different , valuable and impressive these little languages . &quot;
&quot; Red@@ ner of &quot; Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages &quot; which are highly appreciated by Un@@ transl@@ atable , are invited to upload their favorite words here . &quot;

how Sri Lanka deal with the worst fl@@ ut@@ catastrophe of the decade
the archipelago of Sri Lanka are currently under the worst high @-@ water he@@ ater disaster in this decade .
&quot; triggered by the mon@@ sun , which normally uses at the end of May are caused by strong rain@@ b@@ lows of Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , N@@ il@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya in 15 districts in the south and west of the country over the shore . &quot;
&quot; according to an opinion of the cat@@ astrop@@ hic centre of Sri Lanka , from 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and almost hundreds of people are missing because of the floo@@ ds and mud . &quot;
more than 400 000 people have been affected since the last Friday ( 26 May ) and approximately 100 000 people were brought to a reliable residence .
&quot; the rains left on Saturday ( 27 May ) , and the water distances in some areas walked slowly . &quot;
health and hygiene of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected areas and still un@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the extent of the catastrophe :
hot water in Ta@@ wal@@ ama City with water distances of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am Ame@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et deliver regular updates to the high @-@ water situation .

the Air Force has made five planes for rescue operations and another five will be made for the transport of emergency supplies for those in their floo@@ ded villages .
also various organizations and start ups have been prepared to help .
Facebook pages like Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tim@@ s in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Rel@@ ief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on high @-@ water situations and humanitarian aid .

&quot; last year after the catastrophe of the Tro@@ pen@@ ny Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; &quot; high @-@ water assistance &quot; &quot; button to call users a vehicle to pick up assistance and donations . these were then passed on to the s@@ ri@@ lan@@ cal Red Cross . &quot;
&quot; likewise , they led a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; button , which had more than thousands of requests and 150 successful boat recording actions for a result of high @-@ water and deser@@ ted people . &quot;
&quot; the united efforts of the government and civil population of Sri Lan@@ kas , where multiple social media platforms are fully exploited , bringing residents in need of security and afford assistance . &quot;

&quot; using it . Dam@@ as in January , I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour in and dear friend . &quot;
&quot; I trust her four year old daughter , they familiar to me her children ; she is my rock in the bran@@ dy . &quot;
in one minute we call plots for the rights of women .
in the next scale we are rights for trans@@ forms .
&quot; we are in a sea of sh@@ iel@@ ding and people , some keep the i@@ kon@@ ic image of a woman with head@@ tu@@ ch high , bound up from a American flag , other sk@@ ating par@@ ols against Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; my girlfriend look at me and says : &quot; &quot; these things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Mus@@ lim@@ a ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already taken this conversation .
&quot; people with whom I work or people who have been familiar with me for years - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; that has established itself in their imagination . &quot;
you are mus@@ li@@ ze me .
there are 1,@@ 7 billion Muslims worldwide . &quot;
we do not see all the same .
we practise our religion differently .
&quot; we identify with it to be Muslim , to different species but somehow we are all stuck in the same Muslim drawer . &quot;
&quot; this drawer is designed in our collective imagination such as Muslims , which as I do not fit in there . &quot;
ab@@ dom@@ es are being lim@@ it@@ ated
I am not alone with it alone .
&quot; this is even done to the po@@ et , whose poetry in America is most sold : ru@@ mi . &quot;
which images are one in the meaning if you think about him ?
love ?
peace ?
&quot; as Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din rum@@ i as old as I am now , he was a orthodo@@ x Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; Islam , the Quran and the Prophet Muhammad were unto the day when he died , the center of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; but in the western idea , religion was er@@ ased from Rum@@ is , as well as from the most popular translations of its poetry . &quot;
&quot; this delet@@ es a large part of the history of 1,@@ 7 billion Muslims in this world . &quot;
&quot; another exists in the reproductive pictures of Muslims , the western books have been colonial since centuries . &quot;
this temp@@ ting language is determined by the dark man that one should fear and the exotic woman should save .
the pione@@ ering Palestinian scientists Edward S@@ aid fighters in the 1970s the story behind these pictures .
but these pictures stand still further today .
&quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood will continue to continue . &quot;
&quot; I worked for a thir@@ teen years in the news industry and I have seen how this powerful , faul@@ ty Nar@@ r@@ ative our new@@ fe@@ eds domin@@ ate our new@@ fe@@ eds . &quot;
&quot; this Nar@@ rati@@ os over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed the reality , which in the last three decades nine Muslim women have led their countries , while the United States could not even choose their first feminine presidential candidate . &quot;
&quot; this Nar@@ rati@@ os failed to acknowledge that when French , Muslim women are prevented from being forced to wear in public buildings and to cover Saudi @-@ Arabic , Muslim women through their government to cover their entire body , which are both two sides of the same coin . &quot;
&quot; a powerful group exercises its &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; to the &quot; &quot; other &quot; . &quot; &quot;
this strong sc@@ rati@@ fying Muslim women which lead movements for change .
&quot; it seems that the first Muslim prayers were spoken to the American soil of Afri@@ cans , which were brought together with sla@@ on . &quot;
it delet@@ es the existence of Que@@ er @-@ Muslims .
&quot; this Nar@@ rati@@ os has occupied our collective imagination , so deep and flaw@@ ed , that often Si@@ k@@ h men and children become a goal of tim@@ icro@@ bi@@ ous attacks and ra@@ is@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; due to these stories , we tell and because of the way we tell them is Islam@@ opho@@ bia today not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; others . &quot; &quot;
to the 1.7 billion
in the news industry we do more than just tell stories that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create Nar@@ r@@ ative who help us understand the world .
and my industry is enormous to capture the Nar@@ rati@@ v of the 1,@@ 7 billion . &quot;
and we have failed here to represent seven million Muslims in the highest degree &quot; various &quot; religious group in America .
more than one third of the total population are African people with African Americans .
six of ten American Muslims belong to immigrants from the first generation that come from 77 countries .

four decades ago my immig@@ rated parents came to New York to live their American dream .
&quot; my mother placed their first jewelry design in 5th Avenue and my father worked hard to the sky@@ scrap@@ ers of New York ; sky@@ scrap@@ ers were made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ ker from Banglad@@ esh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Kh@@ an . &quot;
&quot; back then , as Kh@@ an the sky@@ lines of the world were re@@ thought , my parents were un@@ avo@@ idable Muslims and Americans . &quot;
but am I now un@@ wo@@ unds Mus@@ lim@@ a and Americ@@ an@@ erin ?
&quot; sometimes , if I ask people why I don &apos;t say a por@@ k , I say - rather than my Muslim recipes to get out or my handy h@@ ow@@ or@@ an that all Muslims have to wear - &quot; &quot; made of respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
&quot; I j@@ okes , we do not wear all T@@ ash@@ enk@@ or@@ ane with us . &quot;
&quot; we also have to be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; or to be selected almost always for additional security purposes at the airport . &quot;
&quot; hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists , who strive to fight far widespread lie over Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies are produced on the ongoing band of a well @-@ based Islam@@ opho@@ bia with ATM , t@@ ink tanks and experts for Fal@@ se information , which is our already faul@@ ty picture of what a Muslim is , or of which Islam is manipul@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of the way we can tell them , Islam@@ ists in more than just a stran@@ gers , who is the head of the head . &quot;

I would like to explain this .
&quot; I was born as a Mus@@ lim@@ a , but a muscle force was born , when I was four years old , in a pro@@ visional mosque in the basement of a Pres@@ by@@ ter@@ i@@ ic Church in New York . &quot;
&quot; if social sciences Relig@@ ious lives describe , they attack on the following terms : faith , behaviour and affili@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim belief and behavior are perhaps not always visible , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; maybe I would see my girlfriend , my neigh@@ bor in the bran@@ ce that I am Mus@@ lim@@ a , when they could look through the 15 metre concrete and air that could separate our houses . &quot;
she would see the entire ritual with my daughter when I wi@@ ege them into my arms and her the Arabic verses to protect the Quran and the Q@@ ul@@ s are called .
each of them I repeat three times .
&quot; please note that they are protected from evil , the evil one can see and evil one cannot see . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim belief is not always visible , but my Muslim membership is always part of my sh@@ att@@ ens . &quot;

&quot; it is the picture of you that I see in this moment when I close my eyes : Nano , surrounded by their finished and un@@ finished painting the painted Su@@ fi @-@ saint ; and a cor@@ ans with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred thousand chapters that can be almost in@@ valuable . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ lim@@ a means to be the prayers to speak , which she had said to me when I have a bad day . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ lim@@ a has to be in it , as they gave me to relate to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a people , that - over centuries - by a &quot; &quot; imperi@@ al &quot; colonial &quot; &quot; has founded a company with the name honor@@ able British Ost@@ ini@@ dien @-@ Comp@@ anie , has a deep meaning to name God , my only Lord . &quot;

&quot; belonging to this means to grow and hear that men are not w@@ aking , but at the same time to see that my first grandfather is cr@@ ying . &quot;
&quot; nu@@ end@@ rin , while he writes books on modern Islam and about the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir@@ se , we@@ pt N@@ ana Ja@@ an un@@ um@@ wo@@ unds to his family in India , K@@ ash@@ mir , family who was not allowed to close his arms in half a century . &quot;
&quot; affili@@ ation is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians , their families , as with my grandfather , colon@@ ized by colon@@ ists who have shared the Muslim world like at the game risk . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ lim@@ a means to know that over the last two centuries Europeans have become more colonial countries all up to four Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it means to know that the first fly bom@@ b of history was raised in front of a century about a Muslim country . &quot;
&quot; it means to know that at the same time the grandfather of my grand@@ mother , an in@@ vigor@@ ous sub@@ tan of the British empire , of the newspapers of his time as &quot; dangerous &quot; , &quot; since he led the first mosque in England . &quot;
&quot; even before there were planes he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever was and pre@@ ached the radical word of love , peace and social justice . &quot;

&quot; to my Muslim tribe of the 1,@@ 7 billion are deeply rooted in our unforgettable tribe ; our un@@ ques@@ tion@@ able history . &quot;
&quot; it means to remember that four years ago , the most powerful army of the world , with troops , distributed over every continent apart from the Ant@@ arc@@ tic , distributed over every continent , in Iraq have gone to pro@@ liferation up mass destruction , which does not exist . &quot;
it means to know that more than half an millions of Ira@@ q@@ is buried among the di@@ mm@@ ers of the war .
to be an American Mus@@ lim@@ a means to know that the su@@ ic@@ ide rate has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means to know that if a tragedy is searching for the US and the susp@@ ects a Muslim name bears the story four times more than a story with a white attack .
&quot; it means to know that twenty @-@ ten years ago the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , of a fre@@ ak black slaves with the name Bil@@ al was called . &quot;
&quot; it means to know that two hundred years ago an African Islam@@ ist named Bil@@ ali Muhammad acci@@ dentally , and brought into this country . &quot;
it means to name Mal@@ com X to name a American hero .
&quot; it is the warmth , which I feel , when people crowded the airports in order to fight against the Muslim B@@ an . &quot;
it is the hope that I feel when we stand for our dreams and when we say black life .
&quot; a Americans to be a Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ erin , a K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , a p@@ ah@@ ari , a m@@ ah@@ ari , a mus@@ lim@@ a and a journalist of our with multiple b@@ lowing identi@@ ties , but to fail to send them to others . &quot;
&quot; the Nar@@ rati@@ v of the 1,@@ 7 billion presents more possibilities than a mag@@ ician , but is represented in the reduced branches &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; against them . &quot;
&quot; to be a mother to care for my child and to build all Muslim children , prosper@@ ous , knowing that powerful and privileged people are established on this branch of structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in the Muslim registr@@ ars , which began with President Bush and expanded under President Obama . &quot;
it consists in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists in the immig@@ rant who takes a five years old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
&quot; it exists in a country that covers its borders against people from just the countries , which are bom@@ bed . &quot;
&quot; it is a false and neb@@ ul@@ ous &quot; No @-@ Fly list , &quot; which is largely Arab@@ s and Muslims into the visor . &quot;
they are the wars that we lead and the bom@@ bs that we cast to Muslim countries .
&quot; because of the stories we tell and due to those who we cannot tell , we are today here . &quot;
&quot; in a study with the title of Asc@@ ent of Man , scientists of the North@@ western University participants showed an scientifically proven picture and are able to judge groups on a scale from 1 to 100 regarding evolution . &quot;
Muslims got the lowest score .
the Con@@ vers@@ ations that we must lead
&quot; we are too deeply dar@@ ken to reveal the Muslim , or the &quot; others &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we have decades to recognize the roots of our fears , and the faul@@ ty and dangerous expression prints , which we owe in our news item . &quot;
&quot; at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry , which tried to capture our often with b@@ lowing identi@@ ties and forgotten history . &quot;
&quot; the Pod@@ cast lake , S@@ ay consists of Bu@@ zz@@ es ; the Pod@@ cast # Good@@ mus@@ lim@@ elight ; the vir@@ al Vide@@ os@@ erie , Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ sters Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative , increasingly Muslim authors to print and Ms Mar@@ vel , the Pak@@ ist@@ an , American super@@ hero@@ ine - all this makes me hope . &quot;

&quot; but I am worried because of this difficult global scale , where we are . &quot;
and this moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion .
&quot; there is one reason for that conspir@@ ators of conspir@@ ators , which existed in the dark corners of the Internet , now the White House lead . &quot;
they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims to others .
&quot; there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally , by creating the &quot; others &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a few years ago she had not given them , now they master major areas in Syria and Iraq . &quot;
&quot; I am worried about the realities and history , which I was not aware of as I was as old now , as it is my daughter now , but who now have made me an un@@ avo@@ idable mus@@ li@@ me today . &quot;
things I have left here like a bread@@ cru@@ de track in my speech .
&quot; things that might aw@@ aken memories , because in all the inter@@ cases that make our humanity , like a story , where anyone is made to a &quot; other &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; just now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , Con@@ vers@@ ations will take place within the 8th annual conference to Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; more than a hundred academ@@ ics speak about our problems with the &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; structural racism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot;
but these are not terms with which we usually throw in our schools to us or which we read in our newspapers .

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
&quot; why do I tell this here at this TE@@ D@@ x talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where he has shown Edward S@@ aid , the man who are led to us , how wars are led and people through the work of the &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; in public performance , four decades even scientist of the Stan@@ ford . &quot;
&quot; we do not have to ask ourselves un@@ convenient questions according to the role of it , consciously and un@@ aware of the &quot; others &quot; , &quot; as it is my girlfriend and I in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because that we have no president , in which we are already broken countries and to other made &quot; people bom@@ bed , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1,@@ 7 billion . &quot;
it starts here with all of us .

&quot; for Steven B@@ ird and Rob@@ yn Perry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) is the nar@@ ration of stories in their original language a possible response . &quot;

&quot; the mass ext@@ inction of the languages of the world can be avoided when we accept cities , the diversity assume - safe spaces where inhabitants are not forgotten , who they are to be associated . &quot;
&quot; listen often so often is to understand , &quot; for purposes , these events instead , instead they hear , to appreciate , to feel . &quot;
in this format stor@@ yt@@ eller tell their story first in their own language and translate them in English .
&quot; even if the participants are no professional stor@@ yt@@ ellers , they perform their devot@@ ion and their representation that the audience can ask for it . &quot;
they may call laughter and emotions than the language is no longer a barrier .
&quot; the following video shows for example a traditional history of Burk@@ ina Fas@@ o , which is told in the language of D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou will also take the opportunity to explain to their land typical customs of copper . &quot;
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the F@@ abel from the rab@@ bit and the P@@ avian in the language Sh@@ ona from Zim@@ babwe :
&quot; after he declared the meaning of his f@@ fork , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked : &quot; &quot; how is it to be speaking to an audience that doesn &apos;t share your language ? &quot; with a broad gr@@ in@@ sen , he shares his feeling of inclusi@@ veness : &quot;
you have heard !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
&quot; so far the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling took place in three cities , and the organizers hope to expand this . all who inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS in order to organize their own stor@@ yt@@ ale performances . &quot;
Puerto Rico calls for the US re@@ mun@@ eration of the sover@@ eign debt
&quot; with the aim of a new exam in the public debt of Puerto Rico , participating in 72 million US dollars , participating in the capital of the capital , the government of the capital , and went up to the Plaza de Col@@ Ã³n in the old town of San Ju@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; declared it by the Group &quot; Fr@@ ente Ci@@ ud@@ ad@@ ano p@@ or la Audit@@ or@@ Ã­a de la D@@ eu@@ da &quot; &quot; ( citizen &apos;s front for the neur@@ anders of debts ) and the Ã@@ kom@@ en@@ ian Church of Puerto Ri@@ cos . &quot;
the inter@@ c@@ ession of the new debts have also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
&quot; the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos calls for the politicians , benches and government authorities , which are responsible for debts to take responsibility for their corrupt . &quot;
&quot; we call for financial examination and a guideline committee without personal interests in public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions according to the employment of the economy . &quot;
we will pres@@ et and supp@@ ressed .
&quot; the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos refused to pay a fault , which is not their . &quot;
we will not choose between education and health .
our re@@ tired will not find himself with sin@@ ful pension payments .
we demand immediate measures .
the island - not integrated in the state of the United States - suffer from severe financial crisis .
&quot; therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Center for New Economy , &quot; a ruling non @-@ profit organization without party membership with focus on the socio @-@ economic development , a law to state responsibility , as an alternative to existing state control . &quot;
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ri@@ cos requires a wide restructuring of state infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; imposed from the outside actions without the participation and conviction of the citizens are going to be rejected by the people . &quot;
the demonstration carried the name &quot; night watch for light and truth . &quot;

&quot; the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web@@ development Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing over a year . &quot;
but he is not forgotten .
&quot; more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives are continuing the campaign for his freedom and remember the contributions that he made for an open network . &quot;
&quot; at this year &apos;s re : Publi@@ ca , the annual conference on digital culture that is organized in Berlin , devoted to an event of # Free@@ Bass@@ el @-@ Camp@@ a@@ ign . &quot;
&quot; MÃ©@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the UK Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ Ã¼h@@ ling , Managing Director of the Book C@@ ost of Freedom : a Coll@@ ective Book ( The cost of freedom : a collective re@@ research ) . &quot;
&quot; the book that was published last year and is available here license @-@ free , contains a number of performances that deal with free culture in the face of oppression . &quot;
it is a hom@@ age to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it is :
&quot; this book would like to discuss how movements are built for free knowledge , and what the real costs are connected with which this is connected . &quot;
&quot; activists , artists , designers , designers , researchers and authors who have been involved in the movements for Fre@@ ies knowledge , have been working on page to look over the fo@@ g that our new@@ fe@@ eds and to create some sense from our different experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to liber@@ ate Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteers , who has in@@ ated in Syria since 15 March 2012 . &quot;
his name was stolen from the directory of the A@@ dra @-@ Pen@@ al directory in which he sat on 3 October 2015 .
we have no information on its current state or residence .
&quot; the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title of collective re@@ membran@@ ce gives his friends and his family a voice that will push for his release , and want to know him back in his normal life and freedom . &quot;
&quot; see how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us begin to think about their own fate , deeds and decisions . &quot;
why are we here today ?
what have we decided ?
what do we have given up in this process of time @-@ wise beliefs ?
the web@@ development for open source and digital activ@@ ist has been in the cu@@ sto@@ ic government authorities since March 2012 .
&quot; in October 2015 Bass@@ el was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution , transferred to an un@@ familiar place . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and Ombud@@ sper@@ son N@@ oura G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; military police &quot; Bass@@ el reported on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military judgment of his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
&quot; G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by persons on 12 November 2015 , who presented himself as insi@@ der Assad government and put them aware of an alleg@@ ed death part against her husband . &quot;
but his residence location and condition remain unknown .
&quot; a pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively participating in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and wikipe@@ dia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role to expand access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , Tech@@ n@@ ologist and at the moment the leader of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project , the Bass@@ el founded , writes on the sides 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
&quot; perhaps , none of the bases of cultural prototyp@@ es are the work that he began to re@@ construct with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras . &quot;
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , the way@@ marks of numerous civi@@ liz@@ ations and here merge Greek @-@ ro@@ man architecture types with hi@@ esi@@ ous traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; b@@ aked at that time , Bass@@ el could not know that ten years after having started with this work , the IS would be everything that would not only em@@ bodies the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world . &quot;
&quot; this effort into the digital archae@@ ology and the conservation has created a time , which will be in@@ valuable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future of in@@ valuable importance . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , Bass@@ el could not yet complete this project yet . &quot;
&quot; N@@ oura G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband , his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison : &quot;
&quot; I spent my whole life spent , of freedom to dream and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her . &quot;
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
&quot; Bass@@ el brought me English , even when he was in cu@@ sto@@ dy . &quot;
I learned to read and speak English well .
&quot; he always has his knowledge shared with everyone who asked . he has taught other inflation , English to read and speak . &quot;
Bass@@ el has opened my gate to the technology . he taught me to use computers as well as smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
&quot; he has also brought other cons@@ ented as they use computers , at least theoretically , without having indeed thought one in their hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of waiting ( waiting ) , a pro@@ sab@@ oth that she wrote in cu@@ sto@@ dy in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in cu@@ sto@@ dy . &quot;
Bass@@ el and N@@ oura worked together on the book for a year .
they cast the lyrics to him when she visited him and he over@@ sat them out of the Arabian horse .
the book is available free of charge .
accounting for Yous@@ sef Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to public domain .
here an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It happens &quot; :
it happens during each visit to
&quot; that I vers@@ y in the world of your charming eyes , &quot;
&quot; that I lose the occupation at the moment in which we embrace ourselves , &quot;
that any of the dangers doesn &apos;t matter
&quot; each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ackl@@ es and guar@@ dians &quot;
I forget the thr@@ ong of the prison

I quickly return to my lon@@ eliness .

I survive myself that I will return soon ...

Bas@@ le History is not unique in Syria .
&quot; since the start of the protests 2011 against the regime Bas@@ har al @-@ Ass@@ ads , according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) have disappeared more than 6@@ 5,000 people . &quot;
those who were arrested or under non @-@ violence through the regime were tor@@ tured or even executed .
until 2016 since 2011 the international human rights organisation Am@@ nest@@ y International at least 17.@@ 723 Sy@@ rer in prison .
the stories of many other people will remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for 2012 release of Bass@@ el .
we repeat today our demand in hope that we have to do this for the last time .
Moz@@ ambi@@ que : because of corruption condemned the director to Haf@@ brief@@ ing again on previous post .
&quot; Moz@@ ambi@@ os re@@ acted with wrath on a corro@@ sion , where a government member returned after half of his sentence after half of his sentence , on which corruption was committed . &quot;
&quot; this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , which was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in 2010 with four other def@@ endants ( approx . 800 000 Euro ) to 22 years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; the money amm@@ ates from public funds from the airports of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , whose advice Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 Board of Directors . &quot;
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 because of good leadership and immediately called his re @-@ setting into the company what happened on April 19 then .
&quot; in accordance with a statement of the General Public Prosec@@ ut@@ or of the Republic , who accepts the application for Cam@@ ba@@ za , there would be no obstacles to relate back to his old post since the company had no disciplines after his trial . &quot;
&quot; however , many local residents are not good . &quot;
&quot; the Centre for Public integrity ( Centro de Int@@ egri@@ da@@ de P@@ Ãº@@ bli@@ ca , briefly C@@ IP ) , an local institution that advoc@@ ates for public transparency , condemned in an interview with the Deutsche Welle to launch the director again : &quot;
&quot; represents a bac@@ kl@@ ash in the fight against corruption , and clear@@ er the lack of transparency and is even a back@@ step with regard to the efforts of our legal system , such as C@@ IP . &quot;
what we take note is that the company should have a discipl@@ in@@ arity against the refu@@ ge would have to be guided .
&quot; however , the company does seem to take no appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ Ã­@@ dio VA@@ Z , a significant voice in the Moz@@ ambi@@ que social media , re@@ jects this behavior also and considers the case as &quot; res@@ ist &quot; : &quot;
&quot; when Cam@@ ba@@ za a competent type would be , he would be consultant after he was sentenced to a sentence and who had half who had dinner . &quot;
&quot; he could keep paid presentations and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and elaborate his image . &quot;
&quot; but since he is in@@ competent , he has entered into the company re@@ integrated into the company that he helped to add damage . &quot;
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za will be paid for his silence .
contra@@ dic@@ tory !
&quot; Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mos@@ ambi@@ kaner and Student of Political Sciences in Brazil says , the director no mor@@ als : &quot;
Cam@@ ba@@ za is rewarded by the state because he bes@@ ieg@@ ed him I cannot believe that someone won someone in such a way that the state has already made so massive .
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za lacks the mor@@ als and serve the state , * he had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead it has only served by itself on the state . &quot;
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as hand@@ ele had become tired money source and the state itself this man has become tired who was pre@@ loaded and finally sentenced to a long sentence .
&quot; honestly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded . &quot;
&quot; Franc@@ ey Ze@@ Ãº@@ te pre@@ fers to remember the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , remember@@ ing that a th@@ ief in prison belongs to : &quot;
&quot; Di@@ si@@ eves belong to the prison Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el will not only be remembered as the first independent president , but also as a sharp president , and - by said - proph@@ etic speakers . &quot;
&quot; one of his most famous oral representations was , as he energ@@ ically confirmed that &quot; an ambitious human being is capable of being able to sell his own individual interest , to sell his own individual interest . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that which is not so . he changes the tac@@ tic , but he does not change his ambitions . &quot;
an ambitious human being is criminal at the same time . &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also read@@ able :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment ; he sat down 10 years and came free .

Facebook blocked the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and c@@ ens@@ ored many users on inj@@ ustice
the bur@@ mes@@ an word &quot; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &quot; means K@@ ich@@ er@@ erb@@ se or sp@@ age .
photo of San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Wikipedia Commons , Creative Commons Attri@@ bution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ ported &quot;
&quot; according to data from Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their post from the net , because it enth@@ used the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; although the origin of the word still is discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of the indigenous origins or generally used as an Ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Facebook c@@ ens@@ ert the word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; or the word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; or a part of a initiative to address the widespread problem of the H@@ ass@@ Language in Burma in the social network . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alistic movements has given the word an extremely low @-@ value creation . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it is a word that most commonly used by Ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as har@@ ass@@ ed against Muslims , which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in an effort to fight H@@ ass@@ adors in Myanmar , the company has c@@ ens@@ ored a lot of sensu@@ al content on its platform . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ ar &apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; may usually be associated with racism , but the word itself does not call itself automatically . &quot;
&quot; the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that Post@@ s , in which they have discussed the use of the word or expressed doubt for their use . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , there are several bur@@ ners words with underlying different mean@@ ings that have the same letter as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , chair on Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar ht@@ a@@ ing &apos; written what the same letters contains , as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &apos; ( Cambo@@ dia ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the Fac@@ ebook us@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ at declared the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of one of my friends became now er@@ ased because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; however , he asked his friends on spiritual nature , whether she kis@@ sed his back pain , as he made his back pain . &quot;
&quot; the sentence ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the Fr@@ age@@ word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resem@@ bles the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
&quot; Z@@ in Win is the opinion that they will reduce the pron@@ unci@@ ation of radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook can be analytical and spread all the Post@@ s that circul@@ ate in sus@@ pic@@ ion . &quot;
Facebook delet@@ es the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it fil@@ tered the word automatically .
the automatic will not understand what you write on Fac@@ t@@ ook .
what it should do instead is to analyse the post carefully and check it by checking the next words .
&quot; for example &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the good is that this tri@@ ck@@ ly nation@@ alists spread , the hate language , a fairly good lesson . &quot;
now it is time to circum@@ cis@@ ion its nation@@ alism .
&quot; while the action may be a strong signal to all , the hate language may not stop the efficiency of this strategy for a long time . &quot;
&quot; the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proved that the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of keywords often become a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks simply will begin to use a new word or an alternative sp@@ elling of the c@@ ens@@ ored word to express their views . &quot;
&quot; the author of A@@ ung Ka@@ at described , such as Facebook , began to delete his post@@ ings as he wanted to tell his friends , that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is banned from the social network : &quot;
&quot; when I was aware of this new directive from Facebook , I made a post to share my Facebook friends that the word is locked . &quot;
&quot; Iron@@ ically my post from Facebook was removed and me , the Li@@ ken , posts and parts of content for 24 hours , because the post &quot; Facebook Community standards did not meet . &quot;
Facebook has a variety of Post@@ s from people who do not have any negative intentions or simply try to show their opinions against the har@@ ass@@ ing radi@@ alists .
&quot; Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed , who has nothing to do with hate language : &quot;
post without hate speech from fac@@ ebook .
&quot; in the post , the author divided his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad . &quot;
&quot; Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have more to do before the start of the initiative , for example the bur@@ ners internet community to ask for advice : &quot;
&quot; Facebook may have a prosper@@ ous intention to reduce racism in Burma through their platform , but this does not work . &quot;
such words to win will only bring more hat@@ red within the various communities .
&quot; in addition , it seems as if they have started this without a local context or technical support and so words like &quot; &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; inheritance curr@@ y &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even when they have found out that they have made mistakes , they tried not to correct the fal@@ seh@@ ood of the Post@@ s . &quot;
&quot; if they had only had more respect for the 15 million benefits , which would describe them a great turnover , would be great . &quot;
fact@@ oring automatic c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship has provided for a lot of sp@@ out among users .
&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users are now aware of Facebook funny and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of H@@ ass@@ Language , to see whether their postal address will be taken from the net . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook @-@ Post@@ s , which were not yet removed . &quot;
used with permission .
the Bur@@ mes@@ an Text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair and watch pe@@ sen@@ curr@@ y and watch an Indian film .
&quot; only to try out whether Facebook contains the post , which contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;

&quot; in the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists , the social networks have used to bro@@ aden their voices and their influence . &quot;
&quot; among other things , the violence in the communities in Myanmar are meant to initiate violence in Myanmar , especially in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have been forced to escape . &quot;
&quot; Facebook has been critic@@ ised for his failure , which cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed and cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed on his bur@@ mes@@ an pages under control . &quot;
&quot; but rather than simply the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; to delicate , it would have been better running in context than on code concentrated initiatives and learned from them . &quot;
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is an end to the children &apos;s marriage
a wedding ring in the sand .

the children &apos;s marriage is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament adopted unanim@@ ously a law on 9 June 2017 , which is supposed to offer this practice so that the heat @-@ down age is now at 18 . &quot;
&quot; before this change of the Eh@@ eg@@ es@@ etz@@ es held some members un@@ du@@ ist and Muslim religious denom@@ inations , the leader of the inter@@ religious organization ( IR@@ O ) , a group , the representatives of the different religious organization ( IR@@ O ) , a group , the representatives of the different religious groups ( IR@@ O ) , a group , the representatives of the different religious groups ( IR@@ O ) , the state of the religious groups of the country gathered that the state is not inter@@ ming@@ le , since that , age , not the maturity . &quot;
&quot; this occurred regardless of the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago a contract partner of the UN @-@ Kinder@@ Convention is , the minority interests , each person under the age of 18 . &quot;
&quot; statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children , who were already married in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago 2,@@ 8 percent , and with 18 were 8,@@ 1 percent . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 the statistical central office of the country , that from 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys under 19 were married . &quot;
&quot; online peti@@ tions and social media movements , stri@@ ves to create laws for children &apos;s home , followed in the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring this outcome . &quot;
&quot; nonetheless , not everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; for example , a Hind@@ u leader for example had no concerns to say the critics of the children &apos;s marriage , they should condemn to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition was actually un@@ complicated thing for tensions in this actually un@@ complicated thing , and at some point they came to agree whether the opposition would agree with the law . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of 2017 , the legislative draft was decided against the children &apos;s marriage - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent that could reveal himself in the representative house , where a simple majority would make him a law . &quot;
now only the President of the country must agree with the law .
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators gave on Facebook a status update to re @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ ag@@ ram again :
&quot; Mr Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the legislative draft against the children &apos;s trip was decided in the Repres@@ ent@@ atives of 35 voices , and no one against it . &quot;
&quot; after that he was decided before the Senate , the draft can now become a law . &quot;
the majority of the social media users were enth@@ r@@ alled because the laws of the children were finally changed .
&quot; Facebook @-@ member Lo@@ vel@@ l Francis , who studied at the Department of Education , said : &quot;
&quot; it has too much time and unnecessary Ger@@ ede , which has lost the nucle@@ us of the matter , but do you know what ? the children &apos;s marriage is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago now , and this is almost every price . &quot;
&quot; during A@@ bel Jackson of my opinion , it was definitely long enough to start the practice , Lara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was finally happy that the day was finally arrived : &quot;
&quot; public Status Update on Facebook by Lara Qu@@ entr@@ en@@ - Thomas , which states : , , Excellent news ! &quot;
the Eh@@ eg@@ es@@ etz was decided .
&quot; minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , who listened to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WIN@@ AD ) , a civil society group who spoke quite openly about how important the adoption of the law be , commented : &quot;
the hei@@ r@@ ats@@ able age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the religious belonging to 18 years .
&quot; the draft to change the former network was adopted today , on 9 June 2017 , decided . &quot;
there are 41 members in the representative service and there were 35 members in the vote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all parliament@@ arians who were opposed to have voted for the law . &quot;
children &apos;s before is no longer allowed in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long battle ( ... ) # child@@ mar@@ ri@@ age@@ able .
many thanks to all activists that have touched him .
congratulations .

&quot; but a possible hook arrives in the shape of Sat Mah@@ ar@@ aja , therefore , the Secretary General of the San@@ at@@ an Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hind@@ u organization of the country . &quot;
&quot; in front of months Mah@@ ar@@ aj had proclaimed his intention to take judicial steps , the law should be adopted , and he seems to rede@@ em his promises . &quot;
&quot; during the general prosec@@ ut@@ or Paris Al R@@ awi , a constitu@@ ent of the law , said , it is quite legal , if Mah@@ ar@@ aja wants to go against the law , most of the social media users , one would lead the debate on the subject differently . &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ rell suggested :
&quot; dear Sat , if we , instead of discussing the discussion in general , in a way that we may take instead of the problem that we may take instead of great , mis@@ diagnosed men who would possibly be beneficial to them , would you then be ready to continue the discussion ? &quot;
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
&quot; but whether it comes to an judicial procedure against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however there are still places in the world where children &apos;s before in different gra@@ dations are legal or furthermore the norm is , although there are laws which they say . &quot;

the mir@@ rors of websites can see Turkish users once again Wikipedia content
&quot; the English @-@ speaking Wikipedia page was presented on 18 January 2012 , oppos@@ ing to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright laws in the United States , internationally crazy . &quot;
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
&quot; for more than one month Turkey , Turkey is the popular and on the crow@@ ds@@ ourcing principle based cy@@ clo@@ pe@@ dia . &quot;
&quot; day for day is more evident , how important the platform for users is to find helpful and reliable information . &quot;
both students and fans and fans of TV series are against the blocking .
&quot; although many techniques sealed internet users are used to use det@@ ecting tools for blocked websites ( a present article from the New York Times reported that Turkey has the third largest VPN preferences in the world ) , most of the ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category . &quot;
&quot; although Turkey have been sign@@ alled since 2008 article by Wikipedia , as recently published in a published report by the Berk@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University since 2007 , after the Internet Law ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted . &quot;
&quot; in China , Turkey is the most famous country in the world , when it comes to the massive c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; while the platform remains closed , there are several Mir@@ ror@@ pages ( pages that reflect the contents of Wikipedia and frequently updated ) . &quot;
&quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform was supported by all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centralized pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( so computer desktop connections ) , which is not supported on the system of domain names and thus a complete c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship . &quot;
the content is not available in spite of legal prohibition .
in a blo@@ g@@ post about IP@@ FS about his efforts :
&quot; after we have heard the news ( about the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we put everything at snap@@ shots of Wikipedia on the IP@@ FS platform . this is the opportunity to read the content on de@@ centralized and divided manner . &quot;
&quot; this can help the users to view at least all Wikipedia content , even if they can &apos;t reach the website www.@@ wikipedia.org yourself . &quot;
&quot; IP@@ FS was also provided that this step was performed independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is merely a screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website . &quot;
&quot; however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to handle the sperm . &quot;
&quot; Cris@@ tian Con@@ sol@@ i from Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Italy has a Mir@@ ror@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project , an open source project that everyone can use similar mir@@ rors , if in the respective country Wikipedia is locked . &quot;
Con@@ sol@@ i reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ir@@ i - Global Vo@@ ices Member as well as staff at Mozilla in the Pan@@ ig@@ ir@@ i &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; pod@@ cast :
&quot; it is not a complete copy of a proxy address , a Mir@@ ror . &quot;
&quot; one acc@@ esses another URL that is not the original one , which you see then is by Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; essentially , the server guides the request to the right Wikipedia page , so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia themselves then when they are locked in Turkey . &quot;
for this is carried out by a server that is not in Turkey .

&quot; Sag@@ itt@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos that he looked around him , never satisfied . they were bl@@ ur@@ red with bad positioning and balanced colors . &quot;
the motiv@@ ates him to wear a camera with himself and try to walk the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
&quot; today , at the age of 28 years , Sag@@ ar , stri@@ ves to bring Nep@@ ar to the international stage . &quot;
&quot; and his homeland location right next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offering him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that direct the attention to Nep@@ als wildlife . &quot;
he described on Facebook and how to help him this first class position in his work :
&quot; I live at the edge of the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could it be better for a passionate wild photographer ! &quot;
&quot; I just rested at home when I suddenly called Navar@@ re ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan Gai@@ da Lodge ) . he had a call from my Father , that at the shore of the Rap@@ ti river would be a Leopard . &quot;
the river dam@@ m is just a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I burned with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
&quot; my father had observed him and showed me the place on the other river , where the Leopard was and I immediately started to cr@@ ashing pictures ! ! &quot;
&quot; Sag@@ itt@@ ar seeks co @-@ operation with the authorities to obtain worldwide recognition for Nep@@ al@@ ness and would like to deep@@ en understanding the understanding that wild animals are not so terrible , as they look like . &quot;
&quot; and he should know it , for he rose tig@@ ers already from face to face towards : &quot;
a tiger can not distur@@ b himself from the opinion of the sheep ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
&quot; also I was at home because of the darkness on the way home , when suddenly the king of the bow was made . he immediately re@@ lies , and he died through the S@@ al trees ! ! &quot;
&quot; to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar the logo &quot; I click for &quot; &quot; ( lit . : I click on environmental protection ) to his photos . &quot;
&quot; however , his passion for the promotion of N@@ ept@@ ance and wild animals is not always easy . &quot;
&quot; he wa@@ ited 22 days long , and usually lived in a tent to make photograph@@ ing in Bar@@ dia &apos;s National Park recordings from Ot@@ tern . up to 12 days it lasted until he could photograph a tiger and live six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live close to the tourist accommodations . &quot;

&quot; this article was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ zed and was originally published on Video Volunte@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community organization from India . &quot;
an updated version was published here as part of a content sharing Convention .
&quot; in many parts of India , women avoid the greatest care to speak the name of their hus@@ bands or even of older men in the family . &quot;
&quot; instead they use a pron@@ oun or say &quot; &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mah@@ ar@@ as@@ ht@@ ra and Ut@@ t@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h give women to respect that they should respect the norm due to the social pressure to the husband , as well as the fear of the consequences they should ab@@ ide by the norm . &quot;
&quot; last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was condemned from the Indian state O@@ dish@@ a by a shepherd , and viol@@ ate from her family and the village community after they had raised a raised relatives with names . &quot;
&quot; the tradition of their wives also fails to call on behalf , is also widespread among men . however , they have far less serious instructions to fear when at all , they should not get rid of this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mah@@ ar@@ as@@ ht@@ ra , nine women , including healthcare and house@@ wives , a unique club , and thus became quick to the main pl@@ aque theme of the city . &quot;
&quot; it is a place just for them , where they can discuss and discuss the enemies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; as one of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states , it is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the Community Video Volunte@@ ers and supports the degra@@ dation of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was has been working with the aid of practices for seven years with the help of their vide@@ am@@ era , such as children &apos;s hei@@ rs up to the exile of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected persons , and guides these clubs . &quot;
she reports about how these clubs have created a safe place for this women and they have made them at the same time to compens@@ ate for change in the change of change .
&quot; the first video , the Roh@@ ini showed in their discussion , acted by women who do not name their hus@@ bands . &quot;
she decided on this subject because she wanted to open the conversation about Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem which can easily identify the women .
&quot; the name of her hus@@ bands , not to speak out , is a Br@@ auch who maintained them all the char@@ ms and never ques@@ tioned . &quot;
raw means :
this tradition tes@@ tified that a woman was respected her husband and wishes him a long life .
&quot; a woman who does not hold this is considered as depos@@ iting , as a woman without mor@@ als . &quot;
tradition is so deeply rooted that we never thought about this discussion .
&quot; at the beginning , Roh@@ ini wanted their husband to have never seen at the name at home , as it runs at home . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion of her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini told :
&quot; my mother @-@ in @-@ in @-@ law , and my husband wei@@ gh long , after the video was at the end . &quot;
&quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said , I will call him from now on his name . &quot;
with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage in Roh@@ ini started its first discussion .
&quot; many women had heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; &quot; never before . some believed that there is a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in Ut@@ t@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h . &quot;
after the video proj@@ ections the women attemp@@ ted to bring discussion with an exercise .
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different emotions - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on . &quot;
&quot; then they asked all , &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us how they want , does that they do not respect us ? &quot;
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when she brought forth the name of her husband in Mah@@ ar@@ as@@ ht@@ ra about the Bre@@ aks of a centuries @-@ old tradition , in the married women of her husband . &quot;
Roh@@ ini told :
&quot; a woman was so shy that they fell during the whole exercise , and another chose to turn all the built @-@ in fru@@ stration against him and his family by leaving it . &quot;
the expression of their faces was ek@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; still in ad@@ ren@@ al exchange about it , with an ancient bread also broken to have decided that they would actually try home to name their hus@@ bands with the name . &quot;
and they kept her word .
in the next few days Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports .
the husband called a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put in his head : his wife could not stop his name .
another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family .
&quot; when her mother @-@ in @-@ law she died , she got fear and said that there was a mistake . &quot;
&quot; a different woman said , &quot; Roh@@ ini said , I sol@@ le it . &quot;
a husband of a participant in was less understanding and the situation of art@@ ete in force .
&quot; Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as the van@@ ity of the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red point on the foreh@@ ead , which shows the husband &apos;s husband : &quot;
why do women need to show that they are married ?
&quot; I said to my husband , that I would bear the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red spot if he also worked . &quot;
&quot; he laugh@@ ed only and I listened to them to bear him . &quot;
&quot; the other women did not come completely with it , but mean that they are now in a better position to choose even to take him in some days . &quot;
&quot; for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we take a trip on any discussion . &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; I do not want to make sure the women make , who could hear what I could hear . &quot;
&quot; in the past few months , they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes ; they d@@ anced and s@@ our@@ ned about things that they had never done before . &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; I have been working on these problems for so many years , and yet I have been doing about some things , for example like our identi@@ ties to our hus@@ bands , never seem to be honest . &quot;
&quot; it feels great to say certain things loud , no matter how small they occur . &quot;
in a discussion we talked about the concept of honour and how it is connected to clothing .
some women in the group have carried only Sar@@ is since their home .
&quot; for most it &apos;s the okay , but some wanted a sal@@ ine Kur@@ ta , a wide inhi@@ bit about a p@@ ants ; they do not have dre@@ amed . &quot;
&quot; after a lot of dispute and discussion about the advantages of their own han@@ ger choice , mor@@ als connected to the Sar@@ is and much more , decoration , Roh@@ ini their own pair Kur@@ t@@ as ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) in a discussion , so that women they could wear . &quot;
&quot; next , they now decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is certain that they will be able to create it . &quot;
&quot; on the question , whether in the five months have changed something in the five months since their first discussion , Roh@@ ini confirmed that things are slowly coming into rolls : &quot;
we have only made small steps so far .
&quot; some women tasted a few times , but then heard again to say the name of her husband . &quot;
&quot; some , myself included , make it still , but only if they are alone and no other family members are . &quot;
&quot; only one or two will continue to say the name of her hus@@ bands , only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their foreh@@ ead . &quot;
&quot; the women in the discussion , knowing that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the fine to navig@@ ating more freedom of movement or their own han@@ ger choice - at the end of a hard to navig@@ ating river . &quot;
&quot; by giving each other confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot;
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a victim of Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am also .
but this club each of us gives us the confidence that will change something .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when each woman walks home and other people about what we talk about and what we do .
we are all sitting in the same boat .

&quot; at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometers from the border to Mal@@ awi . &quot;

two men were arrested and pointed out in a row that the organs of sh@@ aman@@ en in Tanzania and Mal@@ awi are used .
&quot; it give the local su@@ pers@@ ti@@ tions , that the head of a smooth man &apos;s old or wealth could bring , explained the pol@@ z@@ ic@@ pre@@ cher by Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zia the BBC . &quot;
it is the first time that consecutive attacks on smooth men have been registered in Moz@@ ambi@@ que .
&quot; another group , the aim of murder for ob@@ sc@@ ure purposes is , people with al@@ bin@@ ism . &quot;
this led to the UN to investigate a mission in the South African country to investigate these practitioners .
&quot; the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in neighboring country , where the government campaigns to fight this su@@ pers@@ ti@@ tions and prejudi@@ ces . &quot;

&quot; the relationship between China and Norway were gr@@ ated to sto@@ cking after the Peace Prize 2010 to Li@@ u was given , although the Norwegian Government have finally given nothing to do with the decision . &quot;
&quot; diplomatic relations have been continued in December last year . only in June , Norway signed an agreement to resume the sal@@ mon went to China since the exports have been blocked since 2010 . &quot;
&quot; after the message had spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the No@@ bel Committee brought his hope for a unconditional release for expression and lu@@ d Li@@ u , to pick up his prize in Oslo . &quot;
&quot; because of its adher@@ ing , he was not able to assume its price . &quot;
during the ceremony it was represented by a empty chair .
European Union
&quot; on 6 July , the European Parliament passed on a decision where China was asked to free Li@@ u and his wife immediately to the house arrest , and allow him to seek medical assistance where he wants . &quot;
&quot; the leaders of the EU , Federica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , called for China also for release Li@@ us , as she said in an Declaration on 30 June . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we expect China to open all restrictions by Mr Li@@ us E@@ he@@ wife as well as family members . &quot;
&quot; they should meet all the visits and receive , who wish them , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world . &quot;
USA ( USA )
&quot; U.S. Amb@@ assador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad shared with that the Americans gave to him that he has the opportunity for the treatment abroad , insofar as it would help him in his recovery . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ person of the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the message to the Chinese authorities , not only Li@@ u free , but also to free his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from her house arrest . &quot;
&quot; the call of the U.S. message attracted an angry response from China , with the utter@@ ance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , that &quot; no country has the right to make itself un@@ avo@@ idable and un@@ responsible comments on Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley shared with that China should offer the couple of the following :
&quot; protection and freedom such as travel signs and access to the medical care of his choice , to which they claim according to Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , J@@ eff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz have also introduced a decision in the Congress to push the Chinese government to pushing Li@@ u and his wife uncondi@@ tionally . &quot;
&quot; I urge China to release the No@@ bel lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o uncondi@@ tionally , so that he can move into a proper medical treatment . &quot; http : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o &quot;
Germany
&quot; the German government spokes@@ man Steff@@ en Sei@@ bert wrote on 3 July , Berlin I hope that Li@@ u &quot; all the medical support he needed &quot; &quot; and that a &quot; &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot;
the Chinese president of Xi J@@ in@@ ping was published on 7 and 8 July at the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg .
&quot; previously reported diplomatic sources in Beijing of the News Agency Reu@@ ters that China had great concerns , whether the vor@@ tex could over@@ take the visit to Hamburg . &quot;
Canada to Canada
&quot; on June 28 , the Canadian ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um would like to provide adequate medical care to provide Li@@ u provide adequate medical care and give it the opportunity to worry about himself from his family . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ us lawyer AF@@ P previously told us that Li@@ us wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , who could visit him every day , but the police always have the room in the hospital and that it Li@@ u are not allowed to talk to someone outside , including his lawyers , speak and contact . &quot;
Mc@@ Call@@ um tells you :
&quot; Canada calls China to release its international human rights commitments , including freedom of expression , to maintain and manage the rights of these rights . &quot;
France
&quot; France &apos;s Foreign Ministry requested China , in a declaration on 29 June , Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons : &quot;
&quot; all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all treatments which he , regardless of where , needs . furthermore , his wife and his family will have contact with him . &quot;
&quot; although the real estate site France Info was already told that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , gave the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that you won &apos;t give up any further information whether France will ultimately capture it . &quot;
Taiwan
&quot; the Council of the stron@@ gh@@ s in Taiwan ur@@ ged China on June 27 on June 27 , to demonstrate a greater tolerance towards those seeking peace reforms and democratic development . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ ai@@ wan@@ ese leg@@ is@@ lat@@ ure Yu Me@@ i @-@ nu is also called to allow China to allow China to treat the sick li@@ u , to treat yourself in Taiwan . &quot;
the Dalai Lama
&quot; the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed itself very concerned in an explanation on 28 June by Li@@ u , and gave him that many him have asked him to pray for li@@ us well being . &quot;
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; it is my belief that the initiatives that he took and for which he had passed strict , to a harmonious , stabili@@ zing and prosper@@ ous China would have contributed to a peaceful world . &quot;
&quot; I felt personally very moved and also encouraged , when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tu@@ als and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the charter 08 signed for democracy , freedom and the rule of law in China . &quot;
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .

is Singapore a city or country ?
&quot; the question may seem stup@@ id , as Singapore is recognized at the international level as an independent state . &quot;
but according to the judicial Minister K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am should be considered in Singapore as a city .
this observation has triggered a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osph@@ ere .
&quot; during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the An@@ wal@@ ts@@ kammer Association of the State New York , the Minister that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because it is compared with other countries . &quot;
he support that Singapore should be considered as a city .
nobody asked whether New York is a democracy ...
&quot; this is , with most people make a mistake . &quot;
I tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a land .
&quot; the blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io announced the judicial Minister , &quot; to rot@@ ate the logic to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot;
&quot; and then , according to all our efforts and sacrific@@ es to create this valuable land , we say that we are ultimately not a country . &quot;
&quot; it sound@@ ed so vul@@ gar , it had the gift of a flight prior to the responsible , a mandatory injury . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , you eat country is it then ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons were not very no@@ bel : he defended a idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &quot; normal countries &quot; , &quot; given it seemed inevitable . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he has defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities like Chicago , San Francisco or New York , alike , which are permanently guided by a party . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; once you reach the main point of the topic , the good old Lei@@ er from the author@@ itarian Mach@@ ines who give the pres@@ umed logic , since it fits better with their power . &quot;
&quot; in the end , the answers were given in the final week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am given answers to his American guests regarding our press , our J@@ udi@@ k@@ ative , our political system really non @-@ responses . &quot;
appropriate questions he dealt with non @-@ responses efficiently .
&quot; Rachel Z@@ eng calls Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am to clear his opinion , since they did not understand this conclusion . &quot;
personally I find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , but a city is to which country belongs to our city ... &quot;
&quot; in short , I understand nothing . &quot;
&quot; I would be very grateful if our wer@@ ter K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am would take on the effort to clarify this point , if he was paid very high in order to be part of the government of the city of Singapore . &quot;
&quot; on the blog published his comment , it points to read about the critics that one should begin to read the entire conclusion of the conference so that you can understand the context of the statements of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am better , according to the Singapore has a city and no country . &quot;
read the heading .
&quot; as he said that Singapore is rather a &quot; city &quot; , &quot; he declared why the elections in Singapore is so un@@ easier , even if we enjoy free and just elections . &quot;
he out@@ ed Singapore with cities in the United States ( and how many of these cities saw a party gain a party ? ) .
&quot; as he said , Singapore &quot; &quot; is not a country , &quot; he does not mean it in this sense ! &quot;
Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his disappointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am who as a leader of a growing generation that makes such pol@@ em@@ ic statement .
&quot; I am talking about what the judicial Minister of Singapore has said , very ... &quot;
&quot; at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard , which I expect me - if I do not agree with them , but that is another thing . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , a member of the new generation of political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes that he is really aware and aware what he def@@ ends . &quot;
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review cr@@ ates the weaknesses of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams Arg@@ um@@ ers :
did Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am &quot; &quot; believing a mistake &quot; &quot; or was it a fre@@ ud@@ der speaker ? &quot;
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , we will only be seen as independent and sover@@ eign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , on which country go back to the sover@@ eign rights of the city of Singapore ? &quot;
&quot; Singapore is unique , it is equally land and city . &quot;
&quot; as he plays an important role within the government of the government , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am is of serious importance . &quot;
&quot; why do they contribute to their military service , but do not defend their city but not their country ? &quot;
whom must our prime minister have to pay b@@ ills ?
what is the value of our pink personnel position ?
are we the citizens of a country or the residents of a city ?
&quot; the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade for the affir@@ mation , Singapore has and has always been a city : &quot;
I did not say what I said ...
this set seems to have many av@@ ant@@ ness anno@@ yed ...
nobody has ever told that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / town state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; the defense of the country especially &quot; &quot; etc. , but this is not quite true . &quot;
we should speak more of the defense of the city .
the my@@ th of the &quot; cute rab@@ bit &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Fl@@ anders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices asked his editor : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect in your place or home country ?
&quot; their answers are published here as part of a continuing number , with the rum@@ ors about certain parts of the world and to be shown another fac@@ et . &quot;
&quot; the newest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
&quot; the question that is asked me in Japan , is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; no , I am suffering . &quot; &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; &quot; I live from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live and again in Japan . &quot;
&quot; depending on what situation the conversation is taking place , it is considered to be courteous to show interest in his conversation . &quot;
&quot; my clari@@ fying results usually follows the default response : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ic@@ ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; many can@@ adi@@ er cooking perhaps inn@@ ed before W@@ ut , if they are kept for Americans , but me does not distur@@ b that . &quot;
&quot; for someone who does not know , there are little that distingu@@ ishes us can@@ adi@@ er of Americans . &quot;
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans bring a Canadian F@@ ah@@ ne well visible in their back@@ pack when they travel .
all love Canadi@@ ans .
Americans are on the other hand ... .
&quot; so it was already , when I began to travel through the world - before Donald Tru@@ mp , before the march in Iraq and the 11th of September . &quot;
Canadi@@ ans have always been small ast@@ hor@@ n@@ al leaves at their luggage in order to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors .
we have a free health care system !
with us there is no weapons !
gender equality in Canada have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
&quot; all seem to think , Canada is so great . &quot;
we are courteous .
&quot; we obviously say very often &quot; &quot; blame . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is considered to be considered as the toler@@ ant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not like this guy in the south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate this .
&quot; first , I have many American friends who I ad@@ mired . &quot;
there would be nothing to do if one would change me for example with Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
&quot; but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot; &quot;
&quot; firstly : as &quot; nice &quot; said , &quot; is basically to be di@@ lig@@ ently - just like the cre@@ eping , gentle , but portable un@@ important figure N@@ ed Fl@@ anders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( the one &apos;s Canadian double @-@ ri@@ ans ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada really would be a nation full of people like N@@ ed Fl@@ anders , this would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem exists that &quot; nice &quot; no personality has . &quot;
&quot; there are no corners and edges , nothing , where you can encounter . &quot;
&quot; harm@@ less , is called in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and no attention to earn . &quot;
&quot; this can be a good thing , if you want to remain un@@ noticed in the background , remote from the things that happen to happen . &quot;
&quot; I would even go to say that the desire to be free and alone , a main part of the can@@ adi@@ er . &quot;
we tend to take care of our own affairs only .
&quot; what out@@ standing as &quot; nice &quot; , &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy . &quot;
Canadi@@ ans are not often talking about the fence with the neighbors .
&quot; we lack the warm , open friendliness that I have now connect with my American friends . &quot;
thank@@ fully for us ( and for the rest of the world ) then Jus@@ tin Tru@@ de@@ au the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans have more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has turned Canada to sexy .
musical video of a pop @-@ band par@@ o@@ des Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
&quot; one in Thailand famous pop @-@ band has published a music video that the Jun@@ ta has been par@@ o@@ ded , which 2014 restore power , and despite their promises the civil government continues to restore the country . &quot;
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) The band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells him his friend .
&quot; although not expressly politically , the music video refers directly to the ongoing military power of the j@@ un@@ ta . &quot;
the band was praised by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video of the song was a huge success .
&quot; only within the first three days , the video was shared on Facebook 1.@@ 254 times and received 8@@ 800 Li@@ kes . &quot;
last month even the Charlie Chap@@ lin @-@ Video &quot; The dict@@ ator was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists the public ur@@ ged to watch this video .
&quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , in@@ particular how it beha@@ ves with the situation of the country under the j@@ ta domination . &quot;
&quot; once you have a look at this recording of the video , which refer to some of the political issues that Thailand has been pursued in the past three years . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; &quot; may refer to the dra@@ inage section 44 of the preliminary constitution , which is the Supreme Council , which makes absolute decision @-@ making through important national issues . &quot;
&quot; the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the &quot; &quot; Settings &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , activists , politicians and other persons who are regarded by the Jun@@ ta as critics . &quot;
&quot; the image above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose v@@ age and un@@ clear regulations are often used by the authorities to be able to viol@@ ate activists and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , a new unit set up in the army , super@@ vised online content , and individuals who pre @-@ thrown , the mon@@ archy , will be prosec@@ uted , criminal prosec@@ uted . &quot;
Thailand sets a strike against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ est@@ Ã¤@@ ins@@ ult ) .
&quot; on 20 May 2014 , Thailand was declared war right in Thailand . &quot;
two days later it came to a coup of the army .
&quot; one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to be pursued , their decision is expensive U boats , although security experts they war@@ ned that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of control . &quot;
&quot; in the video there is even shown how people are thrown into a black delivery wagon before going to a interference camp , another problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists are in prison , because they said &quot; &quot; confusion &quot; &quot; in society caused and internet users will attack long arrest , they should en@@ ligh@@ ten the mon@@ archy . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile the te@@ aser of the band members of the band showed the sal@@ ads of &quot; &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em &quot; im@@ i@@ ble , which was already used by Put@@ sch actors during the protests 2014 . &quot;
life goes on to the ruins of the Gei@@ ster@@ ili@@ es in the eastern Ab@@ ch@@ asia

&quot; the post @-@ war society recovered only very slowly in East @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al . &quot;
&quot; now over 20 years have passed since the Georgian war has officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still highly visible in this part of the Republic . &quot;
the abandoned villages of the northern districts in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show marked pictures .
&quot; villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mara , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ ht@@ a , Poly@@ ana and Khar@@ chil@@ ava are located in the carbon basin of Ab@@ ch@@ asia . &quot;
&quot; different ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , de@@ preci@@ ation and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together in the area . &quot;
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
today the majority of Russians are living in the area .
such settlements are called in Ab@@ ch@@ asia also Gei@@ ster@@ cities .
&quot; in the post @-@ war period , more than 10,000 people today , there are only a few hundred people in these spirits . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; since 2011 , the total population of the District 16 000 people had barely increased over a decade . &quot;
1989 about 4@@ 3.000 people lived in this district .

&quot; this is all a consequence of war &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the empty five @-@ story building blocks of the Soviet Union from the early six@@ ties , the chron@@ u@@ sch@@ tsch@@ uk@@ ov@@ kas are called symbo@@ lic@@ ally for the decay and the devast@@ ation of the region . &quot;
the buildings are falling and very rare they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a local older man .
he starts a conversation and it falls heavily to end this .
&quot; this is all a consequence of war . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot;
it is still unique . &quot;
in front of the war the village was full of life .
&quot; there were common centers , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens , all of the community . &quot;
now there is only paved road with infl@@ atable magnific@@ ence buildings .
the people who lived once in this place and have made their contribution to the central economy of the Soviet Union .
in the Gei@@ ster@@ stadt D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha live approximately fifty inhabitants .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mara in the other villages it looks similar .
&quot; the Chron@@ u@@ sch@@ ow@@ kas , which are still one or two families , one recognizes the balconies where laundry is dried . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house . &quot;
&quot; when they discover me with the camera in hand , they go back immediately . &quot;
&quot; our Mother has not allowed us to photograph that we are photograph@@ ed , &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; it simply has allowed us to be forbidden , that is all . &quot;
the girl wh@@ is@@ per@@ ing of her friend something to and suddenly she leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small tur@@ qu@@ oise mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence industry ( cultivation of agricultural products for individual needs ) such as cattle farming , bee @-@ farming and vegetables construction . &quot;
it is difficult to come across the rounds .
the District administration supplies free candles in the winter for free candles and bread in the villages .

&quot; I do not know what will happen , but we will build Zu@@ c@@ ch@@ ini &quot;
&quot; about ten years ago an older woman moved by the name Gal@@ ina ( or T@@ ante G@@ alya , as it is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mara to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha . &quot;
&quot; despite their oldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina did not leave before Ab@@ ch@@ asia to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ ch@@ asia , &quot; tells them . &quot;
Gal@@ ina would like to accept financial support from her daughter and insi@@ sting that she supports her young grand@@ son .
Gal@@ inas monthly R@@ ente are just nine dollars .
&quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive . &quot;
T@@ ante G@@ alya tells you and other vill@@ agers trying to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year woman , as well as a young family and I live in this building . &quot;
if holiday are we visit us .
but we cannot do this - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot;
&quot; while she tells her story , a younger neighbourhood appears on the balcony . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ asch@@ a , &quot; calls T@@ ante G@@ alya her . &quot; &quot; they said , we could build Zu@@ c@@ ch@@ ini . &quot;
I have already prepared the ground .
&quot; I do not know what is going to happen , but we will build Zu@@ c@@ ch@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything . &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as conversation with Nat@@ asch@@ a has lived together with her husband and five common children in their house for some time .
Nat@@ asch@@ a was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she reminds me of the village fl@@ eben in front of the war .
&quot; despite the relative , which live in central Russian , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the land of Ab@@ ch@@ asia broke just away ) , they did not leave the opportunity to leave it . &quot;

her husband works in the Kohl@@ eng@@ ru@@ be .
the young family has its own farm .
&quot; near the house , where Nat@@ asch@@ as kinder@@ garten was once , they hold pigs , cows , chicken and ch@@ ick@@ ens . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; we have no fear of dark road or few people . &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
&quot; in fact , it has more to do with pl@@ under@@ ing . &quot;
after the war there was little work and everyone lived like it was right .
I remember every day like the city and the war once were .
&quot; when our conversation is til@@ ted to the end , it is a small boy past us . &quot;
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hidden .
a ball flies out of the window and another young boy ch@@ ased to him .
&quot; he plays with the ball , which then hin@@ der the hills . &quot;
a group of children now sh@@ ake the ball .
&quot; while they run , throw some of them stones on the dis@@ band@@ ed building . &quot;
&quot; these ruins are part of their childhood , which are responsible for in@@ tight@@ ness in their lives . &quot;
they do not know it any other way .

in Mexico &quot; Mama Africa &quot; migrants on their long journey
&quot; Concep@@ ciÃ³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez leads a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border of Mexico to Guatemala . &quot;

this article by A@@ my Br@@ acken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and appears here with friendly permission .
&quot; on the way of migrants , Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality . &quot;
&quot; I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located on the border with Guatemala . &quot;
it is a very simple hotel close to the city center .
&quot; it is run by a 59@@ ol@@ ds t@@ ol@@ ds , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink spect@@ ro@@ est@@ ell and gol@@ d@@ colored ho@@ lics in t@@ ed@@ dy @-@ form . &quot;
it is called Concep@@ ciÃ³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez and grew up in wallpaper and has grown up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name of Mama Africa . &quot;
this nickname is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a target for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tian who are on transit .
the hotel does not have any charm .
&quot; for about 2.50 dollars the night sleep the guests in simple rooms , with cr@@ ushing , secluded walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
in the pre @-@ room there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a c@@ age .
there is no sign@@ post to the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants here .
&quot; sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez , people tells people in full small buses and from the upper part of the coast to call it : &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot;
where are you Mama Africa ? . &quot;
&quot; at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some have also slept outside on cart@@ ons . &quot;
you do not want to reject anyone .
&quot; she helps them also and brings them to the hospital when they are sick , they buy them medications they may not pay them , they are mass@@ aged them with an bal@@ m that was ti@@ ring from the long journey . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , is recently arrived . &quot;
I asked him if Mama Africa was an adequate nickname for Mrs Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family Sebasti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i that has posing a yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ be@@ ard ) posing with Concep@@ ciÃ³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Br@@ acken .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; he reply with a smile . &quot; &quot; I really feel that it fits to her , since African women are very nice women . &quot;
very lovingly .
she has the cordi@@ ality of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
&quot; Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister , who hopes to get to Boston , to find there her husband and three children . &quot;
&quot; they have lived in Brazil , however , it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States , to make a first stop in South America and move towards north . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard of other directions of M@@ um Africa . &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the route , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
he tells the Hai@@ tians and the Afri@@ cans often travelling together the route and that Afri@@ cans already speak to the W@@ hat@@ s@@ App of Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
how many of his sign@@ alling has lived Michel@@ et previously in Brazil and has worked as a building worker at construction sites of the Olympic Games and the Football champion@@ ships .
&quot; when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he has started his journey into the United States . &quot;
&quot; he has been a guest for Mama Africa for months , he has sold SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the B@@ usti@@ cket to Ti@@ ju@@ ana . &quot;
I ask him if he is in the future with Mrs Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let them go again , &quot; reply smiling . &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells you their guests often send text messages , if they have gone to catch them , or to tell you about the course of their journey . &quot;
it declar@@ es that their Christian faith of the drive of their work is .
&quot; she does not know much about Africa , but their guests have brought her to prepare ch@@ ick@@ ens like in Ghana . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez is perhaps very well known , but it is not the only funk hope for migrants who travel through tap@@ ach@@ ula . &quot;
at the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Valencia .
these winter have recorded Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family migrants in their little house .
he is polic@@ eman and has established that the B@@ usti@@ ble will be sold at numerous African migrants too expensive .
&quot; he began to help them to get a reasonable price , then he has offered them his house for one dollar the night . &quot;
at the moment 25 people there are mainly Hai@@ tians .
&quot; some sleep on ceilings on the ground , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cook@@ er outside . &quot;
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests do .
&quot; I have lived in the United States . &quot; &quot; I experienced what they experience . &quot;
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s why I give them my support .
&quot; after having lived there three years , he became a raid on his work place from the United States . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants , who travels through Tap@@ ach@@ ula , comes from Central America , other inhabitants also open the doors of their houses for them . &quot;
JosÃ© Antonio Cord@@ ova Mel@@ Ã©n@@ dez tells me that he escap@@ ed in Honduras with his wife and three children before people who wanted to get money from him without a plan .
&quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he is asked for an accommodation and a unknown , a well @-@ known , has offered him their roof . &quot;
&quot; a few months later the family lives still , and they tried to decide where the next steps should go . &quot;
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests .
in the courses the travellers consult their teleph@@ ones .
&quot; a small bus has arrived today and has 20 new guests , most of Somalia . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez seems happy that their house is full , but she is also no@@ stal@@ gic because of those who have gone away . &quot;
like a proud grand@@ mother b@@ bles them in their album with numerous photos .
&quot; there is one of her daughter with African hair@@ fle@@ ets which you made a customer , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old . &quot;
they were sad while she presents me briefly .
&quot; Y@@ a se fu@@ eron , &quot; repeated every time . &quot; &quot; they have already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang inhabitants are forced to install on their hand a monitoring app .
a check @-@ point for personal communication equipment in X@@ inj@@ ang from Twitter @-@ users .
&quot; the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minorities region in the West of China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; on 10 July the mobile user received a mobile notification in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an district of the city of U@@ rum@@ qi , where she has the District Government to install a monitoring app named J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; &quot; Web cleaning &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in the notification is said that the app &quot; &quot; to prevent access to terrorist information . &quot;
&quot; however , the authorities will also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism . &quot;
&quot; according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h Women have been arrested in the autonomous I@@ li Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture , because she , shortly after she had installed the app , News with a private We@@ chat group . &quot;
&quot; in the Communication of the Police that the app determine the sources and distribution paths of terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , pictures , e@@ books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service provider with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ Ã¨@@ u T@@ elec@@ om . &quot;
&quot; the main function is the block of por@@ no@@ graphy websites , from online fraud , Troj@@ an@@ ers and ph@@ atic pages to make users on it , how much time they spend online and to remot@@ ely control your home network . &quot;
this app with the filters for min@@ ors shall help the children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
a app with these functions can of course be used in many different ways .
&quot; for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; state actors or even h@@ acker @-@ capable to manipul@@ ate the home network of a person or to ste@@ al it . &quot;
this introduction is in line with other actions to control the digital activities in this region .
&quot; during the news about digital c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in China mostly focus on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south , the reality is very often d@@ Ã¼@@ er for those who live in remote , shel@@ tered ethnic minority regions like X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in the conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme tick @-@ acids and monitoring measures as well as rout@@ in@@ vigor@@ ous Internet de@@ preci@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; this on Twitter @-@ based media @-@ Out@@ let &quot; Images from see China &quot; ( 1 of 1 ) , which showed photos from a check@@ point to the police officers , as well as check whether they had the monitoring app . &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian authorities make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang App .
a mobile notification required to install the app within 10 days .
&quot; if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be in@@ ated up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
&quot; they have the people to be forced to use devices , which are intended for older people . &quot;
this is a form of cap@@ tivity by the rest of ber@@ cul@@ ation technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from see China &quot; ( see you a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , out of which the software can lift up a Windows operating system and therefore un@@ restricted access to the hard drive of the computer . &quot;
&quot; after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones are used in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang on electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
&quot; in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , the provisions in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang are possibly a reaction to the instructions of the city of Party , to minimize the dissemination of illegal contents . &quot;
&quot; all governmental organisations , authorities and associated establishments including universities and research institutions are obligated to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office in operation of their computers and communication devices . &quot;
&quot; a current report from Freedom House , a US @-@ American human rights organisation , also mentioned these new monitoring methods : &quot;
&quot; on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of U@@ rum@@ qi , the authorities on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of U@@ rum@@ qi , to the 1st of August their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards &quot; at local police . &quot;
&quot; the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos &quot; , however , this action is viol@@ ated the personal right of U@@ rum@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a number of other possible distor@@ tion price , including those who relate to peaceful religious or political communications . &quot;
&quot; sleep or death , part 1 : everything going to death &quot;
a single plot in Old Du@@ b@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo by : Cor@@ rie Bar@@ kli@@ more ( CC B@@ Y 2.0 ) .
&quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; sleep or death , &quot; in which the activity of Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane is depic@@ ted his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot;
&quot; far from our blue , virtual world you see you and that you &apos;re quite alone in one place where all things are gone . &quot;
everything has gradually been revealed and revealed to a truth that clearly recogni@@ z@@ able both from inside and outside .
one that makes their name all honor .
one that has fallen down in a list of feelings and expressions that have no met@@ aph@@ ors .
&quot; but when you get the reality back and you are behind the scenes - beyond the act@@ s , the beautiful scenes and the performers - turn the characters into beings from flesh and blood , and everything will move to death . &quot;
&quot; any doubt solve yourself in smoke and you will be aware of your existence , even though the earth is caught on the axis of the we@@ dge . you will clear that you have caught here between the walls that your parents , and before them thy grand@@ parents , stone by stone . &quot;
&quot; they have been arrested me and my father three times , but this did not pass , so that I became &quot; my lesson &quot; , &quot; as the boss of the security service it form@@ ulated - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot;
&quot; he presented his power over us , and even destroyed the simpl@@ est concepts that we knew . &quot;
five young people were demol@@ ished during a peaceful protest like we@@ eds from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
&quot; it attracted to the city the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu &quot; &quot; shot &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; all the neighborhood cov@@ eted , only my own . &quot;
&quot; for the first time it was still , reg@@ ungs@@ lessly , at the wrong time , even if I had no high demands in a city that is to the arter@@ ies with state safety organisms and their ac@@ comp@@ lice . &quot;
during the third night things had a little so@@ othing to work after the power supply in the neighborhood .
&quot; I crossed the still@@ ness by writing several times &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu &quot; &quot; of my house . &quot;
I heard my voice through the silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends were brave enough to meet together .
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , true friends joined me ; we moved us to a glorious picture that met my expectations fully and completely filled . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment , you become aware that you are free the spirit from the lamp , but it is just not interested in the Ger@@ ing@@ est . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; makes you ready to meet us at the military security building . &quot;
he laid down .
&quot; then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low - nothing can give you your voice , after you have lifted up your voice to the office of the security service from the body . &quot;
I came there .
the Ober@@ st Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men : my father was already there as I am now .
&quot; the Ober@@ st Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to speak : &quot; let me hear me , how you &apos;re &apos;@@ Al@@ ahu @-@ bar , or you are only brave enough to cry , if we are not in the vicinity . &quot;
his h@@ asser@@ ted eyes turned on me .
&quot; and you look really what to look into the eyes and not on the ground ! &quot;
what I did , has nothing to do with courage . &quot;
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood before this building . &quot;
perhaps it was on my go@@ al@@ ness ; perhaps on the revolution .
&quot; I was so sure of my thing as I answered , &quot; I would not have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot;
&quot; and I believe I have never ceased to look into the eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fat@@ al consequences for me , and yet I am not a word of what I said . &quot;
&quot; put him in an individual , and his father equal to it . &quot;
&quot; his father equals with it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conf@@ ine of this ver@@ sus of proposition is to me down until today in the nose .
&quot; he became a &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; , &quot; a se@@ el@@ ian torture that I was exposed to monthly . &quot;
I get through the farm .
in the first office I leave everything I was with me .
then back through the farm and into the second office that leads through a hallway to the individual cells .
I give me all the details exactly before I super@@ v@@ ise the room .
&quot; otherwise , they have probably shared a larger cell at this time . &quot;
&quot; I have to share it with only one more prison@@ er , and may immediately put me away without waiting for their permission . &quot;
&quot; after some minutes that felt like a whole life , the be@@ ats the cell , and I grip back to an old communication method : with the f@@ ist against the wall . &quot;
I learned that my cell@@ ular becomes a &quot; Er@@ sth@@ t@@ ling . &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he answered me ultimately .
&quot; apparently , in no of the surrounding cells was a respect@@ able man middle age that looks like me and called &quot; &quot; doctor &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in perfect darkness , not let me realize a distinctive fac@@ ial lifts , and doctors are not here ; we are all only numbers . &quot;
&quot; maybe someone , whose voice is similar to my sounds ? &quot;
all answers connected to its existence .
maybe he was transferred to one of the big cells .
maybe he will hear immediately .
&quot; the investig@@ ator had insured me , they would love him , if I stay . &quot;
li@@ ar .
&quot; of course , I would have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to sell all these types , looking at the fruits in the garden of my head . &quot;
from af@@ ar I can still hear them &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; .
&quot; it must be about 10 am in the evening , always at this time the terror , every day . &quot;
the door opens .
&quot; I was always convinced that black and colour of the decay , until I saw the yellow light that gave us the Gre@@ ys in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; &quot; Don@@ ner &quot; , &quot; An@@ chor@@ us on 13 S@@ ure of the Quran ) . &quot;
they are here to listen to .
&quot; this was the secret : to protect the state security before us , and prevent the tra@@ itor and the terrorists in us , they talk in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dial@@ ect - thus they played their kon@@ essi@@ on@@ ous in@@ pres@@ et card and scattered the close eye field of their world view . &quot;
&quot; this is not a home , which is not a land ; it is a cur@@ se who call it co@@ existence to transform the crimin@@ als of their k@@ lan@@ s into a hero . &quot;
&quot; I super@@ v@@ ise the squ@@ ir@@ atory and tre@@ ks on Abu Im@@ ad , a slim and steep man ; at least he comes to me so . &quot;
&quot; he begins a &apos; pleasant &quot; conversation , despite the fac@@ ial expressions , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life when you join this diary and protest on demonstrations , who will soon find an end soon . &quot;
I did not answer .
I used to get acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to answer .
I can really say no more precisely when ins@@ ults and battles after a friendly interview for me became an ordinary communication means .
when and how that happened was un@@ important .
&quot; any voice in me said that I had to be used to be used , pun@@ ished , even though I had done nothing to earn this punishment . &quot;
on punishment in all their diversity .
his command is to rip me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls the lovingly &quot; conf@@ ession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe that probably originates from the clo@@ aken .
your execu@@ tioner betra@@ yed to your bow@@ ls .
&quot; give him the pleasure , you cannot measure you with him and you cannot keep your terror . &quot;
&quot; my terror was not enough , which is why she inter@@ changeable the pipe through a cable . &quot;
&quot; at my first time I asked myself whether the investig@@ ator had worked earlier as a gar@@ ant@@ lers , or if it belonged to the normal working equipment . &quot;
they had four cables in@@ cor@@ rupted to each other to present ourselves from their sight , great invention of a huge cable . &quot;
within one hour rarely happens three of them as I was still in the row .
&quot; I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice , why I listened to scre@@ am . &quot;
the execu@@ tioner dropped out the cooling and found no one to all of them why he as next to an electric charged cle@@ ab .
&quot; flow through my whole body , enough to supply my whole neighborhood . &quot;
&quot; my semi @-@ sitting body , which lay out on the ground , was the perfect power conductor . &quot;
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he met his duty for this night .
it must have been so at midnight .
&quot; I decided to sleep me again ; let &apos;s say , that was my only option . &quot;
a few hours went to me like a few minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; the door opens and the morning light meets the room &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fic@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; I answered with the voice of an exhaustive youths : &quot; &quot; my Lord , my Father must be terri@@ bly worried . &quot;
&quot; be silent and away you , you will be laid . &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had ever released me .
where do they lead me ? !
the j@@ ord@@ ian rap@@ per Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b re@@ jects on the rights of LGB@@ T + community to freedom of expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b harsh a cigar@@ ette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b spends the majority of his time in the inside ; time he sh@@ iel@@ ding to his canvas , once to his computer , and again to his couch . &quot;
&quot; what one can rely on , is a cigar@@ ette between his fingers or his with ni@@ cot@@ ine lips . &quot;
&quot; he lives in the top floor of his family house that has ended them since 1967 ; the year , in which Israel ended his occupation of the West Bank and H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs family had to flee from her village in Palestine , where she had lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ en ( e.g. : Far@@ mer ) . &quot;
&quot; for six years H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is a passionate active , who presents itself to the conservative majority and depos@@ ited their alt@@ ed opinions about gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression by art and Rap@@ ha@@ h music . &quot;
&quot; with his music , which often poses itself with issues such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian geography , but also calls for the nucle@@ us of the whole Arab world . all these topics do not only be found in his hom@@ etown Am@@ man Rel@@ ev@@ anz but also in cities which range from Damascus in Syria to San@@ aa in Y@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; with his 25 years H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees himself as someone who is restricted in his mind by borders , and he can feel according to their own statement by people who suffer from the devast@@ ating consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq , Y@@ emen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if he is not open to the US , he had a special incl@@ ination against the US American foreign policy . &quot;
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by author .
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to do in war zones , something that has been born with his identity as &quot; Palestinian geography of the second generation , even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think because of my own life conditions so , &quot; stresses H@@ d@@ ai@@ b . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; I think so , because I am sh@@ aking a man while he sh@@ ake in water . it is the holy month Ramadan ; in this time it is intended for Muslims , from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the j@@ ord@@ ian law also defe@@ ated that the public consumption of food is illegal during Ramadan .
&quot; obviously , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee to do with a sen@@ ed hot j@@ it@@ ag little with protest against Islam . &quot;
&quot; basically , the sli@@ ppers speak of warm coffee and the wa@@ ist of the K@@ ent @-@ cigar@@ ette in the nose primarily of freedom . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky , especially when you have a view into neighboring countries . &quot;
&quot; hence , you simply avo@@ ids it simple to do basic things - as in the public during Ramadan , to drink water - to not land in prison . &quot;
&quot; recently , the Interior Ministry of Our Lady has a appearance of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a , already for the second time . &quot;
&quot; some parliament@@ arians who support the Islamic Action of the Muslim branch of Muslim Br@@ other@@ hood - arg@@ um@@ ented that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ ex@@ ual Front@@ s@@ Ã¤n@@ gers Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , the cultural and traditional standards of the country contra@@ dic@@ ated and the main reason for the concert tab@@ s . &quot;
the Euro MPs and former Press@@ es@@ pre@@ cher@@ in the Islamic Coalition DI@@ MA Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert has been cancelled due to the sexual orientation of the rope .
&quot; many also pret@@ end , the involvement of the band in affairs such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world be dangerous acti@@ vis@@ m , which represents the old legitimacy of author@@ itarian regimes in the entire region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a the j@@ ord@@ ain people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; which continues to be decided for an intellectual and cultural plur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; this statement is probably not easy to conf@@ essi@@ vely rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic , but actually a clear cryst@@ alli@@ ous reality in Jordan reflect that occurs in H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs work clearly to the fores@@ ee@@ pers . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 backward H@@ d@@ ai@@ b traditional sex men , by giving his vision from the fate of Arabic women . &quot;
&quot; the image shows the sk@@ el@@ eton with a apparently low @-@ known woman , whose arms and legs are up to the corners of the canvas . &quot;
&quot; it is surrounded by a red lake , perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of which they actually trust . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , the number of &apos; honor@@ ary mor@@ de &apos; increased - the in@@ official outside . &quot;
&quot; human Rights Watch is estimated the number of honor@@ ary mor@@ als in the year 2016 their peak ; however , however , comes to Jordan , the institutional infrastructure is lacking to support the women who were attemp@@ ted by or domestic violence . &quot;
&quot; according to a law to anti @-@ breaking control from the year 1954 , women are exposed to the danger of domestic violence , &quot; and for their release is often a long @-@ term bureaucr@@ atic effort as well as the guarantee on the part of the family is necessary that the woman has nothing to happen . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs music enjoys great popularity and is known for it , also not to be back on issues that in his country long as tab@@ u g@@ old . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b pun@@ ished that his work is politically , however , that he is his music , which is full of exp@@ ulsion on sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression , not of politics . &quot;
&quot; I com@@ m from the Middle East , man . &quot;
&quot; I was deb@@ ated in politics , &quot; he says . &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b takes the question of the Palestinian identity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lav@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; &quot; and in &quot; &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; &quot; is the focus on poverty . &quot;
&quot; the list of songs that are politically politically , can be continued . &quot;
in March 2016 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b published a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is often repeated :
&quot; you are free , and anyone else is it . &quot;
&quot; in the further course of the song H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where one can get , in his words , what you want &quot; - be faith or non @-@ belief , H@@ et@@ ero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; he noticed that hardly any one speaks in Jordan about the rights of gay and les@@ bi@@ ans , and that comments on the equality of LGB@@ T + individuals still have decreased considerably until 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b introduced an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ an online program Ro@@ ya to remember later that his comments were covered from the context , and his opinion had been c@@ ens@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; on Youtube it was up@@ loaded without cuts , but was only a edited version , &quot; he says . &quot;
today H@@ d@@ ai@@ b acqu@@ ires H@@ d@@ ai@@ b open to the arab@@ ic LGB@@ T + community and represents the opinion that intoler@@ ance against homosexu@@ als do not meet Islam .
&quot; he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ what , a po@@ et of the eighth century , who still has remained in memory thanks to his hom@@ o@@ erotic po@@ ems . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks : when Abu Nu@@ ts , who was later working on behalf of the pot@@ assi@@ um , in the eighth century , why not write homosexu@@ ality , why can Jordan not be ? &quot;
&quot; the actual problem , so H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a or the fact that the concert was cancelled . &quot;
&quot; in the H@@ ash@@ em@@ i@@ tic kingdom , there is nothing new that the government attacks on freedom of speech and that progressive votes are brought to silence . &quot;
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the j@@ ord@@ an news service took several former government @-@ level and members of the teaching network , with the reason they had expressed themselves on comments in social media cri@@ tically connected to the problems that are deeply rooted in the country with deep corruption . &quot;
&quot; in view of this , the concert H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs think is not only the tip of the ic@@ eberg - the real challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of Jordan . &quot;
&quot; for him , progress has been a constant state and Take . Jordan has succeeded for the second time in a row , but the way of progress - it looks very slow , bed@@ time and inner changes . it is certain that these changes will take place from day to day in the heart of the j@@ ord@@ ic society . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , such as millions of other Arab@@ s , also , from a Arab world without interventions from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he dre@@ amed of not only his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to experience them . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region is dominated by music , art and literature of a real and fundamental openness - and not by bom@@ bs , Stre@@ um@@ uni@@ tions and on artificial way of guided democr@@ acies . at least he hopes that . &quot;
&quot; until the time is , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b will continue and therefore also resistance . &quot;
&quot; this report was made through the Pul@@ se@@ ater Center on Crisis Reporting , which is listened to the A@@ man as a student Fel@@ low . &quot;
Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
&quot; these great , ex@@ travag@@ ant war@@ ri@@ bs are so fantastic ! ! ! &quot;
there are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Neb@@ uta festival .
&quot; you susp@@ ect that there is a variant of Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is also celebrated in August in many areas T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory dates back to the arm@@ ies , the drums and the dance over more than one thousand years , in the arm@@ ies of the west of Japan to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the Em@@ ishi , to the k@@ nee . &quot;
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we were able to climb a few great seats , so we have a great view . &quot;
you can only imagine how big these parts are ...
&quot; a joint centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , hosted a two month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally . &quot;
I &apos;ve been looking for a long time again the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en : two forts are just going to see .
&quot; nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to Ash@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend his summer : &quot;
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer Festival in the North of the country .
I was there and looked at the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of an 18 meter high feast was amazing .

&quot; rarely , outer appearance and body care were as important as in this history , as they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth from crime and promote an legitimate profession like the of the hair . &quot;
&quot; El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where street smo@@ b and illegal drugs are daily . &quot;
one in April 2017 published survey showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel secure .
at the same time Peru experienced Peru - how many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
&quot; the trend , the appearance and therefore also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sports@@ men like Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( Chile ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led to the experienced hair@@ styles to form these elaborate hair@@ styles . &quot;
&quot; the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles that go to the extreme limits of fant@@ asy and creativity , even has inspired an annual event , the competition of the hair@@ dres@@ ser Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , who has held since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in order to show experts from each other , to show those who can see the most popular corp@@ ses , as you can see in the following video ( other videos on current competitions , there is on the public fac@@ ebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) . &quot;
&quot; educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to convince young people of it to get their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools , and instead of bad rates to get a training in the hair@@ dressing art that allows them to find work . &quot;
motivated by this activity and the offering opportunities have doz@@ ens of young people that they can take a job which is currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops in March beginning of March beginning and reported on some of their successes :
in 1995 we were the only professional school in the church and the district where we are very proud because of love for the children we have built this educational community .
Colombia : love @-@ rie@@ fe to Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ak@@ ami

&quot; the following article is the edited version of the &quot; &quot; Liebes@@ bot@@ ties to Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ak@@ ami , &quot; which has published the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot;
the article is published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write only love @-@ sm@@ ells of people who we know ?
&quot; is it not yet much more important , people who feel extinct , aff@@ ection@@ ate ? &quot;
exactly this question went to the two young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ Ã¡r@@ rag@@ a by the Young Youth Youth Foundation and Cris@@ tian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation ( letters to reconciliation ) to write the young people to write Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ak@@ ami &apos;s letters .
&quot; only in short , her country was a location of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to their part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had closed a peace agreement with the guer@@ ri@@ lla Movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary armed forces in Latin America ) , which forms the battle of the longest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
international was the sig@@ nat@@ ation of the peace agreement as so significant that the Colom@@ bian President JosÃ© Manuel San@@ tos was received for his worship the No@@ bel Peace Prize .
&quot; however , in front of the Kolum@@ bi@@ ans , there is still a long way to be able to speak of a real reconciliation and peace . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ er@@ ri@@ ll@@ ers , who lived in illegal wareh@@ ouses for many years , and around the clock have been exposed to their weapons to integrate themselves into life as civilians . &quot;
&quot; the Colom@@ bian society , in turn , which had acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to life in constant fear and in some cases , it must be used to support their ranks and support them in building a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cris@@ tian were convinced that the young Kolum@@ ans have to join together and would have to help with the integration process .
&quot; and that &apos;s exactly what they did : until now , thousands of young people have written letters to former gu@@ ill@@ ers , to welcome them back in society . &quot;
the aim of the campaign are 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former gu@@ ill@@ ers - who will then be personally transferred .
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as an inspiration for the campaign
&quot; the idea for the letters of reconciliation was born on the World Summit of the No@@ bel Peace Prize , which took place in February 2017 in Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ . there was Leonardo and Cris@@ tian the opportunity to talk to the No@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ ar@@ thi , which was awarded the No@@ bel Prize in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this explained that we love the people who love , am Valent@@ ine &apos;s day of thousands of love , but those forgot that they need much unnecessary . &quot;
&quot; he left , told he continues to share his love with people that needed the most urgent need . &quot;
&quot; thus the plan to write letters of hope and support for former comb@@ at@@ ants of F@@ ARC that now have to find their place in society and establish a new life . &quot; &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discour@@ se of a war history to a common history of peace , they say . &quot;
&quot; until now , in the context of the campaign more than 2,000 letters were collected . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ Ã­n , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ . &quot;
&quot; I have never thought that someone would forgive me &quot;
the first 500 letters were handed over to the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o region in the region of Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca .
&quot; a group of 40 students from the University of J@@ aver@@ iana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo by the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art , in the camp to bring the letters personally . &quot;
&quot; the members of the F@@ ARC were so on how they had done earlier , in order to assume the commands of their leaders . &quot;
&quot; but this time they did not receive commands , but letters full of subj@@ ection of people from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a very moving moment for all involved . &quot; &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings can run in just a few hours - from fear up to happiness and all that lies in @-@ between , told the policy @-@ knowledge of Manuela J@@ im@@ Ã©@@ ne@@ z Av@@ ila later . &quot;
Sandra Par@@ ra , an employee of the Govern@@ ors of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca drive this unforgettable experience as follows : &quot;
&quot; after we had passed the letters , I led a former comb@@ at@@ ants through the camp of Gu@@ er@@ illa @-@ fighters . &quot;
&quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut , where the guer@@ ri@@ lla war@@ ts live ) , I saw a guer@@ illa , who wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid to go , because next to him on the bed was an M@@ GL @-@ Gran@@ at@@ cher , a de@@ adly weapon in the thor@@ n@@ ap . &quot;
&quot; I still spoke to him and asked : &quot; hello , what do they just say ? &quot; &quot; he answered : &quot; I answered a letter that someone has written someone . &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; never in my life I wrote something so beautiful , so I answered it . because I suddenly lie@@ ve the t@@ ears about the che@@ eks . &quot;
I embr@@ aced him quite firm and put me next to the gran@@ at@@ cher .
&quot; perhaps he was the war , it was sorry to be all the years of faithful companion of this struggles , and wanted to help him to write this letter . &quot;
&quot; the man told me more about his life . he never had anything else from life than war . to join the F@@ ARC , was the only way to keep him and his six brothers in front of the famine . &quot; &quot; I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes . &quot;
but now I know that there is a society outside there is waiting for us with open arms .
&quot; up to now , I have only learned how I have to deal with weapons . &quot;
&quot; but now where peace is there , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
&quot; at the pre@@ lu@@ de , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC came together to a discussion . &quot;
the students were all grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC already joined in hi@@ ding .
&quot; therefore , the leaders of the F@@ ARC gave the history of the organisation , their ide@@ als , and gave an insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; many years , we have experienced the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party , we can help to create society in this country . &quot;
&quot; for a purpose of this order , it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles , &quot; said one of them . &quot;
Manuela was impressed :
&quot; to hear these people still have never found hearing and no voting right , and to recognize that people I have seen often as monsters and even hate , even people with beautiful feelings that were re@@ directed by their living conditions and their environment was very painful for me . &quot;
&quot; reality , in which the country lives , does me hurt . &quot;
&quot; but it com@@ for@@ ted me that all people - even those who have killed and so much damage , we can teach us something and give a smile and a hug . &quot;
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
&quot; Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez , the command@@ ant of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ Ã­o de Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Arch@@ bishop of the city Cal@@ i , following letter : &quot;
&quot; the Kolum@@ bi@@ an@@ ern was proph@@ esi@@ ed , that after the dra@@ inage of peace would rule peace . &quot;
but this is not the case .
&quot; as long as it is inequality , hunger and a lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are willing to access to weapons and to protest for their rights ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; from the F@@ ARC now putting peace on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; therefore , we call all def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong to themselves - about all that raise from a country in war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrific@@ es , because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those among us who defend life as the basis of existence will be many difficulties . &quot;
&quot; on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them . &quot;

&quot; it follows the translation of an article , which was written by uns@@ rem Partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ mak@@ sum@@ owa , and its initial publication on the OC OC Media . &quot;
&quot; homosexu@@ als and que@@ er people who live in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region , are exposed to a wide range of danger - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and ext@@ or@@ tion . &quot;
with hor@@ rors activists the reports of recent months over the persecution pregnant women in Ch@@ ech@@ n@@ ya .
&quot; but the threat , which depends on as a deriv@@ ative value over the local LGB@@ T community , is not only at night . &quot;
&quot; OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , who shared some of their experiences with us and talked about what is happening in the Republic . &quot;
&quot; LGB@@ T legal situation in Ch@@ ech@@ n@@ ya has been published several months ago the international Head@@ lines , after reports were published , which were published , torture and killing que@@ er men in the Republic . &quot;
&quot; the first report was published by the journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Now@@ aya Gas@@ eta ; it threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities , the di@@ gest@@ ed que@@ er men sho@@ ots , and they were in secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun . &quot;
&quot; they have brought a mon@@ ster to the world &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina , a trans@@ lady , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there . &quot;
&quot; already since her childhood , she felt that she was in reality a woman . &quot;
&quot; when they grow , you became aware that Ch@@ ech@@ n@@ ya was not a safe place for them , why she moved to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after having had a group of Tsch@@ et@@ sch@@ enen of the sex woman , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina . &quot;
out of fear for her life she moved to the USA in the USA .
Sab@@ rina : I was active as volunteers at a human rights organisation .
one day was told me that someone needed my help .
&quot; it was an acquain@@ t@@ ance from Dag@@ est@@ an , a trans@@ woman who hi@@ des in trouble . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help her , he made a friend , a copy of my documents and spread them anywhere on the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent them to his tsch@@ ech@@ n@@ ya friends , with the following message : &quot; then there is no men more in Ch@@ ech@@ n@@ ya which can eliminate these shame ? &quot;
then the photos made from my documents through all W@@ hat@@ s@@ App the round .
I was attacked on 10 October 2015 .
&quot; when I was just a few shopping from the back@@ seat of my car , I heard a men &apos;s voice : &quot; here is a gift for you from your unc@@ le . &quot;
&quot; when I revol@@ ve myself , I felt something in my body , but I did not hurt anything . &quot;
&quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time on Che@@ chen : &quot; how long do you want to honor the family , you Sch@@ and@@ fl@@ eck ? &quot;
I knew the person not .
&quot; I just know that there was a young man , no 30 years old . &quot;
then I lost awareness and vig@@ il@@ ant in the hospital again .
&quot; apparently , some women had gotten everything and started to cry out . &quot;
the man was flying .
the women had called a ambul@@ ances .
in the hospital I learned that I had two key wo@@ unds in my right l@@ ungs .
OC Media : in which health p@@ oul@@ try was placed in which the men or women ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my documents are out@@ dated , there is still my male name on ; but the doctor arose and put me to the women . &quot;
so I am very grateful to him .
&quot; when I read his name for the first time at his burden , I got it with fear ; it was a Muslim , a k@@ iss name . &quot;
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him that he is respect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
last February I got dr@@ ones .
&quot; they sm@@ elled me , wrote me - Related , stran@@ gers , some completely unknown . &quot;
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was attended by neighbors and some distant relatives .
&quot; the slow@@ ed , send me back to Ch@@ ech@@ n@@ ya to prove that all was a lie . &quot;
&quot; they set absurd demands : some told me , I m@@ ts it to prove that I had not changed at the official TV in Gros@@ ny and say that I had not changed my sex , that everything was only bad , and Photoshop . &quot;
I have grain size C - what could I say in television ?
OC Media : how has your family tried to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it is still hard for them .
some older people said once my mother on the road .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; they have brought a mon@@ ster to the world that not only sh@@ amed your family , but the whole Republic . &quot;
&quot; we cannot touch you because you are a dev@@ out woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot;
my mother became too much and she put a stri@@ ck around the neck .
fortunately the neighbors came and ret@@ ched them .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
&quot; I moved into an apartment and a few hours later , under the window a car with shut down window plates and a Num@@ mer@@ n@@ schild with a 95 dr@@ on . &quot;
&quot; having happened for the third time , was clear to me that there was something la@@ zy . &quot;
my human rights @-@ friends over@@ check the number@@ ing signs - it turned out that I was persec@@ uted .
OC Media : how did you get around ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
&quot; for security reasons , I will not want to provide their names , but I will say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with her help , I left the country , but then happened something un@@ belief . &quot;
I can still not understand how it could be .
just before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
&quot; I bought it , without sign me , without reve@@ aling without any notice . &quot;
I broke my old SIM card and cast them into the rub@@ b@@ ish .
came to and check@@ out into the hotel .
the number was registered on a stran@@ ger .
I put your SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t believe in security , just because you have left the country ? &quot;
&quot; our people already know , in which hotel you st@@ eck@@ st . you even know your room number . &quot;
only to prove it : it is the number 115 .
can you imagine ? !
this was actually my room number .
OC Media : do you still get in touch with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; however , we do not talk about the sex aspect we do not , this is a tobacco topic . &quot;
some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian items have still in me .
&quot; so , I also wish to overcome these se@@ el@@ ic barriers , I cannot overcome . &quot;
&quot; I always say that , as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt them . &quot;
&quot; when we chat with camera , I actually give me trouble like the person who reminds them from their past - so on my male form . &quot;
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Ch@@ ech@@ n@@ ya ?
&quot; what do your friends do , those who have stayed there ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I have submitted a report in Washington last week .
for the needed I found current information about the situation in Ch@@ ech@@ n@@ ya .
I spoke to someone who has a half and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; he told that during Ramadan were no human being arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ramadan could barely wait , and he did not lock a new wave . &quot;
&quot; probably , they will now focus on family and relatives . &quot;
&quot; that I mean , they probably invite the relatives , these take care of the problem with the affected person and at the end , demand a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honour &quot; has experienced by blood Gen@@ ug@@ tu@@ ation . &quot;
OC Media : are now even pregnant women in these secrets ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of me says it would not be very many .
&quot; if , then above all those who have no enough relatives , or were left out of their relatives to face Kad@@ y@@ rows court . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they are recorded there to present them later as terrorists . &quot;
&quot; say : should they be converted , they will show their body in television and claim , they could have attacked any village or a military base . &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; as if these people were not simply van@@ ished , but targeted to radic@@ alise them . &quot;
OC Media : is this now just a mut@@ ation or have you a source for this information ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : I just returned to someone , the one and a half months in Ar@@ gun was in@@ cu@@ sto@@ dy . &quot;
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after having grown be@@ ard .
there has since been nothing new of them .
they have just taken her .
&quot; and this so called Lord , this person was himself , when these people were taken . &quot;
&quot; but now they were not presented as a band@@ its , there has been no reports yet . we suppose that such actions are quite possible . &quot;
why else could I have not allowed these people to shave himself ?
&quot; do you know if this persecution and kid@@ n@@ app@@ ings of people who belong to a so called &quot; &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation , &quot; already in the past ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I made my hair always long .
in Ch@@ ech@@ n@@ ya I had a Bob .
&quot; I think , already before 2003 I was already in Great Britain , when I lived there - and I never had any problems . &quot;
in Ernst !
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 , when the aria was considered , I never had any problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , at that time it was much safer than now . &quot;
&quot; Russia wanted to bring us originally to the &quot; &quot; civil@@ isation &quot; , but finally us thrown back to the Stone Age . &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sch@@ aria law ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my eye brow@@ s were sl@@ ated , I had fil@@ tered eyelashes , carried tu@@ be@@ je@@ ans and short T@@ ops . &quot;
the Ministry of Affairs of the Sch@@ aria has never war@@ med me only a hair .
&quot; in front of the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people like me met . &quot;
&quot; it was a small square where several benches were standing , and all the city knew of it ; they knew why men , young people met there . &quot;
we were never bes@@ ieg@@ ed .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a Re@@ action : Khar@@ da ma Khar@@ da . that means : &quot; sp@@ otte not over the un@@ happiness of another . &quot;
&quot; you often say it to children , when dealing with sick fun . &quot;
&quot; OC Media : so they simply have their eyes closed before you , because they believed , they were sick ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never sinn@@ ed , never hun@@ ted and never be@@ aten . &quot;
OC Media : how long did this gn@@ om@@ ens@@ ation held ?
Sab@@ rina : so long before Kad@@ y@@ row entered the plan .
&quot; when he was appointed Minister Prime Minister , he began to speak on TV on mor@@ als . &quot;
&quot; he did not speak about us , but primarily about the behavior of women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , you could feel like the people in the city began to change . &quot;
who had har@@ dened and yellow at once upon once with Arg@@ w@@ ohn .
in time I left Ch@@ ech@@ n@@ ya .
&quot; but every time I came back home , I could feel like the situation in the Republic has steadily wor@@ sen@@ ed . &quot;
OC Media : what activities do you go now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I haven &apos;t earned a lot - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US .
&quot; besides , I am still working as activ@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; currently , I am responsible for 15 Muslim women . &quot;
I communic@@ ates with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we organize teac@@ ups , co@@ arri@@ vals , I guide them to hospital and help them to get essential types . &quot;
I have no pen@@ ny for this .
&quot; I discovered these people themselves , when I ab@@ stain from hi@@ ding places . &quot;
I am Mus@@ lim@@ a and wants to help those who need help .
OC Media : wear an Hid@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : this is al@@ drivers .
&quot; so , nature , that has nothing to do with religion . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly the same as in Ch@@ ech@@ sch@@ enen , who wish to make you a foam before the mouth , that there is no pigs at them . &quot;
&quot; the Dag@@ est@@ ans have which , the Cab@@ ard@@ iner have which Russians have also which Russians ; on the whole planet it is - but &quot; &quot; not in Ch@@ ech@@ n@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; I come from there , so it is annoying to hear . &quot;
I enter here as many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practic@@ ing Muslims that go into the Mos@@ que and during Ramadan - live together with men .
&quot; do you know , many think in Tran@@ si@@ denti@@ ty to men who love men , and they believe that man changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that is a tru@@ er . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different types of feeling to be exactly , different way settings . &quot;
&quot; for me , it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ash@@ amed for my body . &quot;
not whether I have a partner or not .
&quot; sorry that I will be here in person , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago . &quot;
and I am not very sad at all - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups war@@ n before an increase of self @-@ mor@@ den within the armed Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region is suffering from an unusual high level of work and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
&quot; since the last few months , there is a strong rise in self @-@ mor@@ den . &quot;
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .

&quot; the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August backward the desp@@ ised situation of Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran , which is characterized by poverty and unemployment , into the spot@@ light . &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he dwelt in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region Ah@@ wa@@ z in the southwest of Iran .
&quot; he suffered under anxiety , depression , and he sh@@ ame@@ ful himself for his own assistance , the in@@ ability to come up for his family , so Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i @-@ human rights groups who want to work and remain an@@ onym@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; one on YouTube shared video held the moments that he had to blame itself . &quot;
&quot; some people managed to delete the fl@@ ames again , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought into the Tal@@ eg@@ h@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; according to local sources , the comb@@ us@@ ations were so strong that doctors could do nothing more . &quot;
he died a short time later .
&quot; it was not the only su@@ ic@@ ide that has occurred in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i minority , and activists before , that even more men could take life . &quot;
&quot; Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Centre for Human Rights announces that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali H@@ az@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sh@@ ah@@ ab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - ur@@ ges . &quot;
&quot; their stories have one thing in common : there were all family members , who are hel@@ pl@@ ess and in@@ able because of the persecution of Iranian government , hel@@ pl@@ ess and in@@ capable to follow their families and follow a safe work . &quot;
Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i suffer from poverty ; unemployment and discrimination
&quot; the region , in which a large part of Iran &apos;s Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community is located , a profound economic crisis became hard by a profound economic crisis , which makes it hard to walk the native Arab population . &quot;
&quot; in a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predomin@@ antly aut@@ on@@ ous region in Iran , until the P@@ ahl@@ avi mon@@ archy took over and 1925 great efforts to stop ethnic autonomy throughout Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest in Iran pre @-@ coming oil and gas fields as well as some of the most sought @-@ rich and valuable commercial areas for industrial agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite these valuable resources , regional economy develops only slowly , and the locals get only little from this wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often the victim of un@@ treated diseases , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the Iranian regime den@@ ies the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Arab@@ s systematically jobs in local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry . &quot;
&quot; the government also has a variety of d@@ bs built , the waters of the Arab regions in the Persian areas where the provinces is Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , K@@ erman and Gh@@ om . &quot;
&quot; these dam@@ s have managed only to wor@@ sen the devast@@ ation in the region by drying , and local agriculture as well as fish and palm trees . &quot;
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ ha@@ w@@ zi @-@ Youth has now increased to 81 % .
&quot; N@@ OU@@ R Moh@@ am@@ med P@@ ur , the Iranian General Manager for cooperation , work and social welfare , announces that 5 % of Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is who finished a job , completed 55 % a further school and have 45 % a university degree . &quot;
systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance
&quot; Kar@@ im Doh@@ im@@ i , an ir@@ an Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i human rights activ@@ ist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; to a &quot; high rise &quot; &quot; the number of self @-@ mor@@ den among the young Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i @-@ men . &quot;
&quot; Doh@@ im@@ i said , that especially the unemployment has become even worse . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of T@@ wa@@ z re@@ an@@ coming ethnic per@@ ches and anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the setting process : &quot;
&quot; as functionalities and institutions are not prefer@@ ably Arabic labour , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i will have access to work opportunities in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime that aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance , and force them to earn their livel@@ ih@@ ood outside their homeland . &quot;
&quot; there are people who had to hide their advantages and surname to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i , and to be employed as being employed as even Arabic name at the workplace are not toler@@ ated , because the speech of Arabic language or the Arab clothing . &quot;
&quot; given the given circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i have to bear , human rights activists , before the location explo@@ ded . &quot;
it remains to be seen whether the world is clear and aware of it .

&quot; the following article is an updated version of the opinion which was published by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i , and originally published on the website Af@@ ro@@ f@@ Ã©@@ min@@ as . the article was subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed . &quot;
you can read in the comments under the original text .
&quot; if I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , many women - especially white women who call themselves as inter@@ se@@ ful femin@@ ist@@ ers - with fru@@ stration . &quot;
you wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even thought out well thought scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be femin@@ ist and why we generally have all the femin@@ ist * inside .
&quot; for example , women still earn less money in spite of equal education than men . &quot;
women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they can do with their body .
that violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
&quot; or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women sooner or later grow in various areas of life to a smooth blan@@ ket , and that discrimination based on sex is still moving across the many different countries and faith . &quot;
all of this is aware and known to me .
I am convinced of it and I lei@@ de twice and three .
I am a black woman .
&quot; and yet : when I talk to skin colour , on racism , on black CIS women , on black CIS women , on black women in the LGB@@ T community or on black women from the Dias@@ pora ; when I had chosen , both in and outside of femin@@ ist movement , both inside and outside the femin@@ ist movement , decide to mention many white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ se@@ ated femin@@ ist@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; but nevertheless , all agree that women - all women should come together to lift up their voices and &apos; K@@ umb@@ aya , my Lord &apos; to sing &quot; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women . &quot;
&quot; but they do not want to talk about sexu@@ alised violence an institu@@ tion@@ alized form rac@@ ist violence , which we are black women exposed to two . &quot;
or that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and origin of origin earn less than white men and women .
that black girls and girl referred to as a mig@@ rant background of school are referred to as white girl because of obvious integration problems .
or that women in black spheres and women are exposed to a higher risk to suffer domestic violence and violence in partnership as white women .
&quot; on the one hand , I want to have all women , all men and at all , every skin colour do not connect to the same rights ; on the other hand , I cannot consider myself as a black woman , in whose center the white woman stands , which refer to the gender as well as the skin colour of a person . &quot;
&quot; I am exhausted , and I will no longer fight for my membership in a white @-@ femin@@ ist put@@ ty , who has always rejected me and countless other black women and repeatedly rejected . &quot;
&quot; So@@ jour@@ ner be@@ ech 18@@ 51 in her speech : &quot; &quot; I am not a woman ? &quot; and also I refused to maintain an ideology , in which the black woman is in the historical sense a ent@@ less and margin@@ alized beings . &quot;
&quot; I wei@@ gh myself to join me group@@ ings that also absor@@ b our customs and customs , to advance its eg@@ oc@@ entri@@ c program . &quot;
&quot; I will no longer try to settle white women the importance of abundance of skin colour and gender equality . for some of them will continue to mention the importance of black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women are trying to honor them of a better . &quot;
&quot; although the inter@@ se@@ ated femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different herds a home and to diver@@ ge themselves from the white femin@@ ism , there is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in his name . &quot;
&quot; I decided to get rid of me full of femin@@ ism and close the movement of the W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was established for my dark skin and my status as a woman , instead of a white femin@@ ist paradig@@ m that is so stu@@ b@@ born than a new phenomenon is celebrated . &quot;
&quot; now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and set ourselves into the spheres , which we are created for us . &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ oth@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ cana wom@@ an@@ ism : how we can defend ourselves , that we can defend ourselves on our own way . and not only that - black women can also create spaces where they can be fully confident and in which the cultural , mental , physical , physical , and even the spiritual elements can be re@@ vered , who make the black woman . &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter@@ se@@ ated femin@@ ist@@ ers will immediately call separ@@ ati@@ cism and exclusion after they have read these lines , please inform yourself about the hy@@ po@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is affected . &quot;
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures because in this paradig@@ m I exist .
I will be recognized because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman as part of this paradig@@ m .
&quot; I , a black woman , can bl@@ oss@@ om in an environment in which my life neither exagger@@ ated , nor ignored . &quot;

Paraguay Women and her difficult struggle against violence
a group of women presents &quot; the we@@ ather@@ ing women &quot; to express their pain on women &apos;s mor@@ als in the country and in the region and show their rejection .

the following article is the abri@@ d@@ ged and edited version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # wei@@ lich@@ ein@@ e@@ ast@@ bin ) which reports about the ant@@ age against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the persons concerned .
&quot; a police comm@@ iss@@ ary said A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez that she had nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , its exile , who has become violent against violent . &quot;
&quot; since the end of her relationship was a little time passed and the police said , her statement would be put to the files , but more could not do . &quot;
&quot; as another woman Bal@@ bu@@ ena showed for failure , useful also the ac@@ ten@@ ant display of A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez nothing . &quot;
a few days later the second woman moved their ad .
breaking the devil @-@ circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; if women do not even refund , they generally do not receive any support from the state . &quot;
&quot; in many cases , women are also financially dependent on men who do mis@@ use . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who must admit victims of violence themselves at all in the prosec@@ ution authorities . &quot;
&quot; inhal@@ ation and Statisti@@ c 2 In@@ visible mis@@ do@@ ings and a legal system , which is nothing short of Paraguay : good approach , defic@@ ient implementation and statistics &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to determine how many women really mis@@ ed , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez , researcher for comrades in the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aci@@ Ã³n y E@@ studios , but not even the scale of the gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
but the figures available are however al@@ ar@@ ming .
&quot; in 2015 , the District Minister 9@@ 600 displays due to domestic violence . at 70 % of it , it was about violence against women . &quot;
86 % of the ads in the police came from women .
there were more than 5000 ads due to domestic violence in peace courts . also here 86 % of the ads of women .
&quot; in the ads , 40 % of women said that they were physically mis@@ ed , 55 % of women spoke of psychological missions . &quot;
&quot; however , these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ical Women &apos;s Minister Ana Bai@@ ard@@ i will actually appear only a few of these off@@ ences in Paraguay . &quot; on every woman , which are re@@ funded in Paraguay because of psych@@ ical failure , are 9 women who do not do this . &quot;
&quot; on every woman who re@@ funded because of physical mi@@ stress , are re@@ funded , are two women who do not do this , &quot; stated in the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; as women &apos;s m@@ ord in Paraguay is not an own criminal off@@ ense , the prosec@@ ution authorities cannot be adequately documented how many women are mur@@ dered each year from their current or former partners . &quot;
journalists alone until August 2016 journalists have at least 12 cases of Frauen@@ ic@@ ide in the country alone .
the co @-@ ordin@@ ator of human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were mur@@ dered by their current or former partners .
&quot; according to their estimates , in Paraguay every ten days a woman suffered due to violence caused by men . &quot;

invisible mi@@ ver@@ ings and a legal system that takes nothing
&quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ Ã­@@ te@@ z was the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that they called him the names of all their former friends . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , she did not want it , but after all , it should always regret it . &quot;
&quot; today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no more with Carlos together . but two years the psychological force in their part - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time recognis@@ able the most severe recogni@@ z@@ able : &quot;
I never thought that I would be victims of failure .
&quot; when I have read earlier about it , I thought that only women has happened to under@@ estimated that they decei@@ ve themselves from violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that I would never happen .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report about the failure by Carlos Vera .
&quot; without name , she wrote posts on Facebook in which they describe his ins@@ ults and different attacks during their two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated them . &quot;
&quot; many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos themselves . he asked rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic , whether he ever raised the hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of failure . &quot;
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had fallen so long by Carlos and left him earlier .
it seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of failure at least have had a certain amount of complic@@ ity .
&quot; Victoria San@@ tos that originates from Paraguay , fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay , to prove that their former partner they mis@@ ed them . &quot;
Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te cre@@ o ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) that consists of women who are all in any way victims of failure .
&quot; in the group , they can talk to others about their experience , listen to each other and support each other . &quot;
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as case everything started with psych@@ ical failure .
&quot; your weal@@ thy partner , even managed it even to convince them that they are worth@@ less . &quot;
then he began to beat them .
Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as ads in the authorities remained without a result and even from their relatives , she received no support . &quot;
&quot; she carried out a trial against their former partner who developed into a und@@ et@@ able legal struggle between Paraguay and their home country , in which it was mainly about money , power and the influence of their former partner . &quot;
&quot; Paraguay &apos;s laws : good approach , defic@@ ient implementation &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good , but not applied . &quot;
&quot; the adver@@ t of mis@@ ses is a way of resistance , and a fight against corruption in the judiciary , &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organisation for women in Paraguay , sees also great problems in applying the laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , a legislation was discussed in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen Parliament , which was known under the has@@ ht@@ ag # Por@@ venir ( # FÃ¼r@@ s ) . &quot;
this has@@ ht@@ ag and the movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # non @-@ e@@ Less ) are part of a campaign on Twitter which is supported by Am@@ nest@@ y International .
the original design of the law sees before the Fem@@ izi@@ d to an independent criminal off@@ end to explain and harder to pun@@ ish as it is already in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia .
&quot; thus , the leg@@ est@@ text was changed in some point in order to also gain the MEPs for the law that will be fear@@ ed that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alization of deport@@ ation , which are currently prohibited in Paraguay and pun@@ ished with up to five years in prison . &quot;
&quot; the original bill of legislation had planned , most of the ( bureaucr@@ atic and economic ) procedures that have to bear the victims of violence present themselves , if they simply have to refund and receive a secure accommodation to aband@@ on the state . &quot;
&quot; Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective , if the leg@@ is@@ lat@@ ure does not provide sufficient financial resources for it : &quot;
in Paraguay &apos;s failure is seen as part of inter@@ human relationships .
&quot; here , a change must take place , so that violence is no longer seen as some Nor@@ mal . &quot;
&quot; those considering this facts , is involved and contributes to the perpet@@ rat@@ ors of the perpet@@ rat@@ ors . &quot;
we have to refund so long display until mis@@ use is no longer considered normal .
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the law of the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen Senate had been adopted by the law in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen Senate . previously , parts of the law had changed however , among other things , a passage in cases of domestic violence against reconciliation . &quot;
the opinions on the changes go apart .
&quot; the section concerning reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity for Agg@@ res@@ sor , to attack his victims again . &quot;
&quot; the sub@@ missions of the words &quot; &quot; gender &quot; , &quot; political force &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; &quot; from parts of the law is considered a great retreat . &quot;

independent media in O@@ man will continue a year after the ban on a paper .
&quot; this website was closed due to a resolution of the information &quot; Minister , &quot; on the homepage of the Forbidden Zeitung Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
more than one year ago the om@@ ic authorities have closed the independent Arab @-@ speaking newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of its reporting about corruption in the Sult@@ ant .
&quot; You@@ Ã³@@ z@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in prison , where he is a year @-@ year prison . &quot;
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and asked to judge later . &quot;
&quot; O@@ man has been ruled by Sult@@ an Q@@ ab@@ us Ib@@ n S@@ aid , who came to power since he had given his father , S@@ aid Ib@@ n T@@ aim@@ ur , by a state of State . &quot;
&quot; since then , he then dres@@ sed , in addition to his role as the only Sult@@ an , the most important apples in the country : Prime Minister , Defense Minister , Foreign Minister , Foreign Minister , Foreign Ministers , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank . &quot;
&quot; the rule of sult@@ ans is characterized by the persistent efforts of the security forces , in particular the domestic secrecy , including freedom of freedom , including freedom of freedom , including freedom of press , blo@@ gger , and further activists , wo@@ unded , and further activists . &quot;
&quot; the authorities limit peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights systematically and hin@@ dering citizens , also activists , their views on the public affairs of the country such as corruption in government agencies and institutions both online and offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , their closure and the incidence of three of their editors in the last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country . &quot;
&quot; Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper , which has been reported about corruption in O@@ man ( an absolute mon@@ archy ) until it was prohibited by the authorities in August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 28 July 2016 , security forces of I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i , since the newspaper was published on 26 July 2016 an article with the title &quot; &quot; high @-@ ranking parties &quot; hands of the judiciary &quot; . &quot; it was about corruption in the alignment , and the interference of high @-@ level officials in judicial decisions . &quot;
&quot; in the report , government officials mentioned , judge of the Supreme Court in O@@ man have set under pressure to stand a sentence in an inheritance dispute . &quot;
&quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , 26 July 2016 with a report on the title page with the heading : &quot; high @-@ ranking parties bind hands of the judiciary . &quot;

&quot; on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , a member of the Committee of the Committee , was loaded from the ISS and arrested on his arrival by the security forces . &quot;
on 9 August 2016 the ISS devoted to the dep@@ uty @-@ fre@@ d@@ ak@@ te@@ ur You@@ Ã³@@ z@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ em@@ is fixed as a che@@ ap@@ d@@ ak@@ te@@ ur .
&quot; the paper was closed at some time after the information minister had given the statement that &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper on any way , including online , from 9 August 2016 prohibited . &quot;
on 26 September 2016 he took place before the court in Mas@@ k@@ at the first trial in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i . &quot;
the court condemned the three journalists to pris@@ ons and ord@@ ained the final closure of the newspaper .
&quot; Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both among others because of the disorder of the public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; and &quot; sub@@ stan@@ tive of the state of the state . &quot;
Al @-@ Ha@@ j was also found guilty of the violation of an audience and the distor@@ tion for guilty .
Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three @-@ year @-@ old @-@ old co@@ aches and banknotes in the amount of each 3000 om@@ ic ri@@ al ( 78@@ 00 US dollar ) . in addition there was a year @-@ old profession offered against both journalists .
&quot; Al @-@ Abr@@ i was condemned to a year of prison and money in the amount of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 2600 US dollars ) , after making use of a information network for the distribution of material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
&quot; for Al @-@ G@@ Å@@ sh@@ i , a security deposit of 5000 om@@ ic Ri@@ al ( 13 000 US dollars ) was fixed and he was released on 22 August 2016 before the judgment of judgment . &quot;
&quot; the Court of Ap@@ pe@@ al spoke of Al @-@ Abr@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but condemned Al @-@ Ha@@ j to a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i to six months of prison . &quot;
Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i was released on 10 April 2017 after the gradu@@ ation of his six@@ teen prison sentence in Mas@@ k@@ at . Al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison where he ex@@ alt@@ ed his sentence .
the Ap@@ pe@@ al Court also raised the decision of the Ministry of Finance to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; despite the decision of the Court , Az@@ am@@ n again , the newspaper looks like attacks by the om@@ anian government . &quot;
&quot; on 8 January , the Information Ministers passed an instruction with which the closure of &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; was extended by three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the information Minister personally signed another statement in which the closure of &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; was extended by three additional months , and thus the Minister presented another time against the decision of the Court , the publication of the newspaper again . &quot;
&quot; the continuous closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where in O@@ man has been inju@@ red , press freedom . &quot;
&quot; for further injury , the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to stop its operation . &quot;
&quot; because of the constant closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the incidence of the journalists Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ ic authorities are still not ready to prepare an end to the press of press freedom . &quot;
&quot; the Golf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the om@@ ic authorities : &quot;
1 . You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and uncondi@@ tionally free ;
&quot; 2 . create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , so that their journalists can go up in their work ; &quot;
3. to protect the press freedom in the country and
&quot; 4 under all circumstances to ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in O@@ man will have their right@@ ful human rights work , and without fear of exposure measures , including straight@@ ening sc@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; the Golf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization , the human rights def@@ enders ( also independent journalists , blo@@ gger , attor@@ neys , etc . ) in the Gulf region and the right to gather peaceful and protect them . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understanding
&quot; Ran@@ j@@ it war@@ ri@@ ans 2016 in Zambia , figure is done with his consent . &quot;
medical research in Africa is only rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media . this is an increasing area that addresses one of the urgent needs of the continent .
&quot; there are two reasons for the need for medi@@ ated medical research , there are two reasons : to have a lack of global health for many medicines and vacc@@ ines which cover the special medical need on the African continent . &quot;
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis and mal@@ aria have in the poorest countries of Africa far more serious impacts than elsewhere , and lack of investment for the research of these diseases by the pharmaceutical firms are a big problem . &quot;
&quot; secondly , research which is conducted by African scientists themselves , in building their own research capacity in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be beneficial for the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it war@@ ri@@ ans is director of the centr@@ all@@ ors , at the Center for exploration of inf@@ ectious diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR@@ Z ) . &quot;
&quot; he grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epide@@ mic first serious impact on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Zambia for studying in the United States , initially in Lou@@ is@@ iana , later in Indi@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania he himself decided on HIV virus , before he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ bian health system . &quot;
with Global Vo@@ ices Dr. war@@ ned about the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understanding of the media about this research .
( disclaimer : Dr. war@@ er speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it war@@ ri@@ ans R@@ W : at the moment the focus of my work on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ bian national program for anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
&quot; in addition , I have just started a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant disease . &quot;
speed : what do you think about the important current scientific debate in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
R@@ W : there is no basic research . we only set solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
&quot; this has to change , otherwise we will always remain recei@@ vers , rather than ourselves Mach@@ er . &quot;
&quot; the solutions that we get are often not suitable in our surroundings , and sometimes it is even impossible to use it here . &quot;
GV : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable researchers for the projects ?
R@@ W : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are varied differently .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or here , because funding and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot;
GV : how is research infrastructure ?
which obstacles are there in your routine research work which you had previously not had ?
&quot; R@@ W : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money , a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet . &quot;
&quot; laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries . &quot;
GV : how is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
&quot; R@@ W : there are already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods . &quot;
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; GV : how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus on , and how can we support the development ? &quot;
R@@ W : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students from all ages .
&quot; there is need of special scientific training , starting at any age . &quot;
&quot; social sciences , computer sciences , big data , research of space , the health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and cont@@ agi@@ ous diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it . &quot;
&quot; GV , you can describe us the pros and cons of life as scientists in Africa from Western countries based on your experience ? &quot;
&quot; R@@ W : often there are the limited speed , things to do , and access to scientific expertise that represent challenges here . &quot;
&quot; the system that magazines articles can only be accessible by payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limited the amount of availability and the speed of research . &quot;

&quot; for nearly 20 years , Mor@@ tons &apos;s work was only set by its own random and the question how many sal@@ at@@ ers can get boundaries . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of the 2000@@ s , he than@@ ked that ever more sal@@ ads were patented and that he could not use them on . &quot;
&quot; the patents have not only used for individual varieties , but also for certain properties like resistance to diseases , a special red or green or curved leaves . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , more and more of such patents have been registered in more and more plants such as grain and card sites . due to this trend , plant bree@@ ders , environ@@ ment@@ alist and experts ensure the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as a passionate representatives of a m@@ illen@@ nia , Mor@@ ton is still Sal@@ at , he now needs no longer because his work is more and more limitations . &quot;
&quot; it is , when it would lie in a river a rock bro@@ ker to which I have to her@@ ed down . &quot;
&quot; so we have to do that now , but it is a break with the breeding @-@ tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; I think that these patents go on sal@@ ads too far . &quot;
&quot; and if they stand in court , nobody can breeding more a new salad , because all features are already patented , so it is doing so good as possible and tried to breed the characteristics that he wants . &quot;
&quot; however , it is very careful and stri@@ ves to use no material , which is protected as intellectual property . &quot;
&quot; he also joined a movement that is becoming ever greater in the United States and everywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;

&quot; it is not a coinci@@ dence that this name sounds like it sounds , as if the motion comes from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding . &quot;
&quot; open source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; open source &quot; &quot; seeds ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software , the alternatives are provided by copyright protected software . &quot;
&quot; it was called into life to ensure that some plants and gene not be protected as intellectual property , and so for plant bree@@ ders are permanent . &quot;
&quot; in the framework of the initiative , shortly Os@@ si , the US bree@@ ders can commit themselves to be freely able to use the seed seed of them . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed , and they can sell it . &quot; open source &quot; bree@@ ders allow only others to breed it to breed , to breed , and it can not be used immediately - two aspects that are prohibited by many plant pat@@ ches or prescribed . &quot;
doz@@ ens of bree@@ ders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
per@@ stra@@ des prospects
&quot; for the cerem@@ onial Professor of the University of Wis@@ cons@@ in @-@ Ma@@ dison and Os@@ si @-@ Vor@@ committee Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control over the seed and the opportunity to breed new plants as well as for environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; seed plays a role in larger compositions like biodiversity , rights of peasants , control over the nutri@@ ent system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bree@@ ders would try to use the latter or only little to use it seed with natural resistance . &quot;
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphasized that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement is not busy with gene@@ tically modified plants .
&quot; all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , cor@@ als , gene@@ tically modified , and Mon@@ san@@ to and Mon@@ san@@ to and Mon@@ san@@ to and Mon@@ san@@ to and Mon@@ san@@ to and Bayer products , which is offered in August or September 2016 . &quot; who is good , local and sustainable producing vegetables , should also know that the way it is bre@@ d as such vegetables bre@@ d , is threatened . &quot;

&quot; the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative will commit themselves freely to its seed , to offer others its seed and to pat@@ ori@@ ze its action as opposed to seed and plant characteristics . &quot;

&quot; Os@@ si @-@ supporters argu@@ ed that the future of food supply is endangered , since the available gene pool due to the ever more diverse intellectual property rights on plant material , which therefore is always limited to reduced . &quot;
&quot; Claire Lu@@ by , executive director of Os@@ si , has been involved in their doctoral thesis with gene@@ ous variation with gene@@ tics and their availability . it found out that about a third of all cart@@ oons are protected as intellectual property , causing it to plant bree@@ ders either at all or only value . &quot;
&quot; for other plants there are such estimates yet , but experts like Lu@@ by susp@@ ected that mascul@@ ine @-@ built plants like whe@@ at in even bigger style patented as sal@@ at or car@@ r@@ ots . &quot;
a question of view
&quot; plants are so bre@@ d that they have targeted characteristics - from such , by which their taste or colour improves up to such , due to which they must be kept in certain environments and threats such as p@@ ests or diseases . &quot;
&quot; opponents of patents on plant properties point out that the available plant material for bree@@ ders increases through more and more patents . genetic diversity is currently more unnecessary than ever before , since the changed conditions are much worse than ever since the changing conditions . &quot;
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ Spe@@ aker Car@@ ly S@@ ca@@ du@@ to , that genetic variety is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ tos activities . with a total of four gen@@ ders and cooperation with institutions such as the agricultural ministry of the United States , the company re@@ lies for the conservation of genetic diversity . &quot;
&quot; however , they contra@@ dic@@ ated that intellectual property rights other bre@@ eder cabinets , since &quot; patents and the protection of plant vari@@ etal innovations promote innovation . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically taken a plan which is up to everyone as soon as the patent is ex@@ pi@@ red . &quot;
often these instructions help others to come to the same result .
&quot; so , such protection inhi@@ bits innovations not , but encourages them to be provided by the public more material and know @-@ how . &quot;
Mor@@ ton looks different : 20 years to wait until a patent of strap is certainly no innovations .
&quot; and if you wait for a long time to breed , to breed plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , one could have lost the fight . &quot;
&quot; however , the main argument for Mor@@ ton is that genetic resources always have been a general well and we should continue to stay : &quot; &quot; independent plant bree@@ ders have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ ary incentives for us are not attractive . &quot;
we want to make farmers their work easier .
&quot; this is what drives us , and it will not make us impossible when we continue to use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot;
&quot; in total , Mor@@ ton has listened to the concept to patented , plant features : &quot; we create the characteristics not really themselves . &quot;
&quot; plants are formed by themselves and as bre@@ eder , we finally have no cl@@ ue how the plants do that . &quot;
a secret of nature .
&quot; for Caro@@ l Dep@@ pe , plant breeding in the U.S. state Oregon and Os@@ si &apos;s member states , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; who has bre@@ d a sort of breeding , bre@@ d his own values in them . &quot;
those who believe in industrial agriculture with great cour@@ ty@@ ards and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures will be needed for the cultivation of mass her@@ bic@@ ol@@ ds to grow in its varieties of this concept of agriculture .
my concept is accurate . &quot;
&quot; while some medium @-@ sized enterprises ( such , which are moving on international markets , but smaller than for example Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , even without patents to survive - either we reject it too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both is the case . &quot;
the independent plant breeding Frank Mor@@ ton is looking for in his name garden Sal@@ ads .

&quot; Mor@@ ton is also the view that bre@@ eder resulting from the prevention of plants of innovative would : &quot; &quot; it looks like I am with my efforts to produce new , stronger than companies , the patented . &quot;
&quot; I need to keep a new material for my catalog since I know that my competitors is being used for a few years , &quot; &quot; says he . &quot; &quot; with a patent it is 20 years ahead of competition so that it is very nice to make it really nice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; although the US seem to be leaders in the &quot; open source &quot; &quot; breeding leader , the concept has spread itself rapidly throughout the world . &quot;
&quot; in India the centre for sustainable agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which focuses itself as a professional organization in the area of resources , a &quot; open source &quot; seed program . &quot;
it also supports them to come to &quot; open source &quot; seed and sell their own .
&quot; the German Organisation Agre@@ col is working on an &quot; open source &quot; license , which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of Os@@ si &apos;s obligation for bree@@ ders in the European Union . &quot;
( regulations for bree@@ ders differ from country to country where Os@@ si &apos;s obligation cannot simply become one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
&quot; at the beginning of November 2016 , the Executive Committee of the European Union , the European Commission , declar@@ es that conventional plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . thus , she speaks against the current practice of the European Patent At@@ am@@ ts , the patents on conventional plants . &quot;
&quot; however , a statement is not a law ; now it is on governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 the Dutch organisation H@@ iv@@ os hosted a conference on &quot; open source &quot; &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , on the farmers , operators of seeds , NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards the pat@@ enting of seeds . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for H@@ iv@@ os &apos; programme for &quot; open source &quot; &quot; seed systems , that the organisation is currently a worldwide alliance for &quot; open source &quot; &quot; seed systems that will fall next year of the official start shot . &quot;
&quot; a consortium of environmental protection and development groups ( including H@@ iv@@ os , the international Non@@ profit organisation US@@ C Canada and the Action Group to ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database on seeds and biodiversity worldwide to publish a seed map , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food - a combination of aid organizations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - a report published that farmers have the opportunity to get there and improve and improve seed policy thus ensuring a stable supply of food products . &quot;
&quot; in the report also emphasized the importance of a diverse , local care with seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection , from the Lu@@ by Os@@ si hopes to see him soon more people . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has especially respected , where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role in doing so Lu@@ by . &quot; we are trying to make the people clear that even more behind their foods . &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the newest goals of the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in Egypt
still the Egyptian authorities on the internet .
this time we met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a column .
&quot; on the weekend at the end of August , the Egyptian government has documented the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ H@@ RI ) , which documents human rights ab@@ uses in Egypt and the Arab world , and reported about it . &quot;
August published the network a statement on Facebook in which it cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed the Egyptian authorities for this step and said to continue the work and efforts of human rights in the region .
&quot; the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ab@@ bt@@ edness - despite this attack and the constitution of the Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities , as it was never as difficult as now . AN@@ H@@ RI affir@@ med that all technical possibilities should be exhausted , so it was not yet so difficult to overcome these goals and not admit that we continue to fulfil our task . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ H@@ RI is considered the first c@@ ens@@ ored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt , after the authorities in front of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Mas@@ r , Arab @-@ speaking issue of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the German @-@ speaking network of Al Jaz@@ e@@ era due to the alleg@@ ed &quot; support of terrorism &quot; . &quot; &quot;

besides AN@@ H@@ RI also exists on the blog of the Kolum@@ ni@@ sts and human rights research gene@@ alogy Ah@@ med Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada no access to Egypt .
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the spread of columns and articles that he does not write for Egypt &apos;s websites and media .
&quot; now the blog , which he found in order to deal with the sover@@ eign apparatus of the Egyptian government , even target of an attack . &quot;
&quot; blo@@ gger , the provider in which also Zi@@ adas blog is located , on the other hand is further accessible . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in cap@@ tivity after he was arrested in December 2013 of Egyptian security vulner@@ abilities , while he recorded over the student protests and took a video like the police of physical violence against two students . &quot;
his articles are mainly about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada expressed himself to the blocking of the government and refl@@ ecting what this means for him : &quot;
&quot; the , blogs is very old , however , has been priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi priority ; and even if the blocking of the blog may not be significant for the world , it is however for two reasons for me : &quot;
&quot; 1 ) It has succeeded to convey to me the feeling of an ins@@ urrection ; a arrest , an attempt at the national Security Council , the blocking blogs as well as any other website , for whom I worked . &quot;
&quot; 2 ) You have proven that I have not written in v@@ ain . in other words , my words have influence , if only on a small audience . &quot;
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it to post articles in order to handle the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship .
&quot; however , after they have blocked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the brave walk the way up to the end .
&quot; according to the Association for Freedom of thought and Ex@@ pression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian authorities from 24th May to 06@@ th August 133 websites . this con@@ dit@@ ch technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provider ( IS@@ P ) , including orange , Vod@@ af@@ one and E@@ tis@@ al@@ at . &quot;
&quot; AF@@ TE documented also the blocking of providers , through the transformation of Intern@@ ship or@@ ship and private surfing possible , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s ) &quot;
AF@@ TE reported in their research :
&quot; on Monday , 12 June noted , we like the blocking of websites that began V@@ P@@ N@@ s , began . &quot;
such practice refers to the intention of the government to continue to block and filter content to the Egyptian users .
&quot; the situation will additionally be wast@@ ed that the c@@ ens@@ ur@@ lings are made behind closed doors , making the Egyptian people no legal basis , using judgment against these actions . &quot;
now the question : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and whom will it be next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?

some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ ol@@ ds in school shed , &quot; &quot; Y@@ eden second day will be a police officers in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; Di@@ eves harsh pharmacy with military weapons from &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , Marine and Lu@@ ba@@ ja to Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the V@@ al@@ tw@@ elle in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years . &quot;
&quot; the Brazilian @-@ governmental organization of Global Justice called even the United Nations , interven@@ e . &quot;
reports like these are all daily and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; find at least the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; published the detailed coverage of violence in Rio known newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; on 16 August the editorial &quot; &quot; This is not normal &quot; &quot; in which she announced a new section called &quot; War in Rio &quot; . &quot; &quot;
all reports of violence in the city will now be published there .
the moti@@ fs for their decision explained the newspaper so :
&quot; extra will continue to report on crime which will happen in any major city on earth such as murder , rob@@ ber@@ al , and what only happens in Rio , will be published in the category &quot; War in Rio &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal ! &quot;
&quot; this is the only alternative , so that we do not close our eyes before the atro@@ cities . &quot;
&quot; in an Vietnam@@ ese video that was divided on Facebook , said Oc@@ t@@ Ã¡@@ vio Gu@@ e@@ des , the chief Minister of the newspaper that this decision has no reason for pride , but rather a sign of failure : &quot;
&quot; extra is probably the only newspaper around the world , with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that doesn &apos;t recognise the war . &quot;
&quot; in the same video a journalist of the paper declar@@ es that it is based on the data of the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro , which are controlled by criminal organizations . &quot;
in the editorial article the newspaper writes :
&quot; it is deliber@@ ately aware that a war course , if he is distor@@ ted , also used , atro@@ cities of the police , which is only sho@@ ots and then questions imagine . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose objective is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Maf@@ ia and its partners . &quot;
does the name &quot; war &quot; more than they used ?
&quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept The Inter@@ cept Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira against it , the violence as &quot; war &quot; . &quot; &quot; this is their opinion a justification of the failed security policy through the media and could make it difficult to account responsible for the police to account . &quot;
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as extra during the analysis of the military systems in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel , education and a historical and self @-@ suff@@ iciency of the public service . &quot;
&quot; to remember , the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than just his capital . &quot;

&quot; Rio de Janeiro , as &quot; call Rio de Janeiro , &quot; according to Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia , &quot; &quot; 22 of 30 non @-@ violent cities in Brazil lie down according to statistics of 2015 in the north and north @-@ east of the country . these are the most recent data available . &quot;
none of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; when we look at the record rates per federal state , Rio to No. 16 , &quot; writes them . &quot;
&quot; extra belongs to the company Glo@@ bo , the largest media company of South America , which emphasises , like Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia , since years the security policy of the state has been repeated since years . &quot;
&quot; these security policy measures also belonged to the foundation of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ Ã­@@ cia Paci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the federal state Rio in 2003 , whose aim is to conquer a F@@ av@@ ela and to make a unity permanently there . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , this actually led to a hom@@ ep@@ r@@ ape of deaths . for some years , U@@ PP , however , after several reports on gravel and repres@@ sions against the poor churches that should actually protect the newly created police unit , increasingly under complaint . &quot;
&quot; on his Facebook page , the journalist Jo@@ Ã£o Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux from one of his articles from 2010 , in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not comply with the &quot; &quot; Civil War &quot; &quot; - criteria for the name &quot; civil war &quot; . &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war draws serious consequences for people . &quot;
&quot; for this demands the state on the means and paths that are typical of a war . this is the intru@@ sion into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; in which a civil is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and to the object for &quot; coll@@ ater@@ al damage &quot; and &quot; scattered spheres &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; war , or her , fact is that the inhabitants of F@@ av@@ elas continues to suffer in Rio . &quot;
&quot; a week it is now that the police are the mountain with the F@@ av@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho , to the death of a polic@@ emen . &quot;

&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the following civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal exposure and block@@ ades , mainly through the Assad regime towards loyal troops . &quot;
&quot; according to vic@@ tories , a joint initiative of the Peace Organization pax and the Research Institute The Institute , H@@ oms , D@@ ei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ lib currently around a million Sy@@ rer in a state of popularity . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the Eastern Gh@@ out@@ a region is particularly affected by the East Gh@@ out@@ a , where an attack with chemical weapons on August 21 , 2013 called for hundreds of civilians . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition assume that the mass@@ ac@@ re exer@@ ting the mass@@ ac@@ re from Assad regime . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , these have been controlled by reb@@ els controlled areas outside Damascus under expos@@ ing , which led to local residents on local or through tunnels and control points . &quot;
&quot; through years of long block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ attain@@ able for large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; as a counter @-@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and academ@@ ics , the inhabitants of the East Gh@@ out@@ as , as they can plant their own mushrooms as &quot; life @-@ saving food source &quot; . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ y@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
&quot; mushrooms do not belong to conventional , in Syria and are only extremely rare part of Syrian cuisine . your food fulness makes it an attractive food source for many residents of the bes@@ ieg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the direc@@ ting of the project , Ab@@ o N@@ ab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P : &quot;
&quot; we decided to cultiv@@ ate the cultivation of mush@@ room because they have a high nutri@@ ent value , similar to meat and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ah@@ med L@@ eil@@ a , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices , that has been fighting for three years , this project has been announced and proved its relief that it now wins more and more &quot; . &quot; &quot;

Portuguese and justice for the victims of the Br@@ lands of 2017
several hundred men prot@@ ested on October 21st in many districts cities in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of fires that were gr@@ ated in the north of Portugal .
&quot; two @-@ four people died , and approximately 70 were inju@@ red as a result of the forest fires of 15th and 16th October . this led to the government &apos;s final week from solidarity with the victims for 3 days . &quot;
fires were also registered in the region of Gali@@ zi@@ en in Spain where there were 4 t@@ ote .
&quot; it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire@@ out@@ breaks , spread across the northern and central regions of the country and reached approximately 250 million acres of forest and numerous villages . &quot;
in June Pedr@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o Grande a similar tragedy where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 survi@@ vor@@ s .
&quot; according to the European for@@ estry system , which monitors the forest @-@ surfaces by satellite recording , are burned alone in Portugal about 500,000 acres of forest - an area of the size of the district of Lisbon . &quot;
so that you can make a better picture of the Ernst of the Location : there is only in 4 districts no fire .

the fores@@ ee@@ able tragedy
the aim of the protests from Saturday was the demand for better pre@@ ven@@ ing and fire fighting measures by the state .
&quot; people asked themselves why the civil protection was not able to do the extent of the tragedy as far as possible . &quot;
Jo@@ Ã£o Sover@@ al of the Federal Republic of farmers from Portugal declared the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ bli@@ co :
&quot; after Pedr@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o , streets and villages were ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ated for everything and nothing ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; this Sunday they did this nowhere : there are doz@@ ens of open roads , which were surrounded by fire . &quot;
&quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria could have been able to pass a similar tragedy , as in June the streets were very late . &quot;
&quot; in addition , building contractors will be ques@@ tioned with high bran@@ ch@@ iko . &quot;
&quot; a broad proposal to the whale @-@ form , which brought the government to serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was promoted by the municipalities which saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment . &quot;
&quot; the government led an ath@@ ing of the law , which allowed the component of case to fall , if the applic@@ ant could be built about means of self @-@ protection - that was an open rear door , so that everything was built , Jo@@ Ã£o Sor@@ val in the same article of the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ bli@@ co further . &quot;
&quot; the environmental organisation Quer@@ cus made attentive to that large areas with Eu@@ cal@@ yp@@ tus , trees made of slightly burning wood , as in a Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ ate circle , after the walls of this species further spread . &quot;
&quot; for these problems , the website of the civil protection of Portugal on the 15th and 16th of October , as a resident information sear@@ ched or tried to contact relatives , offline was . &quot;
&quot; it was a private initiative that provide the population with information : they used the own civil protection data with the application f@@ ogos@@ .@@ pt , and informed the population in real time about the site and the spread of the fires . &quot;
&quot; the project was launched in 2015 by the developers Jo@@ Ã£o P@@ ina , in order to simplify the work of fire bri@@ g@@ ade and became that the server of the 400@@ m of the 400@@ .000 users who followed the fires , did not exceed the site more than half a million access . &quot;

in a night in autumn 1994 the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban .
&quot; two years before was a terrible civil war between the various Mu@@ jah@@ ed@@ in group@@ ings , which had defe@@ ated the short @-@ Soviet government . thus , Afghanistan became a land of terror and desp@@ air . &quot;
&quot; at this time A@@ shar@@ f Bar@@ ati joined Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year boy , which belongs to the ethnic group of H@@ az@@ ara , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central af@@ gh@@ istan , for the last time with his family at dinner . &quot;
&quot; even if his mother didn &apos;t say it so , so she knew that she would not see her son for a long time - maybe even more . &quot;
in the dawn should break the boy .
his unc@@ le would pick him up and bring him to the tractor .

&quot; Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the party He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat had just been mur@@ dered by the Taliban and many H@@ az@@ ara suddenly felt prot@@ ection@@ lessly . &quot;
the Taliban on H@@ az@@ ara known Taliban arrived ever closer .
many H@@ az@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape took A@@ shar@@ af in Pakistan again .
a couple of years he worked in a co@@ ar@@ tery . the work was heavy and made it sick .
then he took what was left of his low wage ; and went in Iran . once again he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and tow@@ ed sacks with mur@@ ders who were harder than he himself to earn his life .
&quot; at that time , the life of af@@ gh@@ an@@ ic refugees in Iran was dominated by mis@@ erable and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really hard &quot; &quot; rec@@ alled A@@ shar@@ af in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in a le@@ ashed building on the construction site , on which we also worked . &quot;
there was no services and no heating there . we hanging n@@ ylon in front of the open windows so that we do not er@@ fr@@ y at night .
after four years A@@ shar@@ af did his life without papers in Iran and made ready for the trip to Europe .
&quot; in the dangerous crossing over the sea , he suffered cru@@ de and stran@@ ded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island . &quot;
&quot; after the Greek authorities had rejected its asylum application , A@@ shar@@ af 2002 came to Italy . &quot;
&quot; some time was A@@ shar@@ af homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church which had dinner twice a day of food . &quot;
&quot; it is true that Italy due to relatively high ir@@ ill@@ ings quot@@ a is a sort of second chance for exp@@ elled asylum seekers . it is true but also that the conditions , asylum seekers in the country can be found , cat@@ astrop@@ hic . &quot;
&quot; the human rights organisation of civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system &quot; suff@@ ers under a general lack of transparency . &quot;
&quot; the vast majority of asylum seekers will be accommodated in the more than 3000 &quot; special recording centers . &quot;
&quot; according to Italian Law , asylum seekers can only be assigned to an admission centre if they officially asked an application on Asyl@@ um - what can be said after the registration of the asylum seeker . &quot;
&quot; until then , people who have no money for an accommodation , either on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street . &quot;
as heard it also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his un@@ conscious life @-@ w@@ ille helped A@@ shar@@ af to free from these conditions soon .
&quot; after spending several years , various works in the construction sector had made a shar@@ pen@@ ing its entire savings in the establishment of a hostel in Venice . &quot;
this was so good that he opened after a while still a second hostel and a schn@@ el@@ li@@ mb@@ iss opened .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ f Bar@@ atis success story is now on the documentation &quot; &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a H@@ az@@ ara in Italy &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; behind Venetian luxury - an H@@ az@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director Cav@@ id@@ i . &quot;

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
&quot; much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to the official estimates , about 20,000 Afghanistan in Italy . &quot;
&quot; for many of them , the country is a transition solution on the way to other European countries . &quot;
&quot; in recent years several of Afghanistan , including tail@@ ors , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice Ham@@ ed Ah@@ m@@ adi had the idea to his restaurant Orient Experience in which the wa@@ iter and the kitchen staff made mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
&quot; the restaurant &apos;s menu is told by the various af@@ oods , Ira@@ qi , Turkish and Greek courts , the history of their trip to Italy . &quot;
the Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali Kh@@ an Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Padua the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Pizzeria Kab@@ ul@@ og@@ na in Bologna and an Sus@@ hi Restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
&quot; however , A@@ shar@@ per &apos;s goals reach far beyond the Italian Gastronom@@ y and the retail , and aim back to the country that he had to leave a teen@@ ager as a teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; where a risk is , are also opportunities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ f with a smile . &quot; &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
&quot; I never forget my country and I cannot live happy , when I know that my people suffer . &quot;
&quot; I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces in the country , especially for women . &quot;
they represent half of society and must get the same possibilities as all the others .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ f lubri@@ cated also plans for opening a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and conservation techniques . &quot; &quot; this way they can sell their seri@@ ousness on the market and improve their financial situation . &quot;
&quot; the development of successful entrepreneurs was a journey through uncertainty and doubts , but at the end stand stability and prosperity . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af did this journey itself . now he also wants to help other Afghanistan on this path .

&quot; Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ tizen report is an international snapshot , the challenges , vic@@ tories and forthcoming trends in global Internet rights &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Egyptian parliament checks for a legislative draft , which means that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration in a government agency . &quot;
users would have to use to use social networks within six months after successful law enforcement on the website of the authority under specification of their full name as well as its output number .
those who suffer this step may be condemned to up to six months imprisonment or to condemn the end of a criminal install@@ ment .
&quot; the law , which was promoted by six@@ ty parliamentary members , is currently on legislative and constitutional Committee of the Parliament , and shall be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; May , another member of parliament proposal would be introduced in the tough@@ er pen@@ alties for the ins@@ ult of the president or a high officials . &quot;
&quot; under Egyptian law , the popularity of the President as well as state institutions have already been stra@@ ined . under the legislative proposal would be such an act with pris@@ ons and money la@@ under@@ fen , as legal experts of Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot;
&quot; should the law be adopted , this may mean up to three years in prison for the condemned . &quot;
&quot; moreover , this would be a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and assembly of freedom has already been in danger for many years . &quot;
&quot; a striking example is the case of Egyptian photographers Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ id ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who were arrested on 13 August 2013 when he demonstrated violence against demonstr@@ ators , who had taken the elected president of Moh@@ am@@ med Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan wa@@ ited as much more than 700 prot@@ rac@@ ers , who were arrested at the same incident , four years in cu@@ sto@@ dy on a Court of courts . &quot;
&quot; recently , his trial began on 20 May , because the pris@@ ons lead to human rights groups to bring the def@@ endants of prison in the court hall . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree on the head@@ load of amongst others arms , illegal assembly , murder and tried to pass . &quot;
in another case a criminal court spoke in G@@ iza the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Barb@@ ary . they were indic@@ ted for their coverage of pro @-@ Mor@@ si sitting block on the Rab@@ a &apos; a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya square in C@@ airo .
&quot; the Court also reduced the pen@@ alties of the journalists Ab@@ dul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mu@@ st@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , which were also arrested in the previously mentioned incident , from 25 years to 5 years . &quot;
tun@@ ic activ@@ ist activists to all of the documents
&quot; May , Tunis@@ ian authorities spent six hours with the hÃ¶@@ r of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , which co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at as well as the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy project . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia was mainly supported by the President of the Republic , according to the plan expressly granted a contro@@ versi@@ al legislation , the business@@ men and during the former regime , by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine by the corruption of the corruption proclaimed by dic@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine by Ali of corruption . &quot;
&quot; the document published on 21 April on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at , th@@ rows a light on how the pre@@ si@@ di@@ als plans to support the law@@ suit . &quot;
Ben G@@ har@@ bia crossed the nam@@ ing of his sources under specification of Article 11 of the Tunis@@ ian press release from which journalists sec@@ ures the right to protect their sources .
&quot; nevertheless , he joined the District Court in Tunis on 09 . May as witness in the case . &quot;
will China force the users of social media to present their credit card ?
&quot; according to new regulations of the public office of the People &apos;s Republic of China , users need social media in China to write or share messages in social media . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the registration will be required to register with full re@@ als name . &quot;
analy@@ st susp@@ ect that such as the elimination of anonymous comments can be reached within social networks . it is up to now un@@ clear how the authorities apply these regulations .
&quot; Chinese network citizens proposed in social media , these regulations can only be sel@@ ective in order to protect the citizen journ@@ alism and its independence . &quot;

&quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or acci@@ dentally fallen We@@ chat , to register at the provincial government as &quot; organizer of the information distribution &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this term is part of a law from the year 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government guides a list of online services which allows the &quot; publication of the information &quot; , &quot; said services for removing content and force them on request for the suspension of user data . &quot;
&quot; these pages are currently part of websites like V@@ contacts and Od@@ no@@ od@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the image board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service mail@@ .ru and doz@@ ens of other services . &quot;

&quot; it is the first time that Turkey blocks the website completely blocked . it is in addition to China , one of the few countries worldwide , where access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot;
