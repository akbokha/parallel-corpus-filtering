<seg id="1">"although I had visited the USA for at least once a year, I would now live there for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love of America is extremely big.</seg>
<seg id="4">"like many of my generation I have grown up with American films, I have read American music, American authors and operated his sport."</seg>
<seg id="5">"indeed, this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly because of a American film journalist."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, like he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican, with the help of Julia Roberts as Jura-Stunaten the moriderian conspiracy of a oil stomach, who were interested in finding his interest."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"free after method Man," it was, as if that is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that is what I want to do with my life. "</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year that I lived in Arizona had only strengthened my admiration for the USA.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I always said:" "America is the only country where I have ever lived whose diversity is so inviting that you are always who you are and it's easy to find acceptance within a community of like-minded people."</seg>
<seg id="11">I had even written a very dirty love of his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">A lot was written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me as he goes with his bottdies.</seg>
<seg id="15">"he never keeps his opinion behind the mountain, how to say so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="16">"he says exactly what he thinks about how a former colleague has expressed, and explains publicly his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afrosinans and women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, people responded to his statements and voted for him."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the 13 million voices, which he won by the republican elections, was the highest number that was nominated by the party nominate candidate."</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">"who are the Americans who support these bigotte person, I asked me?"</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not bring my voters with the people that I met in Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">"as for example, Dr. Bill Silcock, Director of the journalism programme that takes people from all over the world, a deep believer man, with whom I was talking about Islam and his past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"also voted Trumps World illustration not with the author of Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the" Cincinnati Inquirer "." "</seg>
<seg id="24">"Bhatia and I met us with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours with it to watch the" Phoenix "" in the game. "</seg>
<seg id="25">"Trumps intolerance also stands in contrast to the generosity that I lived at Sandy Bahr who fought for her life for the environment, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like her son."</seg>
<seg id="26">"still it fits to the commitment of Kristi Kappes, who always helps with a lot of patience and grace to me and my colleagues helped us to get used to the complexity of the American life."</seg>
<seg id="27">"then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors who helped me much with my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and those caused by them to deepen values my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"while Trump has its way to nominated the nominated presidential presidential data ground, they used to give me a stop and the counter to its limited vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">However it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">"on 8 November 2016, more than 50 million Americans, mostly wives, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps due to his contempt compared to non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the confrontation with the idea that people have voted for Trump because they have either lost its racism and fanaticism, or because they were ready to overlook these things, broke myself almost the heart."</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is totally to describe the Trump's voters as Rassists.</seg>
<seg id="34">"to arrange the people said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">"this is superficial and respectful, and suggests an inability to understand those who act in a different way and think."</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows the people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes in their churches are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters do have voted for Trump because they want to regain control over a country that she has disappointed?</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, they might want to say they are important in this America?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick who look the cruel decision to raise a man who look down with contempt to those who look differently than he."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this" "Whitelash" (mm. d. as much as "recharge of the White against all other ethnicities"; "words from white in playgrounds on the whites and whiplash), as it was the great Van Jones, just what America did so great."</seg>
<seg id="42">"millions of people around the world appreciate the American Ideal - no matter whether myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - what faith or background you have always like, America welcomes every welcome."</seg>
<seg id="43">"for this country chose as its president, twice the Son of an Kenyers, whose history, as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible."</seg>
<seg id="44">"but with the choice of Donald Trumps, there is a huge majority of the white Americas, and says: to hell with diversity, religious freedom and the whole concept of pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="45">"in the America after 9 / 11, the white man is back on the ruin, they say."</seg>
<seg id="46">"in all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldiers who has fallen in Iraq, and what he said in the eve of the election."</seg>
<seg id="47">On a manifestation for Hillary Clinton had Mr. Khan a word change with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would have my son, captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your America?" "Mr. Khan."</seg>
<seg id="49">The quantity answered with a signalling "no!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" braces the amount. "</seg>
<seg id="52">"have Latinos a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" "answered them."</seg>
<seg id="54">Have Afro-Americans a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" "rieve them and their voices were laugh."</seg>
<seg id="56">"would someone else, who is not like you, a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a record and sounded strong "NEIN"!</seg>
<seg id="58">"Mr. Khan closed with the words:" "God be thanks, Mr. Trump, is not your America." 36 hours later he was corrected. "</seg>
<seg id="59">"the land, for which his son was fallen, sent him a message."</seg>
<seg id="60">"this is now Trumps Land, said the message."</seg>
<seg id="61">"and all the people who look like Mr. Khan, could not find a place in this new America."</seg>

<seg id="100">"in West Africa then was known that this ship had already operated in liberal waters of illegal fishing fishing, before it was the other coast of Africa."</seg>
<seg id="101">"the East African countries were here accordingly, and had little geneists to welcome a legislative brecher of this kind in its coasts."</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Komors, Mozambique and the Seychelles mobilised rapidly against the ship. you may refuse to place one of their ports, and weigh himself to give him an old fishing."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "Ursuddenly was the prime minister surrounded by countries that you simply remember anything else," Benedict Kiilu, a leader of the Kenyan Fisheries Authority. it is part of a team that discovered the ship's time and followed. "</seg>
<seg id="104">"in 2013, the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: it was not able to catch fish there."</seg>
<seg id="105">"ultimately, it has also been forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, because of the looting of fish stocks."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the core of this initiative, the criminal practices crossed and protects resources, Fish-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NRO stop Illegal Fishing (Illegale fishery)."</seg>
<seg id="107">"the members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the six countries who had driven the prime minister from their waters at that time."</seg>
<seg id="108">"" this means that we have eight countries who are equaliable and work together. they exchange information and stand out each other, where it comes to illegal fishing, says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trusts project Ending Illegal's Fishing. this project offers Fish-i technical support. "</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is trapped by definition unregulated: what is caught is hidden because it is extremely difficult to get rid of it. this is illegal fishing a main cause of overfishing from regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">"by deliberate disregard to existing laws, through which certain habitats and species are to be protected by means of illegal fishing ecosystems, which have a delicate equilibrium."</seg>
<seg id="111">"but while actions against illegal fishing has been hindered by bureaucratic hurdles, and also through the snail hurting, with the information between individual countries, so the actions today occur in real time, with trackable on Fish-i's digital communication platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"there, the individual countries can exchange existing licenses with each other for example, news to digesture activities or details that you noticed during a port spectrum."</seg>
<seg id="113">"fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very attentive when they move around the open sea, using satellite data."</seg>
<seg id="114">"this allows the authorities to feature ships which fish in the botanicals territories. also, just let themselves discover that a ship invites its colored fish on the road to other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"in the idecase, such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license where they were travelling and possibly also whether they have a criminal case."</seg>
<seg id="116">"countries that are against illegal fishing, may refuse the acceptance of such ships in their ports, which means that ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they can even go to the numbers of penalties, as in case of prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "it is then about substantial financial losses for the owners, which means that illegal fishing fishing will not be more enjoyable."</seg>
<seg id="118">"and that is what we want to achieve," "says Per Erik Bergh, leader Director of NFDS Africa. the latter is an advisory firm which supports fighting illegal fishing in Africa and also supports Fish-i."</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed Front</seg>
<seg id="120">"the platform was created to attract estimated 20 million USD in lost turnover, which penetrate the eight members of the network HISH-i every year because of illegal fishermen that penetrate in Eastern African waters."</seg>
<seg id="121">"Ostafrika has one of the most productive tuna fish species, present because of the region's commercial fishing from around the world. under these also the illegal fishermen."</seg>
<seg id="122">"their practices such as actions are as the sailing under false flag, counterfeit licence names, the fish protected species and the fishing in nature conservation."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they use this lack of international co-operation and make the weaknesses of a complete organised control system", "says Long." "formerly a ship was illegal and a country could not say 'you could not walk my harbour."</seg>
<seg id="124">"but another country could say" "come to me". "" and exactly this legends I tried to close a fish-i. "</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">"since its foundation, Fish-i was involved in more than 30 studies of suspects."</seg>
<seg id="127">"it has covered criminal networks, which had been distributed on counterfeit licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has been trapped and found."</seg>
<seg id="128">"due to its cooperation with Interpol, the international authority to combat crimes, Fish-i can share information on illegal fishing over large distances."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" some of our studies lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime, "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="130">"it builds a system, the fish-i is to help digested ships conciser."</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo with friendly permission of Fish-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">"fish-i's satellite system, which will always be further developed, also helps to hide the illegal ships."</seg>
<seg id="133">"" the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and its position, "" says Duncan Copeland, boss analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO, which also deals with fisheries data and Fish-i technical support. "</seg>
<seg id="134">"some of the ships turn off for example their automatic identification systems, with which they can no longer be developed by satellite."</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland helps to build a system that connects different information levels each other. it should help fish-i to find criminal ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But Fish-i's Team African nations are actually taking influence on this undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that."</seg>
<seg id="139">"recently, SkyTruth has jointly opened the Platform Global Fishing Watch platform: a platform that can offer satellite data and can be displayed around the world's position."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" meet together with the neighbors to get a better picture of it who does. "" here is a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources for examining. "</seg>
<seg id="141">"we should do this on a global level." "Pew Charitable Trusts have to run a similar project, where a global system allows persecution of ships."</seg>
<seg id="142">"there are signs that Fish-i's activities can not only feel crime, but they are pinned."</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships which had previously used without a licence and hardly to count with consequences you know that they will be observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in Fish-i participated in a 33% increase in fisheries sales, since fishing boats have more licenses for sale."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after Fish-i Somalia has helped to put Greko 1, the inspectors found there on board towing networks, whose use is prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo with friendly permission of Fish-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"other countries do not notice these successes." "the effect is as strong that we now also copy other countries," "says Kiilu." "in West Africa, we will disappear several hundred million dollars by illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="148">"there are six countries that have joined in 2015, so called West Africa Task Force. also they are fighting illegal fishing, according to exactly the same model as fish-i." "With security is the target, even more of such initiatives and structures also arise in other regions," "says Copeland."</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently, Fish-i's youngest member country will report his first major triumph: in October it was Greko 1, a ship which was on the wrong flag. and not only the ship was also used without a license, which is now prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship was also penetrated into botbottled waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "with the recess of rules against Greko 1, a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing." "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="151">"for Fish-i this is another success of many. and at the same time the proof that such a special, collaborative effort to protect the oceans works in the whole world sea.

<seg id="377">"to overset, one needs two important skills: passive language skills, to understand the starting text and to be active voice knowledge to transfer it into the target language."</seg>

<seg id="381">"many Japanese companies do not employ workers with English as native language, the translations into English. this may be attributable to incorrect understanding of the overset, cost reasons or the relatively low number of English speakers, which may learn Japanese."</seg>

<seg id="545">"the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in the prefecture of Miyagi. the prefecture of Miyagi was a permanent prefectures in Japan, which had to experience the earthquake and the resulting tsunami."</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of people from Miyagi and the neighboring prunektures Fukushima and Iwate became inevitated because the tsunami had disappear whole coastal cities from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">"in addition, the prefecture of Fukushima lived a nuclear accident, but on this reason, 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their houses."</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows from the local point of view which progress has been made six years later to rebuild the life of local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the paper includes both statistics of the Japanese reconstructions as well as survey results of those concerned themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">"housing in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate"</seg>
<seg id="551">"Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung reports that until December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned spare parts (see you," "saigai kouei juutaku) in the prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate were finished."</seg>
<seg id="552">"the biggest success among the three prefectures could record Miyagi, here 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed."</seg>
<seg id="553">"Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, from where Fukushima with 70 percent is the final light."</seg>
<seg id="554">"even six years after the catastrophe, evacuated from Behelfsaccommodations (see you, Kazetsu juutaku) into final subhouses."</seg>
<seg id="555">After the threefold catastrophe almost 80 000 people were forced to live in Behelfsaccommodations.</seg>
<seg id="556">"in December 2016, 36 000 people lived from Miyagi, Fukushima and Ivvhima and Ivvhima."</seg>
<seg id="557">"nearly 40 percent of Fukushima in 2011, Evachima live in emergency accommodations, from where he was more than 75 percent of the evacuated accommodations that were lodged after the disaster in Behind accommodations, were inhabited in final houses."</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate the number is here at 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three affected preftures.</seg>
<seg id="560">"as the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper was able to determine, 1074 of 1100 schools, which were affected by Unglück, their doors until December 2016 again opened, which makes almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures."</seg>
<seg id="561">"six years later, the industrial reconstruction in the three prefences is far more difficult."</seg>

<seg id="563">The tsunami and the atomar accident have drawn in the three prefectures agricultural land.</seg>
<seg id="564">"Miyagi could restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas, whereby only 66 percent of the sugar land in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed Ashland in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="565">"it is unlikely that only a result of nuclear is, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of non-destructive land of Fukushima lie in the" nuclear zone "." "</seg>
<seg id="566">"in two of the three prefectures, tourism also has recovered over again, but also here Fukushima remains back far here."</seg>

<seg id="568">"however, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants, it is more difficult to earn their living."</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the locals prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">"in order to determine a whole picture, the newspaper conducted numerous surveys among the native population and among the evacuation. they asked them over the state of rebuilding and also how their sensation over the tsunami risk has changed."</seg>
<seg id="571">In their introduction of the article the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo led a survey to learn more about the tsunami consciousness under the native population.</seg>
<seg id="573">"the survey carried out that 83.1 percent of the oratory resident, measures have taken to be prepared to be prepared for future earthquake and tsunamis."</seg>
<seg id="574">"however 55.9 percent of respondents, that still not enough in terms of disasters prevention has been done."</seg>
<seg id="575">How it stands for those who had to be evacuated from the prefecture of Fukushima</seg>
<seg id="576">"in its output to the anniversary of the earthquake, Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung has also strengthened its attention to the situation of evacuhima."</seg>
<seg id="577">"Fukushima had to experience not only the huge earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, the prefecture Fukushima was also witness of the worst, catastrophic, atomic accident, the Japan ever had to experience."</seg>
<seg id="578">"from 160 000 evacuated from Fukushima, almost 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="579">"at the beginning of 2016, a little more than 23,000 people returned to Fukushima, in permanent spare parts houses."</seg>
<seg id="580">"after the stand of 2017, 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima live outside of their home prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="581">"in the catastrophic areas, most of the evacuated accommodations, which are still in Behind accommodations, older than 50 years old. they have to compete for rebuild reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima with massive construction projects. this is a building projects which are part of the Olympic Games that can take place in Tokyo."</seg>

<seg id="1137">"for Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS) is the narration of stories in their original language a possible response."</seg>
<seg id="1138">"Global Voices reported a short report on another initiative by Steven Bird, the immeasles blog."</seg>
<seg id="1139">"however, the focus of TLS does not lie on the written word, but on the sung word. it is an attempt to obtain the language variety of large cities."</seg>

<seg id="1141">For the creators of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">"the mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided when we accept cities, the diversity assume - safe spaces where inhabitants are not forgotten, who they are to be associated."</seg>
<seg id="1143">"listen often so often is to understand," for purposes, these events instead, instead they hear, to appreciate, to feel. "</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format storyteller tell their story first in their own language and translate them in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">"even if the participants are no professional storytellers, they perform their devotion and their representation that the audience can ask for it."</seg>
<seg id="1146">They may call laughter and emotions than the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">"the following video shows for example a traditional history of Burkina Faso, which is told in the language of Dafing. during this round, the storyteller Rassidatou will also take the opportunity to explain to their land typical customs of copper."</seg>

<seg id="1254">Mozambique: because of corruption condemned the director to Hafbriefing again on previous post.</seg>
<seg id="1255">"Mozambios reacted with wrath on a corrosion, where a government member returned after half of his sentence after half of his sentence, on which corruption was committed."</seg>
<seg id="1256">"this is Diodino Cambaza, which was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in 2010 with four other defendants (approx. 800 000 Euro) to 22 years imprisonment."</seg>

<seg id="1259">"in accordance with a statement of the General Public Prosecutor of the Republic, who accepts the application for Cambaza, there would be no obstacles to relate back to his old post since the company had no disciplines after his trial."</seg>
<seg id="1260">"however, many local residents are not good."</seg>
<seg id="1261">"the Centre for Public integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, briefly CIP), an local institution that advocates for public transparency, condemned in an interview with the Deutsche Welle to launch the director again:"</seg>
<seg id="1262">"represents a backlash in the fight against corruption, and clearer the lack of transparency and is even a backstep with regard to the efforts of our legal system, such as CIP."</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we take note is that the company should have a disciplinarity against the refuge would have to be guided.</seg>
<seg id="1264">"however, the company does seem to take no appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions."</seg>

<seg id="1268">"but since he is incompetent, he has entered into the company reintegrated into the company that he helped to add damage."</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza will be paid for his silence.</seg>

<seg id="1273">"Cambaza lacks the morals and serve the state, * he had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead it has only served by itself on the state."</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as handele had become tired money source and the state itself this man has become tired who was preloaded and finally sentenced to a long sentence.</seg>

<seg id="1291">"Facebook censert the word" "Kalar" "or the word" "Kalar" "or a part of a initiative to address the widespread problem of the HassLanguage in Burma in the social network."</seg>
<seg id="1292">"in recent years, the rise of radical nationalistic movements has given the word an extremely low-value creation."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"in particular, it is a word that most commonly used by Ultra-nationalists as harassed against Muslims, which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"but in an effort to fight Hassadors in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of sensual content on its platform."</seg>
<seg id="1295">"Calar'Kalar 'may usually be associated with racism, but the word itself does not call itself automatically."</seg>
<seg id="1296">"the context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that Posts, in which they have discussed the use of the word or expressed doubt for their use."</seg>

<seg id="1298">"for example, chair on Burmese also 'Kalar htaing' written what the same letters contains, as well as other words like 'Kalar PAE' (Cambodia), 'Kalar OAT' (curtain)."</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebook user Aung Kaat declared the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends became now erased because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">"however, he asked his friends on spiritual nature, whether she kissed his back pain, as he made his back pain."</seg>
<seg id="1302">"the sentence ku la -" healing "(ku) + the Frageword (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression, but the context is completely different."</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"Zin Win is the opinion that they will reduce the pronunciation of radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook can be analytical and spread all the Posts that circulate in suspicion."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook deletes the word "Kalar" not manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filtered the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automatic will not understand what you write on Factook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is to analyse the post carefully and check it by checking the next words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">"for example" Kalar Htine "" (chair) and "Kalar PAE". ""</seg>
<seg id="1310">"the good is that this trickly nationalists spread, the hate language, a fairly good lesson."</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcision its nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">"while the action may be a strong signal to all, the hate language may not stop the efficiency of this strategy for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"the experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proved that the censorship of keywords often become a cat and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks simply will begin to use a new word or an alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views."</seg>
<seg id="1314">"the author of Aung Kaat described, such as Facebook, began to delete his postings as he wanted to tell his friends, that the word 'Kalar' is banned from the social network:"</seg>
<seg id="1315">"when I was aware of this new directive from Facebook, I made a post to share my Facebook friends that the word is locked."</seg>
<seg id="1316">"Ironically my post from Facebook was removed and me, the Liken, posts and parts of content for 24 hours, because the post" Facebook Community standards did not meet. "</seg>

<seg id="1323">Such words to win will only bring more hatred within the various communities.</seg>

<seg id="1902">It is called Concepción González Ramírez and grew up in wallpaper and has grown up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name of Mama Africa. "</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a target for Africans and Haitian who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel does not have any charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">"for about 2.50 dollars the night sleep the guests in simple rooms, with crushing, secluded walls and beds made of metal."</seg>

<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib harsh a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">"the photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"Emsallam Hdaib spends the majority of his time in the inside; time he shielding to his canvas, once to his computer, and again to his couch."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"what one can rely on, is a cigarette between his fingers or his with nicotine lips."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"he lives in the top floor of his family house that has ended them since 1967; the year, in which Israel ended his occupation of the West Bank and Hdaibs family had to flee from her village in Palestine, where she had lived as felahyeen (e.g.: Farmer)."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"for six years Hdaib is a passionate active, who presents itself to the conservative majority and deposited their alted opinions about gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression by art and Raphah music."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"with his music, which often poses itself with issues such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian geography, but also calls for the nucleus of the whole Arab world. all these topics do not only be found in his hometown Amman Relevanz but also in cities which range from Damascus in Syria to Sanaa in Yemen."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"with his 25 years Hdaib sees himself as someone who is restricted in his mind by borders, and he can feel according to their own statement by people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"even if he is not open to the US, he had a special inclination against the US American foreign policy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to do in war zones, something that has been born with his identity as" Palestinian geography of the second generation, even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine. "</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think because of my own life conditions so," stresses Hdaib. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">"then he adds:" I think so, because I am shaking a man while he shake in water. it is the holy month Ramadan; in this time it is intended for Muslims, from sunrise to sunset. "</seg>
<seg id="2105">The jordian law also defeated that the public consumption of food is illegal during Ramadan.</seg>
<seg id="2106">"obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee to do with a sened hot jitag little with protest against Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2107">"basically, the slippers speak of warm coffee and the waist of the Kent-cigarette in the nose primarily of freedom."</seg>
<seg id="2108">"sometimes, Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky, especially when you have a view into neighboring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"hence, you simply avoids it simple to do basic things - as in the public during Ramadan, to drink water - to not land in prison."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently, the Interior Ministry of Our Lady has a appearance of the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"some parliamentarians who support the Islamic Action of the Muslim branch of Muslim Brotherhood - argumented that the sexual orientation of the homosexual Frontsängers Hamed Sinno, the cultural and traditional standards of the country contradicated and the main reason for the concert tabs."</seg>
<seg id="2112">The Euro MPs and former Pressesprecherin the Islamic Coalition DIMA Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert has been cancelled due to the sexual orientation of the rope.</seg>
<seg id="2113">"many also pretend, the involvement of the band in affairs such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world be dangerous activism, which represents the old legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the entire region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement Mashrou'Leila the jordain people as" progressive supporters of human rights, "which continues to be decided for an intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement is probably not easy to confessively rhetoric, but actually a clear crystallious reality in Jordan reflect that occurs in Hdaibs work clearly to the foreseepers."</seg>
<seg id="2116">"in 2016 backward Hdaib traditional sex men, by giving his vision from the fate of Arabic women."</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the image shows the skeleton with a apparently low-known woman, whose arms and legs are up to the corners of the canvas."</seg>
<seg id="2118">"it is surrounded by a red lake, perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of which they actually trust."</seg>
<seg id="2119">"over the past few years, the number of 'honorary morde' increased - the inofficial outside."</seg>
<seg id="2120">"human Rights Watch is estimated the number of honorary morals in the year 2016 their peak; however, however, comes to Jordan, the institutional infrastructure is lacking to support the women who were attempted by or domestic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a law to anti-breaking control from the year 1954, women are exposed to the danger of domestic violence," and for their release is often a long-term bureaucratic effort as well as the guarantee on the part of the family is necessary that the woman has nothing to happen. "</seg>
<seg id="2122">"Hdaibs music enjoys great popularity and is known for it, also not to be back on issues that in his country long as tabu gold."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib punished that his work is politically, however, that he is his music, which is full of expulsion on sexuality, freedom and expression, not of politics."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I comm from the Middle East, man."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"I was debated in politics," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed" Hdaib takes the question of the Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"" "Lavla al 3aib" "and in" "Ghareeb" "is the focus on poverty."</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the list of songs that are politically politically, can be continued."</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib published a song with the title "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is often repeated:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and anyone else is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market where one can get, in his words, what you want" - be faith or non-belief, Hetero- or homosexuality. "</seg>
<seg id="2133">"he noticed that hardly any one speaks in Jordan about the rights of gay and lesbians, and that comments on the equality of LGBT + individuals still have decreased considerably until 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014 Hdaib introduced an interview for the popular jordan online program Roya to remember later that his comments were covered from the context, and his opinion had been censored."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but was only a edited version," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today Hdaib acquires Hdaib open to the arabic LGBT + community and represents the opinion that intolerance against homosexuals do not meet Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentions Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, who still has remained in memory thanks to his homoerotic poems."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib asks: when Abu Nuts, who was later working on behalf of the potassium, in the eighth century, why not write homosexuality, why can Jordan not be?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the actual problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"in the Hashemitic kingdom, there is nothing new that the government attacks on freedom of speech and that progressive votes are brought to silence."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, the jordan news service took several former government-level and members of the teaching network, with the reason they had expressed themselves on comments in social media critically connected to the problems that are deeply rooted in the country with deep corruption."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"in view of this, the concert Hdaibs think is not only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of Jordan."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"for him, progress has been a constant state and Take. Jordan has succeeded for the second time in a row, but the way of progress - it looks very slow, bedtime and inner changes. it is certain that these changes will take place from day to day in the heart of the jordic society."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"ultimately, Hdaib, such as millions of other Arabs, also, from a Arab world without interventions from abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he dreamed of not only his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to experience them."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"perhaps the region is dominated by music, art and literature of a real and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, Streumunitions and on artificial way of guided democracies. at least he hopes that."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"until the time is, Hdaib will continue and therefore also resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"this report was made through the Pulseater Center on Crisis Reporting, which is listened to the Aman as a student Fellow."</seg>

<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Nebuta festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">"you suspect that there is a variant of Tanabata festival, which is also celebrated in August in many areas Tohokus. another theory dates back to the armies, the drums and the dance over more than one thousand years, in the armies of the west of Japan to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emishi, to the knee."</seg>

<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina monsalve.</seg>

<seg id="2181">"the following article is the edited version of the" "Liebesbotties to Guerillakami," which has published the international online magazine Tea After Twelve. "</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article is published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write only love-smells of people who we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">"is it not yet much more important, people who feel extinct, affectionate?"</seg>
<seg id="2185">Exactly this question went to the two young Colombian activists Leonardo Párraga by the Young Youth Youth Foundation and Cristian Palacios from the Young-Youth Foundation (letters to reconciliation) to write the young people to write Guerillakami's letters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">"only in short, her country was a location of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to their part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had closed a peace agreement with the guerrilla Movement FARC (German: revolutionary armed forces in Latin America), which forms the battle of the longest armed conflict in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="2187">International was the signatation of the peace agreement as so significant that the Colombian President José Manuel Santos was received for his worship the Nobel Peace Prize.</seg>
<seg id="2188">"however, in front of the Kolumbians, there is still a long way to be able to speak of a real reconciliation and peace."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"Guerrillers, who lived in illegal warehouses for many years, and around the clock have been exposed to their weapons to integrate themselves into life as civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"the Colombian society, in turn, which had accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases, it must be used to support their ranks and support them in building a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Kolumans have to join together and would have to help with the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">"and that's exactly what they did: until now, thousands of young people have written letters to former guillers, to welcome them back in society."</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign are 6900 letters - one for each former guillers - who will then be personally transferred.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as an inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">"the idea for the letters of reconciliation was born on the World Summit of the Nobel Peace Prize, which took place in February 2017 in Bogotá. there was Leonardo and Cristian the opportunity to talk to the Noailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Prize in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"this explained that we love the people who love, am Valentine's day of thousands of love, but those forgot that they need much unnecessary."</seg>
<seg id="2197">"he left, told he continues to share his love with people that needed the most urgent need."</seg>
<seg id="2198">"thus the plan to write letters of hope and support for former combatants of FARC that now have to find their place in society and establish a new life." "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history to a common history of peace, they say."</seg>
<seg id="2199">"until now, in the context of the campaign more than 2,000 letters were collected."</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá."</seg>
<seg id="2201">"I have never thought that someone would forgive me"</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to the UN camps in the Caldono region in the region of Caldono-Cauca.</seg>
<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city administration of Cali and Leonardo by the Foundation BogotArt, in the camp to bring the letters personally."</seg>
<seg id="2204">"the members of the FARC were so on how they had done earlier, in order to assume the commands of their leaders."</seg>
<seg id="2205">"but this time they did not receive commands, but letters full of subjection of people from all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it was a very moving moment for all involved." "it's incredible how many different feelings can run in just a few hours - from fear up to happiness and all that lies in-between, told the policy-knowledge of Manuela Jiménez Avila later."</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, an employee of the Governors of the province of Valle del Cauca drive this unforgettable experience as follows: "</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after we had passed the letters, I led a former combatants through the camp of Guerilla-fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I saw in one of the" Cambuches "(a kind of hut, where the guerrilla warts live), I saw a guerilla, who wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I was afraid to go, because next to him on the bed was an MGL-Granatcher, a deadly weapon in the thornap."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"I still spoke to him and asked:" hello, what do they just say? "" he answered: "I answered a letter that someone has written someone."</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"never in my life I wrote something so beautiful, so I answered it. because I suddenly lieve the tears about the cheeks."</seg>
<seg id="2214">I embraced him quite firm and put me next to the granatcher.</seg>
<seg id="2215">"perhaps he was the war, it was sorry to be all the years of faithful companion of this struggles, and wanted to help him to write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">"the man told me more about his life. he never had anything else from life than war. to join the FARC, was the only way to keep him and his six brothers in front of the famine." "I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society outside there is waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">"up to now, I have only learned how I have to deal with weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now where peace is there, I can learn many things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">"at the prelude, students and some leaders of the FARC came together to a discussion."</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war and the FARC already joined in hiding.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"therefore, the leaders of the FARC gave the history of the organisation, their ideals, and gave an insight into their views on the peace process:" many years, we have experienced the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party, we can help to create society in this country. "</seg>
<seg id="2224">"for a purpose of this order, it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles," said one of them. "</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"to hear these people still have never found hearing and no voting right, and to recognize that people I have seen often as monsters and even hate, even people with beautiful feelings that were redirected by their living conditions and their environment was very painful for me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">"reality, in which the country lives, does me hurt."</seg>
<seg id="2228">"but it comforted me that all people - even those who have killed and so much damage, we can teach us something and give a smile and a hug."</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"Gustavo González, the commandant of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Darío de Jesús Monsalve, the Archbishop of the city Cali, following letter:"</seg>
<seg id="2231">"the Kolumbianern was prophesied, that after the drainage of peace would rule peace."</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"as long as it is inequality, hunger and a lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are willing to access to weapons and to protest for their rights (...)."</seg>
<seg id="2234">"from the FARC now putting peace on peace, on a policy without weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"therefore, we call all defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong to themselves - about all that raise from a country in war."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"we give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. those among us who defend life as the basis of existence will be many difficulties."</seg>
<seg id="2237">"on our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them."</seg>

<seg id="2249">"they have brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">"Sabrina, a translady, was born in Grosny and grew up there."</seg>
<seg id="2251">"already since her childhood, she felt that she was in reality a woman."</seg>
<seg id="2252">"when they grow, you became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for them, why she moved to Moscow."</seg>

<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I was active as volunteers at a human rights organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day was told me that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">"it was an acquaintance from Dagestan, a transwoman who hides in trouble."</seg>
<seg id="2258">"she had no money, so I took her without hesitation."</seg>
<seg id="2259">"while I tried to help her, he made a friend, a copy of my documents and spread them anywhere on the internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. he sent them to his tschechnya friends, with the following message:" then there is no men more in Chechnya which can eliminate these shame?

<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him that he is respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I got drones.</seg>
<seg id="2280">"they smelled me, wrote me - Related, strangers, some completely unknown."</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>

<seg id="2283">"the slowed, send me back to Chechnya to prove that all was a lie."</seg>

<seg id="2295">"having happened for the third time, was clear to me that there was something lazy."</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights-friends overcheck the numbering signs - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you get around?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">"for security reasons, I will not want to provide their names, but I will say that I remember them all; they really helped me."</seg>

<seg id="2437">"if I say that I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women who call themselves as interseful feministers - with frustration."</seg>
<seg id="2438">You wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even thought out well thought scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be feminist and why we generally have all the feminist * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for example, women still earn less money in spite of equal education than men."</seg>
<seg id="2441">Women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they can do with their body.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women sooner or later grow in various areas of life to a smooth blanket, and that discrimination based on sex is still moving across the many different countries and faith."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced of it and I leide twice and three.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">"and yet: when I talk to skin colour, on racism, on black CIS women, on black CIS women, on black women in the LGBT community or on black women from the Diaspora; when I had chosen, both in and outside of feminist movement, both inside and outside the feminist movement, decide to mention many white feminists and white interseated feministers."</seg>

<seg id="2485">A few days later the second woman moved their ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the devil-circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">"if women do not even refund, they generally do not receive any support from the state."</seg>
<seg id="2488">"in many cases, women are also financially dependent on men who do misuse. this also explains why only 20% of all women who must admit victims of violence themselves at all in the prosecution authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2489">"inhalation and Statistic 2 Invisible misdoings and a legal system, which is nothing short of Paraguay: good approach, deficient implementation and statistics"</seg>
<seg id="2490">"it's hard to determine how many women really mised, says Myrian González, researcher for comrades in the Centro de Documentación y Estudios, but not even the scale of the gender-specific violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2491">But the figures available are however alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">"in 2015, the District Minister 9600 displays due to domestic violence. at 70% of it, it was about violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 ads due to domestic violence in peace courts. also here 86% of the ads of women.</seg>
<seg id="2495">"in the ads, 40% of women said that they were physically mised, 55% of women spoke of psychological missions."</seg>
<seg id="2496">"however, these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2497">"according to the paraguayical Women's Minister Ana Baiardi will actually appear only a few of these offences in Paraguay." on every woman, which are refunded in Paraguay because of psychical failure, are 9 women who do not do this. "</seg>
<seg id="2498">"on every woman who refunded because of physical mistress, are refunded, are two women who do not do this," stated in the end of 2014. "</seg>
<seg id="2499">"as women's mord in Paraguay is not an own criminal offense, the prosecution authorities cannot be adequately documented how many women are murdered each year from their current or former partners."</seg>
<seg id="2500">Journalists alone until August 2016 journalists have at least 12 cases of Frauenicide in the country alone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The co-ordinator of human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>

<seg id="2505">"before Mariana Brítez was the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that they called him the names of all their former friends."</seg>
<seg id="2506">"in the beginning, she did not want it, but after all, it should always regret it."</seg>
<seg id="2507">"today Mariana is 28 years old and no more with Carlos together. but two years the psychological force in their part - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time recognisable the most severe recognizable:"</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought that I would be victims of failure.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"when I have read earlier about it, I thought that only women has happened to underestimated that they deceive themselves from violent men."</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that I would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report about the failure by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">"without name, she wrote posts on Facebook in which they describe his insults and different attacks during their two-year relationship and told how he had isolated them."</seg>
<seg id="2513">"many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos themselves. he asked rhetoric, whether he ever raised the hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of failure."</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why she had fallen so long by Carlos and left him earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of failure at least have had a certain amount of complicity.</seg>
<seg id="2516">"Victoria Santos that originates from Paraguay, fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay, to prove that their former partner they mised them."</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the network Yo te creo ("I believe you") that consists of women who are all in any way victims of failure.</seg>
<seg id="2518">"in the group, they can talk to others about their experience, listen to each other and support each other."</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case everything started with psychical failure.</seg>
<seg id="2521">"your wealthy partner, even managed it even to convince them that they are worthless."</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victorias ads in the authorities remained without a result and even from their relatives, she received no support. "</seg>
<seg id="2524">"she carried out a trial against their former partner who developed into a undetable legal struggle between Paraguay and their home country, in which it was mainly about money, power and the influence of their former partner."</seg>
<seg id="2525">"Paraguay's laws: good approach, deficient implementation"</seg>
<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good, but not applied."</seg>

<seg id="2628">"this article of Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine which reports on solutions for environmental problems worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been bred in the USA Salat since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"his company offers 114 varieties, such as outredder, the first plant, cultivated by NASA astronauts in space cultivated and consumed."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"for nearly 20 years, Mortons's work was only set by its own random and the question how many salaters can get boundaries."</seg>
<seg id="2632">"but at the beginning of the 2000s, he thanked that ever more salads were patented and that he could not use them on."</seg>
<seg id="2633">"the patents have not only used for individual varieties, but also for certain properties like resistance to diseases, a special red or green or curved leaves."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"over the past few years, more and more of such patents have been registered in more and more plants such as grain and card sites. due to this trend, plant breeders, environmentalist and experts ensure the future of food production."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as a passionate representatives of a millennia, Morton is still Salat, he now needs no longer because his work is more and more limitations."</seg>
<seg id="2636">"it is, when it would lie in a river a rock broker to which I have to hered down."</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we have to do that now, but it is a break with the breeding-tradition," he says. "" I think that these patents go on salads too far. "</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and if they stand in court, nobody can breeding more a new salad, because all features are already patented, so it is doing so good as possible and tried to breed the characteristics that he wants."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, it is very careful and strives to use no material, which is protected as intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">"he also joined a movement that is becoming ever greater in the United States and everywhere in the world: open source Breeding (" Open Source ""). "</seg>

<seg id="2643">"it is not a coincidence that this name sounds like it sounds, as if the motion comes from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2644">"open source Seed Initiative (initiative for" open source "" seeds) can be inspired by the movement for free "open source" software, the alternatives are provided by copyright protected software. "</seg>
<seg id="2645">"it was called into life to ensure that some plants and gene not be protected as intellectual property, and so for plant breeders are permanent."</seg>
<seg id="2646">"in the framework of the initiative, shortly Ossi, the US breeders can commit themselves to be freely able to use the seed seed of them."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"however, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed, and they can sell it." open source "breeders allow only others to breed it to breed, to breed, and it can not be used immediately - two aspects that are prohibited by many plant patches or prescribed."</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Perstrades prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">"for the ceremonial Professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi-Vorcommittee Jack Kloppenburg, control over the seed and the opportunity to breed new plants as well as for environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"seed plays a role in larger compositions like biodiversity, rights of peasants, control over the nutrient system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter or only little to use it seed with natural resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg emphasized that the "open-source" movement is not busy with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, corals, genetically modified, and Monsanto and Monsanto and Monsanto and Monsanto and Monsanto and Bayer products, which is offered in August or September 2016." who is good, local and sustainable producing vegetables, should also know that the way it is bred as such vegetables bred, is threatened.

<seg id="2657">"Ossi-supporters argued that the future of food supply is endangered, since the available gene pool due to the ever more diverse intellectual property rights on plant material, which therefore is always limited to reduced."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, executive director of Ossi, has been involved in their doctoral thesis with geneous variation with genetics and their availability. it found out that about a third of all cartoons are protected as intellectual property, causing it to plant breeders either at all or only value."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"for other plants there are such estimates yet, but experts like Luby suspected that masculine-built plants like wheat in even bigger style patented as salat or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">"plants are so bred that they have targeted characteristics - from such, by which their taste or colour improves up to such, due to which they must be kept in certain environments and threats such as pests or diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2662">"opponents of patents on plant properties point out that the available plant material for breeders increases through more and more patents. genetic diversity is currently more unnecessary than ever before, since the changed conditions are much worse than ever since the changing conditions."</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an e-mail, Monsanto-Speaker Carly Scaduto, that genetic variety is generally important and also crucial for Monsantos activities. with a total of four genders and cooperation with institutions such as the agricultural ministry of the United States, the company relies for the conservation of genetic diversity."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"however, they contradicated that intellectual property rights other breeder cabinets, since" patents and the protection of plant varietal innovations promote innovation. "" a patent is basically taken a plan which is up to everyone as soon as the patent is expired. "</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come to the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"so, such protection inhibits innovations not, but encourages them to be provided by the public more material and know-how."</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton looks different: 20 years to wait until a patent of strap is certainly no innovations.</seg>
<seg id="2668">"and if you wait for a long time to breed, to breed plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, one could have lost the fight."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"however, the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources always have been a general well and we should continue to stay:" "independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such formalities, and monary incentives for us are not attractive."</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to make farmers their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"this is what drives us, and it will not make us impossible when we continue to use the best and latest genetic resources."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"in total, Morton has listened to the concept to patented, plant features:" we create the characteristics not really themselves. "</seg>
<seg id="2673">"plants are formed by themselves and as breeder, we finally have no clue how the plants do that."</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature.</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol Deppe, plant breeding in the U.S. state Oregon and Ossi's member states, there is another important aspect of plant breeding:" who has bred a sort of breeding, bred his own values in them. "</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with great courtyards and monocultures will be needed for the cultivation of mass herbicolds to grow in its varieties of this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is accurate. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some medium-sized enterprises (such, which are moving on international markets, but smaller than for example Monsanto are) patents, even without patents to survive - either we reject it too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case."</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeding Frank Morton is looking for in his name garden Salads.</seg>

<seg id="2681">"Morton is also the view that breeder resulting from the prevention of plants of innovative would:" "it looks like I am with my efforts to produce new, stronger than companies, the patented."</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I need to keep a new material for my catalog since I know that my competitors is being used for a few years," "says he." "with a patent it is 20 years ahead of competition so that it is very nice to make it really nice." ""</seg>
<seg id="2683">"although the US seem to be leaders in the" open source "" breeding leader, the concept has spread itself rapidly throughout the world. "</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in India the centre for sustainable agriculture (" Centre for Sustainable Agriculture "), which focuses itself as a professional organization in the area of resources, a" open source "seed program."</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them to come to "open source" seed and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">"the German Organisation Agrecol is working on an" open source "license, which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of Ossi's obligation for breeders in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2687">(regulations for breeders differ from country to country where Ossi's obligation cannot simply become one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">"at the beginning of November 2016, the Executive Committee of the European Union, the European Commission, declares that conventional plants should not be patentable. thus, she speaks against the current practice of the European Patent Atamts, the patents on conventional plants."</seg>
<seg id="2689">"however, a statement is not a law; now it is on governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line."</seg>
<seg id="2690">"in October 2016 the Dutch organisation Hivos hosted a conference on" open source "" seed systems in Ethiopia, on the farmers, operators of seeds, NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa to learn about the "open source" seed movement and the worldwide trend towards the patenting of seeds.

<seg id="2726">"ANHRI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt, after the authorities in front of the Huffington Masr, Arab-speaking issue of the Huffington Post and the German-speaking network of Al Jazeera due to the alleged" support of terrorism "."

<seg id="2733">His articles are mainly about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">"in a Facebook comment, Ziada expressed himself to the blocking of the government and reflecting what this means for him:"</seg>
<seg id="2735">"the, blogs is very old, however, has been priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi priority; and even if the blocking of the blog may not be significant for the world, it is however for two reasons for me:"</seg>
