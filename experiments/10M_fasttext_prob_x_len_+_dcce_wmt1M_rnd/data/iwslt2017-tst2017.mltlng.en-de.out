this is James R@@ isen .
they might know him because he won as a New York Times Re@@ porter .
&quot; long before someone had heard of Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen One book , in which he made spectacular that the N@@ SA illegal teleph@@ ones of Americans have heard . &quot;
but there is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
&quot; in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation , in which the CIA admitted to Iran , dra@@ fts for a nuclear bom@@ b . &quot;
&quot; if that sounds crazy , read it . &quot;
it is an incredible story .
but do you know whom the chapters did not exist ?
the US government .
&quot; for almost 10 years , the government was identified against vines and called him to name his alleg@@ ed sources . &quot;
&quot; in this turn , he became a symbol for the pattern of the government , wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower to condemn and journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to the First Constitutional Court , the media have the right to publish secret information . &quot;
&quot; however , it is impossible to apply this right if media cannot get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave ones . &quot;
&quot; so as the government at R@@ isen anch@@ ors , he did something that many brave re@@ porters already did before him : he refused , and said that he would rather go to prison . &quot;
&quot; so from 2007 to 2015 R@@ isen , so with the risk to go into prison . &quot;
&quot; but then , only days before the process , happened something extraordinary . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , although they were years of years of information that it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government were dropped . &quot;
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring the re@@ porter and sources can always hide less .
&quot; instead of fail and return to the statements , that also could do its digital foot @-@ acids for him . &quot;
&quot; and so the investig@@ ator , without his consent , his phone @-@ wise geh@@ eim , &quot;
&quot; just like his e @-@ mail data , financial and bank information , his credit card , and even travel arrangements with the list of his flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA W@@ hi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and risk . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is just one of many cases . &quot;
&quot; President Obama promised to protect W@@ hi@@ st@@ leb@@ lowers , but instead the judiciary still condem@@ ns more than any U.S. governments before him . &quot;
&quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government is too much at home as a secret . &quot;
&quot; since September 11 , almost every article about national security was the result of that a wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower to a journalist . &quot;
&quot; so we put the press work on the game , which shall be protected by the first Constitutional Court , because the government has more and more ways to play all . &quot;
&quot; but just like technology , the government allows to handle the rights of re@@ porters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; while they are able to contact them from the moment in which they contact , rather than in the desc@@ endants , in the witness . &quot;
&quot; today , there are communication software that had not yet been written as sa@@ ws his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or telephone calls . &quot;
&quot; such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source code system for wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lowers , which was originally developed by the internet famous , which was originally developed by us Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation , where I have been working . &quot;
&quot; instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news website , just like the Washington Post . &quot;
&quot; you can upload documents or send information , just as in any ordinary contact form . &quot;
this will then be encrypted and saved on a server to which only the respective news agency has access .
&quot; so the government cannot obtain more information , and many of the information they would request , would not be available from . &quot;
Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is but only a small part of the whole to protect the press of the 21st century .
&quot; unfortunately , governments around the world develop new sp@@ ion@@ ag@@ ech@@ nologi@@ es which are je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed us all . &quot;
&quot; it is to make sure that not only technology denom@@ in@@ ator such as Edward Snow@@ den have an opportunity to do mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lowers , &quot;
&quot; who wants to report ab@@ norm@@ alities in the care of soldiers , and will report from crowded hospitals . or the next environment workers , the alarm to se@@ se@@ ated water from F@@ lin@@ t suggests . or a pilgrimage @-@ insi@@ der , who war@@ ned us before the next financial crisis . &quot;
&quot; after all , these technologies have not only been made for those who want to cover crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights . &quot;
thanks .
&quot; &#91; on 3 April 2016 , the biggest data sheet of history was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; &quot; was hidden by Global W@@ anders in tax hav@@ ens . &#93; &#91; what does this week we have been hidden by news about a L@@ eck of 11 million documents in Panama &apos;s law firm Mos@@ bag Fon@@ sec@@ a . &quot;
the publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax hav@@ ens .
&quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers are going to go to companies such as Mos@@ bag Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . &quot;
&quot; we actually see the e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages , as the whole system works as it works . &quot;
this has already led to the first very direct consequences .
Islands Prime Minister is res@@ igned .
also there are reports that a allies of brutal Syri@@ ans B@@ asch@@ ar al @-@ Assad brief@@ cases in tax hav@@ ens has .
&quot; it is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russia &apos;s President Vladimir Putin performs , over a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous Cel@@ lists . &quot;
&quot; now there will be a lot of rich people and others , the nervous is waiting for the next release , and the next enth@@ used documents . &quot;
now that sounds like the lot of an agent or an John @-@ gr@@ ish@@ am @-@ novel .
&quot; it seems we@@ pt away from you , ordinary people . &quot;
why should we tackle this ?
&quot; but the truth is : if the rich and powerful in the position are to hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens and not to pay all their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads . &quot;
and that concerns us all .
&quot; for my organisation , Global W@@ ise , these revel@@ ations are phenomen@@ al . &quot;
&quot; all over the world , media and leading politicians , such as secret tax hav@@ ens are used by some of a few are used to hide their assets and worship -- something that we have been discussing and reveal something for ten years . &quot;
&quot; I think many people will be very conf@@ using this whole world , and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax hav@@ ens work . &quot;
I always imagine like a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ u@@ ppe .
&quot; so one has a company in another company , in another company , in another company which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these prayers . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult for criminal prosec@@ ution and tax authorities , as well as journalists or civil society really to understand what thing is . &quot;
I find it interesting that there are fewer reports about this matter in the United States .
&quot; probably because there has been no prominent Americans now , which came in these revel@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; now , it is not that there are no enough Americans to hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; but by the principle , according to which these tax hav@@ ens work , Mos@@ bag Fon@@ sec@@ a is less American customers . &quot;
&quot; if we would have a data base from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples which have connections to the US . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it is so that you need to give less information in some U.S. states to provide less information , to create a company than a library . &quot;
this kind of in@@ consistency in the US has allowed the employees of school@@ ing to be zo@@ oming in school children .
&quot; it has no amounts , especially sus@@ cep@@ tible to zo@@ oming investors . &quot;
it is this kind of behavior that all concerns us .
here at Global W@@ ost we wanted to find out how all this in practice looks like .
how does this actually work ?
&quot; so , we sent a covered actor in the offices of 13 An@@ wal@@ ts@@ as in Manhattan . &quot;
&quot; our investig@@ ator gave himself as a African Minister , bringing a di@@ gest money to the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot;
sho@@ cked us in shock that all were made up to an advocate of our investig@@ ator suggestion as he could transfer his money .
&quot; these were all appe@@ als . none of these lawyers took us as a client , and of course no one was handed over to the money . however , it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important to consider this not as an individual case .
&quot; it is not about a single lawyer , which has under@@ lined up the proposals . &quot;
&quot; it is not about a single peak police , wrapped in a sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; it is about how the system works , through the corruption , tax evasion , poverty and instability . &quot;
&quot; and to cope with this , we must change the rules . &quot;
we need to change the rules to complain this kind of behavior .
&quot; this may sound all very d@@ ow@@ sing , as if we could do nothing about it ; as if nothing could ever change , as if it is always the rich and powerful . &quot;
&quot; but as a born optim@@ ist , I really see that some change has begun . &quot;
&quot; in the last couple of years , we have seen the violations of more transparency in which the owners of companies concerned . &quot;
the topic took political attention through British Prime Minister David Cameron in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
&quot; since then , the EU regi@@ sters the central regi@@ sters at the national level , who really lies behind companies in Europe , and who controls them . &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is her@@ edit@@ ary .
&quot; the parties of both parties have brought a legislative draft in both parliamentary chambers , but this does not make the progress we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how these Panama disclosure , this huge insight into the world of tax hav@@ ens , as a means used to ensure greater transparency in the U.S. and globally . &quot;
for us at Global W@@ ise this is a moment for changes .
&quot; we need ordinary people who are angry , when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind proj@@ ectors . &quot;
&quot; we need managers in the economy , which stand up and say , &quot; In@@ transparent is not good for business . &quot;
&quot; we need leading politicians to recognize the problem and to use it , through laws this kind of in@@ consistency . &quot;
&quot; together we can end the in@@ consistency , which now allows this sort of tax evasion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; this is the story , as I once again kid@@ n@@ apped and in the luggage of a red Maz@@ ow@@ l . &quot;
&quot; one day after I finished my design study , I made a back@@ yard . &quot;
a guy in the red Maz@@ da remained and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my works .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip through the whole country . afterwards he would go to the peac@@ ef@@ ps .
I lu@@ d him on a beer . he told me about how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; where do you go tonight ? &quot;
&quot; he made the whole thing worse : &quot; &quot; I do not know it . &quot;
&quot; and I thought : &quot; &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what should I now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
&quot; but I just got to know him ! he said , he would go to the peac@@ emakers , but I don &apos;t know if he is really planning . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk of a Maz@@ ow@@ l ! &quot;
this is a small stove !
&quot; then I heard me : &quot; &quot; I have a ballo@@ on . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; h , as please ? &quot;
&quot; at night I was then in bed , I died at the ceiling and thought : &quot; &quot; Oh man ! what have I burned myself here ? &quot;
a wild sleep in my living room .
what if he is crazy ?
&quot; I got such a fear that I got out of the bed , on t@@ enth part to the door , and my sleep door . &quot;
but he was not crazy .
we are still in contact .
the artwork that he had bought from me today in his classroom . he is now teachers .
this was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my viewpoint .
&quot; maybe the people who were sold to me in childhood as foreigners , actually friends who only wa@@ ited on it ? &quot;
&quot; people on my air mat , has been normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air . &quot;
&quot; we make a break , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I am unemployed , almost pl@@ ough , my roomm@@ ate moves out and the rent is increased . &quot;
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
&quot; I believe , creativity can create it , fear in fun . &quot;
&quot; I wrote my best friend and new roomm@@ ates Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I have survived , how we could earn something to make a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk including breakfast , a mattress and every morning breakfast . &quot;
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and thorough as &quot; air mat@@ rat@@ ze and breakfast &quot; &#91; AI@@ R@@ Bed a@@ N@@ d Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mat on wood floors .
&quot; they found it super , and we too . &quot;
&quot; I am sure , our cheese t@@ ink @-@ O@@ mel@@ et tasted completely different because we made them for our guests . &quot;
&quot; we talked to them through the whole city . when we had passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle , star@@ red Brian and I ourselves . &quot;
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and to pay our rent ?
the things came into rolls .
&quot; my former roomm@@ ate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czyk , closed to us as a developer . &quot;
we wanted to find out if you could make a business concept .
&quot; we presented ourselves to the investors : &quot; &quot; we want to create a site on the people publicly owned by their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors can be closed when visiting . &quot;
over the Internet you can then invite alien people to stay with them .
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we wa@@ ited that the ro@@ cket would fall .
but indeed they do not .
&quot; no one who is still very near Tro@@ st , would invest in a shop , the foreig@@ ner allowed to sleep in apartments of other people . &quot;
why ?
because we have learned as children all that stran@@ gers are dangerous .
&quot; if you have a problem , one finds himself on the things you can well . we could des@@ ig@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; at the Kunst@@ akademie , we learned that design is much more than just appearance and wh@@ ap@@ tics -- it is the overall experience . &quot;
&quot; we learned how to des@@ ig@@ s objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust by design , between people who have never met before . &quot;
can design such a thing ?
is it possible to create with design trust ?
&quot; I would like to give you a sample , which degree confidence we seek . &quot;
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ b high when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I would like to un@@ lock your mobile phone .
enter your message from your left sitting section .
this silent trip of panic that you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts sense when they open the door the first time .
for the only thing that is more personal than your phone is your home .
&quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel that to keep in the hands of a stran@@ ger in the hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
&quot; so , most guests feel when they stay elsewhere . &quot;
only for this reason can our company exist .
only once who has actually Al Gor@@ es ?
could you pro@@ claim to Twitter that he is responsible for the president of the President ?
you can now return the phones now .
they have now experienced what kind of confidence we want to build . I would like to tell you some discoveries .
what if we had changed a small detail about this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neighbour could have imagined once again with his name ; if he told him , where he comes , how his dog or his children come to ? &quot;
&quot; imagine you could have 150 Be@@ ur@@ ances , which all say , &quot; he can really do very well . &quot;
how would you feel when you would have to leave your mobile phone ?
because a well @-@ thought feedback system strengthens the trust .
at the beginning we have made some things wrong .
it was hard for the people to cut negative assess@@ ments .
&quot; finally , we decided to wait until both host and guest had given their assess@@ ments before we set them online . &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
&quot; we have conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how probably it is that people trust each other , depending on how much they are at age and residence . &quot;
&quot; little surprising we trust the people most , who are most similar to us . &quot;
&quot; the more differences we find , the less we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social occurrence .
it is exciting if you add the call of a person -- in our case by defects .
&quot; if one has less than three assess@@ ments , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; however , one has more than ten , changes everything . &quot;
a good reputation of the simil@@ arities .
&quot; thus , the right design can help us to overcome some of our deep @-@ root love . &quot;
&quot; moreover , we learned that trust is dependent on how much you are priced . &quot;
here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; if you have too little tells us , such as &quot; Hi ! &quot; , &quot; you do not get an answer . &quot;
&quot; you say much , as for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request is rather not accepted . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimal level of openness , such as &quot; &quot; t@@ olle art works in your apartment ! I have been doing with my family vacation . &quot;
how can I create it with design to produce this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics to write something .
all of our company builds up hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudi@@ ces towards foreigners .
&quot; with what we had not expected , the great amount of men who were more than willing to deposit these prejudi@@ ces . &quot;
here you can see how many people take advantage of our offer .
you can see three things .
&quot; first , incredibly good luck . &quot;
second : the ti@@ reless work of our team .
&quot; thir@@ dly , one need , which was not covered before . &quot;
for us the business is very good .
&quot; of course , there are also times when not everything smooth running . &quot;
there were guests who have not allowed parties or app@@ ra@@ ined apartments .
hosts have guests in the rain .
&quot; at the beginning of the project , I have worked on the customer service team . all calls came directly to my mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; I stood at front front , when confidence has been broken . &quot;
there is nothing much worse than these calls . it is sorry if I just think about it .
&quot; the disappointment , which one sounds in the voice of An@@ ru@@ fer , and will always be our greatest motivation to continue to improve . &quot;
&quot; luck@@ ily , there had only a fraction of a fraction of the 123 million people . &quot;
for people trust each other .
&quot; when confidence works , it is possible to arise . &quot;
one of our guests made holiday in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host led him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his judgement :
perfect house for travellers who tend to sleep due to se@@ perate activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real Guardian angel that save a life even though they don &apos;t know at all .
&quot; you drive one in your own car to hospital , when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ yp@@ ass . &quot;
&quot; because they do not want you feel lonely , they bring books by . &quot;
they can even stay longer and stay longer without the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
so of course not every stay will not happen .
but these relationships behind the pure money action are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
when I stum@@ bled about this term I asked myself :
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together ?
it is here about an economic trade .
&quot; but it is now just &quot; &quot; rent industry &quot; , &quot; the matter is not right@@ eous . &quot;
Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
&quot; people put a part of itself open , and that changes everything . &quot;
&quot; when you travel nowadays , this is compared to a Fast Food . it is efficient and reliable , but it is less authentic . &quot;
but what would be if travelling a rich buffet from local impressions ?
&quot; what would be , if at any place you visited , a group there would have been waiting to fill a thoroughly and one in a tavern @-@ our neighborhood of which one has never heard ; &quot;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star cook ?
&quot; nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy . &quot;
what would be if we would like apartments of the ground on to the roomm@@ ates ?
how would this look like ?
what would be if cities would accept the thoughts of the common sharing ?
&quot; I imagine cities that allow us to society and relationships , instead of sol@@ itude and de@@ preci@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in the South Korean capital of Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking spaces included in the government , &quot;
were offered by residents . students who were looking for a bite
were convey@@ ed to people whose children were taken out . there were in@@ cu@@ b@@ ator programs have been started .
&quot; to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share economy , through our platform alone today night 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a stran@@ ger or even hosts . &quot;
the idea seems to be not as crazy as it was brought to us .
we have not invented the wheel .
hospitality was even before .
there was similar websites before us .
so why does our work right now ?
&quot; apart from luck and tim@@ ing , we believe that you can find the right design with the components of trust . &quot;
design can help us to overcome deep prejudi@@ ces .
I think that is amazing .
right to be overwhelming .
&quot; I have to think about it , when a red Maz@@ da goes over to me . &quot;
of course we know that design cannot solve any problem .
&quot; but if it could help us when it had this great influence , I ask myself how we can use design soon . &quot;
thanks .
what do you think if you see me ?
a belie@@ ver ? a belie@@ ver ?
maybe even a sister .
&quot; or supp@@ ressed , a brain la@@ under@@ ing , a terrorist attack ? &quot;
or simply a delay in security at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I do not give you the fault for your negative impressions .
&quot; thus , the media represent people who look like me . &quot;
a study y@@ iel@@ ded that 80 % of reporting on Islam and Muslims are negative .
studies show : the Americans think most would not get Muslims .
probably people are not talking to their exercises .
&quot; for all those who have never met a Muslim : it &apos;s great to meet you . &quot;
I tell you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee maker -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream . &quot;
&quot; I am intro@@ ver@@ ted , &quot;
a M@@ oul@@ der @-@ Fitness @-@ Fan@@ ati@@ ker@@ in , &quot;
&quot; and I am a practic@@ ing , spiritual muscles . &quot;
&quot; but not like Lady G@@ aga s@@ ings , because , baby , I was not so born . &quot;
I decided to do so .
&quot; when I was 17 years old , I met the decision to ou@@ ten me . &quot;
&quot; no , not as hom@@ os@@ ex@@ ual man , like some of my friends , but as a muscle . I decided to bear the hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover . &quot;
&quot; my femin@@ ist girl@@ friends were de@@ composed , &quot; &quot; why do you supp@@ ressed yourself ? &quot;
&quot; the funny was : at that time it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , and against pressure that I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ ol@@ ds , to adapt me to a perfect and un@@ attain@@ able beauty ideal . &quot;
I have not only accepted the faith of my parents .
I have been with the Qur &apos;an .
&quot; I read him , thought to , put in question , dou@@ bling and credi@@ ble ultimately . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
she was confidence and slow devot@@ ion that deep@@ ened up with each reading of the basket .
the beauty of the rhyth@@ mi@@ k sometimes brings me to the wines .
I perceive myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
&quot; had you ever feel that someone else takes you , you fully understand , and yet somehow love ? &quot;
it feels like this .
&quot; later I married and began , like all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineering . &quot;
&quot; I had later , after my marriage , a child , and lived basically the &quot; Egyptian dream &quot; . &quot; &quot;
then this terrible morning came in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; I sat in my kitchen , had dinner at the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; E@@ yes . &quot; &quot;
&quot; smoke , planes fle@@ w in buildings , people sp@@ ran@@ gen from buildings . &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock turned rapidly into rebel@@ lion .
why should one do something ?
&quot; I joined the TV channel and heard : &quot; &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; &quot; ... in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... j@@ ih@@ ad &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; bom@@ bing Mek@@ ka ! &quot;
&quot; Oh , my God . &quot;
&quot; it is not only attacked my country , but in the nu related me the acts of others from one civil society in a dou@@ bling . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , we had to drive through the Middle East of the USA to move into a new city and begin with the construction studies . &quot;
&quot; I remember , as I went -- than we did not know -- so deep it went into my seat square , and I was the first time to be fear@@ ed as Mus@@ lim@@ es . &quot;
&quot; we moved this night into our apartment , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world . &quot;
&quot; and then heard , saw and read the warning of the national Islamic organizations that defe@@ ated , &quot; &quot; Sei@@ d careful &quot; , &quot; conf@@ ess in well illuminated areas , &quot; &quot; disgu@@ ise you not . &quot;
I stayed the whole week inside .
then it was Friday during that week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer .
&quot; and again the war@@ nings : &quot; &quot; does not go on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot;
I saw my extensive coverage .
&quot; the feelings were understand@@ ably approximate and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or from people that one held for Muslims , into the Free and hit . &quot;
there were really Bran@@ dan@@ ces in mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should remain at home .
but something really felt right .
because people who have attacked this country to attack our country .
I left the anger of people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain itself .
&quot; I have nothing to ask for questions , I love questions . &quot;
&quot; there are the acc@@ us@@ ations , which are hard . &quot;
&quot; nowadays , we can actually hear people : &quot; &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims . &quot;
when will we go ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tum@@ or in the body of the USA .
it is only the question : are we mal@@ icious or ben@@ evol@@ ent ?
you know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tum@@ or as a whole and a ben@@ ign tum@@ or holds only under observation .
the alternatives are meaning@@ less because the question is wrong .
&quot; Muslims are like all other Americans , no tum@@ or in the body of the US , but a vital organ . &quot;
thank you !
&quot; Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , Er@@ sth@@ el@@ fer and Olympi@@ oni@@ ks . &quot;
will the closure of mos@@ ques America make safer ?
it will perhaps stop a few parking spaces but not to stop terror .
&quot; the regular visit of a mosque leads to people other faith , and show greater citizens &apos; participation . &quot;
&quot; and as me a head of police in the area of Washington , DC recently told : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques . &quot;
you are radi@@ ated in your cellar or in bed in front of a computer .
&quot; in the radic@@ alization process , one has established that he begins online . as a first , the person is cut off from her church , even by their family , so that the person believes that the person believes the true Muslims , and anyone who ab@@ sent their behaviour and their ideology , is a tra@@ itor , or of faith . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent radic@@ alization , we must stop the people to go to the mosque . &quot;
&quot; some are still pret@@ end , Islam is a non@@ violent religion . &quot;
&quot; finally , a group of the IS establishes their brut@@ ality with the Quran . &quot;
&quot; as a m@@ ess , as a mother , as a human being , I think we must do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot;
&quot; but we would add ourselves into their imagination , if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers . &quot;
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u club @-@ Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology reasons in their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
&quot; but when you look at it , she does not drive what they do in their &quot; Holy Scriptures &quot; LA@@ SEN . &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality which they can read these things into Scrip@@ ture .
an outstanding Im@@ am told me recently an amazing story :
&quot; a girl came to him , because she had imagined to join the IS . &quot;
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; he said , the problem was just the opposite . every spiritual , with whom she had spoken , she brought to silence and told her that her wrath , their sense of inj@@ ustice in the world , they would only bring in trouble . &quot;
&quot; of nothing inspired and something that was given to their anger , it was a main goal for the instrument@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sten that you gave a solution . &quot;
this emp@@ t set out the link to God and their church .
&quot; instead of reve@@ aling them for their anger , he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world . &quot;
&quot; what they learned in the Mos@@ que , keep it before to join the IS . &quot;
that was an insight like the Islam@@ opho@@ bia and my family concerns .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect any other ?
&quot; how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption acts from fear every day on our democracy , to our thought freedom ? &quot;
a study -- actually show several neuro@@ scientific studies -- : when we fear that at least three things happen .
&quot; we are accepting more an author@@ itarian governance system , conformity and prejudi@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; a study reveals : if you have reported news , in which negative about Muslims was reported that it was rather military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circum@@ cis@@ ion of the rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not only a Ak@@ adem@@ ic problem .
&quot; if you look at when the mood against Muslims to the top -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot;
it happened in advance of the Ira@@ qi war and during two election periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Mos@@ lem terror as I expected .
&quot; it can actually be a tool for mani@@ p@@ ulation of the public to compens@@ ate the foundation of a free society , the reasonable and well informed citizens . &quot;
the handling of Muslims is an early warning sign .
we maybe sense it as the first but the tox@@ icity of the fear seemed to us all .
&quot; in the assignment of collective debt , it is not just about to explain itself to itself . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple , which lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was an ath@@ l@@ ete .
&quot; he was frequ@@ ented by the dental Faculty , talented , much promising ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would say to me that he was the sweet , generous man , who knew her . &quot;
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was st@@ un@@ ned and said :
&quot; when is from my brothers , such a sealed young man became ? &quot;
&quot; just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne at her brother and his wife , her neighbour , Cra@@ ig Stephen H@@ icks , she mur@@ dered , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , which was born in the afternoon , as with an execution , after having met an utter@@ ance against Muslims on his Facebook page . &quot;
he d@@ oss eight times on De@@ ah .
&quot; Fan@@ ati@@ cism can not only be mor@@ ally mor@@ ally , but also fat@@ al . &quot;
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
are we gone to the mosque or stayed safe at home ?
&quot; we bes@@ ought it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it went to leave , which America we want to leave our children : one that would be able to control us through fear , or one where we can freely exercise our religion . &quot;
we chose the mosque .
&quot; with our son in kinder@@ garten , we drove to it , with high pressure to the mosque . &quot;
&quot; I took him out , drew my shoes , went into the prayer sh@@ alle , and what I saw , left me . &quot;
the hall was completely un@@ filled .
&quot; then the Im@@ am an announcement , than@@ ked himself and called our guests , because half of the assembled were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , believers , and non @-@ believers who had come to attack us , but to join us . &quot;
in this moment I have coll@@ ap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had courage and compassion panic and prejudi@@ ces .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose in the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you go on number one ?
or will you connect to those that mean : we are better than that .
many thanks .
thanks nice !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have a thri@@ ve . &quot;
&quot; but I ask myself what do you say that you may hold a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a mind@@ set with dr@@ au@@ ght with dr@@ au@@ ght , so an exception and not the rule . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say that you do not decei@@ ve . I am completely normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am so usual how it is permitted .
&quot; when you look at the Muslims around the world , and I did that with the biggest ever performed study to Muslims around the world , people want to normal things . &quot;
they want prosperity for the family who want to work and they want to live in peace .
&quot; so , I am in no respect an exception . &quot;
&quot; if people seem like an exception to rule , then often the rule had broken , and they are not the exception to the rule . &quot;
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
&quot; what began as a platform for cra@@ ftsmen , is shortly before , a milli@@ ar@@ den@@ store . &quot;
&quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . possible , this is made in research institutes worldwide . &quot;
&quot; before air @-@ package presentation to our social consciousness , has built an autonomous fleet of aircraft in the F@@ RAC Centre in France live in front of the audience a six meters high tower from 1 500 brick buildings . a few years ago she started to fly with rop@@ es . &quot;
by connecting aircraft : high speed and acceler@@ ation on narrow spaces .
you can also build self @-@ employed structures .
&quot; they have learned to wear loads , to deal with tur@@ mo@@ il and to react generally on natural laws . &quot;
today we want to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of the possible in the autonomous flight .
&quot; to enable a system of aut@@ on@@ om , it must know collective signs where the mobile objects are located . &quot;
&quot; in our laboratory at ETH Zürich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tas@@ ks . &quot;
for today &apos;s Dem@@ os we use a new localization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a deriv@@ ative of our laboratories . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
&quot; each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in space , calculations on board what the machine should do . &quot;
&quot; external commands is available at the highest level . &quot; &quot; example &quot; &quot; and land &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a so@@ called H@@ eck@@ starter , &quot;
&quot; a aircraft , that is trying to hit two fingers with a fl@@ ap . &quot;
&quot; like other Star@@ r@@ amps , it is efficient in advance flight efficient , much more efficient than helic@@ opter in all its variations . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to most star@@ ches , it can fluctu@@ ate , and has a large advantage with start and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always a cap . &quot;
a limitation of sti@@ ffer is that they are sensitive to tur@@ mo@@ il like wind b@@ ows .
we develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the air device does not matter in which position to reg@@ ain the optimum position and improved the performance by exercising .
okay .
&quot; during our research , we often place fundamental abstract questions , which penet@@ rate the core of the matter . &quot;
such a question would be : what is the smaller number of movable parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons to know the answer to such a question .
helic@@ opter are known approximately as machines with a thousand movable parts that meet you .
&quot; decades ago , trained pil@@ ots could fly , which had only two moving parts : a prop@@ eller and a h@@ eck@@ ru@@ der . &quot;
&quot; long ago we discovered that flies , with just one works . &quot;
&quot; this is the Mon@@ osp@@ ic , the mechanical system @-@ protected aircraft . it was invented in short @-@ time . &quot;
&quot; it has only one movable part , a prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and cross@@ ings , no further pitches or cont@@ rol@@ lo@@ ber@@ surfaces , just a prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechan@@ ically simple , happens in the interior living very much so that it can fly stable and can move around in the room . &quot;
&quot; however , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the H@@ eck@@ star@@ ters . to bring it to the fur , I have to throw it right . &quot;
&quot; the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood , it is exactly right when I watch all , is low , therefore I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening . &quot;
&quot; when the mon@@ ds is an exercise in gen@@ lon@@ eliness , this machine is here , the cou@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance . &quot;
what do with all this over@@ flow ?
you see that he is only symmet@@ rical .
therefore he is ambi@@ valent in his alignment .
&quot; thus , he receives the most appreciated capability , &quot;
&quot; move in space to all directions , no matter what direction he filmed or even how it rot@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers from the eight prop@@ ellers . &quot;
a lot is un@@ think@@ able in models and the rest will be learned directly when flying .
let us see that .
&quot; if flying machines have to be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely secure and reliable . &quot;
this machine consists of two separate semi @-@ prop@@ ellers .
this is in the clo@@ ck@@ wise sense
and the other against the clo@@ ck@@ wise .
&quot; when one builds them , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ru@@ cop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; however , something wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller falls off , the electronics or a battery -- can continue to fly the machine if also restricted . &quot;
we will now demonstrate that by doing a half of plane .
the last demonstration investig@@ ates synthe@@ tic sc@@ rolling .
&quot; the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression . &quot;
we participated in the sweet micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each single weighs less than a disc bread -- and provide them with local technology and algorithms .
&quot; every unit knows where in space it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit . &quot;
hopefully you motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine there is at Broadway a flying lamp@@ shade .
&quot; of course , it is difficult to predic@@ t the influence of this technology . &quot;
for types such as us lies the reward in the development and creation act .
&quot; it serves as a reminder , how wonderful and magical our universe is , and that there is creative , kl@@ u@@ gen stor@@ i@@ ings , it is allowed to shape in such spectacular way . &quot;
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the i .
many thanks .
&quot; at 1.9 billion years ago in a very far distant galax@@ y , two black holes are becoming more and faster , you turned into the mass thir@@ ties in a t@@ enth study in pure energy . &quot;
this short moment was shining bright than all the stars together in all galax@@ ies of the whole of us known universe .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but their energy put them not in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was given into the space period itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
&quot; as a result , we arrange the events initially . &quot;
it was almost 3 billion years ago it has been living on Earth for several years ago .
&quot; since then , the earth has brought a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , su@@ rier , man and -- God stand with us at -- even the internet . &quot;
&quot; about 25 years ago a group was particularly brave -- R@@ ai Weiss from MIT , K@@ IP Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ tech -- to seek a huge laser det@@ ector to seek out gra@@ vit@@ ational black holes . &quot;
most they kept them crazy .
&quot; but enough people recognized it as crazy gen@@ ies , so that the US National Science Foundation contributed their idea . &quot;
&quot; after decades development , construction , design , design and extremely much hard work they built the det@@ ector LI@@ GO : the laser inter@@ fer@@ om@@ eter@@ - gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ Observ@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; in the following time , the precision of LI@@ GO could significantly increase its recognition performance enormously . &quot;
therefore they call him now Advanced LI@@ GO .
at the beginning of September 2015 LI@@ GO for a final test run started to clarify some smaller the stu@@ b@@ bor@@ n@@ ly problems .
&quot; on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the commissioning of the det@@ ector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two col@@ li@@ ds black holes through the earth . &quot;
they went through you and me
and also through the det@@ ector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were emotional as this :
the birth of my daughter
and the far@@ ewell from my to@@ d@@ sick father .
basically these were the fruits of my life .
all that which I had worked is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ c@@ ist at MIT . he studied gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves from black holes and their through observ@@ at@@ orial signals . what are gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves ? &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a cl@@ ash in the po@@ und@@ ing of space and time .
&quot; when using the wave , the space and its entire content is stretched into a direction and into the other . &quot;
to illustrate lec@@ tur@@ ers in courses on the relevance theory often have a correct dance .
&quot; stretch and du@@ sting , stretch and dust . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that Gra@@ vit@@ ational w@@ ellen are extremely weak , even ridicul@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September , for example , each of us became stretched and gest@@ ed . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average person was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; that means 20 N@@ ul@@ ls after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1st of Dar@@ um , one declared the LI@@ GO staff for crazy . &quot;
&quot; with a five kilometres long laser det@@ ector , and this is already absurd , this length should be measured in less than a Millennium of the radius of a nuclear kern@@ els . &quot;
at the end of his classical text on gravity
&quot; described K@@ IP Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder LI@@ GO@@ s , the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties in the construction of such det@@ ectors are huge . &quot;
&quot; but physi@@ ci@@ sts are dark , and with the support of the public will certainly be overcome all obstacles . &quot;
&quot; Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot;
back to LI@@ GO . Scott would like to be more an ear than an eye .
I want to explain what this means .
&quot; visible light has a w@@ avel@@ ength , which is much smaller than things around us : face @-@ ups , the size of your mobile phones . &quot;
this is quite handy . for this is how you can create a picture or a map of things by taking advantage of several points of the coming light around you .
in pot@@ ato that is different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a w@@ avel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
&quot; that &apos;s why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean you particularly much : &quot;
the face of your child approximately .
&quot; instead , we lau@@ gh according to certain properties like sound and height , rhythm and volume , to close the history behind it . &quot;
&quot; now , speaks Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob under@@ breaks them . &quot;
&quot; D@@ number Bob , &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
with them we cannot produce simple pictures of objects in the space .
&quot; but by considering changes in the am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can hear her stories . &quot;
at least lie for LI@@ GO the measured frequencies in the audi@@ ble area .
&quot; so when we convert wave patterns into barriers , we can talk to all literally . &quot;
&quot; the gravity too loud , can tell us about a lot about the coll@@ ision of two black holes , which my colleague Scott has been very long busy . &quot;
&quot; SH : two black , not rotating holes , circul@@ ate easily : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
turning the two body very fast , you hear the same cir@@ cus with an additional sound change . this does not stop at : W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u ! &quot;
it is a kind of movement that is characterized by the wave form .
AA : on 14 September 2015 -- a date that at least I never forget -- heard LI@@ GO next : &#91; Sur@@ ren@@ des Ball@@ et &#93; J@@ em@@ and who knows how to hear this as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with each 30 @-@ professional sun mass that are about as fast as the sticks of your mix@@ er .
AA : let us know what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the most dense body in space , one with a mass of 29 probe , the other with a mass of 36 probe , revol@@ ve each hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de . &quot;
imagine these forces before .
fantastic .
and we know it because we have heard it .
therein lies the remaining importance of LI@@ GO .
&quot; LI@@ GO is a completely new way to explore the universe , as they never had previously been possible . &quot;
on this way we can listen to the universe and the un@@ visible .
much in all we can -- practically or basically -- not see .
&quot; a Super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ t stars in Super@@ nov@@ ae explo@@ de . &quot;
they are very useful . from them we learned a lot about this .
&quot; but the exciting physical activity occur in the core , which lies behind thousands of iron , carbon and si@@ licon brick . &quot;
we will never go through because these op@@ ak are .
&quot; gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves penet@@ rate iron , as if it would be transparent glass . the Ur@@ kn@@ all : I would be happy to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it since the original one is covered by his own desc@@ end@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; using Gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , it should be possible to look back to the beginning . &quot;
&quot; and the most important thing : I am optim@@ istic that in all things we have never seen , which we never see never seen and from which we have no idea of what we just discover . &quot;
&quot; in fact , LI@@ GO found the first impression of what we did not expect . &quot;
&quot; my colleague at MIT , Mat@@ t Evans , an important member of the LI@@ GO project , says to this topic : ME : the type of stars , the black holes are observed , like LI@@ GO they observed are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe . &quot;
they are enormous ; ancient bodies of pre@@ historic times . the black holes are the su@@ ri@@ erk@@ no@@ ons for our arche@@ ological work .
&quot; LI@@ GO gives us a completely different angle of view of the events in space , to the emergence of the stars and ultimately , as we went out of this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge is now to be as brave as possible .
&quot; thanks to LI@@ GO we know how to build great det@@ ectors , and the pre@@ y and cir@@ cus of cosmos . &quot;
we need ideas for new observ@@ at@@ ories -- a completely new generation of observ@@ at@@ ories on Earth and in space .
&quot; for what could be more beautiful , than the urine itself to lau@@ gh ? &quot;
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thanks .
some time ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; one year I would say about &quot; Yes ! &quot; , &quot; in front of which I fear@@ ed myself . &quot;
&quot; whether it made me nervous , brought me in unpleasant situations , I inev@@ it@@ ably say myself &quot; Yes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
I wanted to speak in the public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
I wanted to be live on TV ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
wanted to start playing with the show ?
&quot; no , no , no , yes , yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a crazy thing happened : exactly what I fear@@ ed , wo@@ unded to my fear . &quot;
&quot; my fear , speeches to hold , my social fear -- Pu@@ ff , weg . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes &quot; &quot; has changed my life . &quot;
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
&quot; but there was a certain Yes , which changed my life , to an unexpected art . it started with a question of my youngest . &quot;
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the youngest , calls for in@@ explic@@ able reasons &quot;
as if she was a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; k@@ ittens , I need milk for my be@@ ak @-@ chairs . &quot;
&quot; she asked me once if I could play with her , when I just arrived on the go . and I said : &quot; yes . &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
&quot; a new life setting in my family . from there I weak@@ ened me , always with them as soon as I go on it . no matter what I do , or where I go , I say always Yes -- every single time . &quot;
&quot; almost . I am not perfect , but I am very happy . &quot;
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , on my children , to our family . &quot;
&quot; but it also has an intri@@ gu@@ ing side effect : only recently , I was actually complete that the &quot; Yes &quot; sessions for playing with my children saved my career . &quot;
I have a real dream job .
&quot; I am author . I think things off , awak@@ ens you to life . &quot;
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I Cre@@ ate television . I pro@@ du@@ zi@@ ere television .
&quot; I make television , in a great style . &quot;
&quot; in this TV season , I am responsible for that 70 hours program will go out into the world . &quot;
&quot; four television programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production . &quot;
each shipment has hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a television can be between three and six million dollars .
we say five .
&quot; a new episode every nine days of four shows , so all nine days 20 million dollars , four channels , three episodes , three episodes , three episodes , 15 Ep@@ iso@@ des : Gre@@ y &apos;s : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 Ep@@ iso@@ des : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours of television , &quot;
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my TV series run on Thursday night .
all over the world my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are broad@@ casts which I myself is created , and not just produced , so still ob@@ end@@ lessly . I have to find time , really silent , creative time to gather my fans around camp@@ fire and tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four television series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fire , which burn around the world . &quot;
do you know who makes this still ?
&quot; nobody , that is why I am a Titan . &quot;
dream job .
I would not like to impress you .
&quot; I say it , because I know what you think when the word &quot; author falls . &quot;
&quot; I say it to you all of you , who now work as hard as you are now pursuing a company , a country or a class@@ rooms , if I talk of work , so that I say not only on the computer , and fant@@ asi@@ ere , and it is true when I say , I understand that it &apos;s not just a dream job for dreams . &quot;
&quot; it is all a job , everything work , everything reality , all blood , all swe@@ at -- no t@@ ears -- no t@@ ears . &quot;
&quot; I work a lot , hard and I love it . &quot;
&quot; when I am deeper into the work , there is no other feeling . &quot;
my work always creates a country from nowhere .
&quot; it is , when set troops up , as m@@ old I am on a canvas . &quot;
&quot; so as bear@@ er one high tone , lie@@ fe a marathon . &quot;
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
&quot; it is creative , mechanical , exhau@@ sting and depri@@ ving , funny and mis@@ erable , cru@@ el and sensible , cru@@ el and reasonable , and the best thing is the sw@@ men . &quot;
there is such a change in me when working out well .
&quot; a mar@@ men starts in my head , and it grows and grows and the sums sounds like a busy road , I could always drive on her . &quot;
&quot; many people take , when I declare them the sums that I over@@ s writing , that writing me joy . &quot;
do not understand me wrong , this does . &quot;
&quot; but the sums -- when I started working with television production , when I began to work and work , build and work , I discovered this thing , this sw@@ men , this energy . the sums ! &quot;
the sums is more than writing .
the sums of action is action and activity . the sums is a drug .
the sums is music . the sums is light and air .
the mar@@ men is the voice of God in my ear .
&quot; and if you have such a sums , you cannot be different from size to size . &quot;
&quot; feeling not to be different than to the size , no matter what price . &quot;
this is called the mar@@ men .
or perhaps it also means a work@@ ah@@ olic .
maybe it is geni@@ us .
maybe it is the ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I do not know .
&quot; I know only that I am not for failure , and I know only that I love the sums . &quot;
&quot; I just want to say to you , I am a Titan , and I know that I will not ask it to question . &quot;
&quot; to make a clear : the more successful I will , the more episodes , the more work , the more things the more , the more you write me , the more what more expectations are there . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to be successful , the more you need to work . &quot;
and what did I say about work ?
&quot; I love work , not true ? &quot;
&quot; the country I create , the marathon , the marathon , the army , the canvas , the high tone , the sums , the sw@@ men , the sw@@ men . &quot;
I like this sw@@ men . I love the sums .
I need the sums . I am the mar@@ men .
am I only this sw@@ am ?
and then the sums .
&quot; revised , exagger@@ ated , exagger@@ ated , burned . &quot;
the mar@@ men stops .
&quot; now , my three daughters to the truth is acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to the truth that their m@@ um is a single working place . &quot;
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my m@@ um will not be there but you can write my N@@ anny .
&quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; Sch@@ ätz@@ chen , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da country . &quot;
there are the children of a Titan@@ ium .
you are baby @-@ Titan@@ ium .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the sums up . &quot;
the tot@@ als of the engine was hidden .
I loved my work no more . the engine was off .
the sums did not come back .
my sums was broken .
&quot; I made the same things as always : the same Titan@@ ium work , 15 hours of weekends , no Reu@@ ters , no Reu@@ ters , no Reu@@ ters , don &apos;t exist , with all @-@ heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no sums .
in me was silence .
&quot; four television programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four television programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously ... &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a show @-@ Titan , &quot;
&quot; everything was gray , I just had no fun anymore . &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the mar@@ men and the mar@@ men was I .
&quot; so what do you do if what you do , the work that you love , suddenly f@@ aded ? &quot;
&quot; I know some may think : &quot; Heu@@ l you from , bl@@ ö@@ der author . &quot;
&quot; but you know it , you do what you are doing , you love how to be a teacher , a m@@ aler , a m@@ aler , a m@@ aler one knows , and knows how the sums it feels , when the sums stops , who is you then ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; if the song of my heart sounds , I can survive in silence ? &quot;
and then my &quot; southern states &quot; is taking a question .
&quot; I am on the way out there , late and she says : &quot; Mama , magic you play ? &quot;
&quot; and I will already say no , when I will be aware of two things : &quot;
&quot; first , I have to say yes to everything and secondly , she called me not &quot; swal@@ lowed . &quot;
it is called nobody and more &quot; swal@@ lows . &quot;
when is this happened ?
&quot; I miss it when I am Titan am and my sums , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so says it : &quot; &quot; Mama , &quot; &quot; you play ? &quot;
&quot; and I say , &quot; yes . &quot;
that is nothing special .
&quot; we play and encounter their sisters , we lau@@ gh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body po@@ ops &quot; . &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; but it is outstanding , because my pain and my panic , in the lon@@ eliness and absence of sums , I can do nothing , except to aband@@ on . &quot;
I am focused .
I am silent .
&quot; the country , which I create , the marathon , the marathon , the army , the canvas , the high tone - they no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; everything that exists are glu@@ ed finger and hum@@ ble kis@@ ses , delicate voices , Wach@@ sm@@ al@@ sti@@ ched and the song where things get rid of it , or whatever the girl is in &quot; Die Eis@@ als &quot; . &quot; &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air at this place is so close that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me sol@@ ves .
a mental door goes on and an energy circuit comes in .
&quot; and that is not immediately , but it happens . &quot;
I feel it .
the sums is slowly coming back .
&quot; no full volume , hardly there , it is quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there . &quot;
&quot; not the sums , but a sw@@ men . &quot;
and now I feel like I would know a magical secret .
but let us remain with the matter .
it is love . that is all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something that we have forgotten .
&quot; the sums , the working environment , the Titan@@ en@@ sum@@ ms , that is just the replacement . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you who you are , if I am saying who I am , when I am descri@@ bing the help of broad@@ casts and television hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real sums . &quot;
the sums is not power and it is not work @-@ specific .
it depends on the pleasure .
true Sum@@ ms is dependent on love .
&quot; the sums is the power , which comes from the l@@ ust . &quot;
true Sum@@ ms is self @-@ confidence and peace .
&quot; real sums ign@@ ores the pressure of history , which lead to enlight@@ ened tasks , the expectation and the pressure . &quot;
the real sums is simple and original .
&quot; the real Sum@@ men is the voice of God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps it will escape the wrong words , for which God said to me that I am a Titan am ? &quot;
it is just love .
&quot; we all need a bit more love , much more love . &quot;
&quot; once my child wants to play with me , I will say yes . &quot;
&quot; I am doing this for a fixed rule , so I can free myself as a work@@ ah@@ olic of any gu@@ ilt . &quot;
&quot; it is law , I have no other choice . I have no other choice unless I want to hear the sums again . &quot;
&quot; I wish it would be as simple . I am not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
&quot; as a result , I am not able to play as well as working . &quot;
&quot; the truth does hurt , &quot;
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
&quot; I always work , because I love it . &quot;
I prefer to work at the workplace as at home .
&quot; this conc@@ ession is painful , because what kind of man work rather than to be home ? &quot;
&quot; well yes , I . &quot;
&quot; time honestly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; -- &quot;
I have to have problems .
&quot; that I am to relaxed , is none of it . &quot;
&quot; we ras@@ en in the garden around , and back , back and forth . &quot;
&quot; we make small dance parties , &quot;
we sing and play ball .
we sh@@ plat@@ inum soap bu@@ b@@ bles .
&quot; I feel mainly sti@@ ff , ab@@ sent and confused . &quot;
I always write to my cell phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
&quot; my children show me how one lives , and the sums of the universe fulfil@@ s me . &quot;
I play and play until I ask myself : why did we hear about playing with the games ?
you can also ! say they always yes if your child wants to play with you .
&quot; maybe , hold me for nai@@ ve , for a diary @-@ pack . &quot;
&quot; you have probably right , but you can do it ! &quot;
you have time !
and do you know why ? you are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et Show figure .
your child will find less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
&quot; my little ones want to play at most 15 minutes with me , to them that they want to do something different . &quot;
&quot; there are wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
after 15 minutes a Marien@@ et@@ le or bis@@ cuit .
&quot; and she speak@@ eth my teen@@ ager &apos;s daughter all 15 minutes long with me , I am mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; there are only 15 minutes , more do not need it . &quot;
&quot; each can bring 15 minutes in a piece , even on a bad mood day ! &quot;
15 minutes on the piece !
&quot; no mobile phone , no laundry , no distr@@ action . &quot;
the day is short : dinner the children are ready .
but 15 minutes are inside !
&quot; my children are my kindness , my world . it must not be the children . it is true to feel the sums , a place for his soul @-@ peace . &quot;
it is not about playing with their own children . it is about joy
about the &quot; Games &quot; in general .
allow yourself the 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
find it out and keep it yourself .
&quot; I am not perfect in it . I sh@@ alt and I vic@@ tories . friends meet , books to enjoy the day &quot;
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; is short for everything I have given up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in training , when I wanted to meet myself more and more . &quot;
&quot; 15 minutes of the piece , why do not have full 15 minutes away ? &quot;
what can it be wrong ? nothing !
the sums came back in my spare time . the sums seems to return when I am not working .
work does not work without games .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months opens a door , the energy flows and I find myself in my office . I listen to new ideas . I lost my way to new ideas . I use it to full@@ est and I love my work again . &quot;
&quot; I like the sums , but I love it . &quot;
I do not need it .
&quot; I am not the sums , the sums is not I ... not anymore . &quot;
soap bu@@ b@@ bles and glu@@ ed finger , dinner with friends . &quot;
this is my sums .
the sums of life .
the sums of love .
&quot; the sums of work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so grateful . &quot;
&quot; it is s@@ lu@@ b to me that I am a Titan am . I have never seen a Titan , the trip to Jerusalem . &quot;
I said yes to less work and for more games .
and nevertheless I have everything in the handle . my brain is still functioning . my camp@@ fire are still burning .
&quot; the more I play , the more happ@@ ier I and my children . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel like a good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more clear is my head . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better work I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the sums . the land , which I create , the marathon , the troops , the sums , the sums , the sums , the sums , the sums , the mar@@ men : the sums of life . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this sums , the more makes this unusual , driving , naked and new life feeling in me wide . less Titan -- more I ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel exactly this sums , the more I know who I am . &quot;
&quot; I am author . I think things out , I aw@@ aken you to life . &quot;
&quot; that belongs to the job , that means to live his dream . &quot;
that is the dream of this job ;
because a dream job should be a little dre@@ aming .
I said &apos; Yes &apos; to less work and for more games .
Titan@@ en has no chance .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thanks nice .
I am neuro@@ surgery .
as most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human trag@@ e@@ dies .
&quot; I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a heavy stroke or accident . &quot;
&quot; for us Neuro@@ surgery is it very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other bodi@@ ly organs , a very low ability to self @-@ healing . &quot;
&quot; after a severe violation of the central nervous system , the patients often have a permanent , heavy disability . &quot;
this is probably the reason why I work functional neuro@@ surgery .
what is a functional neuro@@ sur@@ geon ?
a doctor who attempts to improve ner@@ ve functions through various surgical measures .
&quot; surely they have heard of one of the most famous , the &quot; deep @-@ &quot; stimulation &quot; &quot; which is impl@@ anted in the brain to affect the circuits of neur@@ ons so that neuro@@ logical function has improved . &quot;
it really is an amazing technology . she has improved the fate of patients with Park@@ inson who suffered from he@@ ater tre@@ m@@ bling and heavy pain .
&quot; however , Neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ cure . &quot;
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I want to show you that we are very close .
with some help the brain can help themselves .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was conduc@@ tive Ober@@ physician and worked day and night in the emergency .
often I supply patients with sk@@ ull @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
they have to imagine that at sk@@ ull @-@ Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ mat@@ a the brain de@@ pressed and the sk@@ ull pressure .
to save the life you have to reduce the sk@@ ull pressure .
so you must sometimes remove a part of the brain mass .
&quot; instead of throwing brain mass , we decided to analyse with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , an bi@@ ologist to analyze the brain mass . &quot;
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
&quot; to let cells grow from a th@@ eb@@ est@@ ück , comparable to small children that are removed from your families . &quot;
&quot; you have to find the right diet , temperature , humidity and the environments to let them thri@@ ve . &quot;
exactly this we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts by Jean @-@ François .
he saw it under his micro@@ scope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells , which are surrounded by small , un@@ mature cells . &quot;
perhaps you still know from the bi@@ ologi@@ c lessons that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells that can transform into any cell type of the organism .
&quot; the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small niche of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising to receive this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of brain mass in the op .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die ; they are imm@@ or@@ tal .
but these cells stopped differently .
they split slowly and after a couple of weeks they died even .
&quot; so we saw a new , strange cell population that looked like stem cells , but was different . &quot;
&quot; we needed long , to understand where they came . &quot;
you come from these cells .
these blue and red cells hot Dou@@ bl@@ ec@@ or@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
you will make 4 % of our large hir@@ n@@ ind@@ enz@@ els .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the fet@@ us they provide for the folding of the brain .
but why do they stay with us ?
we do not know that .
&quot; we believe they take part in the cure of the brain , as we find them in higher concentr@@ ations close to brain infring@@ ements . &quot;
&quot; however , this is not so secure . &quot;
&quot; however , one thing is clear -- by these cells we received our master cells . &quot;
we are facing a potential cell source that allows bra@@ ins .
we had to prove it .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ speaking area and then cultiv@@ ate the cells exactly as it did Jean @-@ François did
and then highlight the color to follow it in the brain .
in the last step we impl@@ anted them at the Ent@@ rance registry of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ ologist Trans@@ plantation -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ trans@@ plant .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we plan these cells into normal brain tissues ? and what will happen if we plan@@ ing the same cells into damaged brain tissues ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we could work with monkeys .
&quot; in the first scenario we impl@@ anted the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that they had been completely removed after a few weeks , they go back home . the room is already occupied , so they will not go there , so disappear . &quot;
in the second scenario we added a violation and re@@ impl@@ anted exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they washed to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were re@@ impl@@ anted .
&quot; the proof that they show are these little points . these are the cells that we are in vit@@ ro , in the culture . &quot;
here we could not stop .
will these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain death ?
&quot; so , we exercis@@ ed monkeys with a manual skill task . &quot;
they had to take feeding pell@@ ets from one tray .
that made them very good .
when they had achieved a stable skill level we last in the motor cor@@ tex the hand@@ or@@ ic area .
&quot; then the monkeys was par@@ aly@@ sed , they could no longer move their hand . &quot;
&quot; just as it would happen in people , they recover spont@@ aneously up to a certain degree , just as after a stroke . &quot;
the patients are par@@ aly@@ sed and then try to recover with the help of sculp@@ tural brain mechanisms . they come to a certain degree , just as in the monkey . &quot;
&quot; when we were sure that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery , impl@@ anted we impl@@ anted his own cells . &quot;
&quot; on the left side they see the monkey , which spont@@ aneously recovered . &quot;
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance before injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
&quot; now , see when we re@@ impl@@ anted the cells : the same aspir@@ ation , two months after the matur@@ ation plant . &quot;
I can tell you that was also very exciting results for us .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can free@@ ze them and later use .
&quot; we can use them in other neuro@@ path@@ ological models , for example at Park@@ inson &apos;s disease . &quot;
but our dream is still going to im@@ itate it in humans .
I really hope I can show you soon as the human brain is the means to cure himself .
many thanks .
&quot; Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , that is wonderful , I am sure that several dozen people in the audience , perhaps even the majority of thinking : &quot; I know someone who need it . &quot;
I definitely .
&quot; of course , the question of which the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials at man . &quot;
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . depart@@ ing from these great results you have to fill about two kil@@ ograms of Pap@@ ers and forms to run this kind of studies .
&quot; BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and a almost professional team . &quot;
&quot; BG : take a look into the future -- you have completed research and attemp@@ ted to get permission to start the clinical trials . if you go further into the future , how many years it will take to get to hospital and this therapy will be available . &quot;
J@@ B : that is difficult to say .
&quot; first of all , it depends on the approval of the clinical study . &quot;
will we allow the authority to start it soon ?
then you have to do this study with a small group of patients .
&quot; it takes a long time to choose the patients to conduct and evaluate the treatments , whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment . &quot;
then you have to apply this to a multi @-@ centralized study .
you first really need to indicate that it is useful before you can supply these treatment .
BG : and that it is safe . J@@ B : natural .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting us and that you told us about it . &quot;
BG : thank you .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them as natural .
&quot; we do not see democracy as the fragile plant that is in reality , but as an inventory of our society . &quot;
we tend to consider it as un@@ changing disease .
we believe that capitalism leads to democracy .
that is not true .
&quot; Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great neigh@@ bor in Beijing have proven that it is quite possible to have a blo@@ oming capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democr@@ atically . &quot;
&quot; in fact , democracy with us , in Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning of the year , when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was un@@ ambig@@ uous that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- not to influence the austerity programmes that have been realized in Greece . &quot;
&quot; in this moment , I thought that there might be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my recorded friends , that would be repeated , if it would change anything . &quot;
at this point I would like to introduce a green model for real democracy .
&quot; I ask you to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group , we could save the democracy , but that we need a true and def@@ ective democracy . &quot;
&quot; for without democracy , our societies become common , our future d@@ ü@@ ster and our great , new technologies are wast@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; to the subject of waste , I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction , which currently threat@@ ens our economies . &quot;
I call it the &quot; Zw@@ ill@@ ings@@ gi@@ f @-@ Parad@@ ox . &quot;
&quot; a summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the school mountain , which th@@ rows its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we all recognise the school @-@ hill , &quot;
but few recognize its purpose .
&quot; a mountain of un@@ contamin@@ ated cash , which could be anxi@@ ous to invest there where it would be productive and in@@ comes to contribute to what it would be productive and also to produce all things which need to urgently need humanity , for example &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; over the past 3 months , in the United States , in England and the Eurozone , 3,4 Bil@@ li@@ on US dollars invested in all the prosperity of goods , such as industrial plants , schools , roads , streets , streets , streets , and so on and so on . &quot;
&quot; 3,4 Bil@@ li@@ ons US dollars sounds like a lot of money until you compar@@ es it with the 5,@@ 1 Bil@@ li@@ ons US dollars , which are at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing they did , except the stock exchange and the real estate prices . &quot;
&quot; thus , debts and in@@ productive capital form the tw@@ ins summit , which is not identical to the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result are stagn@@ ating wages , more than one quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 year @-@ ol@@ ds in the United States , Japan and Europe , and consequently , a low general economic demand that could not invest in which they would not invest in which they would not invest in which they would kill him , if he will grow him , &quot;
b@@ oll@@ ards the circumstances bring about that o@@ di@@ p@@ us kill him .
this is my ha@@ ils with capitalism --
&quot; his exc@@ eed@@ ingly productive labour should be used to improve our lives , to further improve human talents and especially all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies , which are decisive for the salvation of the earth . &quot;
is democracy the solution ?
I believe . but before we continue : what do we understand on democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ el@@ it defined democracy as the form of society in which the open and the poor as a majority to control the government .
the ath@@ ic democracy naturally closed too many from --
&quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , there would be a mistake to reduce the importance of ath@@ ic democracy due to these closures . &quot;
&quot; the decisive factor in the ath@@ ic democracy was and is that they called the working poor , and not only the right to freedom of expression , but more important and crucial that they gave them the right to political co @-@ determination with the same mood in questions of the prosec@@ ution . &quot;
ath@@ ic democracy has not kept long before --
&quot; as a cand@@ le , which is very bright lights , it is also rapidly burned . &quot;
&quot; however , our present @-@ liberal democr@@ acies do not have their roots in the ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; but in the Mag@@ na C@@ arta , in the glorious Revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution . &quot;
&quot; while the ath@@ ic democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened arms , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na C@@ arta , which was ultimately a stat@@ ute for ruling . &quot;
&quot; for liberal democracy only came upon , as a complete separation of politics and economy , and the democratic process of politics used , while the economy is the world of corporations -- a democracy @-@ free zone . &quot;
&quot; in our present democr@@ acies , since the time , in which this separation of politics and economy began , an un@@ ques@@ tioning struggle between the two , the economy has gradually under@@ gone the politics . &quot;
do you wonder why the politicians are no longer like this ?
it is not on a de@@ generation of its DNA .
&quot; it is that one can nowadays be in the government , and nevertheless not in power because the power of politics into the economy is ab@@ ed and the areas are separated . &quot;
I mentioned my ha@@ ils with capitalism .
&quot; if you think about it , it is in about like a herd of smoke , which is so sustainable the animals , of which they nour@@ ishes themselves , dec@@ imal by the end therefore hungry . &quot;
&quot; similarly , it is similar to the economy which the politics becomes so far @-@ caused by the self @-@ caused economic crisis itself . the power of corporations grows , political goods are increasing , inequality increases , the whole economic demand falls and the managing directors of the corporations are becoming more anxi@@ ous to invest the cash of their companies . &quot;
&quot; the more successful of capitalism the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; &#91; the people &#93; out of democracy , the higher the tw@@ ins summit , and the greater the waste of human labour power and prosperity of humanity . &quot;
&quot; if this is true , it is obvious that we have to bring the politics and the economy again and it would be better if in the ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
the Marxist left had already had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very strange .
&quot; the doctrine of the deb@@ acle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can reg@@ ain a position as in the ancient Athens , without creating new ways of brut@@ ality and waste . &quot;
but there is a solution : working out the working poor !
capitalism does it going through automation and robots replaced by automation and robots .
&quot; the problem is , so long economy and politics are separate areas , the automation becomes higher , the waste of waste , and the social conflicts deeper , as it is very soon as I believe -- in countries like China . &quot;
&quot; so we have to re@@ configure the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and in this respect we respect the united area of democracy , otherwise we end up in a sick surveillance @-@ Hyper@@ auto@@ cr@@ acy that lets the film &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; like a documentation . &quot;
&quot; thus , the question is not whether capitalism has created the technical achievements which he has brought forth , will survive -- &quot;
&quot; the interest@@ ingly question is whether capitalism is divided by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the &quot; &quot; Star Trek &quot; , &quot; or through something that the company is stuck in &quot; &quot; Star Trek &quot; , &quot; or into a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ ener &quot; Ag@@ ora &quot; , &quot; in long talks the sense of life . &quot;
&quot; I believe , we must be optim@@ istic . &quot;
&quot; so what liked it , how could it look like this &quot; star Trek &quot; -@@ ar@@ tery Utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; similar D@@ yst@@ opy &quot; ? &quot;
&quot; in practical implementation , I would like to give you a few examples briefly . &quot;
&quot; in the field of companies : ask for a capital market in which you deserve money , while you are working and in which your capital follows you from a job to the next , and the company -- no matter which you are currently working -- is the property of those who currently work in the company . &quot;
then all income from capital and from dis@@ solve and the concept of wage labor is completely over@@ hau@@ led .
&quot; no distinction between those who belong to the company , but not to work , and employees who work there , but not belong there between capital and labor , no large gaps between investment and co@@ ars , and ultimately does not asc@@ end tw@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; in the field of global political economy , please realize that our national currencies would have a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which is presented by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest threshold countries &#93; , in the interests of the whole of humanity . &quot;
&quot; continue to be tra@@ ded before the entire world trade in this currency -- we call them &quot; &quot; cosmos &quot; , &quot; in units of &quot; cosmos &quot; &quot; -- and each government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade union of the respective country into a common fund . &quot;
&quot; also , imagine that this fund is investing in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world , in which investment means . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes was proposed in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that one had not had the technical means at that time .
&quot; today we have them , in particular in the background of a united policy and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world I describe at the same time , at the same time , in which they preferred people , and Marxist , because they buried the separation of capital and labour in the tr@@ ash of history , and key@@ fluid , globally key@@ chain . &quot;
but above all others it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy .
we will wake up in such a world
or will we go into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ opy ?
the answer depends on how to reach us politically .
&quot; it is in our hands , and we do it better democr@@ atically . &quot;
thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself in your biography itself as a liberal Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
&quot; Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if anything about what I just say is relevant , then Marx is relevant . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the re@@ union of politics and economy ... do we do not mean that technological development generate such a massive decline in the economic demand , which is Lar@@ ry sum@@ mers as &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; through the transfer of this crisis from a part of the earth to the next , as we &apos;re currently experiencing it , it is not only our democr@@ acies dest@@ ab@@ ili@@ ze , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is true , Marx is quite relevant , &quot;
&quot; as Hay@@ ek , this is why I am a liberal Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and therefore I am also completely co@@ gn@@ r . &quot;
&quot; BG : actually , and now we are it too . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ V : if you are not acceptable , you do not think enough . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosoph@@ ical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein that said . BG : in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the speakers , you have said very clearly what you think of the sight of the West in China . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hy@@ po@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democr@@ acies we have the sunshine of democracy .
&quot; as I said in my presentation , we have limited democracy on politics during the area where most of the economy is playing -- a totally democratic free zone . &quot;
&quot; in some respects , if I may say the so pro@@ voc@@ ative , resem@@ bles China today the England of the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; because -- remember -- we tend to link liber@@ alism with democracy -- that is a mistake , historically considered . &quot;
liber@@ alism , liberal as John Stu@@ art Mill --
he was particularly scep@@ tical what the democratic development concerns .
&quot; what one can now observe in China , similar to the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
&quot; now , China is now being able to do what the West has done himself in the 19th century , sm@@ ells r@@ hy@@ po@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
BG : I am sure that many list@@ eners are curious about your experiences as a finance minister of Greece beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I believe that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back for six months later on the first semester ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , out of personal sight , and very dis@@ appointing because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the eurozone . &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the eurozone , &quot;
&quot; namely , by the self @-@ determination to say , and the constant den@@ ial den@@ ial that a massive distor@@ tion line caused by the eurozone and continues to be massi@@ vely threatened by the development of the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- by the way , the first proposal was to reveal that this den@@ ial . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , the powers within the Eurozone , within the European group , continues to den@@ ial the den@@ ial . &quot;
&quot; however , you know what comes . &quot;
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
&quot; if you are trying to obtain an economic system that is not viable , through political will and author@@ it@@ arian@@ ism in life , you might be able to delay a while if then the change happens ab@@ rupt and destruc@@ tive . &quot;
BG : what change can you see ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future if we do not change their structure .
BG : have you made any mistakes in your time as a finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who look back -- seriously ...
&quot; if there is a Minister of Finance , or any minister , who claims after 6 months in office , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , he has no mistakes , then it is a dangerous person . &quot;
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the request for the extension of the school programme at the end of February .
&quot; I believed that there was a honest interest in the pages of the don@@ ors , a common solution . &quot;
but that did not exist .
they just wanted to bring our government to the case only because they didn &apos;t want to deal with the promises that were passed through the Eurozone .
they didn &apos;t want to be classified that it has been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
that is worse than during the Great Depression .
&quot; none of the Troika of the don@@ ors who imposed us these policies , and a : &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot;
&quot; BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive table of talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is coming from someone who lives and loves for . &quot;
my biggest fear is that the eurozone is not survived .
&quot; for if they are not survived , the shared tile forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot;
&quot; this will not be dis@@ astro@@ us alone for Europe , but for the entire world economy . &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; when we hit ourselves up the way of a post @-@ modern 1930 , it seems to me , it will be de@@ ar@@ able for the future of Europeans as well as non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope you will be wrong at this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you very much for you at TED . &quot;
Y@@ V : thanks .
&quot; by Roy Price , most of this never heard , even though he is probably responsible for 22 @-@ sized minutes of your life on 19 April 2013 . &quot;
&quot; probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for many of you . &quot;
this goes back to the decision which Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is conduc@@ tive event at Amazon Studios
the TV production company of Amazon .
&quot; he is 47 years old , sl@@ ender , has a yellow and describes herself on Twitter as &quot; movies , TV , technology , Tac@@ os . &quot;
&quot; Roy has a very important job , because he is responsible for shows the shows and the content that will produce Amazon . &quot;
&quot; of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought industry . &quot;
there are so many TV series that Roy can &apos;t choose any one .
&quot; he must find shows , which are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he must find shows that are completely on the right at this turn . &quot;
this curve is the evaluation of over 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the evaluation proceeds from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this rating .
&quot; will your show be rated with nine and higher , this is a winner . &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; these are shows how &quot; breaking bath , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones &quot; , &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows , the ad@@ dic@@ tive , where you ask a season , your brain asks : &quot; where is there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left , here at this end , shows how &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ aras &quot; -- -- this should tell you enough what is going off at this end of the curve . &quot;
&quot; Roy Price does not care to get to the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to provide &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ aras . &quot;
&quot; he makes more thoughts on the medium scale , the average television -- the shows , which are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t delight . &quot;
so he must make sure he really is on the right side .
&quot; the pressure is available , and of course it is the first time that Amazon makes such a thing , therefore Roy does not want to risk nothing . &quot;
he wants to create success .
&quot; he needs guaranteed success , so he keeps a contest . &quot;
&quot; he takes many ideas for television shows and choose an evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online where they can watch everyone for free . &quot;
&quot; and if Amazon comes out there , one can still acc@@ ede , right ? &quot;
millions of spectators have a look at these episodes .
&quot; however , they do not know that they are observed at the start of these shows . &quot;
they are observed by Roy and his team who record everything .
&quot; you capture , when you start the show when you pause , which parts you can transfer or again look . &quot;
&quot; they collect millions of data to decide with these data , which show them should produce . &quot;
&quot; in fact , they collect the data , process these and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com on four re@@ publi@@ can US Sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
do anyone know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many will remember this show because they were not so good . &quot;
&quot; it is just an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- as the average of this curve 7.@@ 4 is and Alpha House lan@@ det at 7,5 -- thus something above average , but not exactly what is s@@ ore , and his team worked . &quot;
&quot; about at the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy he is always looking to find this a super @-@ show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it something different . &quot;
&quot; instead of holding a competition , he and his team saw the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the reviews that they like the shows , whose shows they like etc . &quot;
&quot; then use this data to find out these little details about the audience : what shows they like , which producers , which actors . &quot;
&quot; when they had all the parts together , they went a wagon and chose not to make a Sit@@ com on four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a Sen@@ ator . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; house of Cards &quot; . Net@@ fli@@ x has a hit , at least for the first two sc@@ ars . &quot;
house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 review on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
&quot; of course , the question is : what happened here ? &quot;
&quot; one has two very com@@ peti@@ tive , data sealed companies . &quot;
they connect these many data together and it works great for one of them but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because the logic somehow defe@@ ated that this should work with everything .
&quot; if you collect millions of data , for a decision which you meet , then you should make a good decision . &quot;
you have 200 years to statistics as Back @-@ Up .
it is optimized by very powerful computers .
&quot; the Mind@@ este what you can expect , is good TV , or ? &quot;
&quot; if data analysis does not work , then this is somewhat fri@@ ght@@ ening because we live in a time when we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television . &quot;
do anyone know here the company Multi @-@ Health System ?
&quot; nobody . OK , this is even good . &quot;
multi @-@ Health System is a software company and I hope that no one will ever get in touch with this software . come in touch with this software you are in prison .
&quot; if someone ask here in the U.S. in prison and ask for dism@@ iss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether an discharge is done or not . &quot;
&quot; just like on Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of decide whether a show is good or bad , it is decided if a person will be good or bad . &quot;
&quot; poor TV , 22 minutes , which can be genuine , but even more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data , &quot;
not always the best results generated . this is not that a company like multi @-@ health system does not know how to use data .
the data rever@@ sible companies are also wrong .
yes . even Google sometimes makes errors .
&quot; in 2009 , Google announced that they can say through data analysis out@@ breaks from flu , the worst kind , predic@@ t -- by data analysis of the Google research . &quot;
it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation . the success was in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked just fine , year round year , until it suddenly no longer worked , &quot;
and nobody could say why .
&quot; it simply did not work , this was again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
even the data rever@@ sible companies like Amazon and Google may sometimes understand something .
&quot; despite all these errors , data streams into decisions of life a -- at the workplace , in the legal framework , in medicine . &quot;
so we should rather make sure that data are helpful .
&quot; I also know many difficulties with data . I work in the computer @-@ based gene@@ tics -- a field , where some very kl@@ u@@ ge people un@@ imagin@@ able many data to make serious decisions as the decision for cancer therapy
&quot; or the development of a drug . over the years , I have realized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be distributed . &quot;
&quot; you ever have to solve a complex problem , just do two things : &quot;
&quot; as a first place , you put this problem into its parts , so you can analyze components ; as a second place , you put the parts back together to grasp a discharge . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you need to do this several times , but there are always two things : apart and put together again . &quot;
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help create a problem and understand its parts . &quot;
they are not suitable to conclude the parts again and then come to a discharge .
there is another tool and we have it all : our brain .
&quot; if there is something that is good when the brain is good , it is parts and pieces again together , even if the information is incomplete to write a good decision -- especially when it &apos;s the brain of a expert . &quot;
&quot; therefore , I think was Net@@ fli@@ x so successful because they used data and mind where they are also in the process . &quot;
&quot; they use data to better understand their audience , what else would not have been able to put all these parts , put together again and make a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; &quot; that was not in the data . &quot;
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show what meant that they entered a great personal risk with this decision .
&quot; on the other hand , this is in the wrong way . &quot;
&quot; they used the data to control all their decisions , first when they were offset by TV ideas when they chose &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; as show . &quot;
it was a safe decision because they were able to say : &quot; that tell us the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired outcome .
&quot; data are helpful for better decisions , but I believe that things go wrong when data will begin to control our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data are only a tool and to forget that this device is quite useful . &quot;
many of you will ...
&quot; before it was data , this was the device for decisions . &quot;
many know it .
&quot; it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; . it is amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ or or no @-@ question you just have to sh@@ ake the ball to get an answer . &quot; &quot; most likely &quot; -- exactly here in this moment . &quot;
I will keep it later with a technical demo .
&quot; so far , I have made some decisions in my life until I could hear in the ball . &quot;
&quot; however , as you can of course know if you have the data available , you would like to replace them through a bit much de@@ preci@@ ation , such as data analysis to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not change the ground@@ work .
&quot; thus , the ball cl@@ assy and clever and clever thing . ultimately , it is possible to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn . &quot;
&quot; and I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the great amount of data still paying , making decisions , an expert in what you are doing , and risks . &quot;
&quot; in the end , it is not the data , but the risks that you end at the right end of the curve . &quot;
thanks nice .
