<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">They might know him because he won as a New York Times Reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">"long before someone had heard of Edward Snowden, Risen One book, in which he made spectacular that the NSA illegal telephones of Americans have heard."</seg>
<seg id="4">But there is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in this he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation, in which the CIA admitted to Iran, drafts for a nuclear bomb."</seg>
<seg id="6">"if that sounds crazy, read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know whom the chapters did not exist?</seg>
<seg id="9">The US government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"for almost 10 years, the government was identified against vines and called him to name his alleged sources."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this turn, he became a symbol for the pattern of the government, whistleblower to condemn and journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to the First Constitutional Court, the media have the right to publish secret information."</seg>
<seg id="13">"however, it is impossible to apply this right if media cannot get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave ones."</seg>
<seg id="14">"so as the government at Risen anchors, he did something that many brave reporters already did before him: he refused, and said that he would rather go to prison."</seg>
<seg id="15">"so from 2007 to 2015 Risen, so with the risk to go into prison."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, only days before the process, happened something extraordinary."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, although they were years of years of information that it would be essential for their case, the demands of the government were dropped."</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring the reporter and sources can always hide less.</seg>
<seg id="19">"instead of fail and return to the statements, that also could do its digital foot-acids for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"and so the investigator, without his consent, his phone-wise geheim,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"just like his e-mail data, financial and bank information, his credit card, and even travel arrangements with the list of his flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA Whistleblower and risk."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, this is just one of many cases."</seg>
<seg id="24">"President Obama promised to protect Whistleblowers, but instead the judiciary still condemns more than any U.S. governments before him."</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government is too much at home as a secret."</seg>
<seg id="26">"since September 11, almost every article about national security was the result of that a whistleblower to a journalist."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so we put the press work on the game, which shall be protected by the first Constitutional Court, because the government has more and more ways to play all."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but just like technology, the government allows to handle the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="29">"while they are able to contact them from the moment in which they contact, rather than in the descendants, in the witness."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today, there are communication software that had not yet been written as saws his book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or telephone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"such technology is SecureDrop, an open source code system for whistleblowers, which was originally developed by the internet famous, which was originally developed by us Aaron Swartz, and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation, where I have been working."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news website, just like the Washington Post."</seg>
<seg id="33">"you can upload documents or send information, just as in any ordinary contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">This will then be encrypted and saved on a server to which only the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">"so the government cannot obtain more information, and many of the information they would request, would not be available from."</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is but only a small part of the whole to protect the press of the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">"unfortunately, governments around the world develop new spionagechnologies which are jeopardized us all."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it is to make sure that not only technology denominator such as Edward Snowden have an opportunity to do misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblowers,"</seg>
<seg id="39">"who wants to report abnormalities in the care of soldiers, and will report from crowded hospitals. or the next environment workers, the alarm to seseated water from Flint suggests. or a pilgrimage-insider, who warned us before the next financial crisis."</seg>
<seg id="40">"after all, these technologies have not only been made for those who want to cover crimes, but to protect our all constitutional rights."</seg>
<seg id="41">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="42">"[on 3 April 2016, the biggest data sheet of history was published.] [the" Panama Papers "" was hidden by Global Wanders in tax havens.] [what does this week we have been hidden by news about a Leck of 11 million documents in Panama's law firm Mosbag Fonseca. "</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers are going to go to companies such as Mosbag Fonseca and say:" okay, we need an anonymous company. "</seg>
<seg id="45">"we actually see the e-mails, the exchange of messages, as the whole system works as it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Islands Prime Minister is resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">Also there are reports that a allies of brutal Syrians Baschar al-Assad briefcases in tax havens has.</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russia's President Vladimir Putin performs, over a close friend of children's days, a famous Cellists."</seg>
<seg id="50">"now there will be a lot of rich people and others, the nervous is waiting for the next release, and the next enthused documents."</seg>
<seg id="51">Now that sounds like the lot of an agent or an John-grisham-novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it seems wept away from you, ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we tackle this?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is: if the rich and powerful in the position are to hide their assets in tax havens and not to pay all their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads."</seg>
<seg id="55">And that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organisation, Global Wise, these revelations are phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"all over the world, media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens are used by some of a few are used to hide their assets and worship -- something that we have been discussing and reveal something for ten years."</seg>
<seg id="58">"I think many people will be very confusing this whole world, and it's hard to understand how these tax havens work."</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine like a Matrjoschuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">"so one has a company in another company, in another company, in another company which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these prayers."</seg>
<seg id="61">"it can be very difficult for criminal prosecution and tax authorities, as well as journalists or civil society really to understand what thing is."</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it interesting that there are fewer reports about this matter in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="63">"probably because there has been no prominent Americans now, which came in these revelations."</seg>
<seg id="64">"now, it is not that there are no enough Americans to hide their assets in tax havens."</seg>
<seg id="65">"but by the principle, according to which these tax havens work, Mosbag Fonseca is less American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"if we would have a data base from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples which have connections to the US."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, it is so that you need to give less information in some U.S. states to provide less information, to create a company than a library."</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of inconsistency in the US has allowed the employees of schooling to be zooming in school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">"it has no amounts, especially susceptible to zooming investors."</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that all concerns us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Wost we wanted to find out how all this in practice looks like.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does this actually work?</seg>
<seg id="73">"so, we sent a covered actor in the offices of 13 Anwaltsas in Manhattan."</seg>
<seg id="74">"our investigator gave himself as a African Minister, bringing a digest money to the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet."</seg>
<seg id="75">Shocked us in shock that all were made up to an advocate of our investigator suggestion as he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">"these were all appeals. none of these lawyers took us as a client, and of course no one was handed over to the money. however, it shows the problem with this system."</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as an individual case.</seg>
<seg id="78">"it is not about a single lawyer, which has underlined up the proposals."</seg>
<seg id="79">"it is not about a single peak police, wrapped in a scandal."</seg>
<seg id="80">"it is about how the system works, through the corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"and to cope with this, we must change the rules."</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to complain this kind of behavior.</seg>
<seg id="83">"this may sound all very dowsing, as if we could do nothing about it; as if nothing could ever change, as if it is always the rich and powerful."</seg>
<seg id="84">"but as a born optimist, I really see that some change has begun."</seg>
<seg id="85">"in the last couple of years, we have seen the violations of more transparency in which the owners of companies concerned."</seg>
<seg id="86">The topic took political attention through British Prime Minister David Cameron in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">"since then, the EU registers the central registers at the national level, who really lies behind companies in Europe, and who controls them."</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is hereditary.</seg>
<seg id="89">"the parties of both parties have brought a legislative draft in both parliamentary chambers, but this does not make the progress we would like to see."</seg>
<seg id="90">"we would really like to see how these Panama disclosure, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, as a means used to ensure greater transparency in the U.S. and globally."</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Wise this is a moment for changes.</seg>
<seg id="92">"we need ordinary people who are angry, when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind projectors."</seg>
<seg id="93">"we need managers in the economy, which stand up and say," Intransparent is not good for business. "</seg>
<seg id="94">"we need leading politicians to recognize the problem and to use it, through laws this kind of inconsistency."</seg>
<seg id="95">"together we can end the inconsistency, which now allows this sort of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering."</seg>
<seg id="96">"this is the story, as I once again kidnapped and in the luggage of a red Mazowl."</seg>
<seg id="97">"one day after I finished my design study, I made a backyard."</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda remained and looked at my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a road trip through the whole country. afterwards he would go to the peacefps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I lud him on a beer. he told me about how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "where do you go tonight?"</seg>
<seg id="104">"he made the whole thing worse:" "I do not know it."</seg>
<seg id="105">"and I thought:" "Oh, man!"</seg>
<seg id="106">What should I now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">"but I just got to know him! he said, he would go to the peacemakers, but I don't know if he is really planning. I don't want to land in the trunk of a Mazowl!"</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small stove!</seg>
<seg id="111">"then I heard me:" "I have a balloon. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">"a voice in my head said," "h, as please?"</seg>
<seg id="113">"at night I was then in bed, I died at the ceiling and thought:" "Oh man! what have I burned myself here?"</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild sleep in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I got such a fear that I got out of the bed, on tenth part to the door, and my sleep door."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The artwork that he had bought from me today in his classroom. he is now teachers.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has completely changed my viewpoint.</seg>
<seg id="121">"maybe the people who were sold to me in childhood as foreigners, actually friends who only waited on it?"</seg>
<seg id="122">"people on my air mat, has been normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air."</seg>
<seg id="123">"we make a break, two years later..."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I am unemployed, almost plough, my roommate moves out and the rent is increased."</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">"I believe, creativity can create it, fear in fun."</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote my best friend and new roommates Brian Chesky:" Brian, I have survived, how we could earn something to make a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk including breakfast, a mattress and every morning breakfast. "</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and thorough as "air matratze and breakfast" [AIRBed aNd Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mat on wood floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">"they found it super, and we too."</seg>
<seg id="132">"I am sure, our cheese tink-Omelet tasted completely different because we made them for our guests."</seg>
<seg id="133">"we talked to them through the whole city. when we had passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle, starred Brian and I ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and to pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">The things came into rolls.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, closed to us as a developer."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if you could make a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">"we presented ourselves to the investors:" "we want to create a site on the people publicly owned by their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors can be closed when visiting."</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the Internet you can then invite alien people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the rocket would fall.</seg>
<seg id="142">But indeed they do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">"no one who is still very near Trost, would invest in a shop, the foreigner allowed to sleep in apartments of other people."</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we have learned as children all that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">"if you have a problem, one finds himself on the things you can well. we could desiging."</seg>
<seg id="147">"at the Kunstakademie, we learned that design is much more than just appearance and whaptics -- it is the overall experience."</seg>
<seg id="148">"we learned how to desigs objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust by design, between people who have never met before."</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create with design trust?</seg>
<seg id="151">"I would like to give you a sample, which degree confidence we seek."</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumb high when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Enter your message from your left sitting section.</seg>
<seg id="157">This silent trip of panic that you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts sense when they open the door the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">For the only thing that is more personal than your phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">"visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet."</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel that to keep in the hands of a stranger in the hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most sense the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">"so, most guests feel when they stay elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason can our company exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Only once who has actually Al Gores?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you proclaim to Twitter that he is responsible for the president of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">They have now experienced what kind of confidence we want to build. I would like to tell you some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a small detail about this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">"what if your neighbour could have imagined once again with his name; if he told him, where he comes, how his dog or his children come to?"</seg>
<seg id="170">"imagine you could have 150 Beurances, which all say," he can really do very well. "</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you would have to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-thought feedback system strengthens the trust.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we have made some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for the people to cut negative assessments.</seg>
<seg id="175">"finally, we decided to wait until both host and guest had given their assessments before we set them online."</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">"we have conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how probably it is that people trust each other, depending on how much they are at age and residence."</seg>
<seg id="178">"little surprising we trust the people most, who are most similar to us."</seg>
<seg id="179">"the more differences we find, the less we trust."</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social occurrence.</seg>
<seg id="181">It is exciting if you add the call of a person -- in our case by defects.</seg>
<seg id="182">"if one has less than three assessments, nothing changes."</seg>
<seg id="183">"however, one has more than ten, changes everything."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation of the similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">"thus, the right design can help us to overcome some of our deep-root love."</seg>
<seg id="186">"moreover, we learned that trust is dependent on how much you are priced."</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"if you have too little tells us, such as" Hi! "," you do not get an answer. "</seg>
<seg id="189">"you say much, as for example:" I have problems with my mother "-- -- the request is rather not accepted."</seg>
<seg id="190">"so there is an optimal level of openness, such as" "tolle art works in your apartment! I have been doing with my family vacation."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can I create it with design to produce this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which topics to write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">All of our company builds up hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices towards foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="194">"with what we had not expected, the great amount of men who were more than willing to deposit these prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you can see how many people take advantage of our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">"first, incredibly good luck."</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">"thirdly, one need, which was not covered before."</seg>
<seg id="200">For us the business is very good.</seg>
<seg id="201">"of course, there are also times when not everything smooth running."</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have not allowed parties or apprained apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">"at the beginning of the project, I have worked on the customer service team. all calls came directly to my mobile phone."</seg>
<seg id="205">"I stood at front front, when confidence has been broken."</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing much worse than these calls. it is sorry if I just think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">"the disappointment, which one sounds in the voice of Anrufer, and will always be our greatest motivation to continue to improve."</seg>
<seg id="208">"luckily, there had only a fraction of a fraction of the 123 million people."</seg>
<seg id="209">For people trust each other.</seg>
<seg id="210">"when confidence works, it is possible to arise."</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holiday in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host led him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary surgery!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his judgement:</seg>
<seg id="215">Perfect house for travellers who tend to sleep due to seperate activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real Guardian angel that save a life even though they don't know at all.</seg>
<seg id="218">"you drive one in your own car to hospital, when you die, and wait while you get a bypass."</seg>
<seg id="219">"because they do not want you feel lonely, they bring books by."</seg>
<seg id="220">They can even stay longer and stay longer without the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">So of course not every stay will not happen.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relationships behind the pure money action are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled about this term I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is here about an economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"but it is now just" "rent industry", "the matter is not righteous."</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">"people put a part of itself open, and that changes everything."</seg>
<seg id="230">"when you travel nowadays, this is compared to a Fast Food. it is efficient and reliable, but it is less authentic."</seg>
<seg id="231">But what would be if travelling a rich buffet from local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">"what would be, if at any place you visited, a group there would have been waiting to fill a thoroughly and one in a tavern-our neighborhood of which one has never heard;"</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star cook?</seg>
<seg id="234">"nowadays, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy."</seg>
<seg id="235">What would be if we would like apartments of the ground on to the roommates?</seg>
<seg id="236">How would this look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What would be if cities would accept the thoughts of the common sharing?</seg>
<seg id="238">"I imagine cities that allow us to society and relationships, instead of solitude and depreciation."</seg>
<seg id="239">"in the South Korean capital of Seoul, this project has already begun. many parking spaces included in the government,"</seg>
<seg id="240">Were offered by residents. students who were looking for a bite</seg>
<seg id="241">Were conveyed to people whose children were taken out. there were incubator programs have been started.</seg>
<seg id="242">"to finance new start-ups in the Share economy, through our platform alone today night 785 000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a stranger or even hosts."</seg>
<seg id="243">The idea seems to be not as crazy as it was brought to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We have not invented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality was even before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There was similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why does our work right now?</seg>
<seg id="248">"apart from luck and timing, we believe that you can find the right design with the components of trust."</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us to overcome deep prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I think that is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="251">Right to be overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">"I have to think about it, when a red Mazda goes over to me."</seg>
<seg id="253">Of course we know that design cannot solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">"but if it could help us when it had this great influence, I ask myself how we can use design soon."</seg>
<seg id="255">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you see me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? a believer?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">"or suppressed, a brain laundering, a terrorist attack?"</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in security at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I do not give you the fault for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">"thus, the media represent people who look like me."</seg>
<seg id="264">A study yielded that 80% of reporting on Islam and Muslims are negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans think most would not get Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people are not talking to their exercises.</seg>
<seg id="267">"for all those who have never met a Muslim: it's great to meet you."</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">"I am a mother, a coffee maker -- double espresso, with cream."</seg>
<seg id="270">"I am introverted,"</seg>
<seg id="271">A Moulder-Fitness-Fanatikerin, "</seg>
<seg id="272">"and I am a practicing, spiritual muscles."</seg>
<seg id="273">"but not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not so born."</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do so.</seg>
<seg id="275">"when I was 17 years old, I met the decision to outen me."</seg>
<seg id="276">"no, not as homosexual man, like some of my friends, but as a muscle. I decided to bear the hijab, my head cover."</seg>
<seg id="277">"my feminist girlfriends were decomposed," "why do you suppressed yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">"the funny was: at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence, and against pressure that I felt as 17-year-olds, to adapt me to a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only accepted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have been with the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="281">"I read him, thought to, put in question, doubling and credible ultimately."</seg>

<seg id="312">I thought: we should remain at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something really felt right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because people who have attacked this country to attack our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I left the anger of people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to constantly explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">"I have nothing to ask for questions, I love questions."</seg>

<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>

<seg id="332">"the regular visit of a mosque leads to people other faith, and show greater citizens' participation."</seg>
<seg id="333">"and as me a head of police in the area of Washington, DC recently told: people are actually not radicalised in mosques."</seg>

<seg id="335">"in the radicalization process, one has established that he begins online. as a first, the person is cut off from her church, even by their family, so that the person believes that the person believes the true Muslims, and anyone who absent their behaviour and their ideology, is a traitor, or of faith."</seg>

<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">"he said, the problem was just the opposite. every spiritual, with whom she had spoken, she brought to silence and told her that her wrath, their sense of injustice in the world, they would only bring in trouble."</seg>
<seg id="350">"of nothing inspired and something that was given to their anger, it was a main goal for the instrumentalization by extremisten that you gave a solution."</seg>
<seg id="351">This empt set out the link to God and their church.</seg>
<seg id="352">"instead of revealing them for their anger, he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world."</seg>
<seg id="353">"what they learned in the Mosque, keep it before to join the IS."</seg>
<seg id="354">That was an insight like the Islamophobia and my family concerns.</seg>

<seg id="357">"how does the 24-hour consumption acts from fear every day on our democracy, to our thought freedom?"</seg>

<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of the possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">"to enable a system of autonom, it must know collective signs where the mobile objects are located."</seg>

<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>

<seg id="425">"however, there is always a cap."</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of stiffer is that they are sensitive to turmoil like wind bows.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the air device does not matter in which position to regain the optimum position and improved the performance by exercising.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">"during our research, we often place fundamental abstract questions, which penetrate the core of the matter."</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be: what is the smaller number of movable parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopter are known approximately as machines with a thousand movable parts that meet you.</seg>
<seg id="434">"decades ago, trained pilots could fly, which had only two moving parts: a propeller and a heckruder."</seg>
<seg id="435">"long ago we discovered that flies, with just one works."</seg>
<seg id="436">"this is the Monospic, the mechanical system-protected aircraft. it was invented in short-time."</seg>
<seg id="437">"it has only one movable part, a propeller,"</seg>
<seg id="438">"no flaps, hinges and crossings, no further pitches or controllobersurfaces, just a propeller."</seg>
<seg id="439">"although it is mechanically simple, happens in the interior living very much so that it can fly stable and can move around in the room."</seg>
<seg id="440">"however, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the Heckstarters. to bring it to the fur, I have to throw it right."</seg>
<seg id="441">"the likelihood, it is exactly right when I watch all, is low, therefore I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening."</seg>
<seg id="442">"when the monds is an exercise in genloneliness, this machine is here, the couter with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance."</seg>
<seg id="443">What do with all this overflow?</seg>
<seg id="444">You see that he is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">Therefore he is ambivalent in his alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">"thus, he receives the most appreciated capability,"</seg>
<seg id="447">"move in space to all directions, no matter what direction he filmed or even how it rotates."</seg>
<seg id="448">"of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers from the eight propellers."</seg>
<seg id="449">A lot is unthinkable in models and the rest will be learned directly when flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let us see that.</seg>
<seg id="451">"if flying machines have to be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely secure and reliable."</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine consists of two separate semi-propellers.</seg>
<seg id="453">This is in the clockwise sense</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against the clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">"when one builds them, they behave like a high-performance quadrucopter."</seg>
<seg id="456">"however, something wrong -- a motor or propeller falls off, the electronics or a battery -- can continue to fly the machine if also restricted."</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate that by doing a half of plane.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration investigates synthetic scrolling.</seg>
<seg id="459">"the large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression."</seg>
<seg id="460">We participated in the sweet micro-quadcopter -- each single weighs less than a disc bread -- and provide them with local technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">"every unit knows where in space it is and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no upper limit."</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully you motivate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine there is at Broadway a flying lampshade.</seg>
<seg id="464">"of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology."</seg>
<seg id="465">For types such as us lies the reward in the development and creation act.</seg>
<seg id="466">"it serves as a reminder, how wonderful and magical our universe is, and that there is creative, klugen storiings, it is allowed to shape in such spectacular way."</seg>

<seg id="478">"about 25 years ago a group was particularly brave -- Rai Weiss from MIT, KIP Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech -- to seek a huge laser detector to seek out gravitational black holes."</seg>

<seg id="492">All that which I had worked is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he studied gravitational-waves from black holes and their through observatorial signals. what are gravitational-waves? "</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a clash in the pounding of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">"when using the wave, the space and its entire content is stretched into a direction and into the other."</seg>

<seg id="496">"stretch and dusting, stretch and dust."</seg>
<seg id="497">"the problem is that Gravitational wellen are extremely weak, even ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="498">"on 14 September, for example, each of us became stretched and gested. the elongation of an average person was 10 high -21."</seg>
<seg id="499">"that means 20 Nulls after the comma, followed by a 1st of Darum, one declared the LIGO staff for crazy."</seg>
<seg id="500">"with a five kilometres long laser detector, and this is already absurd, this length should be measured in less than a Millennium of the radius of a nuclear kernels."</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classical text on gravity</seg>

<seg id="503">"but physicists are dark, and with the support of the public will certainly be overcome all obstacles."</seg>
<seg id="504">"Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success."</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to LIGO. Scott would like to be more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">"visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than things around us: face-ups, the size of your mobile phones."</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite handy. for this is how you can create a picture or a map of things by taking advantage of several points of the coming light around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">In potato that is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">"that's why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean you particularly much:"</seg>

<seg id="518">With them we cannot produce simple pictures of objects in the space.</seg>
<seg id="519">"but by considering changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can hear her stories."</seg>
<seg id="520">At least lie for LIGO the measured frequencies in the audible area.</seg>
<seg id="521">"so when we convert wave patterns into barriers, we can talk to all literally."</seg>
<seg id="522">"the gravity too loud, can tell us about a lot about the collision of two black holes, which my colleague Scott has been very long busy."</seg>
<seg id="523">"SH: two black, not rotating holes, circulate easily: wupp!"</seg>
<seg id="524">Turning the two body very fast, you hear the same circus with an additional sound change. this does not stop at: Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu! "</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement that is characterized by the wave form.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on 14 September 2015 -- a date that at least I never forget -- heard LIGO next: [Surrendes Ballet] Jemand who knows how to hear this as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes with each 30-professional sun mass that are about as fast as the sticks of your mixer.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let us know what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">"two black holes, the most dense body in space, one with a mass of 29 probe, the other with a mass of 36 probe, revolve each hundred times a second before they collide."</seg>

<seg id="540">"gravitational-waves penetrate iron, as if it would be transparent glass. the Urknall: I would be happy to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it since the original one is covered by his own descendings."</seg>
<seg id="541">"using Gravitational-waves, it should be possible to look back to the beginning."</seg>
<seg id="542">"and the most important thing: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen, which we never see never seen and from which we have no idea of what we just discover."</seg>
<seg id="543">"in fact, LIGO found the first impression of what we did not expect."</seg>

<seg id="562">"no, no, no, yes, yes, yes."</seg>
<seg id="563">"and a crazy thing happened: exactly what I feared, wounded to my fear."</seg>
<seg id="564">"my fear, speeches to hold, my social fear -- Puff, weg."</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes" "has changed my life."</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">"but there was a certain Yes, which changed my life, to an unexpected art. it started with a question of my youngest."</seg>
<seg id="569">"I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the youngest, calls for inexplicable reasons"</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she was a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"kittens, I need milk for my beak-chairs."</seg>
<seg id="572">"she asked me once if I could play with her, when I just arrived on the go. and I said:" yes. "</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">"a new life setting in my family. from there I weakened me, always with them as soon as I go on it. no matter what I do, or where I go, I say always Yes -- every single time."</seg>
<seg id="575">"almost. I am not perfect, but I am very happy."</seg>
<seg id="576">"it has a magical effect on me, on my children, to our family."</seg>
<seg id="577">"but it also has an intriguing side effect: only recently, I was actually complete that the" Yes "sessions for playing with my children saved my career."</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">"I am author. I think things off, awakens you to life."</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I Create television. I produziere television.</seg>
<seg id="585">"I make television, in a great style."</seg>
<seg id="586">"in this TV season, I am responsible for that 70 hours program will go out into the world."</seg>
<seg id="587">"four television programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production."</seg>
<seg id="588">Each shipment has hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a television can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">We say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">"a new episode every nine days of four shows, so all nine days 20 million dollars, four channels, three episodes, three episodes, three episodes, 15 Episodes: Grey's: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 Episodes: the Catch, 70 hours of television,"</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my TV series run on Thursday night.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">"my brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are broadcasts which I myself is created, and not just produced, so still obendlessly. I have to find time, really silent, creative time to gather my fans around campfire and tell my stories."</seg>
<seg id="596">"four television series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfire, which burn around the world."</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who makes this still?</seg>
<seg id="598">"nobody, that is why I am a Titan."</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I would not like to impress you.</seg>
<seg id="601">"I say it, because I know what you think when the word" author falls. "</seg>
<seg id="602">"I say it to you all of you, who now work as hard as you are now pursuing a company, a country or a classrooms, if I talk of work, so that I say not only on the computer, and fantasiere, and it is true when I say, I understand that it's not just a dream job for dreams."</seg>
<seg id="603">"it is all a job, everything work, everything reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears -- no tears."</seg>
<seg id="604">"I work a lot, hard and I love it."</seg>
<seg id="605">"when I am deeper into the work, there is no other feeling."</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country from nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">"it is, when set troops up, as mold I am on a canvas."</seg>
<seg id="608">"so as bearer one high tone, liefe a marathon."</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">"it is creative, mechanical, exhausting and depriving, funny and miserable, cruel and sensible, cruel and reasonable, and the best thing is the swmen."</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when working out well.</seg>
<seg id="614">"a marmen starts in my head, and it grows and grows and the sums sounds like a busy road, I could always drive on her."</seg>
<seg id="615">"many people take, when I declare them the sums that I overs writing, that writing me joy."</seg>
<seg id="616">Do not understand me wrong, this does. "</seg>
<seg id="617">"but the sums -- when I started working with television production, when I began to work and work, build and work, I discovered this thing, this swmen, this energy. the sums!"</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums of action is action and activity. the sums is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sums is music. the sums is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The marmen is the voice of God in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">"and if you have such a sums, you cannot be different from size to size."</seg>
<seg id="623">"feeling not to be different than to the size, no matter what price."</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the marmen.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or perhaps it also means a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Maybe it is genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Maybe it is the ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I do not know.</seg>
<seg id="630">"I know only that I am not for failure, and I know only that I love the sums."</seg>
<seg id="631">"I just want to say to you, I am a Titan, and I know that I will not ask it to question."</seg>
<seg id="632">"to make a clear: the more successful I will, the more episodes, the more work, the more things the more, the more you write me, the more what more expectations are there."</seg>
<seg id="633">"the more I work to be successful, the more you need to work."</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">"I love work, not true?"</seg>
<seg id="636">"the country I create, the marathon, the marathon, the army, the canvas, the high tone, the sums, the swmen, the swmen."</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this swmen. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the marmen.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only this swam?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the sums.</seg>
<seg id="641">"revised, exaggerated, exaggerated, burned."</seg>
<seg id="642">The marmen stops.</seg>
<seg id="643">"now, my three daughters to the truth is accustomed to the truth that their mum is a single working place."</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mum will not be there but you can write my Nanny.</seg>
<seg id="645">"and Emerson says:" Schätzchen, I want to go to Shonda country. "</seg>
<seg id="646">There are the children of a Titanium.</seg>
<seg id="647">You are baby-Titanium.</seg>
<seg id="648">"they were 12, 3 and 1, when the sums up."</seg>
<seg id="649">The totals of the engine was hidden.</seg>
<seg id="650">I loved my work no more. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sums was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">"I made the same things as always: the same Titanium work, 15 hours of weekends, no Reuters, no Reuters, no Reuters, don't exist, with all-heart, clear eyes, whatever."</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sums.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">"four television programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously, sometimes four."</seg>
<seg id="657">"four television programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously..."</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a show-Titan, "</seg>
<seg id="660">"everything was gray, I just had no fun anymore."</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the marmen and the marmen was I.</seg>
<seg id="664">"so what do you do if what you do, the work that you love, suddenly faded?"</seg>
<seg id="665">"I know some may think:" Heul you from, blöder author. "</seg>
<seg id="666">"but you know it, you do what you are doing, you love how to be a teacher, a maler, a maler, a maler one knows, and knows how the sums it feels, when the sums stops, who is you then?"</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">"if the song of my heart sounds, I can survive in silence?"</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern states" is taking a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"I am on the way out there, late and she says:" Mama, magic you play? "</seg>
<seg id="673">"and I will already say no, when I will be aware of two things:"</seg>
<seg id="674">"first, I have to say yes to everything and secondly, she called me not" swallowed. "</seg>
<seg id="675">It is called nobody and more "swallows."</seg>
<seg id="676">When is this happened?</seg>
<seg id="677">"I miss it when I am Titan am and my sums, and here everything changes in front of my own eyes."</seg>
<seg id="678">"and so says it:" "Mama," "you play?"</seg>
<seg id="679">"and I say," yes. "</seg>
<seg id="680">That is nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="681">"we play and encounter their sisters, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book" Everybody poops "." "</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">"but it is outstanding, because my pain and my panic, in the loneliness and absence of sums, I can do nothing, except to abandon."</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am silent.</seg>
<seg id="686">"the country, which I create, the marathon, the marathon, the army, the canvas, the high tone - they no longer exist."</seg>
<seg id="687">"everything that exists are glued finger and humble kisses, delicate voices, Wachsmalstiched and the song where things get rid of it, or whatever the girl is in" Die Eisals "." "</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air at this place is so close that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me solves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes on and an energy circuit comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">"and that is not immediately, but it happens."</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums is slowly coming back.</seg>
<seg id="698">"no full volume, hardly there, it is quiet, hardly audible, but it is there."</seg>
<seg id="699">"not the sums, but a swmen."</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I would know a magical secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let us remain with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that is all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something that we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">"the sums, the working environment, the Titanensumms, that is just the replacement."</seg>
<seg id="706">"if I ask you who you are, if I am saying who I am, when I am describing the help of broadcasts and television hours and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real sums."</seg>
<seg id="707">The sums is not power and it is not work-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="709">True Summs is dependent on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">"the sums is the power, which comes from the lust."</seg>
<seg id="711">True Summs is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">"real sums ignores the pressure of history, which lead to enlightened tasks, the expectation and the pressure."</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sums is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">"the real Summen is the voice of God's voice in my ear, but perhaps it will escape the wrong words, for which God said to me that I am a Titan am?"</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">"we all need a bit more love, much more love."</seg>
<seg id="717">"once my child wants to play with me, I will say yes."</seg>
<seg id="718">"I am doing this for a fixed rule, so I can free myself as a workaholic of any guilt."</seg>
<seg id="719">"it is law, I have no other choice. I have no other choice unless I want to hear the sums again."</seg>
<seg id="720">"I wish it would be as simple. I am not good in playing, I don't like it."</seg>
<seg id="721">"as a result, I am not able to play as well as working."</seg>
<seg id="722">"the truth does hurt,"</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">"I always work, because I love it."</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer to work at the workplace as at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">"this concession is painful, because what kind of man work rather than to be home?"</seg>
<seg id="727">"well yes, I."</seg>
<seg id="728">"time honestly, I call myself" Titan "--"</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>

<seg id="738">"my children show me how one lives, and the sums of the universe fulfils me."</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why did we hear about playing with the games?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also! say they always yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">"maybe, hold me for naive, for a diary-pack."</seg>
<seg id="742">"you have probably right, but you can do it!"</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? you are not Rihanna or a Muppet Show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">"my little ones want to play at most 15 minutes with me, to them that they want to do something different."</seg>
<seg id="748">"there are wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes."</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a Marienetle or biscuit.</seg>
<seg id="750">"and she speaketh my teenager's daughter all 15 minutes long with me, I am mother of the year."</seg>
<seg id="751">"there are only 15 minutes, more do not need it."</seg>
<seg id="752">"each can bring 15 minutes in a piece, even on a bad mood day!"</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes on the piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">"no mobile phone, no laundry, no distraction."</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner the children are ready.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are inside!</seg>
<seg id="757">"my children are my kindness, my world. it must not be the children. it is true to feel the sums, a place for his soul-peace."</seg>
<seg id="758">It is not about playing with their own children. it is about joy</seg>
<seg id="759">About the "Games" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Allow yourself the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you are doing well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find it out and keep it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="763">"I am not perfect in it. I shalt and I victories. friends meet, books to enjoy the day"</seg>
<seg id="764">"do you want to play?" is short for everything I have given up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in training, when I wanted to meet myself more and more. "</seg>
<seg id="765">"15 minutes of the piece, why do not have full 15 minutes away?"</seg>
<seg id="766">What can it be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums came back in my spare time. the sums seems to return when I am not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Work does not work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">"it takes time, but after a few months opens a door, the energy flows and I find myself in my office. I listen to new ideas. I lost my way to new ideas. I use it to fullest and I love my work again."</seg>
<seg id="770">"I like the sums, but I love it."</seg>
<seg id="771">I do not need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">"I am not the sums, the sums is not I... not anymore."</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap bubbles and glued finger, dinner with friends. "</seg>

<seg id="789">"that belongs to the job, that means to live his dream."</seg>
<seg id="790">That is the dream of this job;</seg>
<seg id="791">Because a dream job should be a little dreaming.</seg>
<seg id="792">I said 'Yes' to less work and for more games.</seg>
<seg id="793">Titanen has no chance.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thanks nice.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="797">As most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">"I know how your life can change from one second to another, after a heavy stroke or accident."</seg>
<seg id="799">"for us Neurosurgery is it very frustrating that the brain, unlike other bodily organs, a very low ability to self-healing."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after a severe violation of the central nervous system, the patients often have a permanent, heavy disability."</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I work functional neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who attempts to improve nerve functions through various surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">"surely they have heard of one of the most famous, the" deep-" stimulation "" which is implanted in the brain to affect the circuits of neurons so that neurological function has improved. "</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. she has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson who suffered from heater trembling and heavy pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">"however, Neuromodulation does not mean Neuro-cure."</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I want to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help themselves.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was conductive Oberphysician and worked day and night in the emergency.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I supply patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They have to imagine that at skull-Hirn-traumata the brain depressed and the skull pressure.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save the life you have to reduce the skull pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">So you must sometimes remove a part of the brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">"instead of throwing brain mass, we decided to analyse with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, an biologist to analyze the brain mass."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">"to let cells grow from a thebestück, comparable to small children that are removed from your families."</seg>
<seg id="822">"you have to find the right diet, temperature, humidity and the environments to let them thrive."</seg>
<seg id="823">Exactly this we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts by Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw it under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells, which are surrounded by small, unmature cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you still know from the biologic lessons that stem cells are unripe cells that can transform into any cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niche of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to receive this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of brain mass in the op.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die; they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells stopped differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They split slowly and after a couple of weeks they died even.</seg>
<seg id="836">"so we saw a new, strange cell population that looked like stem cells, but was different."</seg>
<seg id="837">"we needed long, to understand where they came."</seg>
<seg id="838">You come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells hot Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">You will make 4% of our large hirnindenzels.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of the fetus they provide for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay with us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">"we believe they take part in the cure of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain infringements."</seg>
<seg id="847">"however, this is not so secure."</seg>
<seg id="848">"however, one thing is clear -- by these cells we received our master cells."</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source that allows brains.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove it.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non-speaking area and then cultivate the cells exactly as it did Jean-François did</seg>
<seg id="853">And then highlight the color to follow it in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step we implanted them at the Entrance registry of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologist Transplantation -- Autotrantransplant.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we plan these cells into normal brain tissues? and what will happen if we planing the same cells into damaged brain tissues?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we could work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario we implanted the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that they had been completely removed after a few weeks, they go back home. the room is already occupied, so they will not go there, so disappear."</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we added a violation and reimplanted exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they washed to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were reimplanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">"the proof that they show are these little points. these are the cells that we are in vitro, in the culture."</seg>
<seg id="863">Here we could not stop.</seg>
<seg id="864">Will these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain death?</seg>
<seg id="865">"so, we exercised monkeys with a manual skill task."</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take feeding pellets from one tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">That made them very good.</seg>

<seg id="877">I can tell you that was also very exciting results for us.</seg>

<seg id="884">"Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that is wonderful, I am sure that several dozen people in the audience, perhaps even the majority of thinking:" I know someone who need it. "</seg>

<seg id="886">"of course, the question of which the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials at man."</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. departing from these great results you have to fill about two kilograms of Papers and forms to run this kind of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">"BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc."</seg>
<seg id="889">"JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and a almost professional team."</seg>
<seg id="890">"BG: take a look into the future -- you have completed research and attempted to get permission to start the clinical trials. if you go further into the future, how many years it will take to get to hospital and this therapy will be available."</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that is difficult to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">"first of all, it depends on the approval of the clinical study."</seg>
<seg id="893">Will we allow the authority to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to do this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">"it takes a long time to choose the patients to conduct and evaluate the treatments, whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment."</seg>
<seg id="896">Then you have to apply this to a multi-centralized study.</seg>

<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting us and that you told us about it. "</seg>

<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider them as natural.</seg>
<seg id="903">"we do not see democracy as the fragile plant that is in reality, but as an inventory of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider it as unchanging disease.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">"Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great neighbor in Beijing have proven that it is quite possible to have a blooming capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratically."</seg>
<seg id="908">"in fact, democracy with us, in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">"in the beginning of the year, when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unambiguous that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- not to influence the austerity programmes that have been realized in Greece."</seg>
<seg id="910">"in this moment, I thought that there might be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my recorded friends, that would be repeated, if it would change anything."</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to introduce a green model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">"I ask you to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup, we could save the democracy, but that we need a true and defective democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"for without democracy, our societies become common, our future düster and our great, new technologies are wasted."</seg>
<seg id="914">"to the subject of waste, I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction, which currently threatens our economies."</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "Zwillingsgif-Paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">"a summit is known to you. you know and recognize him as the school mountain, which throws its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="917">"we all recognise the school-hill,"</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize its purpose.</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of uncontaminated cash, which could be anxious to invest there where it would be productive and incomes to contribute to what it would be productive and also to produce all things which need to urgently need humanity, for example" green "energy."</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"over the past 3 months, in the United States, in England and the Eurozone, 3,4 Billion US dollars invested in all the prosperity of goods, such as industrial plants, schools, roads, streets, streets, streets, and so on and so on."</seg>
<seg id="922">"3,4 Billions US dollars sounds like a lot of money until you compares it with the 5,1 Billions US dollars, which are at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing they did, except the stock exchange and the real estate prices."</seg>
<seg id="923">"thus, debts and inproductive capital form the twins summit, which is not identical to the usual market mechanisms."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the result are stagnating wages, more than one quarter of the 25-54 year-olds in the United States, Japan and Europe, and consequently, a low general economic demand that could not invest in which they would not invest in which they would not invest in which they would kill him, if he will grow him,"</seg>
<seg id="925">Bollards the circumstances bring about that odipus kill him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my hails with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"his exceedingly productive labour should be used to improve our lives, to further improve human talents and especially all the technologies," green "technologies, which are decisive for the salvation of the earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I believe. but before we continue: what do we understand on democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotelit defined democracy as the form of society in which the open and the poor as a majority to control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">The athic democracy naturally closed too many from --</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, foreigners, and of course slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">"however, there would be a mistake to reduce the importance of athic democracy due to these closures."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the decisive factor in the athic democracy was and is that they called the working poor, and not only the right to freedom of expression, but more important and crucial that they gave them the right to political co-determination with the same mood in questions of the prosecution."</seg>
<seg id="935">Athic democracy has not kept long before --</seg>
<seg id="936">"as a candle, which is very bright lights, it is also rapidly burned."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, our present-liberal democracies do not have their roots in the ancient Athens,"</seg>
<seg id="938">"but in the Magna Carta, in the glorious Revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while the athic democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened arms, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which was ultimately a statute for ruling."</seg>
<seg id="940">"for liberal democracy only came upon, as a complete separation of politics and economy, and the democratic process of politics used, while the economy is the world of corporations -- a democracy-free zone."</seg>
<seg id="941">"in our present democracies, since the time, in which this separation of politics and economy began, an unquestioning struggle between the two, the economy has gradually undergone the politics."</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why the politicians are no longer like this?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not on a degeneration of its DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"it is that one can nowadays be in the government, and nevertheless not in power because the power of politics into the economy is abed and the areas are separated."</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hails with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"if you think about it, it is in about like a herd of smoke, which is so sustainable the animals, of which they nourishes themselves, decimal by the end therefore hungry."</seg>
<seg id="947">"similarly, it is similar to the economy which the politics becomes so far-caused by the self-caused economic crisis itself. the power of corporations grows, political goods are increasing, inequality increases, the whole economic demand falls and the managing directors of the corporations are becoming more anxious to invest the cash of their companies."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the more successful of capitalism the" Demos "[the people] out of democracy, the higher the twins summit, and the greater the waste of human labour power and prosperity of humanity."</seg>
<seg id="949">"if this is true, it is obvious that we have to bring the politics and the economy again and it would be better if in the ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had already had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very strange.</seg>
<seg id="952">"the doctrine of the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can regain a position as in the ancient Athens, without creating new ways of brutality and waste."</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: working out the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it going through automation and robots replaced by automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem is, so long economy and politics are separate areas, the automation becomes higher, the waste of waste, and the social conflicts deeper, as it is very soon as I believe -- in countries like China."</seg>
<seg id="956">"so we have to reconfigure the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and in this respect we respect the united area of democracy, otherwise we end up in a sick surveillance-Hyperautocracy that lets the film" "matrix" "like a documentation."</seg>
<seg id="957">"thus, the question is not whether capitalism has created the technical achievements which he has brought forth, will survive --"</seg>
<seg id="958">"the interestingly question is whether capitalism is divided by a dystopia, similar to the" "Star Trek", "or through something that the company is stuck in" "Star Trek", "or into a high-tech version of the ancient Athener" Agora "," in long talks the sense of life. "</seg>
<seg id="959">"I believe, we must be optimistic."</seg>
<seg id="960">"so what liked it, how could it look like this" star Trek "-artery Utopia instead of the" "matrix" "similar Dystopy"? "</seg>
<seg id="961">"in practical implementation, I would like to give you a few examples briefly."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the field of companies: ask for a capital market in which you deserve money, while you are working and in which your capital follows you from a job to the next, and the company -- no matter which you are currently working -- is the property of those who currently work in the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income from capital and from dissolve and the concept of wage labor is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">"no distinction between those who belong to the company, but not to work, and employees who work there, but not belong there between capital and labor, no large gaps between investment and coars, and ultimately does not ascend twins."</seg>
<seg id="965">"in the field of global political economy, please realize that our national currencies would have a freely fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which is presented by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest threshold countries], in the interests of the whole of humanity."</seg>
<seg id="966">"continue to be traded before the entire world trade in this currency -- we call them" "cosmos", "in units of" cosmos "" -- and each government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade union of the respective country into a common fund. "</seg>
<seg id="967">"also, imagine that this fund is investing in" green "technologies, especially in parts of the world, in which investment means."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes was proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that one had not had the technical means at that time.</seg>
<seg id="971">"today we have them, in particular in the background of a united policy and economy."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world I describe at the same time, at the same time, in which they preferred people, and Marxist, because they buried the separation of capital and labour in the trash of history, and keyfluid, globally keychain."</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all others it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">We will wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we go into a "matrix" - similar dystopy?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how to reach us politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">"it is in our hands, and we do it better democratically."</seg>
<seg id="978">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself in your biography itself as a liberal Marxists.</seg>

<seg id="984">"through the transfer of this crisis from a part of the earth to the next, as we're currently experiencing it, it is not only our democracies destabilize, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low."</seg>
<seg id="985">"if this analysis is true, Marx is quite relevant,"</seg>
<seg id="986">"as Hayek, this is why I am a liberal Marxist, and like Keynes, and therefore I am also completely cognr."</seg>

<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the sunshine of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">"as I said in my presentation, we have limited democracy on politics during the area where most of the economy is playing -- a totally democratic free zone."</seg>
<seg id="994">"in some respects, if I may say the so provocative, resembles China today the England of the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="995">"because -- remember -- we tend to link liberalism with democracy -- that is a mistake, historically considered."</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, liberal as John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical what the democratic development concerns.</seg>
<seg id="998">"what one can now observe in China, similar to the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second."</seg>
<seg id="999">"now, China is now being able to do what the West has done himself in the 19th century, smells rhypocrisy."</seg>

<seg id="1001">YV: I believe that this is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back for six months later on the first semester?</seg>
<seg id="1004">"YV: very exciting, out of personal sight, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the eurozone."</seg>
<seg id="1005">"not only Greece, but the eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1006">"namely, by the self-determination to say, and the constant denial denial that a massive distortion line caused by the eurozone and continues to be massively threatened by the development of the whole European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1007">"we had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek proposal -- by the way, the first proposal was to reveal that this denial."</seg>
<seg id="1008">"unfortunately, the powers within the Eurozone, within the European group, continues to denial the denial."</seg>
<seg id="1009">"however, you know what comes."</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">"if you are trying to obtain an economic system that is not viable, through political will and authoritarianism in life, you might be able to delay a while if then the change happens abrupt and destructive."</seg>

<seg id="1038">"by Roy Price, most of this never heard, even though he is probably responsible for 22-sized minutes of your life on 19 April 2013."</seg>
<seg id="1039">"probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for many of you."</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision which Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is conductive event at Amazon Studios</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company of Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"he is 47 years old, slender, has a yellow and describes herself on Twitter as" movies, TV, technology, Tacos. "</seg>
<seg id="1044">"Roy has a very important job, because he is responsible for shows the shows and the content that will produce Amazon."</seg>
<seg id="1045">"of course, this is a very hard-fought industry."</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy can't choose any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">"he must find shows, which are very, very good."</seg>
<seg id="1048">"in other words, he must find shows that are completely on the right at this turn."</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the evaluation of over 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the evaluation proceeds from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this rating.</seg>
<seg id="1050">"will your show be rated with nine and higher, this is a winner."</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"these are shows how" breaking bath, "" Game of Thrones "," The Wire "-- all the shows, the addictive, where you ask a season, your brain asks:" where is there more of these episodes? "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"on the left, here at this end, shows how" Toddlers and Tiaras "-- -- this should tell you enough what is going off at this end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1055">"Roy Price does not care to get to the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to provide" Toddlers and Tiaras. "</seg>
<seg id="1056">"he makes more thoughts on the medium scale, the average television -- the shows, which are neither good nor bad, they simply don't delight."</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure he really is on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">"the pressure is available, and of course it is the first time that Amazon makes such a thing, therefore Roy does not want to risk nothing."</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create success.</seg>
<seg id="1060">"he needs guaranteed success, so he keeps a contest."</seg>
<seg id="1061">"he takes many ideas for television shows and choose an evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online where they can watch everyone for free."</seg>
<seg id="1062">"and if Amazon comes out there, one can still accede, right?"</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of spectators have a look at these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">"however, they do not know that they are observed at the start of these shows."</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are observed by Roy and his team who record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">"you capture, when you start the show when you pause, which parts you can transfer or again look."</seg>
<seg id="1067">"they collect millions of data to decide with these data, which show them should produce."</seg>
<seg id="1068">"in fact, they collect the data, process these and this results in the answer, and this is:" Amazon should make a Sitcom on four republican US Senators. "</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Do anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"yes," Alpha House, "but it seems that not many will remember this show because they were not so good."</seg>
<seg id="1072">"it is just an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- as the average of this curve 7.4 is and Alpha House landet at 7,5 -- thus something above average, but not exactly what is sore, and his team worked."</seg>
<seg id="1073">"about at the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. just like Roy he is always looking to find this a super-show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it something different."</seg>
<seg id="1074">"instead of holding a competition, he and his team saw the existing data on the Netflix audience, so the reviews that they like the shows, whose shows they like etc."</seg>
<seg id="1075">"then use this data to find out these little details about the audience: what shows they like, which producers, which actors."</seg>
<seg id="1076">"when they had all the parts together, they went a wagon and chose not to make a Sitcom on four senators, but a drama series about a Senator."</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"yes," house of Cards ". Netflix has a hit, at least for the first two scars."</seg>
<seg id="1079">House of Cards "gets a 9.1 review on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">"of course, the question is: what happened here?"</seg>
<seg id="1081">"one has two very competitive, data sealed companies."</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data together and it works great for one of them but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because the logic somehow defeated that this should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">"if you collect millions of data, for a decision which you meet, then you should make a good decision."</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years to statistics as Back-Up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">"the Mindeste what you can expect, is good TV, or?"</seg>
<seg id="1089">"if data analysis does not work, then this is somewhat frightening because we live in a time when we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television."</seg>
<seg id="1090">Do anyone know here the company Multi-Health System?</seg>
<seg id="1091">"nobody. OK, this is even good."</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health System is a software company and I hope that no one will ever get in touch with this software. come in touch with this software you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">"if someone ask here in the U.S. in prison and ask for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether an discharge is done or not."</seg>
<seg id="1094">"just like on Amazon and Netflix. but instead of decide whether a show is good or bad, it is decided if a person will be good or bad."</seg>
<seg id="1095">"poor TV, 22 minutes, which can be genuine, but even more years in prison are worse."</seg>
<seg id="1096">"unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,"</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results generated. this is not that a company like multi-health system does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">The data reversible companies are also wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes. even Google sometimes makes errors.</seg>
<seg id="1100">"in 2009, Google announced that they can say through data analysis outbreaks from flu, the worst kind, predict -- by data analysis of the Google research."</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation. the success was in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">"it worked just fine, year round year, until it suddenly no longer worked,"</seg>
<seg id="1103">And nobody could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"it simply did not work, this was again a sensation, including the revocation of the publication in the magazine" Nature. ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data reversible companies like Amazon and Google may sometimes understand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">"despite all these errors, data streams into decisions of life a -- at the workplace, in the legal framework, in medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data are helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">"I also know many difficulties with data. I work in the computer-based genetics -- a field, where some very kluge people unimaginable many data to make serious decisions as the decision for cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">"or the development of a drug. over the years, I have realized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be distributed."</seg>
<seg id="1110">"you ever have to solve a complex problem, just do two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">"as a first place, you put this problem into its parts, so you can analyze components; as a second place, you put the parts back together to grasp a discharge."</seg>
<seg id="1112">"sometimes you need to do this several times, but there are always two things: apart and put together again."</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help create a problem and understand its parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to conclude the parts again and then come to a discharge.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool and we have it all: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">"if there is something that is good when the brain is good, it is parts and pieces again together, even if the information is incomplete to write a good decision -- especially when it's the brain of a expert."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"therefore, I think was Netflix so successful because they used data and mind where they are also in the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"they use data to better understand their audience, what else would not have been able to put all these parts, put together again and make a show like" House of Cards "" that was not in the data. "</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show what meant that they entered a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">"on the other hand, this is in the wrong way."</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they used the data to control all their decisions, first when they were offset by TV ideas when they chose" "Alpha House" as show. "</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a safe decision because they were able to say: "that tell us the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired outcome.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data are helpful for better decisions, but I believe that things go wrong when data will begin to control our decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerful they are, data are only a tool and to forget that this device is quite useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">"before it was data, this was the device for decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"it is also called" Magic 8 Ball ". it is amazing. for decisions using a Jaor or no-question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer." "most likely" -- exactly here in this moment. "</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will keep it later with a technical demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">"so far, I have made some decisions in my life until I could hear in the ball."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"however, as you can of course know if you have the data available, you would like to replace them through a bit much depreciation, such as data analysis to make better decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the groundwork.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"thus, the ball classy and clever and clever thing. ultimately, it is possible to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the great amount of data still paying, making decisions, an expert in what you are doing, and risks."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"in the end, it is not the data, but the risks that you end at the right end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thanks nice.</seg>
