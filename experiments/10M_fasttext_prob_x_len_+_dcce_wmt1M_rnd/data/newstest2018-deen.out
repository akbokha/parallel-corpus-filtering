Munich 1856 : four cards that will change your view of the city
there are young people who want to meet young people today .
&quot; a tomb chapel , where now for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel is being excav@@ ated . &quot;
small gar@@ den@@ er work in the first reason of peasants .
the oldest official map of Mün@@ ch encourages exciting stories to days .
it is annoying if land cards are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
&quot; this knows everyone who had ever had to rain , because the Auto @-@ Nav@@ i takes place instead of a revers@@ ing road to a green meadow . &quot;
&quot; the historic maps of the digital Bavaria @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als in Bavaria , are anything but up @-@ to @-@ date - but it is therefore very ambitious . &quot;
especially when you compar@@ es them with current online cards .
&quot; then , the cities and municipalities are changed in the spread @-@ area of the Mün@@ ch@@ ner Mer@@ cur@@ y since the 19th century . &quot;
the digital Bavaria Atlas is a pat@@ ch@@ work which one does not recognise as such .
&quot; in the large overview cards were used for towns and municipalities in more detailed maps , so @-@ called judgment of sheets . &quot;
this emerged according to the information of the Bav@@ arian Ver@@ measurable Administration between 18@@ 10 and 1864 and originates from the first verse measurement of Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leader Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Ko@@ ali@@ tion@@ script with Austria .
Napoleon sees an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographic absorption in Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
&quot; even if the French troops ended up with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville from 9 February 18@@ 01 : there were today &apos;s neighbors who created the idea of a surface area of Bavaria card . &quot;
&quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max I@@ V. Joseph drove the project further , the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; &quot; - and thus the Bay@@ erische Ver@@ measured administration . &quot;
the Ur@@ posi@@ tional leaf@@ let for Munich dates back to 1856 and is like all others on the website of the Bav@@ arian State Library .
the comparison of fruits / lo@@ ot is most impressive at the heart of the state capital .
the city has spread across all directions and has grown together .
&quot; an example of this is Lower send@@ ling , which appears in the map of 1856 still relatively isolated . &quot;
&quot; send@@ ling was born 21 years after creating the map , so 1877 , as Mün@@ ch@@ ner district . &quot;
&quot; today , Lower send@@ ling is in the middle of the city . &quot;
&quot; the houses sig@@ nat@@ ories focus on 1856 along the today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ strasse which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader of the peasants &quot; peasants &quot; against Austria 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where today the West park is , one sees nothing but fields - at the first glance : in writing lines and numbers : hand@@ written numbers out of the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Ur@@ ge &quot; , &quot; derived from which the basic tax deduc@@ ed . &quot;
small plots stood there today no farmers more - but small gar@@ den@@ er of the plant in the sun .
a large green area is located north of Lower send@@ ling .
&quot; the Ther@@ es@@ ien@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 locations of the October 2005 , was in the 19th century still a meadow - and no concrete desert . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historic card gives an insight into the history of psychi@@ atric medicine . &quot;
&quot; in the judgment sheet , one reads in the locality of today &apos;s A@@ u @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen not only the road names &quot; at Gast@@ eig &quot; &quot; or from the height &quot; &quot; On the ventilation &quot; &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt . &quot;
&quot; yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ fel@@ d@@ straße , it was once used by people with ins@@ anity . &quot;
&quot; there was 18@@ 58 / 59 the Mün@@ ch@@ ner circle @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ aline , On the Au@@ er Lü@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; from 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von G@@ ud@@ den the decor - that psych@@ i@@ ater that is brought in connection with the death of King Lud@@ wi@@ gs II . &quot;
&quot; he was progressive for his time , and ended for example the chains of so @-@ called &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; moreover , he is forbidden to apply the staff to apply violence against the masses , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who has worked for an exhibition with the An@@ st@@ alt . &quot;
&quot; first place for 280 patients was first place , later on 500 places was expanded . &quot;
&quot; at some point , this capacity is no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the roundabout in hair 1905 . &quot;
&quot; there has been the Is@@ ar @-@ A@@ MP@@ ER @-@ Klin@@ ik@@ um Munich @-@ Ost , one of the largest psychi@@ at@@ rists in Germany . &quot;
on the area of the former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt now meet young people in Mün@@ ch@@ ner Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um .
&quot; the Order @-@ war@@ b of the building complex 1920 , and turned him into a youth home with training sessions . &quot;
&quot; west is the football field of the TS@@ V Munich East , east @-@ houses from the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; 2015 , we set the children &apos;s house &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bosco &quot; - in architec@@ tur@@ f at the origin of the Ir@@ ren@@ aline , which was destroyed during the Second World War with bom@@ bing ra@@ ids . &quot;
&quot; the Marien@@ platz was a &quot; &quot; Main Square &quot; &quot; named in 1856 . &quot;
a decisive change brought to the Second World War also in the heart of Mün@@ ch .
the bom@@ bs of the Al@@ lies in December 1944 many holes in the city center .
one big remained until today - at Marien@@ hof .
&quot; the English Institute , small business buildings and a Gru@@ ft@@ chapel from the Middle Ages were once at Marien@@ hof , where this day work and take place on 5 April 2017 the sp@@ aten@@ sti@@ ch for the second S @-@ Bahn . &quot;
&quot; with the sli@@ der , the old Munich card can be compared with the a@@ erial view of today - and the hole at the Marien@@ hof . &quot;
civil Group publ@@ ishes Reis@@ ew@@ ar@@ ming for Miss@@ ouri
the National Union for the promotion of color @-@ above has issued a warning for colored people who travel to dis@@ discri@@ min@@ atory policy and rac@@ ist attacks of the State to Miss@@ ouri .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory Council will enter into force until 28 August 2017 , visitors and Mis@@ sou@@ ri@@ ans , to leave special attention through the state , as a number of ques@@ tion@@ able , ras@@ sen@@ based inci@@ dents in recent times throughout the country and here are stated in the opinion of the group . &quot;
&quot; a recently adopted law of Miss@@ ouri , which makes people difficult to win dis@@ discri@@ min@@ ating authorities , as well as the criminal prosec@@ ution authorities of the state , the dis@@ proportionate measures of the state , the dis@@ proportionate to minorities , said the NA@@ AC@@ P . &quot;
&quot; they have violations of civil rights , people happen . &quot;
&quot; they are raised because of their skin colour , they are be@@ aten or killed , &quot; said the President of Miss@@ ouri NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star . &quot;
we hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not heard before .
it is the first such warning that has issued the organization for a state in the USA .
&quot; the group caused inci@@ dents like r@@ acial mer@@ gers against black students at the University of Miss@@ ouri and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from T@@ enn@@ es@@ see . &quot;
&quot; S@@ anders died at the beginning of the year , after he had no pet@@ rol during the journey through the state no gas@@ oline , and taken away from the police of Miss@@ ouri . &quot;
the Council also points to a recent report of the Office of the General Public State of Miss@@ ouri in which it is shown that black motor@@ ists in the state is 75 percent more common than past@@ ures .
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and their families , friends and staff will inform about what could happen in Miss@@ ouri , &quot; said Chapel . &quot;
&quot; people need to be willing to bring it to Cau@@ tion or to know the relatives that they travel through the state . &quot;
&quot; Miss@@ ouri recorded in 2015 100 H@@ ass@@ el , after the latest figures from the H@@ ass@@ in@@ bre@@ d reporting program of the F@@ BI , which entered the state with respect to the number of such injuries on the 16th rank of the country . &quot;
the par@@ ation of travel is also an answer to a new Miss@@ ouri law that would make it more difficult to complain a company because of living or employment discrimination .
&quot; previously had issued the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ LU ) Reis@@ ew@@ ar@@ ings for Texas and Arizona , after the states of immigration authorities had to assume that local criminal prosec@@ ution authorities shall commit to the local criminal prosec@@ ution , which will contribute to the view of the AC@@ LU for further razor filing . &quot;
&quot; travel ar@@ ings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , but in recent times stakeholders have used the measure as a response to specific laws and trends within the United States . &quot;
Wei@@ gh@@ aun@@ project is elementary
the fish@@ erman Wei@@ dez@@ au@@ n project is a success project and will continue in the coming year .
the CD@@ U Bundestag Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ovac have provided a picture on the spot .
&quot; at the rect@@ angle of the family Schwen@@ dem@@ ann , representatives of the fish@@ erman CD@@ U local associations , together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members . &quot;
&quot; Markus Schwen@@ dem@@ ann received an insight into his farm , in which he has 55 acres of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 milk cows and also houses many young people and houses in five apartments Ferien@@ ga@@ este . &quot;
the &quot; Schwar@@ zw@@ al@@ d@@ mil@@ ch &quot; is for him the alternative marketing way for the milk of his cows so Schwen@@ dem@@ ann .
at the table of the Ferien@@ ga@@ este exclusively Regional .
&quot; as he is also the B@@ L@@ H@@ V Chairman of the fish@@ erman , it is important for the Wei@@ der project as &quot; element@@ ar . &quot; &quot;
I cannot gain profitable in such steep areas .
the green area care for much work , much m@@ ts with the engine sense can be processed . &quot;
&quot; we have here to fight with the conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; Schwen@@ dem@@ ann &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2003 he took over the el@@ ter@@ med operation and be@@ ech these without chemical plant protection and fer@@ tiliz@@ ers , even if he does not lead bio@@ operations . &quot;
&quot; for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; &quot; the Comm@@ une has recognized the importance of the whe@@ ely project and is happy about the leaders support . &quot;
the farmers would have to support farmers at the expense of 3000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are .
one hope that the for@@ estation of the surfaces could be moved out for quite a while .
&quot; the greatest treasure we have , are people who work in agriculture and make thoughts about how to continue their operation , &quot; &quot; said the Mayor . &quot;
farmers have often been in criticism due to the promotion of funding .
over the Wei@@ priv@@ ation promotion were fenced in 2013 in total 25 plots of eleven participants .
&quot; the disclosure surface is therefore 40 hectares , which will not be en@@ forced until at least 2023 . &quot;
&quot; from the total cost of 71 500 Euro , half over leader was promoted , a quarter carried the municipality of Fisch@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; thus , the farmers remained 12 610 Euro , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometres . &quot;
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ gevity of the f@@ ences , &quot; explained Pi@@ dem@@ ann . &quot;
&quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ovac stressed : &quot; &quot; you are doing a really good job , without farmers and land@@ wives . &quot;
also for Peter White stood firm : &quot; here are best food produced . &quot;
the Land@@ sc@@ apes ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg enables the state promotion of past@@ de@@ sa@@ unas .
the aim is the disclosure of the Black Forest .
prerequisite is the presence of one of the L@@ PR signed .
&quot; in addition , it must not be a non @-@ effective surface ( slope incl@@ ine above 35 percent ) and must be threatened by the for@@ estation . &quot;
for the fish@@ erman Wei@@ gh@@ aun@@ project 2018 currently runs the request of eight participants with 24 plots who want to build almost 16 kilometres fence .
&quot; the open space is 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros . &quot;
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tru@@ mp takes the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to att@@ acking the statues .
the Americans appreciate this as well as any other - therefore the caring overthrow Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos Square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
&quot; Stephen M@@ iller , one of the key ide@@ olo@@ gues of the Tru@@ mp @-@ regimes , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axis with J@@ im A@@ co@@ sta of CN@@ N on the proposals by the President to the dr@@ as@@ tic restriction of legal migration with the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
to be fair , M@@ iller does not handle the statue itself . &quot;
a hor@@ de of boat owners and liberty Im@@ it@@ ators would have liked him if he had done it .
&quot; but he handle their meaning , and in particular the meaning that it was written , as the famous po@@ em by Emma Lazarus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , his base was added . &quot;
&quot; as M@@ iller A@@ co@@ sta , I don &apos;t want to enter into a complete thing about history but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that is enlight@@ ened the world . &quot;
the po@@ em which you relate later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty .
&quot; M@@ iller is knowledgeable , but as he forms it yourself , it is not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is about contemporary reson@@ ate words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state does not only invites any old immigrants , but the hass@@ led of the poor : &quot; your fatigue , your poor , / your bed@@ time masses , which are after that longing , free to breathe , / the end of your rich co@@ asts . &quot;
there was never a time in which the &quot; el@@ der waste &quot; was better to see on our screens .
M@@ iller has not engaged in liter@@ ary criticism - he clearly did that these people are not welcome in Tru@@ m@@ ps USA .
this conflict because of the meaning of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation : it is in fact a conflict around the meaning of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who sat down to place their words after their death - knew very well that they are a high political act .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American Republi@@ can@@ ism by presenting the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her po@@ em the female figure is no longer abstract - it has received a voice .
and she gives herself a very different name : mother of the exile .
the connection of the po@@ em with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist cou@@ p and a devast@@ ating attack on the American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
&quot; and exactly how Lazarus changed the importance of the statue , people wanted to change it for a long time . &quot;
&quot; the great sc@@ rei@@ er than Rush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Bap@@ tist for the coming of Tru@@ mp , arg@@ um@@ ented 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not take the American flame into the re@@ ared world : &quot; Lady Liberty goes forward . &quot;
it is supposed to bear the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
the F@@ ack@@ el should not en@@ ligh@@ ten the way into the United States . &quot;
quite unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh here on something razor .
the significance of the statue is quite and at all a question of the point of perception .
&quot; the great in@@ ventive act of Lazarus was to see them , as they had seen from the exhaustive , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible trips to the de@@ cks of ships was seen . &quot;
&quot; it is in the true sense to see the world from the perspective of people , to seek the refu@@ ge and a chance to improve their lives . &quot;
her statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they have to hear .
and this is of course not the perspective that M@@ iller and Tru@@ mp ever would like to recognise .
&quot; their tor@@ ch should not en@@ ligh@@ ten the way , but the hat@@ red , who is their only source of power . &quot;
world championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black lo@@ oted sch@@ ot@@ ist Members of the United Kingdom
&quot; E@@ ili@@ dh Do@@ yle reminds one of time , when only two heads to the team of Great Britain . &quot;
&quot; the director of the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ heads of a massive cont@@ ingent in the world championship &quot; is a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record from sch@@ ot@@ tic athletes was selected for London 2017 that starts on Friday .
black believes that in Scotland develops a special specialist in Scotland and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn from it .
&quot; we welcome it , and we try to understand it and we will continue until we find it out , &quot; said Black . &quot;
I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the sh@@ ot@@ ist athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the corner .
&quot; whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely bri@@ ll@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; several of the Scottish athletes are med@@ als , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - which was elected against Sir Mon Far@@ ah , while E@@ ili@@ dh Do@@ yle was elected by the team to the team of team . &quot;
&quot; E@@ ili@@ ie is quite modest .
&quot; their surrender speech was amazing , &quot; says Black . &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , no matter whether they were narrow , or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot;
&quot; the passion and the real feel , the E@@ ili@@ ie totally natural , were great . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ mon@@ wealth silver med@@ iter@@ acy that will compete in their fifth world Championships at the 400 @-@ m hur@@ dles , says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; is that 16 heads in the British team are amazing . &quot;
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes on the world championship was seven which were achieved in 1983 and 2015 .
Mu@@ ir Mu@@ ir runs on this path through British and two European records last year .
&quot; it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 metres . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , the 1.500 m runs , is another sc@@ ored that one should observe the victory at the British team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary games . &quot;
Do@@ yle reminds himself of her first world champion@@ ships than the only other sc@@ ored in the team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell .
&quot; the teams of the capit@@ ol says that they are &quot; great pride &quot; to the fact that many of their land@@ lords don &apos;t only belong to the team , but in some cases also with the med@@ als and at the Fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; the special thing to be part of the team is that they have chosen by the other members of the team so that they have voted for me , but to know that my team @-@ mates chose for me and chose to me something very special for me &quot; , &quot; she added . &quot;
&quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the r@@ ots who belong to the team . &quot;
it shows just how far we came .
&quot; and they are here as established athletes , athletes , who want to asc@@ end on poetry . &quot;
what my speech is concerned as a chapter ?
&quot; yes , I think she went well . &quot;
I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from it that we are back at the Olympiastadion .
&quot; I get a second chance to go there and compete , and it will simply be such a great atmosphere there . &quot;
&quot; block the critics via Facebook : Be@@ wir@@ b you not around a public office , if you can not wear the heat of constitu@@ ents . &quot;
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
&quot; the Americans loved George Washington , but it took not long until the newspapers stopped him because of everything , from the interior to its political principles . &quot;
&quot; he sh@@ im@@ pe@@ ed with criticism , safely . &quot;
but he has not brought his critics to silence .
&quot; in the year 17@@ 83 said Washington : &quot; &quot; the freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stup@@ id and mu@@ te we shall be led to the sheep to battles . &quot;
&quot; this brings me to Maryland to Govern@@ or Lar@@ ry H@@ og@@ an , who must work to be more like Washington . &quot;
Ho@@ gans employees have blocked contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinions on his official Facebook page .
&quot; and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union said , this is the beginning of this week . &quot;
&quot; the stamp of the Govern@@ or left the law@@ suit as fri@@ vo@@ l , and the online comment was full of a counter @-@ action with &quot; Na , and ? &quot;
&quot; it is only Facebook , &quot; said many people . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important if there is a type like H@@ og@@ an .
this is a re@@ publi@@ ic govern@@ or in a overwhelming democratic state which is amazing .
he has the two th@@ est consent of the 50 Govern@@ ors of the Nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a reactionary Hit@@ z@@ head .
he showed a firm hand upon the leadership of his state and strict compliance with principles .
&quot; he was also very skill@@ ful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his constitu@@ ents and play@@ ful his ha@@ iry head to chem@@ otherapy on his side . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the block of persons coming to the side of the Govern@@ ors - the public forum is to be officially referred to as officially and by employees who are paid with public tax @-@ Dollars - need@@ less and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
in an interview with The Washington Post defended ho@@ gans Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse the actions of the Govern@@ ors and argu@@ ed that the block@@ ade of the comments were nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
&quot; but it is too simple to use the image of T@@ rolls or sp@@ amm@@ ers or h@@ asser@@ ted people , which sw@@ ing@@ ed online the pen@@ ises . &quot;
the post spoke with some of the real people that were blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
&quot; and that are only real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a past@@ or , no evil . &quot;
they all told that their comments were respect@@ ful and not profound .
the priest brought the Bible in his post and app@@ el@@ ers to Ho@@ gans Catholic faith .
&quot; attorney Sar@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ like , MD . , was not filled with water , but they asked for hate . &quot;
&quot; I commented polite that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate and other current news , she wrote in the comment section of the message &quot; The Post . &quot;
&quot; I also appreciate this idea if a number of people on the same subject takes place , then they are considered by some rather than a so @-@ called collective use , and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; what the employees of the Govern@@ ors referred to as &quot; concentrated spam attack , others probably would call &quot; &quot; inter@@ c@@ ession &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Facebook era makes it simple , cut a message by simply blocked a cri@@ tic or deleted a negative comment . &quot;
&quot; it is much clean@@ er than in earlier times when you have done the same , that staff were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical lad@@ ders and to burn prot@@ esters and to silence . &quot;
but that is exactly what happens digital .
&quot; H@@ og@@ an is not the first public officials that is cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed , that he cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed Facebook and other social media . &quot;
President Tru@@ mp is negotiated by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first milestones in this question fell last week in Virginia .
&quot; the chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County banned the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to US district James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when she was named a voters from her Facebook page . &quot;
and in K@@ entu@@ cky Govern@@ or Mat@@ t received a visit from AC@@ LU because of its use of Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so hard .
at the moment Wash@@ ing@@ tons had a similar effect on the internet as the internet .
&quot; the number of newspapers multip@@ lied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous brief@@ ing . &quot;
and even at that time Washington had an anonymous T@@ role .
&quot; the people , the pseud@@ onyms like &quot; Ju@@ ri@@ cola &quot; , &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us &quot; , &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; &quot; wrote all letters of newspapers , the Wash@@ ing@@ tons decisions made . &quot;
&quot; peti@@ tions who critic@@ ised his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and navigation with the UK , overcome his office , according to the historical documents that were collected by the Online Pap@@ ers of George Washington Project . &quot;
but he has not brought them to silence .
&quot; freedom of speech , differences and discour@@ se belong to the foundation of our nation . &quot;
and true leadership means to accept that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for home comfort at the Renaissance club
&quot; the former Europeans no 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for the next three days , since the Renaissance Club is held in East Lorraine , the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open . &quot;
&quot; the Nor@@ di@@ re , which resulted in the arch@@ er@@ field links up to the end of the arch@@ er@@ field , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is associated with the new Austr@@ o @-@ founder and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot;
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he reaches its glory with this event , &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; players will see this course from his best side , he is in a great condition . &quot;
Jerry has made a great job when he set this place .
he is a fri@@ ght@@ ening of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
&quot; the Engl@@ ish@@ man is looking forward to defend a championship for the first time , although he won in his 32 @-@ year career both at the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour . &quot;
&quot; this really feels particularly like &quot; , &quot; said in South@@ port . &quot;
&quot; I have not able to defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open , since it was in the year after I gained them out of the program . &quot;
back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; the memories of the last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on , last year here to win . &quot;
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate .
Gary Or@@ r who came to the European senior tour after his 50@@ th birthday earlier this year .
this event will be the first sch@@ ot@@ tic performance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more , if you play at home , &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you can also feel this additional print . &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid Gulf .
I am glad about how it has gone .
&quot; with the trio in the field , the former Masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and the Senior Major Champions Paul Bro@@ adh@@ ur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ ativity . &quot;
&quot; Or@@ r and the former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ rance belong to the six heads in the field , the others are Andrew classic corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and R@@ oss Dru@@ m@@ mond . &quot;
&quot; the entrance is free , the car park costs £ 5 per car with a scale and £ 10 per car with two or more in@@ mates . &quot;
all proceeds to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less pul@@ mon@@ stro@@ kes by Passi@@ v@@ smoke
&quot; over the past two decades , less and less people have died because of passive cancer . &quot;
this result is scientists of the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ ke ) in a study .
&quot; according to our estimates are attribut@@ able per year 167 L@@ ung cre@@ ases on passive smoking &quot; , &quot; said Study of Hei@@ ko Bech@@ er . &quot;
&quot; as a comparison , he moved to a study on this topic from 1994 . &quot;
at that time there was also 400 lung cre@@ ases due to passive fl@@ atter@@ ing per year in Germany .
the new study is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
domestic connections prove to be very complex
&quot; the construction work in the Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &quot; &quot; halfway at the time &quot; , &quot; so the head of the Bau@@ station Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; in the area of domestic closures , the situation is more complicated than susp@@ ected , as in the bottom of the substr@@ ate much de@@ berge , which is not stated in the plans . &quot;
&quot; the traffic , which is repeatedly disabled again , is a big problem for the component of the company St@@ ump@@ p . &quot;

&quot; it is a rare insight into the daily life in the highlands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , recorded in 1969 according to a contro@@ versi@@ al referendum in Indonesia when only 1.0@@ 26 elders is to vote in front of the occup@@ ying forces . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement , which resulted in the independence of the Dutch rule , turned up quickly against the government of Jak@@ arta , which holds control over the region and out foreign journalists or judicial monitoring of it . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 the province was officially divided in Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , whereby the independent part Pap@@ ua @-@ Neu@@ gu@@ ine@@ as was the eastern part of the island . &quot;

Pap@@ ua is Indon@@ esian province where 28 % of men live under the poverty line and have some of the worst children of children in Asia .
but it is also Indon@@ esian Gold@@ land .
&quot; the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high land of New Jersey with 15@@ 3.000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , Free@@ port was built in the value of 3,@@ 1 billion US dollar gold and copper . &quot;
&quot; moreover , Pap@@ ua &apos;s resources has a value of estimated 78 billion US dollars . &quot;
&quot; this rich@@ es are however a source of mis@@ ery for the Pap@@ ua , ensuring that Indon@@ esian military has preserved a er@@ ron@@ eous presence . &quot;
&quot; an examination from 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port local military operators , and units from 1998 and 2004 nearly 20 million US dollars , including up to 15@@ 0,000 US dollars to a single official officer . &quot;
papers demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten these golden gen@@ ans and will be treated gr@@ ac@@ ess .
&quot; according to data of activists , more than 500,000 Pap@@ ua have been killed and thousands were viol@@ ated by the Indon@@ esian military since 1969 . &quot;
&quot; according to the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission in Pap@@ u@@ as Chief es@@ hoch@@ land in 1970 @-@ er years , in accordance with the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission for geno@@ cide . &quot;
in the region alone the Indon@@ esian police last year more than 3.@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; we value the Every@@ thing in a report of the arch@@ di@@ oc@@ ese Bris@@ bane in 2016 , in which reports of atro@@ cities did not contain , such as un@@ law@@ lessness and torture , are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal precip@@ itation of peaceful demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims as every week inci@@ dents , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; the screws have more strengthened , since Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring an influ@@ x of settl@@ ers from other parts of Indonesia . &quot;
&quot; the population of 3,5 million inhabitants of the province is to 83 % Christian , but demo@@ graphic development changes , since Muslim economic migrants have changed from the most pop@@ ulous islands Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i . &quot;

&quot; the Indon@@ esian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , in the folk and as Jok@@ ow@@ i known , said during his election campaign against the ine@@ qualities and infring@@ ements in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
the former Zimmermann attended 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the Pres@@ idential Palace in Jak@@ arta .
&quot; but in Pap@@ ua has changed little , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed . &quot;
&quot; our hearts have broken because we have voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i , with expectation that he will satisfy our hopes that the justice is restored , &quot; says You . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai had only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is inaugur@@ ation in October a low point . &quot;
on 7 December 2014 there was a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas songs before a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali as two Indon@@ esian soldiers on a motorcycle through the darkness .
the rocky children told them that they should un@@ lock their head@@ lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers took part in her tone and later returned with four soldiers , so the local past@@ or Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers , who had dre@@ amed , and sm@@ ote the group with their tissue mates , said victims and witnesses . &quot;
then mo@@ ist one of the soldiers into the group of children .
&quot; a child , the 16 @-@ year Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so hard to come to the com@@ a . &quot;
a few hours later the building of the nearby government Commission was set in fire and the things escal@@ ate next day .
&quot; approximately 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered themselves together on a football field in front of the local police station and the military al@@ mond centre to demand justice . &quot;
they carried out the Wa@@ al@@ kal@@ ine Jag@@ db@@ ö@@ gen and led the Wa@@ ita dance - in the circle continuously and an bird &apos;s im@@ pregn@@ ation - by Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators began to sc@@ rap stones on police and military post .
&quot; when the mood was heated , the soldiers became a command over an internal radio : &quot; when the masses can afford more than three times , they shoot them dead , it is not released in an official document of TI@@ ME , which has not been released the local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ Quarter of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threat@@ ening danger and called for peace and ur@@ ged the crowd to return home . &quot;
nobody was listening to the mood .
&quot; when I revol@@ ted myself , I suddenly turned into my left hand wr@@ ist , &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the porch of his colourful wooden house . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ ame knows still not who has gone , but says that the ball came out of the ranks of the soldiers gathered together . &quot;
&quot; it was over@@ crowded , lots of shots were reduced &quot; , &quot; he adds . &quot;
&quot; the native man of Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ous@@ in , the witness of the shooting . &quot;
&quot; I burned up to him and he sought his body to make sure that he was , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans just a name , the TI@@ ME in d@@ ü@@ ster@@ er mood . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him .
&quot; the chief spec@@ ulative of Pap@@ ua @-@ police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said Re@@ por@@ ters that his officers said their station only &quot; &quot; wanted to be attacked , because they are attacked . &quot;
&quot; we must defend ourselves when people threat@@ ens to kill us , &quot; said the spokes@@ man of Pap@@ ua @-@ Police , Commissioner Pud@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many more inju@@ red .
the news about the notes came only on the following day &apos; fil@@ tered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
&quot; three weeks ago Jok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate speech , in which he expressed sympath@@ ies for the families of the victims and weak@@ en the historical mis@@ states in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; I would like that this case be solved immediately , so it will no longer happen in the future he said . &quot;
&quot; Security Minister Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 , that he entered a non @-@ judicial mechanism for the settlement of historic human rights violations . &quot;
but the excav@@ ations began almost instantly .
&quot; most violations occurred a long time ago .
some were in the 90 ′ s and early the 2000 @-@ er years .
&quot; the point is that we have committed to tackle these violations , but there are processes that must go through . &quot;
&quot; then Esper@@ anto got a retreat as he said on 5 June in Jak@@ arta with TI@@ ME and said he did not have plans , in Pap@@ ua a complaint mechanism . &quot;
&quot; instead , everything is legally regulated , &quot; said . &quot;
&quot; the fact that the UN has called for &quot; crimes against humanity , &quot; said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Pap@@ ua said , said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Pap@@ ua has already been laid , including the pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims received such claims with gri@@ pping un@@ believers .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear later .
&quot; I have fear , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have fear , to be arrested by the military , I have been afraid to be shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says that he was be@@ aten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I had buried the corp@@ ses , the military sought after me &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indon@@ esian police of vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
&quot; during a confrontation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma that refused to bring a conscious man into hospital , a person and 17 others were wo@@ unded , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , the 24 @-@ year R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , the subli@@ dr@@ unken , when he died in a nearby river , died on the way to hospital . &quot;
vill@@ agers are prot@@ ested before the location of the company .
&quot; the police said that the vill@@ agers were war@@ med , the vill@@ agers were war@@ med that re@@ acted by War@@ n@@ sch@@ nuts . &quot;
but locals say that the mobile Brig@@ ade ( Indon@@ esian par@@ am@@ il@@ it@@ ary police ) on the crowd began to shoot and a killing .
&quot; we were so in panic , we have fear that it will be reven@@ ge &quot; , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u B@@ adi@@ i , who was in the vicinity of the hospital and witness , as the last here was quickly delivered here , the TI@@ ME . &quot;
&quot; I hidden two days in my house . &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai Parliament called to account the official officers to account and drag the mobile Brig@@ ade of the police out of the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai has always been an un@@ rest for the Indon@@ esian government .
&quot; the lack of sensu@@ ous development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the Chief Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and Dam@@ al , who live in the green highlands of Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; many joined the &quot; &quot; Free Pap@@ ua Movement &quot; &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel@@ lion which claims to defend the rights of Pap@@ ua , by reve@@ aling the rights of Pap@@ ua attacks and kid@@ n@@ app@@ ings of ind@@ on@@ esian soldiers . &quot;
&quot; some of the top @-@ O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ o@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; in response to the last few years , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were arrested and arbitrary in cu@@ sto@@ dy under the pre@@ text of &quot; safeguarding of national sovereignty . &quot;
some will never dive again .
&quot; among the people in Pap@@ ua is Pan@@ i@@ ai as a &quot; tragic , forgotten place &quot; . &quot; &quot;
poverty strengthens dis@@ satisfaction .
&quot; the bit of rice , which is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals . &quot;
bread is just as out of reach .
the people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women which can edit four or five fields of sweet@@ ener .
they retain the bulk of harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces Not@@ a precious only 10,000 Indon@@ esian ru@@ pe@@ e ( 75 C@@ ents ) .
&quot; over time , economic ine@@ qualities between the native Pap@@ ua and the new migrants grew since the opening of new flu@@ kes to the airport N@@ ab@@ ire in larger number . &quot;
&quot; the few jobs that exist in the region , usually go to the better educated and prosper@@ ous migrants . &quot;
Pap@@ ua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to guide their own companies competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John G@@ ob@@ ai , the chairman of the Chief Executive Board of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world from Pap@@ ua .
&quot; in addition , restrictions on the coverage of international media remain ten@@ se . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Basi@@ lle Long@@ ch@@ amp due to a lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua de@@ ported , although they gave them the rare permission to movies . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the dep@@ uty @-@ director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is elect@@ oral campaign to raise the limitations of reporting to promote transparency and development , not realized . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists who try to report from Indon@@ esian , un@@ peaceful provinces of Pap@@ ua and West@@ pap@@ ua to report : visa den@@ ial and a black list , &quot; said it in an explanation . &quot;
lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indon@@ esian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
&quot; in March , six paci@@ fic states - Tong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Mar@@ sh@@ all@@ ine Islands and the Sal@@ om@@ ones Islands - the UN Human Rights Council to examine the &quot; various and widely spread injuries &quot; in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting . &quot;
the same countries have historically seen the O@@ PM .
&quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indon@@ esian Foreign Ministry of Foreign Ministry of Foreign Affairs and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia is still a democratic system , and there are free media so that it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights inci@@ dents . &quot;
people on the spot want more foreign governments to take note of this .
&quot; as an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of the Human Right @-@ Bot@@ tom K@@ ees Van B@@ aar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura on 4 May visited the locals who took their silence and bed@@ es him &quot; We want freedom &quot; , &quot; in accordance with a source that also took part in the session but will remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia has a further presidential election , but the Pap@@ ua say that they probably will not be able to vote again for Jok@@ ow@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a person who has good intentions , but he is by the people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai Sch@@ iss@@ ing , &quot; says G@@ ob@@ ai , the chairman of the Chief Executive Board . &quot;
&quot; he wants to know that Jok@@ ow@@ i know that the pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from that it is under the constant threat of a military military , in arm@@ our education and health services . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; gu@@ ilt &quot; , &quot; which he must pay back . &quot;
&quot; they do not need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; despite the threats and in@@ tim@@ id@@ ations , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai she@@ ath @-@ offering a last symbolic act of the f@@ itter , was buried at a terrain right outside the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they know that they may never give justice to them , but at least let them forget those responsible for their crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with healthy head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scrap@@ ers of Dubai for the second time
&quot; a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest residences of the world in Dubai , his flow and inev@@ it@@ ang hundreds of inhabitants , from the 337 meter high , 79 @-@ story buildings to flee . &quot;
&quot; it is the second fire that is fine in just two years by the sky@@ scr@@ aper , which is called accidental the Tor@@ ch @-@ Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el @-@ Tower ) . &quot;
&quot; the building was ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we slept on the harbour and we are up with fire alarm and at the shooting of the people . &quot;
&quot; we ran down the stairs , and it lasted approximately 10 minutes to get from the 50@@ th floor to come down &quot; , &quot; told a inhabitants called his name as George &apos;s , Reu@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; Du@@ ba@@ is civil protection authorities said that the units of fire fighting against 4.00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 am GMT ) the fire extingu@@ ished and the building is cool@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the government said , they work on providing accommodation for those concerned . &quot;
&quot; the incident can be used for safety of materials , which are used in outdoor areas of sky@@ scrap@@ ers around the world . &quot;
&quot; an examination by the management of the tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 took that the largest part of the damage from the cl@@ adding , the outer covering for decor@@ ating or insulation . &quot;
&quot; in the UK , the police , she believe that the system of plates for insulation and cl@@ adding in the London Gren@@ ada @-@ Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a bran@@ ding in June , with approximately 80 people died . &quot;
no Davis Cup reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International tennis boards ( IT@@ F ) is carried out with his great Davis Cup cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
&quot; at the meeting in Ho @-@ Chi @-@ Min@@ h city , one of the necessary two @-@ third @-@ majority was not supported by the required two @-@ third majority . &quot;
&quot; this often very long , but even so much appreciated five @-@ set @-@ classic will remain with the traditional competition . &quot;
&quot; 6@@ 3,@@ 54 percent of member states voted for reform , the goal of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only slightly missing . &quot;
&quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members are not accepted the whole reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot;
&quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of this i@@ kon@@ ical and historic competitions , &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot;
you will continue to work on improving the applications .
&quot; not only for the vote , after the vote , the final trial had already reached the final place in a neutral place . &quot;
&quot; new from 2018 are only compar@@ atively smaller details : so , the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will in future have the hosts in the first round . &quot;
&quot; to reduce the costs for the organizer , the demands placed in terms of training courses etc , and the players will have to be able to complete the Davis Cup less official media dates before the Davis Cup . &quot;
&quot; more than 1 of 5 US travelers will move forward objects to the plane , find a survey out . &quot;
&quot; a survey conducted by plane passengers , that over 20 percent are consciously or un@@ aware items to control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent , which gri@@ eves the plane , while they are acci@@ dentally banned kni@@ ves or other items with blades . &quot;
&quot; less than 1 percent claimed , they would have been delayed that they have travelled to swal@@ low with sc@@ iss@@ ing , amm@@ unition or explo@@ si@@ ves . &quot;
&quot; the survey with more than 1.000 people - which was carried out by a jet charter service , the ST@@ RA@@ TOS Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , was carried out also firm that younger travellers are more dis@@ regard for the rules . &quot;
&quot; ques@@ tioned by the respon@@ dents that they have tried to fly with something that was banned from the T@@ SA , 19,@@ 7 percent m@@ illenni@@ als , compared to less than 15 per cent of the members of the generation X . &quot;
&quot; the most common objects , which were inten@@ tionally maintained by T@@ SA agent , were foods and liquids . &quot;
&quot; more than 3 percent have borne , knowing objects with blades by the safety control , while 2,@@ 2 per cent of the female ques@@ tioned and 3,@@ 7 per cent of the male ques@@ tioned also confirmed that they could un@@ inten@@ sely affect drugs into the plane . &quot;
&quot; the company said , we asked travelers in the whole country to find out how many acci@@ dentally sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ware had been brought by the airport security and how many things could have been inten@@ tionally done . &quot;
&quot; it is not a surprise that people who are most popular sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ware - know@@ ingly or not know@@ ingly - by safety , those were most often fly . &quot;
&quot; however , the company proves that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and conf@@ using . &quot;
people are often uns@@ ure which liquids may take them or how much of it .
&quot; thus , there is no surprise that the largest amount of the objects received by the T@@ SA . &quot;
a time for people thought the T@@ SA could see books as sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ware .
&quot; liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights . &quot;
El@@ on Mus@@ k it doesn &apos;t matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers can cancel Order
&quot; for his new Tes@@ la &quot; &quot; Model 3 &quot; &quot; with the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
&quot; so far , he has under@@ estimated that a part of the customer has already with@@ drawn its non @-@ binding reservation . &quot;
&quot; besides the always tri@@ ump@@ ed figures to sales increase and even gigantic sales aim , Tes@@ la @-@ Chief El@@ on Mus@@ k has under@@ estimated a different , less high @-@ gloss number : the cancellations made in the new mass market model 3 . &quot;
&quot; in the past few months , Mus@@ k had often accompanied with the more than 500,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose delivery is just beginning . &quot;
&quot; now , Mus@@ k saw a : from the total of 5@@ 18.@@ 000 pre @-@ orders have been returned to 6@@ 3.000 already . &quot;
critics were always pointed out that it is merely a non @-@ binding reservations .
&quot; if cancellation pays Tes@@ la the 1000 Euro ( in the US 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1,000 pounds ) &quot; booking fee &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; currently , 45@@ 5.000 of such non @-@ binding reservations made available in a telephone conference with analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; that cancellation of up to 12 percent of all orders may become a problem , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe . &quot;
&quot; its argument : the challenge for ambitious growth objectives lies not in demand , but on the production site . &quot;
&quot; last year Tes@@ la 8@@ 4,000 cars made out of the year . &quot;
&quot; 2018 , it should be assembled - all models - 500,000 , 2020 one million . &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
&quot; according to Mus@@ k , you arrive at this time per day 1800 reservations . &quot;
&quot; who today ordered a &quot; model 3 &quot; , &quot; may be expected in the second half of 2018 with the delivery - if Tes@@ la creates its brand new , never in practice tested with no greater inter@@ ruptions with maximum utilization . &quot;
doubt many experts that this is possible .
&quot; however , it comes to greater delays , then the in@@ binding of the reservations may become a problem for Tes@@ la . &quot;
&quot; for then the company can not go beyond satisfied customers , in Sch@@ aren . &quot;
EPA Chef Pru@@ itt draws back to reducing emissions from Obama @-@ Er@@ a to reduce emissions
&quot; a day after he had passed from 15 states , Scott Pru@@ itt , the Chief of the Environmental Authority , his former decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era to reduce the emissions of smo@@ g @-@ caused air pollution . &quot;
Pru@@ itt presented the change as its agency proved to meet the needs of governmental environmental authorities to react more quickly than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mentioned the law@@ suit was raised against his previous place in a federal union Court .
&quot; it is about a deadline , which ran off on 1 October for states to hold the standards of 2015 for bot@@ tom@@ o@@ zone . &quot;
&quot; in June , he announced the adher@@ ence to a year to study the plan for a year to study the plan and to avoid the economic growth in local decisions . &quot;
&quot; Pru@@ itt , who was calling for O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma before his appointment by President Donald Tru@@ mp State of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma was a long time a reliable opponent &apos;s environmental protection regulations . &quot;
&quot; since its arrival in Washington , Pru@@ itt is repeated to block or delay the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels . &quot;
the sudden conversion of Wednesday is the most recent legal back@@ charge for the Pru@@ run regulatory rolling agenda .
&quot; last month a federal career court in Washington has decided that the EPA @-@ holder has passed his authority , when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of Obama administration , the oil and gas companies for monitoring and reducing meth@@ an@@ lec@@ ks to delay . &quot;
&quot; in one at the Friday evening , the opinion published by oceans with oceans standards quite simply the willingness of EPA to cooperate with the states by the complex process of timely implementation of the new standards ampli@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; among former administr@@ ations , EPA have often decreased the deadlines for carrying out and then wa@@ ited to set off activists , and others , and in an agreement to set up the date for the execution , &quot; said Pru@@ itt , who has supp@@ ress the EPA over a dozen times in his previous job . &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in regulation by jurisdictions , and we take deadlines seriously . &quot;
&quot; we also take the law and authority , which gives us serious . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the opinion expressed by the EPA , that leaves at some point his &quot; authority for the delay and all other legally available made &quot; &quot; to ensure that the rules &quot; are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
the re@@ public@@ ans in the Congress is pushing for a broader new version of the oceans .
&quot; in the last month of the legislation , the implementation of the rules of 2015 should be concluded by at least eight years . &quot;

association wants to check permission from Wind@@ bikes
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim w@@ hon@@ ors &quot; &quot; does not represent a legal prerequisite for the construction and therefore has adapted to the country council . &quot;
&quot; the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; has promp@@ ted land Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) asked to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette . &quot;
it is illegal .
the association was argu@@ ed that at the time of permission of 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette could not have been approved since at the time in Aachen only at the border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal there have existed .
&quot; within this concentration area , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , at the same time causes the concentr@@ ations but also for the exclusion of wind use for the rest area . &quot;
the lei zones should prevent a &quot; understanding &quot; of the landscape .
&quot; a few days ago , the city had decided to take a second wind power station in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette - but it had not approved the District Government of Düsseldorf , because of a form@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of plan@@ ation legal prerequisite is the right per@@ missible permits , and therefore to rise again , &quot; said Christoph Er@@ kens , Chairman of &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; current state of affairs : the city council has again decided prior to the summer break , the wind @-@ cent@@ ric zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette decided ; an approval of the District Government stands still . &quot;
&quot; with this , Er@@ kens : &quot; &quot; with this point the issuing of a permit for the construction of wind turbines are legally excluded . &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the call .
&quot; the corresponding letter has been entered into a circle since last week , explained a speaker . &quot;
the circle takes it to the occasion to examine the matter once again .
but it is not likely to do that the procedure is stopped .
&quot; with a view of the ongoing procedures at the administrative court , the circle was not expressed on Thursday , on the argument of the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; NE@@ W re , an affiliate of the NE@@ W , is planning on an area at the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette the construction of four to 200 meters high wind wheels . &quot;
&quot; already last year the company had participated in which the city is involved in the city of Vier@@ n@@ bar , Pach@@ t@@ agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of great terrain closed . &quot;
&quot; with the establishment of the four wind turbines , the power requirement is to be covered by around 11 400 households - this corresponds to approximately one fifth of the electricity needs of all four @-@ four households . &quot;
the NE@@ W Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer gave a green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the wind park Lin@@ ni@@ ch at Aachen and a stake in a wind turbines in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district of Hein@@ sberg .
car and tractor bor@@ row@@ ed together : woman dies in a terrible accident
one horri@@ ble traffic case took place on Friday morning at 10 am on the L 333 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bog@@ el ( Rhine @-@ L@@ ahn ( district ) .
a woman became fat@@ al .
two more people were inju@@ red .
the provincial road stayed over hours closed .
&quot; according to police information , a 17 @-@ year old woman made from Bor@@ ni@@ ch with their car in the course of accompanying bikes with her 53 @-@ year mother as companion the L 333 in the direction of Bog@@ el . &quot;
city and retailers plan &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend
bath Langen@@ sal@@ za@@ er and people from the region should discover the shopping center in the city center in September .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; ren@@ ditions and the city administration want to use the weekend on 8th and 9th September to lo@@ vel@@ ing the inhabitants to the shopping center in the city center . &quot;
&quot; as the chairman of the business association , Christian König , announced the &quot; home @-@ Sh@@ utter &quot; &quot; weekend , the &quot; &quot; homeland &quot; &quot; weekend , which offers the customers to become more sensitive , which offers the own city away from the usual supermarket goods . &quot;
&quot; therefore , a market with regional suppliers , similar to the weekly market . &quot;
&quot; in addition , local companies are to present themselves with their training courses . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the shops of the city centre will invite you to &quot; &quot; Mit@@ tern@@ ts &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the action is not only on residents of the city and the closer region . &quot;
&quot; in preparation , commerci@@ als in the radio , a Internet video and printed bag , which point to the battery weekend , so Christian König . &quot;
city administration and trade ren@@ ditions are working together with the Chamber of Industry and Commerce of Commerce .
&quot; thus , the trade ren@@ ditions and the city go into another stage of the project &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive downtown . &quot; &quot;
&quot; these include new offerings such as the first &quot; &quot; Ak@@ tiv day &quot; &quot; for well as selling so@@ b@@ lown Sunday , talks with all trade operators and working to move them to active participation . &quot;
&quot; also , attractive offers for Saturday and finishing in parking fees due to this day are part of the concept . &quot;
&quot; in addition , customer potential is to be opened or opened again . &quot;
this includes Kur@@ passengers and tourists .
but also many local residents would have lost the inner city at shopping .
&quot; in the end , everyone would have to contribute to bel@@ li@@ ven the city center - to land@@ lords , the businesses of the whole city and . &quot;
&quot; it turned out to overcome with a network the Le@@ th@@ arg@@ y , who made himself partly , had king in the spring . &quot;
&quot; Bir@@ g@@ it St@@ reich , Leit@@ erin of the I@@ HK @-@ Centers in Müh@@ l@@ hausen shared with that at the nationwide third &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; &quot; day , for the first time five Thuring@@ ian cities . &quot;
&quot; besides Bad Langen@@ sal@@ za this Weimar , S@@ ö@@ m@@ mer@@ da , Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt and B@@ light@@ ero@@ de . &quot;
&quot; the day sol@@ ves &quot; to advertise the appreciation of local trade and its significance for the common good of our cities stronger , &quot; so St@@ reich . &quot;
the action under the Feder@@ au@@ spices of the Chamber of Commerce and its many partners make it clear that every citizen could influence its proprietary environment itself .

Tru@@ mp put after the sent tran@@ scription by phone call Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the border wall
Tran@@ scription by phone call between US President Donald Tru@@ mp and Le@@ aders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
&quot; on 27 January called Tru@@ mp in a telephone at a telephone with the Mexican President En@@ ri@@ que Pen@@ a NI@@ E@@ TO , to say publicly that he would pay for a planned border wall . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. president im@@ ply him , because he had publicly announced the wall to publicly . tell , he said to him , &quot; &quot; this cannot say the press . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp launched its presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall in the southern border of the USA , and weak@@ en Mexico for the project . &quot;
tran@@ scription of his first attack with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and presented a ten@@ se exchange .
&quot; Mr. Tru@@ mp said Mr. Turn@@ bull said that a trade for the US refugees came to take on &quot; ridicul@@ ous &quot; , &quot; m@@ ies &quot; and &quot; stup@@ id &quot; , &quot; &quot; m@@ ies &quot; and &quot; stup@@ id &quot; , &quot; &quot; m@@ ies &quot; and &quot; du@@ mm &quot; , &quot; if he proposed a ban on the settlement of refugees in the United States . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Tru@@ mp has ended the call , after he had said Mr Turn@@ bull , &quot; this is the most uncomfortable call for the whole day . &quot;
mo@@ ores Ford @-@ Mass@@ aker : activists make rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a Call for Justice again
&quot; a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mer@@ cur@@ y drove by a group of spectators in rural Monroe , Georgia , and buried on the Ford bridge of Mo@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; before the car , the four black passengers and a white driver had to reach the bridge , a group of white men came out to block its way . &quot;
the leader of the bul@@ l@@ oth@@ s - a man middle aged in a needle @-@ strip - took a long train at its c@@ ig@@ ar and looked upon through the wind@@ shield .
inside hi@@ des the in@@ mates in fear .
&quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; breaks the man . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ l him from the car ! &quot;
&quot; sh@@ ri@@ pped the still@@ ness , as a young black man sail@@ ed from the Bei@@ rut . &quot;
&quot; fortunately this terrible scene , which was played on 22 July , only a post@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; but if then a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; , &quot; almost all of all in the audience is very real s@@ eu@@ ph@@ zer . &quot;
&quot; since 2005 Ombud@@ sman for Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge back to im@@ itate the night , in the two black pairs - Roger and Dor@@ oth@@ y Mal@@ com , as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - from K@@ u Club x Kl@@ an in 1946 . &quot;
no one was charged ever because of the Mor@@ de .
&quot; it really is unden@@ i@@ able that in all these years no one person was arrested - although we see them in our churches , although we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks , who helps in the organization of delivery . &quot;
&quot; it is a strainer on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Bro@@ oks is a 71 @-@ year former congress of the State of Georgia and a life of civil rights .
&quot; for him , it serves as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual memory of the Monroe community that an Un@@ right has never been corrected . &quot;
&quot; we want criminal tracking , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must receive justice , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; we cannot get healing and reconciliation , until we receive justice . &quot;
a court medi@@ ator presents a du@@ tu@@ ch about the Lei@@ che of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on 27 July 1946 .
&quot; according to F@@ BI @-@ acts , which were received by the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men out of Monroe and the surrounding county in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process . &quot;
but nobody has ever been charged .
&quot; although the susp@@ ects have been on free on foot , saying that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions in the whole city was always known : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 made a decision of the Supreme Court of the black citizens in Georgia , for the first time , at the prefer@@ ential battle in the summer their voice . &quot;
&quot; about at the same time as the choice st@@ ach according to the data of the black Far@@ mp@@ ächter Roger Mal@@ com had a white base owners , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a struggle down - supp@@ osedly because of a woman . &quot;
Bro@@ oks said the sm@@ ells in the city have been that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s Mrs. Dor@@ oth@@ y slept and that the baby who contributed them not of her husband .
&quot; on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land owners , 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , so the F@@ BI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ oth@@ y and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to the prison .
&quot; but when they went away from the prison and turn off the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , um@@ ring@@ ing a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b the car . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison that the Mor@@ de prepared and arranged , &quot; includes a F@@ BI report . &quot;
&quot; it is also obvious that there was a complete set @-@ in between the state and local criminal prosec@@ ution , which was not only involved in the mor@@ den , evidence and the identity of witnesses . &quot;
Bro@@ oks form@@ ulates it even conc@@ ise .
&quot; it was a elect@@ oral mass@@ ac@@ re , &quot; he said . &quot;
they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; when you register and if you vote then this will happen here .
almost a decade ago C@@ ass@@ andra Gre@@ ene led the annual post@@ age of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
&quot; their representation is illustr@@ ative , grasp and is founded in a kind of profound racism that many believe in America no longer exists . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to look , and even more difficult to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that the point is . &quot;
&quot; we do not want to talk about the Lyn@@ chen , because we are going to face with him in all of us , &quot; said she . &quot;
but I cannot build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or not want to hear what I did through .
&quot; samples for the year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day there is almost 30 actors - a dozen past@@ ure and the rest of Black - into a space and lau@@ gh as Gre@@ ene started a good overview of the piece started . &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ enes Co @-@ director .
&quot; he has played the role of Chief C@@ lan@@ mit@@ gli@@ eds since years , but he said , the role will never be simpler . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty , because I am not so , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; but I think it is very important to get this story in life , because we don &apos;t want to return to these times . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the room the actor D@@ arri@@ us Bra@@ d@@ sh@@ aw and N@@ ick Ras@@ cona , Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester play , their lines . &quot;
&quot; the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the h@@ ester , and let him drink , angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ oth@@ y . &quot;
&quot; I said , n --- he , pu@@ zz@@ led by my property ! &quot;
Ras@@ cona wi@@ ther the fire .
there is a pause .
and then each ( at least all black actor ) in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laugh@@ s at the lau@@ test .
&quot; what ? ! &quot; , &quot; asked Ras@@ cona . &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still k@@ ich@@ ever . &quot;
I just don &apos;t believe that white people then &apos; n --- he said &apos; .
&quot; but , funny one of the other black performers . &quot;
&quot; you must only meet the hard &apos; R. &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and that is exactly there the energy in space , a sense of compan@@ ion@@ ship replaces the discomfort . &quot;
&quot; everyone is busy to get this right , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed . &quot;
the scene begins once again .
&quot; this time when Ras@@ cona the N @-@ Word says , he says it sharp and with re@@ print . &quot;
absolutely no one laugh@@ s .
this re@@ petition ends non @-@ violent and fast .
&quot; there is terror , shots and then silence . &quot;
&quot; a woman , with a trau@@ ma @-@ dress , stands on the corp@@ ses of the actors and leads Bil@@ lie Holidays traum@@ atis@@ de Lob@@ s@@ Fruit &quot; . &quot; &quot;
your voice breaks out in every second word .
about one hundred meters behind it wis@@ ely a group of about four dozen spectators and t@@ ears from the eyes .
the audience is almost even@@ ly divided between black and white .
&quot; a pair is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , arrived to see the performance , many come only the road . &quot;
they have experienced every eight hours of Georgi@@ as well as impressive humidity when Bro@@ oks she goes on a pilgrimage to the tomb of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
&quot; up to this point the Mor@@ de have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when you were on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de features , feels the air s@@ tical . &quot;
&quot; if the final notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene invites the quantity to come closer and to insp@@ ect the body name . &quot;
&quot; children ho@@ cken to their heads , register the f@@ ake blood and the silent body and wh@@ is@@ per@@ ing each other . &quot;
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; m@@ bles a little boy , when it wants to remember it . &quot;
after some minutes Gre@@ ene of the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw the Lyn@@ chs@@ eil and w@@ aking her t@@ ears .
&quot; Bra@@ d@@ sh@@ aw - Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit , who has played the C@@ lan@@ member . &quot;
N@@ ick Ras@@ cona um@@ ar@@ ks two of his fellow players and then breaks out in their arms , the emotional load of performance breaks finally with him . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; fl@@ asks one of women . &quot;
we know that this is not in your heart .
you did that for a reason .
&quot; later , the audience starts with the actors for dinner together . &quot;
at a table a white couple from Atlanta promp@@ ted over the re@@ ation with a black pair that they have just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski fought to find words that left the performance .
&quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... of people who look like yourself and do that , because they look like you , &quot; said she . &quot;
&quot; what that really with me is doing so makes me believe that the Lyn@@ chen still continues , &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; today it is called the police shooting . &quot;
&quot; in the same room Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks Hof at his table , he e@@ ats and reminds of the citizen rights . &quot;
he said he started to plan the performance in the next year .
&quot; the post@@ ure is in a certain way inspir@@ ational , as it describes the fri@@ ght of what we bear , but it is also a moment of learning &quot; , &quot; said . &quot;
&quot; it is so , if we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again . &quot;
whoever does not study his own history who does not know his own story is condemned to repeat them .

&quot; great appl@@ ause is available for the Fest@@ spiel@@ haus , which shows the first time on stage - in view of the great heat again in leg@@ is@@ ers . &quot;
the performance was expected by Frank Cast@@ orf and his regional team .
&quot; in 2013 he had to leave a g@@ ell@@ ful pipe concert in 2013 , there were five years later great che@@ ers in which the &quot; &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; &quot; went down . &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Kath@@ arina Wagner is likely to be pleased about it .
&quot; you notice that the audience has grown with the &quot; &quot; ring &quot; in a certain way , she had said shortly before the launch of the d@@ pa . &quot;
&quot; the audience did not only have a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it has also been a understanding of its view . &quot;

max quantity works as a volunteer
they work in their volunteers equal to several places .
where everywhere ?
&quot; quantity : usually in stone furt in the furniture of furniture , once a week I hel@@ mets here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge . &quot;
and I already worked in an open @-@ day at the school .
what are your experiences with this ?
&quot; quantity : it is a beautiful , wide spectrum which I see here . &quot;
&quot; I have to do with different people with young adults , with refugees , with young adults . &quot;
&quot; they are now 26 years , so a late @-@ professional volunteer . &quot;
how does that come about ?
amount : I have done Ab@@ it@@ ur .
&quot; and then a building of civil engineering , we say that we have been successfully broken . &quot;
I realized for me that it is wrong for me and I want to do something else with people .
and then I asked myself what you do .
&quot; do a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on site , in the burning , maybe also , really is . &quot;
and was it so ?
amount : I have collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the winter semester .
&quot; I will study dual @-@ study , probably in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne a social working training and studying in Ham@@ m at the Fach@@ hoch@@ schule . &quot;
is it not something unusual during the volunteer service to have several different operating locations ?
&quot; quantity : yes , it is very variable . &quot;
it always depends on where you make his F@@ S@@ J .
you can make it from Al@@ ter@@ sheim to Ju@@ gen@@ dar@@ work - in all possible fac@@ ets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
&quot; I was also partially in the O@@ GS , so in the after@@ math . &quot;
for me this was just the right thing that I had mat@@ ured .
&quot; I could see my own strengths , and see how it really happened . &quot;

&quot; quantity : na clear , here it is not about to reck@@ on St@@ ati@@ cs . &quot;
&quot; one has repeatedly a different person , which each have a completely different story behind . &quot;
&quot; whether a refuge@@ e , whether a teen@@ ager has been fet@@ ched from the family - you always have to respond individually to it . &quot;
very interesting .
and you did not have any kind of touch ?

there is a field that gives a lot .
&quot; great love , lots of kindness . &quot;

EPA will make a decision to delay the smo@@ g rule according to chains .
&quot; the US @-@ American Environmental Agency has a decision to delay a regulation of the government of Obama , as well as the states are committed to re@@ lie@@ ve the smo@@ g @-@ caused emissions . this was a day after 15 states the Agency due to the step@@ per . &quot;
&quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the &quot; Oz@@ on@@ provisions 2015 &quot; , &quot; and said , they show the obligation of the agency to work with countries . &quot;
&quot; we believe in dialogue with and that we respond to our state partners , &quot; said EPA boss Scott Pru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; Pru@@ itt had announced in June the intention of EPA , the oceans regulations in which are to be measured in a part of the country poll@@ ut@@ ant emissions which must be made , to delay ti@@ ghter air@@ quality standards - to delay a year until October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , held on Tuesday , and said that the ende@@ avor was illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tru@@ mp has tried to rise a wide range of environmental aspects that the former President Barack Obama has imposed , as part of a broader agenda , to boost economic growth according to Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; however , the efforts have triggered the impact of the democr@@ ats and nature conservation groups that are worried about the effects of greater emissions on public health . &quot;
&quot; the EPA website says that the inhal@@ ation of air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; &quot; the lung function and the breath@@ able symp@@ tom can strengthen , such as as@@ thma . &quot;
community of Community
&quot; in the end , the decision was clearly stated : with two oppos@@ ing the congreg@@ ations of Flu@@ orn winds , the establishment of a joint space in the future elderly . &quot;
&quot; in front of the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the even missing land is signed , reports Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden . &quot;
&quot; although it will still take it until the so far the church community of the community in the common property is , but there is now no plan@@ ation for that of a private investor to build a project . &quot;
&quot; for this , there is a discussion on a joint space . &quot;
&quot; one of the two investors who are still in the boat , has offered the community to come . &quot;
&quot; on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - approximately 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with at least 70 square meters of space for a special price . &quot;
&quot; the administration and the majority of the congreg@@ ations of the community , such a common area is not fores@@ ee@@ able as a meeting place for the residents of sen@@ i@@ cur@@ y living conditions , but open to the church . &quot;
&quot; as an example , the word was made by &quot; &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the decision is made by providing funds for the current budget already in the last autumn , by funding opportunities . &quot;
the construction lies in the refurb@@ ishment area .
&quot; the establishment of a joint space would be , so reports T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent are conduc@@ ive . &quot;
&quot; the decision proposal regards to sign@@ aling the investor that one wants to throw from it in this respect , that both saddle - what the environmental impact is reduced - and the construction cost of economic power - it would be possible . &quot;
&quot; need@@ less , so not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer , be this supplement . &quot;
when it helps : unanim@@ ously happened to the body .
it is not as easy as it is in the common room .
&quot; Daniela call refers to the many own buildings , with which you do not get so far forward , you are now taking place at the common room from the window , she says : &quot; I do not do me with it . &quot;
Y@@ v@@ onne Sta@@ ve necessarily speaks for the common area - but absolutely against a municipal participation .
it looks at the same time a compar@@ isons to the accident or even foreign investors .
&quot; that is just not so , because with the acquisition of the surface you do not give a supplement , but may be a real , in the two @-@ case @-@ market ver@@ sus , is the counter@@ speech . &quot;
&quot; state application , the decision proposal accordingly , will find three pro@@ pon@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; so it remains with two oppos@@ ing in the original program , the Stefan H@@ aller , summar@@ izing : &quot; when we take the decision , we make a giant step to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot;

&quot; we know that we are not in the best physical constitution , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ ot@@ ti and added : &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot;
that was last not good . &quot;
the 58 @-@ year @-@ old does not believe in an power upgrade in the first official game of the season .
&quot; football is also tac@@ tic , strategy , personality and motivation . &quot;
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the crew is ready .
&quot; we want to play intelligent , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ ot@@ ti , who is a &quot; difficult , intensive play &quot; . &quot; &quot;

in the Har@@ z of Stern to star
&quot; in Har@@ z , the nationwide first &quot; &quot; star@@ ch &quot; &quot; is supposed to be created . &quot;
this is planning the club Star awaits Saint Andre@@ as@@ berg .
a planetary path is available in Göt@@ t@@ ingen - since 2003 .
&quot; a &quot; star@@ ch &quot; &quot; is contrary to the information needs of many Har@@ z@@ visitors , called it . &quot;
&quot; he connect nature , science , exercise and sporting performance . &quot;
the members want to put up along the planned route table and inform them about stars and constell@@ ations .
&quot; in the first phase until 2018 , the association &quot; &quot; well achiev@@ able installations of five to six locations &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; case @-@ question : St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Si@@ eber . &quot;
the information on the tables should be complemented by internet .
&quot; therefore , at the location of location a good mobile network welcome is a part . &quot;
also accessibility is a criterion .
later the star@@ ch is to be extended by train .
&quot; on the stars , the viewer experienced a lot of knowledge , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; declared the association . &quot;
&quot; moreover , they have learned why the stars would have different colors or why a star stronger lumin@@ aire than another , although he is considerably further away . &quot;
&quot; also , in which constell@@ ation is an selected star , and when he is best to see . &quot;
the association has been running in the mountain village of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg since 2014 at the highest nearby constell@@ ation North Rhine .
the centre in the middle of the Har@@ z National Park is one of the German most dark regions of Germany in the middle of Germany .
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a galax@@ y can clearly see clearly .
&quot; in the uni @-@ town , there have been a little simil@@ arities since 2003 on the initiative of the Förder@@ arium Göt@@ t@@ ingen , something like the planned star @-@ value - the planetary path . &quot;
&quot; starting from Geb@@ h@@ ards Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ al@@ lee that forms the interior of our solar system , the planetary path leads with its steep up to the Hain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an extra @-@ terrestrial location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( municipality equals ) with the planet Sed@@ na . &quot;
the st@@ ables with the individual planets - including the d@@ warf @-@ resistant Plu@@ to at the end point - are precisely in the distance and scale of one to two billion .
&quot; the earth sh@@ ru@@ ined so on a sphere of 6,@@ 5 millimeters , while the exact 75 meter remo@@ ves 70 cen@@ tim@@ eters in size . &quot;
the entire distance of the plan is about four kilometers .
&quot; while the light needs from sun to Plu@@ to about eight hours , ped@@ est@@ ri@@ ans need a good hour up to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to . &quot;
ped@@ est@@ ri@@ ans are thus faster than the light in the cosmos .
the march to the next fix@@ ation but would still last a half year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko will meet for the first time to discuss a possible show@@ down
&quot; Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , which should be found in a coll@@ isions in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; they were in separate rooms at ES@@ PN @-@ offices in Los Angeles , to Gar@@ cia , the un@@ trained World Boxing Champion , the corridor down to greet Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Boxing Organisation Super @-@ spring champion . &quot;
after Gar@@ ci@@ as victory through incoming decision on the former four divisions of the World Champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Showtime are both f@@ ighter members of the top @-@ five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ List .
&quot; Gar@@ cia stretched the right hand and said , &quot; How is it you , Champion ? &quot;
I wish you good luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko has defended his belt against Miguel Marri@@ aga on Satur@@ days at 7 p.m. on ES@@ PN .
&quot; when the pair was posing for photos , commented Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is climate that would be a possible show@@ down between the fighters that would be &quot; perfect &quot; order . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am a former fe@@ ather @-@ weight , &quot; reminded Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; I have risen to bronze &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I am not so big . &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to run on lightweight .
and he must move to lightweight tler &#91; 135 pound &#93; and then fight .
that will require the fans .
let us give them that .
Lom@@ ach@@ enko is atmosph@@ eric .
&quot; boxes needs this fight . &quot;
&quot; climate asked if it should be on Pay @-@ per view , part of a strategy to arrange Lom@@ ach@@ enko with a 135 pound debut in this year to arrange a date in the next summer with Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also interest in the fight against the winner of Jor@@ ge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell after their lightweight title struggle in the Forum on 23 September . &quot;
&quot; this struggle could take place in the pay @-@ per @-@ view mode , because all fans asked for him , &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia and strongly open to fight in the network that offers the best financial package . &quot;
we are the best .
no other name can create this kind of attention .
when always they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said he said Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous fighters , &quot; and he may take part in his Saturday struggle . &quot;
&quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ enko held at the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he think , the Thir@@ ty Champion of River@@ side see &quot; very slow , I &apos;m sorry for Mi@@ key ... you wanted to get the co @-@ off . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said , the focus is to show impact , then boxes . &quot;
&quot; both said , they could build the Mom@@ entum that was built for the own battle . &quot;
&quot; this is the battle , which must be carried out . &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; I am more than happy to work on , &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said , &quot; &quot; I have been waiting for the top fighters and this is Mi@@ key . &quot;
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four verses for tire @-@ se@@ er
with an accident on the A7 on Thursday afternoon four persons were inju@@ red for part .
&quot; after the first information lost the driver of a Opel Z@@ af@@ ira , after 4.@@ 30 p.m. shortly before the connecting market , after a tyre , he probably will control the control of his vehicle . &quot;
&quot; the passenger moves to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he turned out and then lying on the roof in the green stri@@ ps . &quot;
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - have been inju@@ red during the accident .
&quot; during the first supply of the last through the life@@ service , the A7 was locked in the direction of the north for about one hour , then the traffic on the left lane was transferred to the accident . &quot;
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; Dre@@ ier@@ chain works better &quot;
&quot; And@@ re Hoffmann hopes after 2 : 2 for the season of the season against Braunschweig , that the optimization of def@@ enses in Au@@ e points brings . &quot;
&quot; with the first season , And@@ re Hoffmann was satisfied with the result , they would not have been the two oppos@@ ing at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig . &quot;
&quot; these were two oppos@@ ing too much , and we have to fit even better in Au@@ e , &quot; says the def@@ enses from Fortuna Düsseldorf . &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains the Dre@@ ams should also be optimized further .
&quot; and a gate after a friend , the For@@ tun@@ ings do not want to catch the For@@ tun@@ ings . &quot;
for the future it will be so no more besides Michael ( R@@ ensing ) to the line .
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will also get better to the experiences in preparation with the rotating chain than with the quad@@ rant .
&quot; still I don &apos;t know how we are acting in Au@@ e , but Hoffmann says in his thing , &quot; &quot; says his thing is safe , &quot; &quot; because we just have been in the turning chain on the semi @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Nik@@ o found@@ el@@ mann players who can build a good &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ condition is , but that we are still better harmon@@ ise and we do not perform so many play@@ errors . &quot;
&quot; of course , Hoffmann also drives to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; whether one cannot speak after an accident of a mis@@ erable start , don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; the performance could be quite okay , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; if we can go on Sunday with four points and we can concentrate on the Pok@@ al , we will certainly speak of a true season . &quot;
it wanted to know his trainer .
&quot; the start into the season Be@@ ur@@ ances I only came after six to eight game days , who don &apos;t want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e , just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim was pre@@ mat@@ urely due to a we@@ aver . &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season virtually with a home game , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann believes that players from Au@@ e might even be something fresh , since they would have no he@@ avi@@ es and complete game like Fortuna against an asc@@ ension favorite . &quot;
&quot; but they do not know as 100 @-@ percentage , where they are currently standing , &quot; says the interior of the Fortuna . &quot;
although guests from the Rhin@@ eland go as a lighter Favor@@ ite on Sunday in the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; that we take them away , just because we have the claim to come under the first six is bl@@ ö@@ ck@@ wise , &quot; &quot; says funk@@ el , its balance in just a defeat against Au@@ e from nine games is quite positive . &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga that one has to hit from pre@@ h@@ in , &quot; explains For@@ tun@@ as Chef@@ coach . &quot;
&quot; such a statement would be arro@@ gan@@ t , arro@@ gan@@ t and over@@ subscri@@ bed . &quot;
and he does not want to experience his players on Sunday in no case .
new results of the Swedish asylum application tests published
&quot; the recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , which were under@@ gone a new method for medical evaluation of their age , show that over 80 percent of the tested people are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish authority for for@@ ens@@ ic medicine ( R@@ ät@@ ts@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) has started with the execution of the tests last year .
&quot; they are to make the assessment of the age more precise during the asylum procedure , after the Swedish Mig@@ r@@ ulation authority ( mig@@ r@@ ation ) , due to errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees were critic@@ ised the min@@ der@@ stone . &quot;
&quot; until today , Mig@@ r@@ ations@@ et 6.@@ 880 to test cases send and the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency now has released the results of a total of 2.@@ 481 testing from the period from mid March to 31 July 2017 . &quot;
&quot; eight@@ y percent ( 2002 ) were rated as 18 or older , whereas in another 25 cases the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency divided that the person may be 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; in 432 cases , the conclusion that the person is under 18 years old . &quot;
tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is ques@@ tioned .
&quot; according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency , the results are resistant in recent months . &quot;
&quot; we do not see a big difference in statistics of the past months , the numbers are quite constant , &quot; he said the magazine The Local . &quot;
&quot; the high proportion of cases in which the person has been judged as over 18 years , does not necessarily signi@@ fy that the asylum seekers has to be over his age . &quot;
&quot; in May , the agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there are 442 cases that the &quot; propose person 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bl@@ a@@ det the 581 published results , it turned that in 243 cases the person had been openly said that she will be in this year 18 years old . &quot;
&quot; the method of medical age assessment , in the x @-@ rays of wisdom and M@@ RT @-@ recordings can be analysed , which are then analyzed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , was also cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed in some fields . &quot;
&quot; a scep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ inska Institute , whose work encomp@@ asses the assessment of the biological maturity of men to see if they went earlier or later than usually through pu@@ ber@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t believe that the type of measurement should be used . &quot;
assess the biological age in this way is very insec@@ ure .
&quot; if we cannot say it safe , we should not do as if we could do it , &quot; said the newspaper Metro . &quot;
&quot; Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency defended however the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk to assess a child as an adult is low . &quot;
&quot; the biggest risk is in it , if the person is under 18 , in this case this is about 10 per cent . &quot;
fully in plan
the work on the three bridges of the Land@@ straße 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are well ahead .
&quot; on Wednesday , there was a seven ton of heavy fraud on the bridge on the eastern outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; we are very good at the time , it runs super , &quot; &quot; says Rein@@ hold L@@ eicht , building leaders at the Department of Street and Transport in the Camp@@ dium Freiburg . &quot;
in April the works began at all three san@@ itation bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the building is scheduled for October and is sure that the schedule will be respected .
&quot; the first bridge , from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads across the tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; it is a v@@ aul@@ ted bridge from concrete , which is dres@@ sed with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4,@@ 80 meters . &quot;
it was built in 1900 .
&quot; as the two other bridges also , she has now come into the years . &quot;
&quot; to guarantee the stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly sandy . &quot;
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built in red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were erected in 1939 and are twelve and about 60 meters long .
the bridge on the outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach near Lau@@ ter@@ bach has now received a 1,30 meter wide and seven tons of heavy so called bridge fl@@ ap .
&quot; this is a random , which is also used as an operating path . &quot;
on the southern part of the bridge a 2.@@ 20 meters wide brow@@ s are used .
on this then the pedestrian path should go .
&quot; the special thing is that it is about manufacturing , a patent from Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ en@@ o . &quot;
the other two bridges are already provided with the patented distill@@ eries .
particular f@@ inger@@ tips has the failure of lines caused by the construction work in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; because there is also a glass table , connected to which many companies are connected . &quot;
residents were informed in advance of the work by hand@@ outs over the project .
&quot; in addition , initially fish and canc@@ ers had to be de@@ ed off . &quot;
&quot; for the bridges between the building building and the collective , towards Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is regulated by a traffic lights . &quot;
&quot; for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bacher local entrance , the street in the area of the bridge at the height of the Hotel &quot; &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; are fully locked . &quot;
the cost of the three parti@@ tions are between 700 000 Euro .
the whole is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ under Prot@@ est at German pot@@ ato
&quot; it does not appear so frequently that parties involved in a strand , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , what else is difficult to bring under a hat . &quot;
&quot; the political @-@ day can@@ ei@@ fel representatives ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , Left ) belong to a broad alliance that shows that day peaceful flag , because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle Ron@@ dell into the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle Ron@@ dell for the &quot; &quot; large elect@@ or@@ acle &quot; &quot; invites you . &quot;
&quot; and known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , together with Alexander Gau@@ land the peak du@@ o for the Bundestag on 24 September , and the Deputy Chairman of the Beatri@@ x of Stor@@ k . &quot;
&quot; but those who are on site already at the beginning of the event , do not want to listen to the Af@@ D collectors , but demonstrate . &quot;
the motto &quot; The Ei@@ fel remains colourful . &quot;
&quot; originally the town @-@ picnic was planned under the motto &quot; &quot; All at a table &quot; &quot; on the fountain location , but now finds it on the parking lot below the Ron@@ d@@ ells - and thus directly in front of the eyes who come to the Af@@ ales event in the Stadthalle . &quot;
a colorful picture that has to offer .
&quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chair of the Forum A world and one of the relevant organizers , really happy : &quot; great , how many people have come together here . &quot;
&quot; there are music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; German pot@@ ato al@@ at that could also eat the Af@@ D without any problem , &quot; says the woman who brought him . &quot;
&quot; the police have be@@ aten many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence mainly at the train station , which is only a few meters away from the venues . &quot;
how did the Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes on the Af@@ D volcano ei@@ fel reports he tried to make such an event and receive the supplement .
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ ol@@ ds from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf initially had asked at the thum@@ b , but there was a cancellation because of the already built @-@ in Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ onal kir@@ mes is not enough parking available . &quot;
&quot; so the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ pes is pleased that we can have such a nice event here . &quot;
&quot; with a view of the event on the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ platz , he says : &quot; this is the good right of the people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
&quot; this also does it : against 20 o &apos;clock , on the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ a band , there is a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle various speakers , including the rh@@ ine @-@ el@@ ic Af@@ D leader Uwe Young . &quot;
&quot; in the hall are about 200 list@@ eners , which are waiting for the high @-@ quality assurance for the Bundestag , Alice Wei@@ del , and the Deputy Chairman of the Beatri@@ x of Stor@@ k hold their speeches . &quot;
&quot; the police presence , but so far the police had a quiet evening . &quot;
&quot; little more than an hour takes the Af@@ D event , the guests on the ground floor have a longer breath , but also there is shortly after 21 o &apos;clock Au@@ fr@@ aming . &quot;
the police can push the police - no special requirement .

both sol@@ o@@ ists are winner and winner of numerous international competitions and have sol@@ opo@@ si@@ tions in European top orch@@ est@@ ras .
thus Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter at the prestigious Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic Bell@@ i is the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
&quot; both combines the desire to cross not only the limits on their instruments , but also the limits of various gen@@ res . &quot;
&quot; Johann Sebastian Bach with the two like in a new mant@@ le , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; world music &quot; combines itself with Bulgarian fol@@ klore , and in the piece of &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the J@@ azz@@ ech@@ op@@ rei@@ er N@@ ils W@@ ogra@@ m , mix in classical , jazz and free games to a fascinating overall art work . &quot;
this core of the program was first performed in Freiburg with huge success in Freiburg .

Kri@@ sten Stew@@ art speaks about their bis@@ ex@@ ual
&quot; some people love gri@@ lled cheese , and will eat it until the end of her life . &quot;
&quot; but I want to try out everything , so Kri@@ sten st@@ ew@@ art quite openly about their bis@@ ex@@ ual . &quot;
&quot; when I went to gri@@ lled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what comes as next ? &apos; . &quot;
the most well known relation of the Holl@@ y@@ wood@@ stars was to her &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; colleagues Robert Patt@@ inson who ultimately looked bitter .
&quot; despite all the insured the Br@@ ün@@ ette of Dar@@ stell@@ ress towards the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s B@@ az@@ aar &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; I was in everyone who loves I am . &quot;
&quot; or do you believe about , I would have played it ? &quot;
&quot; after their separation gave war@@ es to that they were bis@@ ex@@ ual , &quot; &quot; I have always lived and seriously believed in du@@ alism . &quot;
so it has never been confused or hin@@ dered .
I just liked it to be taken seriously .
&quot; especially among them , they suffered according to &quot; &quot; Bang Show@@ biz &quot; &quot; but in the school period as they prefer as a bu@@ b dress : &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot;
that really has been very wo@@ unded .
&quot; when I was eleven I told me the children , I would look like a bow . &quot;
I really felt attacked me attacked and embarrass@@ ed .
&quot; well , I look back and think I am &apos; girls , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot;
&quot; in particular the public , they don &apos;t like to live their love : &quot; people expect you to give you a certain way , and anno@@ yed me . &quot;
&quot; and maybe they describe me some as un@@ think@@ able , but I don &apos;t like to justify me before all the public . &quot;
the Govern@@ or of West Virginia announces that he changes the Party
&quot; the democratic Govern@@ or of West Virginia , J@@ im Justice , announced Thurs@@ days with a manifestation with President Tru@@ mp that he will change the party . &quot;
&quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; said Govern@@ or Justice . &quot;
&quot; today , I will tell you many prayers and a lot of after@@ thinking ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia , I can no longer help if I am a democratic govern@@ or . &quot;
the manifestation broke in ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the re@@ public@@ ans , &quot; added Justice . &quot;
&quot; as a coach I would say that it is time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp previously spoke a great announcement at the West Virginia Rallye .
Mr. Tru@@ mp won West Virginia with 42 points and Justice have not endor@@ sed the democratic candidate Hill@@ ary Clinton .
&quot; Justice , which is according to For@@ bes of the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state was chosen , 2016 . &quot;
&quot; For@@ bes , that he owns a carbon@@ ic in five states , and inher@@ ited from his father a carbon business . &quot;
he is worth $ 1,@@ 59 billion . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile the re@@ publi@@ can committee held on Thursday night , in which it said , &quot; the Party change of Govern@@ or Justice is another blow to a Democratic party that would lead us rather than to work in order to make our country back great . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 Govern@@ ments and control of the least legal entities in history , the announcement of Govern@@ or Justice is only the last rejection of a party that is from top to bottom without leadership and is not able to find a positive , a positive message , &quot; said the R@@ NC @-@ president R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the CB@@ S News . &quot;
Co@@ e pra@@ ises &quot; Russian explor@@ ations for doping @-@ sc@@ andal
&quot; the global leader of the athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised am Thursday , which he referred to as an open dism@@ iss@@ al from Russia to a doping sc@@ andal , but he repeated it is not the moment for the country to return to sport . &quot;
Russian athle@@ tics Chef D@@ mit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ akh@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF congress at the eve of the athle@@ tics World Championships that the exile of his country was correct and that he decided to fight intelligence .
&quot; he said to him sorry for &quot; all athletes , those in competitions of gold - and silver med@@ als were swe@@ pt away . &quot;
&quot; despite his comments the IA@@ AF Congress for the maintenance of the verse , which was negotiated in November 2015 , after a report of the world anti @-@ intelligence agency ( WA@@ DA ) was found on stat@@ ely sponsored intelligence in Russia . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was a very open answer , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF @-@ President Co@@ e the re@@ porters . &quot;
the entire Council and the entire congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has been aware that she has experienced quite a hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed .
&quot; Co@@ e said , he is also pleased that Russia accept the criteria for his re@@ launch . &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress has been made , but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
we have to do everything in the next months to norm@@ alize this situation .
&quot; the principle of principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the ver@@ spoiled system , &quot; he added
&quot; nin@@ et@@ een Russian athletes will start at the athle@@ tics World Championships , which begin on Friday in London , according to the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral actors . &quot;
&quot; the leader of the IA@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia still meet some of the criteria for a re@@ setting . &quot;
&quot; Dro@@ gent@@ ests are still insufficient and banned Trainer still , he said Re@@ por@@ ters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot;

&quot; but he is also of high importance &quot; for a country , from which we are only separated by two states , &quot; &quot; said . &quot;

Prinz Hen@@ rik wants no grave next to his wife
&quot; the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prinz Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , wants to be best@@ owed upon his death not next to his wife . &quot;
this shared the Royal House on Thursday with .
&quot; traditionally , the Danish Royal Palace is set in the Dom@@ church of Ros@@ kil@@ de . &quot;
the sculp@@ tor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ gaard made already a sar@@ cop@@ ha@@ g for both the two .
&quot; the queen was agreed with the decision of their man , it was further in message . &quot;
where prince Hen@@ rik buried , be still un@@ clear . &quot;
but he did not have the intention of being put in his French home .
prince Hen@@ rik never had a s@@ meal that he was not happy with his title .
&quot; after the throne of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would be fond of king . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 he went to retirement , and also places the title &quot; &quot; prin@@ c@@ um &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; since Hen@@ rik in Denmark did not get the title and the function he didn &apos;t see himself against his wife - even after death , said L@@ ene Ball@@ eby , the executive director of the Danish Royal house . &quot;
&quot; where the last retirement of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old is ultimately , be un@@ clear . &quot;
&quot; but he did not have the intention of being put in his French home , but in Denmark . &quot;
he likes the land for which he has worked for the past 50 years .

on the Thames he worked in the French embassy .
&quot; during his later woman the sympath@@ ies of the people always fled , prince Hen@@ rik in his barely 50 years of reign with the Dan@@ es had a heavy stand . &quot;
&quot; in a car photography , Hen@@ rik over the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival was everything I did cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; my Danish was pregnant , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk bu@@ cks instead of Stri@@ ck@@ so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Vol@@ vo , tennis instead of football . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises that I ro@@ de instead of Virginia @-@ tobacco , and which had the reputation among the reputation to be the brand soci@@ alization intellectual intellec@@ tu@@ als , I could not hope to see . &quot;
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with that position and not to be ash@@ amed .
these were just two errors ! &quot;
Prime Minister W@@ eil wants swift re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP against possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; Nieder@@ sach@@ sens Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) is after losing red green majority for a rapid re @-@ election of the country , but he does not want . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; because she spoke on Friday for the resolution of the parliament . &quot;
&quot; previously , the surprise of a Green Members had thrown out of a Green Members of the Prime Minister of Prime Minister of Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SD@@ P ) into a severe crisis . &quot;
five months before the official date of the Sunday election the red @-@ green coalition in Hannover will enable its scar@@ ce majority vote in the Parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the previous Gre@@ ens of El@@ ke D@@ raft laid its step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the election 2018 in their elect@@ or@@ ship in Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ rit@@ me ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; stated on Friday in Hannover . &quot;
CD@@ U @-@ Leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ur@@ ler wants to recommend to his faction to record them .
&quot; thus , CD@@ U and F@@ DP have had 69 seats in low @-@ Sax@@ on Land@@ tag , SPD and Green 68 seats . &quot;
so far the relationship was vice versa .
the new country will be elected in the 14th of January next year .
&quot; Th@@ ur@@ ler said , the red @-@ green provincial government must now decide whether in this situation can be governed by no majority . &quot;
&quot; however , Stephan W@@ eil holds , however , is indispensable for an indispensable that the country decides as quickly as possible its self @-@ resolution . &quot;
the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on Tuesday through its further procedure .
&quot; the state of affairs also sees the possibility that the country &apos;s day is paid to the prime minister , and choose a successor . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; our constitution offers several options . &quot;
&quot; these possibilities must be legally clean , &quot; said Th@@ ur@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; you will discuss all questions in peace , if they are legally reasonable . &quot;
Th@@ ur@@ ler called T@@ west@@ ens step &quot; but something k@@ uri@@ os . &quot;
the politicians themselves stressed : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
it proved to be a trailer of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called for the disp@@ en@@ ish member of the return of their country day to return .
&quot; we of course assume that they received her land @-@ day , which gives them over the green state list , with immediate effect , participating in the CEO Met@@ a J@@ ans@@ sen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; the Leader of the Green Anja P@@ iel said : &quot; &quot; we depl@@ ore the decision of El@@ ke T@@ iny extra@@ ordin@@ arily . &quot;
they have deliber@@ ately decided to lead no pron@@ unci@@ ation in the group .
&quot; also in the background that there was no contents of any differences , we cannot compreh@@ end this step . &quot;
SPD @-@ anc@@ ellor Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the convic@@ tions of the Angl@@ o @-@ Sax@@ on Green Valley El@@ ke @-@ west to CD@@ U as bet@@ ray@@ al .
&quot; the behaviour of former Gre@@ ens in Lower Saxony is not only bet@@ ray@@ al to the constitu@@ ents and constitu@@ ents , but also bet@@ ray@@ al in red @-@ green , &quot; wrote the German leader of the Socialists and Democrats on Friday on fac@@ ebook . &quot;
&quot; he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) , which can quickly select the country &apos;s day . &quot;
the res@@ ign@@ ing T@@ west@@ ens costs Red @-@ Green in Lower Saxony .
&quot; the policy of policy &quot; in their last emancipation , and in her fr@@ ying their personal interests before the good of the country , &quot; cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed SPD @-@ Secretary @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus salvation . &quot;
&quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony will take this dirty game , and attempts to beat out of political capital . &quot;
Nieder@@ sach@@ sens CD@@ U @-@ Group Leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ur@@ ler wants to recommend his MEPs to resume El@@ ke T@@ ine to the CD@@ U .
&quot; the Leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , threw T@@ ests in front of , with personal career the result of the country @-@ day election in 2013 . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U was at that time before the SPD &apos;s greatest power , SPD and Green had a hau@@ ght@@ y majority of one voice . &quot;
&quot; agricultural ministers in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from gyp@@ sy , Mr. Schmidt ? &quot;
Germany discusses about secondary eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect consumers .
agricultural Minister Christian Schmidt ( C@@ SU ) is in the interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
Mr. Schmidt - How can the consumer protect against po@@ ison ?
I can only encourage users to view consumers and consumers to look at the eggs in your fridge and check the stress pressure .
on the consumer portal www.@@ food@@ war@@ n@@ .de the states represent the latest information on the Eg@@ g batch .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; even if in all we know , a health haz@@ ard is practically excluded . &quot;
&quot; now , Al@@ di is taking over the best possible crisis action - all eggs get out of the offer - because the central role of the awareness of the Federal Minister of Minister is not really perceived ? &quot;
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
&quot; despite this , my house has immediately switched on , and there is a contro@@ versi@@ al of Germany in close cooperation with the authorities of the countries . &quot;
all information and the risk assessment are available for consumers .
trade has just as well as the manufacturers to ensure that the products sold products are far and health@@ ful .
&quot; if at eggs of the resi@@ dual content of 0,@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is crossed , these are not traffic . &quot;
un@@ loaded eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time not the companies blame .
are production companies and consumers in the same boat ?
&quot; according to the high level of knowledge , the production plants meets no immediate fault . &quot;
&quot; rather , they must count on illeg@@ ally illegal practices of service companies with economic damage . &quot;
as always there are too few cont@@ rol@@ ure too little .
lacks it only on the personnel or also on the car@@ es@@ tial jurisdiction ?
&quot; however , there were just the official controls that have revealed the process . &quot;
&quot; however , the truth is also heard that food fraud and criminal energy cannot be ruled up to 100 percent . &quot;
&quot; therefore , a consistent clarification of such events and the commit to public prosec@@ ut@@ ances in the cases where criminal off@@ ences can occur , of crucial importance . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have already seen several times , that I expect a complete declaration by the responsible authorities . &quot;
is the regular al@@ ar@@ ism at food sk@@ and@@ als really necessary ?
consumers and consumers have the right to get exclusively secure and beneficial food .
&quot; if a non @-@ approved ins@@ ecti@@ cide in the food sector is used , consumers and consumers are rightly emp@@ ow@@ ered . &quot;
&quot; by the pan@@ ed means , manufacturers , retailers and consumers come into a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
&quot; basically , it must be clear : the illegal use of ins@@ ecti@@ cide fe@@ le@@ il in the attitude of food delivery animals is not acceptable and must be stopped immediately . &quot;
it has to be consistent with high pressure on all levels and high pressure .
&quot; I expect from all competent authorities , that the atomic fact is fast and complete . &quot;
how to impact the financial rules of football on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Moving to Paris
&quot; the rules , which aim to prevent enormous issues of European football , will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Wel@@ tre@@ k@@ ord transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain . &quot;
any consequences will be made for Paris Saint @-@ Germain from U@@ EF@@ A because the conduc@@ tive organisation that monitors the European game has the power to offer cre@@ ws from the access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
&quot; financial fair play rules , which were called by U@@ EF@@ A to life , mean that PS@@ G eventually has to show that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without great losses . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million $ ) to buy the Brazilian from his contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will be several ten million dollars a year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Moving to France .
&quot; PS@@ G can bring the money to loose the money so that N@@ ey@@ mar under@@ writes and bring him into a galax@@ y of other stars , given the funding of the team by the energy of the rich ruler of Qatar . &quot;
&quot; one may address a lot of money for the acquisition of players , but they must include legitimate sources , which enable them to serve the Bre@@ ak E@@ ven point in her on the football @-@ related business . &quot;
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after its election to the U@@ EF@@ A President in 2007 .
&quot; the former French player believed that an who had taken enormous debt in their quest for success , effectively decei@@ ve and ris@@ ky to ruin , if banks or owners have returned their support . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P moved from concentration on the debts of the clubs to monitor their losses . &quot;
&quot; the change meant that the business model , the novel Abr@@ amo@@ is originally used in Chelsea in Chelsea - a club with potential and then fully invested to build the team and build a global brand - to become a harder matter . &quot;
&quot; during the current three @-@ year @-@ year period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses in the amount of 30 million euros . &quot;
&quot; and although Plat@@ ini 2015 has fallen from the presidency in Un@@ gn@@ ade , its U@@ EF@@ A @-@ successor Alek@@ s@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ in continues to cut down from excessive spending . &quot;
&quot; certainly FF@@ P is not dead and we will reinforce the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the U@@ EF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press during the last week . &quot;
&quot; although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a package , it can distribute the amount of invo@@ icing on the duration of its contract . &quot;
N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract for the next five years in the amount of 44@@ ,@@ 4 million in the annual financial statements .
&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has reached the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions . &quot;
&quot; the PS@@ G was reduced in a budget of 60 million euros ( then 82 million dollars ) , which later rose to 20 million euros , and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players . &quot;
&quot; U@@ EF@@ A is searching for clubs , who could try to over@@ see their financial supervision by connecting their revenue by companies that are connected to the owners of a club . &quot;
&quot; as a Catalan company the PS@@ G spon@@ ge , if the value of the sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , the U@@ EF@@ A would not apply this as legitimate income . &quot;
this happened in 2014 when the U@@ EF@@ A decided that the value of the sponsor@@ ing of the P@@ SA was created by Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come about payments of the organizational Committee of the World Cup 2022 in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 pro@@ gres@@ sed that N@@ ey@@ mar World amb@@ ass@@ adors will simply be out and a such man@@ eu@@ ver for the U@@ EF@@ A regul@@ ators will be easy to find out .
&quot; the existing sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the U@@ EF@@ A will remain attentive , every attempt to consider the rules . &quot;
&quot; U@@ EF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G about N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , sag@@ ging on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation . &quot;
they said under the condition of an@@ onym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press since they were not authorized to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
&quot; the latest published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 has achieved a profit of EUR 54@@ 2.@@ 4 million , which has achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros . &quot;
the accounts for the last fiscal year must be published .
PS@@ G expects that N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrived a blessing for sponsor@@ ing De@@ als , mer@@ chan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ kot@@ ar . &quot;
the association goes from that the sales increase by at least 30 per cent .
&quot; the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated , one of the best soccer players go to see , and tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s to prevent st@@ oned that PS@@ G the FF@@ P would hurt . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; financial intelligence &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the President of the La Liga , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily newspaper AS in terms of the final owner of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; ar@@ sen@@ al @-@ Manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that financed an association . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of the owner , and this has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; it is very difficult to respect the Financial Fair@@ play , because you have different ways or have different interests when a country has such a great actor in order to represent a country . &quot;

&quot; his brother Christoph , Olympi@@ asi@@ eger from 2016 , was failed in the national World Cup and could only look at the flo@@ ppy competition just from the tri@@ bun@@ es . &quot;
&quot; also with the first attempt qualified in the Polish title defense Pi@@ ot@@ r Mal@@ ach@@ owski , the 6@@ 5.@@ 13 meter far threw , for the final battle . &quot;
no@@ stal@@ gia goes into &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
&quot; this re@@ petition of history is at the same time no@@ stal@@ gic because of the smooth days of characters of the 80 @-@ year @-@ gr@@ unge for M@@ TV , and for itself - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , such as Elizabeth Banks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Rud@@ d went to larger things . &quot;
as a cultural Ar@@ te@@ f@@ act it is equally a par@@ ody and an em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era permanent memories .
but as fran@@ chise it feels like the time was tight .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; worked surprisingly good , not only because of its absurd human rights ( it contained an original story for an speaking c@@ ose vegetables , which was spoken by H. J@@ on Benjamin ) . &quot;
&quot; by playing on the core of the G@@ ags - actor of middle aged children , they will still be able to re@@ lie@@ ve the in@@ possibility of winning the last part of the weather . &quot;
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults who now play adults is less emotion@@ ally engra@@ ined and its par@@ ody goes more according to the lad@@ ker &apos;s films of the 90 @-@ er years like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the Cra@@ dle &quot; ( &quot; The hand , which is the cradle &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; on one point , a character through an Apple @-@ Power@@ Book , some In@@ line sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
&quot; the gr@@ acious C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ age ) , now Roman@@ aut@@ or , has K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) still not forgotten . &quot;
Victor ( K@@ en Marino ) has still not lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
&quot; and there is another crazy P@@ lot , included in the Ron@@ ald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Show@@ age ) , which is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well successful impression of Michael Ian Black ) . &quot;
how always are the rates of the best part of fran@@ chise .
&quot; it is especially fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Rud@@ d , the Mat@@ t D@@ illons sub@@ li@@ ppen@@ bart by &quot; sing@@ les &quot; shows , whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy is now like an old K@@ nack@@ er . &quot;
&quot; there are the moments of accidental wound , which could be this fran@@ chise , like a sort of repeated &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series , until he achieved what I will show as his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ ET Hot American Summer : &quot; &quot; W@@ ET L@@ ater &quot; , &quot; whose last scene will show the gang of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon now reminds on a different kind of no@@ stal@@ gia : to the revival of the Cold War by &quot; The &quot; , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; &quot; and even on &quot; glow &quot; with its East @-@ against @-@ West Ring@@ kampf @-@ I@@ kon@@ ography . &quot;
&quot; the com@@ edy by Brian Gat@@ ewood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka created Com@@ edy with Rh@@ ys Thomas as director gives an awesome TV series with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Bucharest , which fight for truth , an@@ the@@ ism and the way of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; the main rollers - a hard lined Gregor and an ideological I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ si@@ c J@@ r@@ s. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alo@@ gues of Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a complete producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ ant will be syn@@ ced in English . &quot;
it is a geni@@ us idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
&quot; there are some nice walking trails for viewing ( the police spends the time to watch chess on TV , how Americans are doing it with football ) . &quot;
&quot; and the list of famous speakers - including Jenn@@ y S@@ late , N@@ ick off@@ erman , Mah@@ ersh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent game of &quot; fin@@ de &quot; &quot; voice . &quot;
&quot; but &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; is involved so much for the tru@@ thful propaganda of a doubt propaganda - a mur@@ derer who carries a Re@@ agan mask is included , that it is often like a single one . &quot;
&quot; at six long episodes , it is about , and the com@@ edy is not fast or frequently enough . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; , who has risen to a lower length , since Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef repeatedly deliver the American message , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who merge a p@@ ile of Hamburg . &quot;
the message for the imag@@ inary communist audience is that Western culture can make everything for food for money .
the fic@@ tional Romanian Maker not wrong : we even make it with our own younger history and with ih@@ ood .
blow against Dru@@ m@@ af@@ ia in the country
the police have succeeded in a blow against the Italian Maf@@ ia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; at the mid@@ och@@ et @-@ B@@ aar district , in Rot@@ tw@@ ald @-@ B@@ aar district , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Kon@@ stanz , Trade and Stuttgart , numerous objects are looking for as the prosec@@ ut@@ or con@@ stan@@ cy on Friday . &quot;
&quot; during the age of 25 , 15 sec@@ ul@@ aged between the ages of 25 and 77 were arrested and exp@@ elled against them . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the officials asked greater quantities of mari@@ ju@@ ana and Kok@@ ain , sc@@ iss@@ ors , as well as several hundred thousand Euros . &quot;
at the same raid in Italy two people were arrested .
against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans there were German arrest .
the two are therefore probably delivered to Germany .
at the action we were involved in the Italian and Bay@@ erische Er@@ ker .
&quot; overall , more than 300 polic@@ emen were in use . &quot;
&quot; the members of the Maf@@ ia will organised crime crimin@@ ality , heavy violence , attemp@@ ted murder , as well as rob@@ ber@@ y and ext@@ or@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; since summer 2016 , the prosec@@ ut@@ or of the Con@@ stance against organised drug wholesale in the southern German space . &quot;
&quot; between the prosec@@ ut@@ ances in Con@@ stance and Palermo , a lively exchange and the investig@@ ator of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had almost daily contact with their colleagues on Sicily . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the grandfather was accompanied by four officials from Palermo , too . &quot;
into the vision of the studies above all Italian nation@@ als with closer related to the Italian Maf@@ ia .
&quot; also an incident on 27 May in stro@@ kes , when early in the morning several shots were thrown into a guest house , is likely to go to the bank account . &quot;
thus the large gaps in the foreig@@ ner @-@ Register
data from citizens who should not arise : a report reveals the foreig@@ ner Register in Germany considerable short@@ com@@ ings .
the lead to partly serious mis@@ decisions in asylum procedures .
&quot; the respon@@ dents for the refuge@@ e management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen way , has made a media report according to large gaps in the country @-@ central register . &quot;
&quot; defects within the registered data could result in asylum procedures and deport@@ ations , &quot; war@@ ned way in an analysis that the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the register , there are estimated ten million people in foreign nation@@ als , including 5,@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU states . &quot;
the data will be managed by approximately 600 individual country authorities in Germany .
&quot; because the data had not been sufficiently well maintained , the data quality in parts did not have been well . &quot;
&quot; in individual cases , data from 1921 have been found , &quot; by people who have long been no longer in life , or of citizens who have become the German citizen , and actually no longer arise in the register . &quot;
&quot; faul@@ ty data entry allows revers@@ al processes greatly slow , it is the result of the report . &quot;
&quot; in statistics about economic people , this EU citizens who would not have to do not want to travel . &quot;
&quot; however , such false statements led , but &quot; to a distor@@ ted debate on how to deal with an entry , it is therefore in the analysis . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the federal government has obviously begun to return to refuge@@ e families with under 16 @-@ year @-@ old children , when they travelled from there . &quot;
&quot; this brings out of an internal paper of the Federal Minister for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BAM@@ F ) , reports the &quot; Neue O@@ sn@@ ab@@ backward Zeitung &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to the paper it is therefore , the BAM@@ F leader such procedures for families with children - except for inf@@ ants and small children - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; since the end of 2014 , this was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper under reference to the difficult situation on site . &quot;
&quot; following the Dublin agreement , the EU state is responsible for refugees from the EU state . &quot;
&quot; if a mig@@ rant enters into another EU country , this state can withdraw him into the entry @-@ country . &quot;
&quot; to reason@@ ing the Office now : &quot; &quot; meanwhile the recording capacity for families with min@@ der@@ age children in Italy increased substantially . &quot;
Italy submitted for admission and accommodation for families warran@@ ties .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( E@@ GM@@ R ) keep these commitments for adequate .
&quot; also , other EU states would withdraw to refugees in the framework of Dublin agreement . &quot;
&quot; the internal political consultations in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed this decision : &quot; families with children threat@@ ens because of the defic@@ ien@@ cies in the Italian asylum system , un@@ law@@ ful conditions and a haz@@ ard of the Kind@@ es@@ kin . &quot;
1 @-@ wide result obtained
&quot; a total of 220 litres of blood from in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach living people , the blood is already available for other people . &quot;

&quot; this year we achieved with 114 sp@@ en@@ ders the second best result , &quot; said the DR@@ C . &quot;

Bank of England will keep interest rates of 0.@@ 25 %
&quot; the Bank of England will probably be announced later that the interest rates remain unchanged , after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation led the spec@@ ulation about a rise . &quot;
&quot; the Bank of England has war@@ ned that economic growth &quot; &quot; will remain &quot; &quot; to keep the interest rates on family income in the midst of an intensi@@ fying pressure . &quot;
&quot; the policy makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the bank voted with 6 to 2 , the interest rates on 0.@@ 25 % , whereas in this month fewer members increase an increase in increasing growth since the weak economic growth . &quot;
&quot; in their fourth quarter annual report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1,@@ 7 % and for 2018 in 1.6 % and war@@ ned that the pressure on the budget would probably still be expected to rise to barely 3 % . &quot;
&quot; but they sign@@ alized that in the next few years , Z@@ inser@@ tion would be necessary to grow the inflation led by Bre@@ x@@ it and said that the l@@ ending costs may be expected more than expected on the financial markets . &quot;
&quot; the members also voted to withdraw part of the Mam@@ mut economic package , which was published before a year after Bre@@ x@@ it . &quot;
&quot; it will call for the financing plan to provide the financial support for banks from the upcoming February cheap financial means , although it is expected to provide 15 billion pounds more in the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds . &quot;
&quot; minutes after deciding on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak , since the pressure on the real income of households continue to continue the consumption . &quot;
&quot; due to the interest of interest they re@@ peti@@ tive that &quot; &quot; a certain criminal off@@ ense of monetary policy &quot; for cooling of inflation and a &quot; slightly greater &quot; scale would be necessary than the markets expect . &quot;
the markets are predic@@ ted for the first rise in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; the Bank stressed , however , that increases &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; and &quot; limited &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the growth forecasts of the Bank for this and next year are forecast compared to the 1,@@ 9 % and 1,@@ 7 % compared to the previous year . &quot;
it has retained its growth forecast to 1.8 percent in 2018 .
the pound fell upon these messages compared to the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % on 1.@@ 31 US dollar and fell by 0.3 % to 1.@@ 11 Euro .
the decision to no change comes after the recent dis@@ appointing growth rates en@@ forced the increasing expectations on a tick height and increased GDP in the second quarter of 0.7 % in the preceding three months to 0.3 % .
growth is expected to recover in the third quarter at 0.@@ 3 % even though it is easy to recover after the bank at the end of the year .
&quot; the most recent in@@ fl@@ ation@@ Report offered little enthusiasm for households , which will be affected by an increasing inflation and slightly different housing heights , as the tight@@ ening first is even worse before it becomes better . &quot;
&quot; it added that monetary policy in the next few years can not prevent &quot; &quot; prevent &quot; , &quot; but it added that wages would be clear to the end of their three @-@ year forecast . &quot;
&quot; the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is attribut@@ able to the weak pound of what is a part of the lower consumption fees . &quot;
&quot; the decision will come a year after lower@@ ing interest rates on 0.@@ 25 % in the last August after the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the t@@ ink of the dog . &quot;
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until the prices and the economy will be fully accessible .
&quot; before the last judgement of the Bank to interest rates , the reputation was increased upon a rate of wrath , since inflation led the pressure on hard @-@ sitting budgets , whereby three political decision makers in July a rise to 0,5 % demanded . &quot;
&quot; inflation has declined in the last month of 2,@@ 9 % in June to 2.@@ 6 % , although the Bank said that this was expected and will be moved in the coming months . &quot;
the Bank said to write the transition in proportion to their target of 2 % be &quot; &quot; very &quot; &quot; to the weak pound . &quot;
&quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director at Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; &quot; given the short@@ coming back of the S@@ wap bodies market , the credit card is likely to seek more competitive , as the l@@ essor would like to seek business and end the year in a positive way . &quot;
&quot; the market looks especially good for those who run the existing de@@ als and complete the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with extra @-@ free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( The National Health Service ) is to be disp@@ uted with contro@@ versi@@ al HIV drug for 10,000 people
patients will receive funding from September after a struggle in front of the High Court against financing the drug in N@@ HS access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment .
&quot; N@@ HS England announced that a proph@@ yla@@ xis proph@@ yla@@ xis should be reduced by around 86 percent prior to sexual intercourse risk , now by health service over a first three @-@ year student for estimated 10,000 people . &quot;
&quot; he explained ready to finance the process after the Ap@@ pe@@ al Court had confirmed a judgement of the Supreme Court of Justice , that the N@@ HS had confirmed the authority , for the Pr@@ EP despite the asser@@ tion that local authorities should finance him . &quot;
&quot; the announced chess train was announced by N@@ HS England head of Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as &quot; important new intervention &quot; , &quot; during the National Aids Trust ( NA@@ T ) . &quot;
&quot; sexual health clinics in London , Bright@@ on , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield become the first belong to the first one who will follow the registration of people , and further clinics will follow in October 2018 before it will be introduced in England in April 2018 . &quot;
prevention proph@@ yla@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) is a consequence of HIV preparations to be taken before sex to reduce the risk of an HIV infection .
studies have shown that Pr@@ DP reduces HIV transmission with inf@@ ectious endangered endangered in Inf@@ ection .
suppose Pr@@ EP in front of intercourse means that just enough medicines are available in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection .
such drugs can be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse .
&quot; those who come for treatment in question , include gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , Trans@@ sexual and persons with HIV @-@ positive partners who have not been treated successfully . &quot;
&quot; in clinics are identified most participants who agree with the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known as an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment . &quot;
people who live in England and register with a medical specialist can also register for possible participation in their local participating sexual clinic .
the program will receive £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract for the supply of drugs during this week after an international competitive supply .
&quot; the study aims to assess the entire potential of Pr@@ EP by using clinical trials , as it is used in large scale , and implemented . &quot;
&quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; these great new intervention should supplement the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV supplement and transfer . &quot;
it is another milestone in the more than three decades lasting progress in addressing one of the biggest health challenges of humanity . &quot;
&quot; Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National Aids Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ EP , when it is targeted to vulnerable and dangerous people , the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; from September to people , people with high HIV risk have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded trial in England to develop a new instrument and is not subject to negotiating with a partner , which leads to improving many , many lives . &quot;
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; Ian Green , CEO of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority must now be carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one has left the risk for HIV . &quot;
&quot; now , since the Pr@@ EP test medicine was created , we are on the best way to protect more than 10.000 HIV @-@ infected persons . &quot;
&quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , shadow of Health , said : &quot; the beginning of the Pr@@ EP process is welcome and over@@ due to monthly implementation by the government and over@@ due . &quot;
the evidence demonstrate how transform@@ ative this drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and end the transfer of this life changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to the understanding of the benefits of Pr@@ EP .
&quot; it is important that this study is carried out as fast as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected with HIV , and that they will contribute to the termination of spreading HIV in society . &quot;
the great life live : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Ear@@ ls Court Apartment into a generous home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , smaller in 2014 from a large house in Kn@@ ight@@ s@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court Apartment . &quot;
&quot; it is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace , and it is a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed their bags and sold their bags . &quot;
&quot; before I lived with my ex in Kn@@ ight@@ s@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; says Jo@@ anne . &quot;
I sear@@ ched for something that was comparable to my price .
&quot; this apartment was shown in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ceilings . &quot;
I made myself in love and made an offer on this day . &quot;
&quot; since the first visit , the 1,000 square floor was completely over@@ hau@@ led by large apartment . &quot;
originally a one @-@ room @-@ property with a wast@@ ed layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add yo@@ anne and a mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot;
&quot; that was my requirement , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; to this end , she appro@@ vals the architectural design and design studio Duck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill that has 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home which was not only a development , but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; the ceiling was not large enough to place two spaces , so that the architectural challenge consisted in it to create a mezzanine where you could stand . &quot;
Er@@ fan had to be creative thinking about solving the pres@@ et .
&quot; the steel frame is quite complicated , &quot; he explains . &quot;
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were over@@ hau@@ led , without that we had to b@@ ate ourselves . &quot;
&quot; it was not just about building a simple platform , but to create the steel so that he had the right height for the function above or down . &quot;
&quot; this arrangement allowed there Er@@ fan , two rooms in full of height - with lots of extra drama . &quot;
&quot; for the mezzanine , a classic copper window looks down from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us over the gl@@ am@@ orous living area . &quot;
sung gold furniture , Silver acc@@ ents and V@@ intage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program . &quot;
&quot; the use of mir@@ rors plays a role when adding theater , space and light . &quot;
on both ends a short corridor is mir@@ r@@ ored to aband@@ on him longer .
the kitchen feels the mir@@ r@@ oring as a window into another room .
at the entrance we offer pi@@ red units place for all the bestsellers and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
&quot; due to the perception of a gl@@ am@@ orous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used . &quot;
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
special about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering , went into , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the stainless steel , vene@@ ered MD@@ F @-@ door . &quot;
&quot; it is important that it is , when you slide the door very easily , very easily . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the clever usage of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne was able to win additional 16 m ² , an extra bedroom and a improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the plot - or how your property is estimated , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ ment@@ ary form , a real estate bro@@ ker must enter and carry out a calculation based on the floor size . &quot;
&quot; here , they managed to enlarge the floor area and to use high quality materials that provide the room with its luxurious advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things that you touch and they can help create an emotional binding in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; you are not embarrass@@ ed you into the electrical outlet into the walls .
&quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can be converted by a good design and increased square met@@ ering of slightly standards even something completely amazing .
&quot; in fact , as Jo@@ anne you could decide to leave them not . &quot;
brothers are fighting for more than 500 million US dollars .
&quot; two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the Dyn@@ asty , in an examination because of one of the biggest real estate per@@ me@@ as in the value of more than 500 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; the former director of the Carl@@ ton @-@ Football @-@ Club &apos; and developers Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul . this led him to the Supreme Court of Justice , to clarify their property and their business assets . &quot;
&quot; Paul already wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp discussion of the separation takes place in the Supreme Court of Justice . &quot;
&quot; together with her mother Anna , brothers 38 Real Estate have collected the value of more than half a billion dollars , since then the family renovated 1973 a shop at Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood . &quot;
there the family West@@ co Je@@ ans and grew up to a chain of 160 retailers .
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
&quot; this money was invested in real estate and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis now comprises offices in the city centre , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and M@@ t Bul@@ ler as well as shopping m@@ alls in the suburbs . &quot;
&quot; after an agreement with her died father , Col@@ in - by Paul as &quot; main operators and the domin@@ ating personality &quot; in the family De Lu@@ tis - about two thirds of the enterprise , and Paul about one third . &quot;
a place of jurisdiction that this means that Col@@ in is owned by 316 million dollars and Paul in the value of 176 million dollars .
the division of real estate and cash has turned out for Paul as a tunnel .
&quot; the proposed by Col@@ in proposed departments have left him with the left what I held for the best objects , he wrote in a first Aff@@ id@@ av@@ it in 2015 . &quot;
on the last Friday after several failed plac@@ ements took place the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice .
&quot; brothers now also fight for control over the existing business - of which Col@@ in , as Paul claims that I have excluded . &quot;
&quot; ar@@ arg@@ um@@ ented , this is not true , but th@@ rows Paul before , some pos@@ sessions in@@ competent . &quot;
&quot; in an early monkey av@@ it that was filed by Col@@ in , he says he hope to present the dispute . &quot;
&quot; my Italian heritage writes , that the family is the most important priority , he wrote . &quot;
&quot; the costs are in the case , with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and charter K@@ eck C@@ ram@@ er , and with leading Law@@ yers , including All@@ an My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and of both sides of the law firms . &quot;
&quot; Ms. De Lu@@ tis and her husband husband Luigi were Italian immigrants , the milk bars and delic@@ acy stores from late 1950 @-@ er years and bought a business in Br@@ uns@@ wick . &quot;
&quot; they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property , at the Col@@ in the first Je@@ ans@@ ad of the family . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in says that he began West@@ co there , when he was in my last years of high school , when Paul was still a small child ( about ten years old ) . &quot;
&quot; Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hop@@ ed to pass their property to their children . &quot;
&quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted to land the brothers against judgment , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no more part of the De Lu@@ tis group , whereby Col@@ in claims that Mark paid the company 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; both Luke and Mark , so Paul &quot; said about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in has kept very back , although he was a former AF@@ L executive board and after an biography from 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of the television stars . &quot;
Fair@@ fax media participated in Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
&quot; only Col@@ in answered by SMS to say &quot; I can really say much , &quot; &quot; because the case before the courts is . &quot;
&quot; it is very very sad that my brother Paul decided to complain , and draw our family names through the courts , he wrote . &quot;
&quot; in mid 2016 Col@@ in , wrote Col@@ in in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother . &quot;
&quot; our Father couldn &apos;t know that Paul and I would end up in our current conflict , he said and added that he is still hoping for a solution . &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be past .
&quot; our matter will be solved in the near future of the courts , &quot; wrote Col@@ in . &quot;
Tru@@ m@@ ps new Stab@@ ili@@ ef is planning to restrict media ab@@ in@@ ence of the President .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do .
&quot; if so , he will be the first . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ tico reports that the new Stab@@ ili@@ ef of the White House plans to restrict the information flow to President Tru@@ mp - including reports of the news media , in hope to keep the boss on an even more moderate course . &quot;
here is a piece of Re@@ porter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; as John F. Kelly , the new Stab@@ ili@@ ef of the White House , put together in his first working day with leading employees , he set a main problem in President Donald Tru@@ m@@ ps White House which he wants to repair : poor information that put into the hands of the president . &quot;
Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in writing - because the President would make better decisions when he would receive good information .
&quot; Kell@@ ey diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to count Tru@@ mp by monitor his media . &quot;
&quot; President Tru@@ m@@ ps relationship with television extends back - and now , where he is in the White House , his TV show is still strong . &quot;
&quot; if candidate Tru@@ mp was angry because of an un@@ fair reporting it was productive to show him that he was a fair coverage of places that were to convince , &quot; said the former elect@@ oral advis@@ er Sam Nun@@ berg in February compared to Poli@@ tico . &quot;
&quot; Pol@@ ti@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; &quot; the key , Tru@@ m@@ ps Twitter @-@ habit among control , to ensure that his personal media consumption contains a clear praise price . &quot;
okay .
&quot; but the idea that tru@@ m@@ ps Twitter @-@ habit ever &quot; under control &quot; was ridicul@@ ous . &quot;
perhaps these struggles were aware of what we don &apos;t know - that Tru@@ m@@ ps T@@ we@@ ets would have had even more ig@@ nition without their intervention .
we will probably never experience something about the twe@@ et the Tru@@ mp has not sent .
&quot; if him have managed to keep him a few times , anger from him , then their efforts were worth it . &quot;
&quot; but no one has consistently prevent it , that Tru@@ mp contrasts . &quot;
&quot; a part of the problem is that people in a past@@ or house consists of competing parties , always try to advance their own agenda by providing Tru@@ mp material that might have their views from the world . &quot;
Poli@@ tico - very busy with this story - reported in May on the preferences of the consultant to continue the president for strategic reasons .
this was an example that was described by Re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former Tru@@ mp @-@ Beam@@ te say that Tru@@ mp can react to negative press sections , especially such with damaged Lec@@ tures and that he will find out to find out where they come from . &quot;
&quot; this happened at the end of February , when someone called the President b@@ ös@@ willing to printed a printed copy of a article by Got@@ new@@ .com , the website of the Internet @-@ Prov@@ oc@@ at@@ eurs Charles C. Johnson , called the source behind a p@@ ile to be of Lec@@ ks &quot; in the White House . &quot;
&quot; although Johnson &apos;s permanently banned from Twitter or that he has not offered a concrete evidence , or that he has expressed a concrete evidence in the past , and re@@ voke them in the past . &quot;
Tru@@ mp read the article and started to ask people about Wal@@ sh .
&quot; Gold@@ macher added that the dam@@ n St@@ ef Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage the pap@@ er@@ m and document the Tru@@ mp . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly tries three months later to do the same .
&quot; perhaps he will prove to be more effective Manager as a pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tru@@ mp is still its ultimate self , and his advis@@ ors still strive to influence . &quot;
these un@@ changeable factors make our mission very difficult .
Master sear@@ ched crimin@@ als get post by Euro@@ pol
&quot; since the address is unknown , the aid of the population will pray and shipped . &quot;
the police are ma@@ iled all over Europe in this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards on the escape .
&quot; as the addresses of the sear@@ ched @-@ bre@@ wing natur@@ es are not known , are hints of the population and pray . &quot;
&quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the action , which follows the &quot; &quot; EU Most W@@ anted &quot; &quot; Advent@@ ures of winter follows . &quot;
&quot; the experiences could have shown that many fle@@ eting on holiday destinations , it was called Euro@@ pol . &quot;
I have compiled 21 Post@@ cards for sear@@ ched from 21 EU countries .
&quot; since 2016 , there have been the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ ering , more than 2.5 million times it was viewed . &quot;
&quot; 36 of the online registr@@ ations could previously be arrested , at least eleven of them based on the publication on the website . &quot;
travellers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to &apos; milli@@ on@@ är@@ s @-@ Series &apos;
&quot; some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands stand again with some un@@ determined travellers on war , which have negotiated one of the municipality of zo@@ gen@@ dered dit@@ ch to re@@ claim a field in front of its man@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; the travelers have par@@ ked their 20 caravans on a field outside a prosper@@ ous road of Soli@@ h@@ ull , which is called &quot; milli@@ on@@ är@@ s &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they have horses , babies and an army of transportation , after they were raised only in May , without being det@@ er@@ ated by a advice from a council to prevent their accidents . &quot;
&quot; the tac@@ tical group found a gap in the defence systems , and strongly pushed their vehicles by a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way . &quot;
angry inhabitants have fallen the advice of Soli@@ h@@ ull that said it &apos; us@@ eless to deal with the problem .
an anonymous inhabitants said : &quot; they have been moved on the assembly day after they were sent to Bentley He@@ ath where they cast stones on the pas@@ sers .
&quot; the Council must act in action by means of putting into action , as he was us@@ eless when dealing with the problem . &quot;
the travellers were there in May where were moved and are now back again .
&quot; more yesterday evening yesterday evening , probably today more . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; &quot; the Council of Birmingham white , how to deal with it by going long to protect their parks . &quot;
&quot; I live without the Stre@@ ets@@ bro@@ ok Road and I am not happy to continue to pay my community , if the Council cannot stop it once . &quot;
&quot; a residents who wanted not to be called , said : &quot; it is ridicul@@ ous , we just have seen the last round of this trav@@ eller , just to be se@@ ated by another round . &quot;
this time the numbers have increased and you even saw a horse in the car park . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ person of the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull said : &quot; &quot; we are aware of a unauthorized camp on the country beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ bro@@ ok Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps so that they move as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; to support our quality collection , it is very important that as many inhabitants we report a anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police by pressing 101 . &quot;
&quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation where the judgment must be checked , when we present our case . &quot;
from Bir@@ ken@@ hof becomes Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Bir@@ ken@@ hof the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise will be .
&quot; the house before the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts , is currently being renovated and will be opened on the 1st of March next year . &quot;
these are good news for the city .
&quot; because with the closure of the hotel Bir@@ ken@@ hof , due to the dam@@ n @-@ setting environment , to 13 April 2014 , the time of around 30 000 nights was lost per year and also revenues generated by the tourist tax . &quot;
&quot; in the autumn of 2014 the dramatic rising figures of refugees , which came into the land , the hotel building is offered as a collective accommodation , which provided for contro@@ versi@@ al discussion . &quot;
the town prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers through the installation of a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not contro@@ versi@@ al at that time .
&quot; but above all Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts , Os@@ s@@ wald , Os@@ s@@ wald defended the hotel location , and spoke already at that time of harv@@ ested interests in the house . &quot;
he should retain law .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ otels with chair@@ men of Bir@@ g@@ it Sch@@ erer with seat in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern has acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ ken@@ hof during a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of the three @-@ star @-@ Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städter House four houses .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Man@@ al@@ b .
&quot; you hot Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; at the former Hotel Bir@@ ken@@ hof have been standing near the entrance , and when you enter the house , it becomes clear , what extensive renovation work will be made . &quot;
&quot; the so@@ ils have been demol@@ ished , ceilings partly built , old bath@@ tubs from the rooms . &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
until March there is still much to do .
&quot; it is actually a lovely place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style .
&quot; the rooms are equipped with large walk showers , the entrance area will be re@@ designed , it will be built new window . &quot;
&quot; everything was later &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; close &quot; &quot; how Thomas Sch@@ erer is express . &quot;
&quot; we want to make a jewelry . &quot;
&quot; swimming pool , spa area and a meeting room are part of the equipment . &quot;
&quot; it does not want to position itself at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already at an up@@ scale downtown level , empha@@ sizes . &quot;
&quot; the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its about 60 rooms want to set up wide , explains Sch@@ erer further . &quot;
&quot; both individual holiday makers , groups or business@@ men should feel at home in the hotel . &quot;
conversations with O@@ B Julian Os@@ s@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael Kr@@ ause he has already led so Sch@@ erer .
the ideas of the city are the same with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; after the amount of investment , Thomas Sch@@ erer does not want to determine exactly . &quot;
&quot; just under a million Euros , he pays . &quot;
&quot; even the external plants are brought to front , which is already clearly visible . &quot;
&quot; in a courtyard there is a large terrace , which is publicly available from the restaurant , which is publicly available . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ aires : US Special Fac@@ tor composed Grand Jury
in the Russia affair about US President Donald Tru@@ mp will have special designs for Robert Mu@@ eller to a report a so called Grand Jury .
&quot; the panel has recorded the work over the past few weeks , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; under vocation on the subject of familiar persons . &quot;
the newspaper insi@@ sted the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller has extended its investigations and intensified .
&quot; the CN@@ N transm@@ itters , there was already the first pre @-@ inv@@ itations of the Gre@@ mi@@ ums in connection with a meeting between Tru@@ m@@ ps oldest son and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
U.S. intelligence acc@@ ents the Kre@@ m@@ lin for longer to be mixed up in the presidential campaign for 2016 .
Mu@@ eller examined whether there was a debate between the Tru@@ m@@ ps elect@@ oral team and Moscow .
&quot; in the focus of the investigations , several men are standing in the election campaign as a consultant of the re@@ union . &quot;
&quot; according to this , Mu@@ eller also took more and more Tru@@ m@@ ps private and business environment among the Lup@@ e . &quot;
&quot; Washington Post &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the Sonder@@ n@@ ler Tru@@ mp personally met in the center and looking for the pre @-@ design , whether the President in the wake of the affair may not hin@@ der the judiciary . &quot;
&quot; the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys is to examine and decide the evidence of possible inci@@ dents , and to decide whether the indic@@ t@@ ment should be raised . &quot;
Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore also called Prosec@@ ution .
mostly they will be switched on if it is a larger and contro@@ versi@@ al cases .
the procedure is always behind closed doors .
the panel can also be switched on by the prosec@@ ut@@ or &apos;s prosec@@ ut@@ or to up@@ load people at E@@ id .
according to the CN@@ N broad@@ cast@@ ers were issued pre @-@ inv@@ itations to turn the encounter between Donald Tru@@ mp J@@ r@@ s. and a Russian lawyer .
&quot; people who were involved in the meeting , be promp@@ ted to a statement , it was called in the report . &quot;
&quot; moreover , they should provide documents . &quot;
beside Tru@@ mp J@@ r@@ . were also Tru@@ m@@ ps consultant and in @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ers as well as his dam@@ al@@ iger elect@@ oral manager Paul Man@@ a@@ continues with the interview .
&quot; legal experts said on Thursday evening in the US TV , that the brief@@ ing show that Mu@@ eller does not leave in@@ tim@@ id@@ ated in his work and that he should be necessary to act quickly . &quot;
&quot; but it &apos;s not necessarily , that the Grand Jury will be switched on the end to decide on the survey of an indic@@ t@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the introduction of the Gre@@ mi@@ ano is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for the President Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the new revel@@ ations , President on Thursday night , a speech in West Virginia to present the Russia affair as a campaign of its political opponents . &quot;
&quot; the Russia &apos;s story is a total invention , &quot; said Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; the theme give the democr@@ ats an opportunity to feel good , because they have nothing else to talk about it . &quot;
&quot; his special advis@@ er T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in a statement , he wis@@ se nothing of the introduction of a Grand Jury . &quot;
&quot; but they usually work in secret , he stressed . &quot;
the White House fears all measures that accelerated the work of the special evaluation in &quot; fair &quot; way .
the former F@@ BI @-@ boss James Com@@ ey have said three times said not against the president .
they have no reason to suppose that something was changed in the explanation .
Mu@@ eller had only been used after Tru@@ mp Com@@ ey had gone .
&quot; because of this re@@ tired were pres@@ su@@ ing against tru@@ mp according to , he made the judiciary im@@ pe@@ de . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ey said in June in front of a Senate Committee , Tru@@ mp have asked him for a set of investigations against the former national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n . &quot;
the president is under great print because of the examination .
according to the representation of US media gathered the White House Material for the special evaluation and its employees .
the spec@@ imen spec@@ ulation about whether Tru@@ mp Mu@@ eller wants to release .
&quot; other than an independent special evaluation of the congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair about the later rec@@ alled President Richard Ni@@ x@@ on , has Mu@@ eller a position where he could control at the pressures of the President of the Ministry of Justice . &quot;
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
&quot; two groups of re@@ publi@@ can and democratic Sen@@ ators presented on Thursday legislation , after which the special voice could no longer be released . &quot;
Ant@@ arc@@ tic : gigantic ic@@ eberg is driving in the Ant@@ arc@@ tic
in the West@@ ant@@ ark@@ tis a gigantic ic@@ eberg has solved itself from the barely seven @-@ n size of Berlin from the Shel@@ fe@@ is .
this shared the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred Weg@@ ener Institute for polar and marine Research on Wednesday .
&quot; the more than a Bil@@ lion tons of heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometers , large Kol@@ oss is now coming to the north and will probably need two , three years until he mel@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; with 175 kilometers length and a width of up to 50 kilometers of one of the largest ice cream , the researchers have registered in the past three decades . &quot;
a danger for people goes from him not .
&quot; what climate change has played a role in the break@@ down of ice age , is un@@ clear according to research purposes . &quot;
&quot; in total , there has been a series of un@@ common break@@ through@@ s of ic@@ eb@@ rows in the region , writes the US research center for snow and ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a fact . &quot;
according to the opinion of many researchers this can be connected to the global warming .
the now broken Kol@@ oss was so far a part of Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ fe@@ is .
Schel@@ fe@@ is floating on the sea and is fed by large gl@@ aci@@ ers .
it is still growing into the sea and breaks out regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ fe@@ is is located south of South America almost at the top of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula .
North of this ro@@ cket was the balance of w@@ ax@@ ing and break down a few years ago .
a complete Schel@@ fe@@ is is there was broken down , writes AW@@ I @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot to do that also the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ fe@@ is is in danger , because the front edges have never with@@ drawn as far as currently . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the ice shaft stand under voltage and can fall , if at a key point a piece of bre@@ w . &quot;
&quot; the mel@@ ting by Schel@@ fe@@ is and Eis@@ berg does not increase the sea level , as they flo@@ cks on the water as it ends as much water as it depends on the mel@@ ting itself . &quot;
&quot; however , the loss of the ro@@ cket is that the gl@@ aci@@ ers leads directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before . &quot;
&quot; this could possibly increase the level , but only in the low degree , the British research project is called the Ant@@ arc@@ tic ( Mi@@ das ) . &quot;
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ fe@@ is is after AW@@ I @-@ information with nearly 50 000 square kilometres the fourth ro@@ g@@ is of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic .
&quot; at the passage from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , on the front edge to the free ocean around 200 meters . &quot;
there it breaks regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural happening and is not aware of any direct connection to climate change , the ice is now in a dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y of the British Sw@@ an@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the wid@@ est retreat since the beginning of the record , &quot; confirmed also . &quot;
&quot; to scientists be contro@@ versi@@ al whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ fe@@ is now to grow again and possibly merge together , said his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last decades .
&quot; even if these researchers go down to change this giant ic@@ eberg to climate change , so in the past decades , there have been very much ice sk@@ el@@ fe of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula . &quot;
this long accordion of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic extends towards South America .
&quot; according to the data of the research program British Ant@@ arc@@ tic Surv@@ ey , the ice area of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula has gone back to 28 000 square kilometres . &quot;
the temperature has contributed to the decline .
&quot; the Ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula has passed over 50 years by around three degrees per@@ sever@@ ely and fold in the fields , where the temperature at the fastest growing . &quot;
CD@@ U wants to be Hau@@ ling at the staff
&quot; because it is becoming increasingly difficult to occupy , freely value bodies , the CD@@ U , from the working association calls to be more attractive to become more attractive . &quot;
only shortly before the summer break the K@@ rei@@ day 41 new places in the administration has passed through .
&quot; more than 1100 anarch@@ ists and officials are working for the roundabout , in M@@ ett@@ mann . &quot;
now even 17 trainees their first working day behind themselves .
the teachers are obviously very popular with the circle .
around 620 applications were to be in v@@ ain for the squares in this year .
&quot; however , the circle is missing to the circle to cope with the soci@@ etal requirements and tasks . &quot;
at present there are M@@ ett@@ mann in front of the circle of M@@ ett@@ mann just as before 50 years ago .
&quot; among other things , doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration . &quot;
the CD@@ U would now like to take action together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG initiative and take care of the skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; the management should develop according to the request of the parties &quot; &quot; a concept for recruitment and human resources . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the goal is to cover not only short @-@ term commercial professionals , but future @-@ oriented of the applicants , means it is . &quot;
&quot; the overall concept should be based on the inside and outside , concrete measures for cross @-@ ups and include an exempl@@ ary offensive , calling for CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot;
this is what you hear already after a good approach .
&quot; for the circle has to do with personal problems , which one did not know earlier . &quot;
other towns advertise good officials and asked and offer attractive conditions .
the speech is from a regul@@ ating &quot; contest of the public employer . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , a high number of employees , the disease or alter@@ ations from the service . &quot;
&quot; so , for the highest time to act so that no longer positions remain un@@ occupied . &quot;
&quot; but Klaus @-@ Dieter peoples , leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the common application . &quot;
he wa@@ ited un@@ long since the k@@ day of a f@@ aust@@ rop@@ ause surprise when he placed the personnel cover public in question and the remaining parties bl@@ oss@@ om .
peoples want to be examined that all the possibilities are verified that make an discharge from the municipal working environment .
&quot; if we come here not at short notice to a satisfactory solution , the county administration with the unions - maybe even in cooperation with the county of cities - a home rate &quot; , &quot; said nations . &quot;
&quot; thus , the CD@@ U , the workers and officials are trying to pay better than the collective service is actually looking for the public service . &quot;
&quot; the sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , enhancements or more money , there is only if you switch to a higher level which is based on professional years . &quot;
but the tasks of the circle has grown more and more in recent years .
&quot; only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up in which the provisions of the new pro@@ stitute protection law . &quot;
not least by the rising number of asylum seekers have Thomas Hen@@ del@@ e and Cir@@ direc@@ tional Martin Richter a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy exac@@ erb@@ ated the tone to NGO @-@ migrants @-@ ambulance
&quot; Italy has war@@ ned NGOs , the rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean sea , war@@ ned that they may not continue to continue with new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not write a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they continue working , &quot; said Interior Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Tur@@ iner daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot;
&quot; Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after the Italian authorities had a boat of the German relief organization &quot; youth Ret@@ rie@@ ve &quot; , &quot; because their team had worked effectively with human traders in a manner that facilitated illegal immigration . &quot;
&quot; the aid organization , which has only been in operation since one year , it turned out to express itself to detailed lectures of the Italian Prosec@@ ut@@ or Amb@@ ro@@ gio Cart@@ osi@@ o . &quot;
&quot; for us , the rescue of human life remains our top priority . so we are sorry that we cannot operate in the search - and rescue zone , &quot; said the organisation in an opinion on social media . &quot;
&quot; we can all acc@@ us@@ ations that are currently collected , only after we have collected all the information and evaluate the situation . &quot;
&quot; the Italian authorities had the boat of &quot; &quot; youth Ret@@ rie@@ der &quot; , &quot; the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , since October super@@ vised . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that his crew of infl@@ atable migrants are delivered on board , which can be delivered directly by crowds , and that the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers can be used again so that the ships can be used again . &quot;
&quot; at least one such tick @-@ meeting , supp@@ osedly found only 1,@@ 3 miles before the Liby@@ an coast , according to the acquisition of the Prosec@@ ut@@ or , whose content of Italian media has been published . &quot;
&quot; the occupation is di@@ gest@@ ed upon the authority of the Italian coastal guard , the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other moti@@ fs are monitored . &quot;
&quot; under the code of conduct , boats , such as the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta must have placed on board as well as the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta on board , who super@@ vised their activities . &quot;
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have been involved so far , have explained to the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter told the new rules as unnecessary , but acceptable since they would not make any &quot; significant changes or disability &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot;
&quot; among those who refuse to sign , is the No@@ bel lau@@ re@@ ate organization doctors without borders ( MS@@ F ) . &quot;
&quot; by now , Minn@@ iti said now that the number of migrants arrived in Italy over the past few weeks , giving efforts to strengthen the Liby@@ an coastal guard and the cooperation with the local may@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; in the last days we began to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; he gave plans for further talks with Liby@@ an may@@ ors in this month about economic development initiatives and with Ch@@ ad , N@@ iger , and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who can reach these countries in the hope of Europe . &quot;
sti@@ ege and tri@@ as
&quot; nine W@@ eil@@ er@@ mer Bi@@ ker , the &quot; Berlin outer post &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the North @-@ Salt to enjoy four days in the Tri@@ als and tourist attractions . &quot;
&quot; for this , three be@@ aked guides stood at your disposal . &quot;
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer Tal proved to be a good starting point for tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour conducted during hot summer temperatures along the vineyards for Mich@@ a@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim .
&quot; it followed view@@ points , partly on towers , from which one could look far beyond the Pf@@ äl@@ zer forest and the up@@ stream levels . &quot;
&quot; in between , there was repeatedly longer an@@ sti@@ ege , for the long tri@@ c@@ als . &quot;
on the second day it went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and the folk festival .
&quot; again the viewpoint at the viewpoint connected by &quot; &quot; flo@@ ck &quot; &quot; tri@@ als and moderate attack . &quot;
on the last two days there were many altitude metres over the last two days .
&quot; caves , rocks , towers , ruins , ruins and recur@@ rent brought welcome breaks . &quot;
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim at@@ met@@ en the bi@@ ker in the outdoor content of healing Sole one .
also Neu@@ stadt was controlled .
&quot; after 173 kilometers and almost 4@@ 500 meters , the group had the p@@ äl@@ zer forest from its best page - sporty and cultur@@ ally . &quot;
console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga for E @-@ Sport
sit the sport @-@ stars in future before computer con@@ soles , instead of fighting swe@@ ating in wind and weather over the stadium . &quot;
&quot; fact : e @-@ sport has long been a serious increasing sector , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative shop - large stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gases . &quot;
this also has recognized the first federal states that are increasingly active in this field .
&quot; in the beginning of 2015 the V@@ f@@ L Wol@@ fs@@ burg , later followed by the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last of the VF@@ B Stuttgart , the middle of July founded an e @-@ sport department and took two professionals for the computer play FIFA 17 . &quot;
&quot; we hope to inspire the whole new young target groups for the VF@@ B , &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ öt@@ t@@ German@@ ann . &quot;
&quot; he is safe , &quot; that on this train still has several clubs to asc@@ end . &quot;
&quot; next weekend , the football @-@ world association organized FIFA in London the first &quot; &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; &quot; in which the gam@@ er of various clubs compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; apart from Schal@@ ke and Wol@@ fs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Eind@@ hoven . &quot;
also Robin Dut@@ t sees great potential in the e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ Trainer by Bayer Lever@@ kus@@ en and Wer@@ der Bremen have now advis@@ es an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; the real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 years of year @-@ old , that young people will also go into the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; and : the understanding tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian , to conquer . &quot;
&quot; with prominent e @-@ sports@@ men under contract one could be much more often present on these markets than once in the year the Federal Republic to Asia . &quot;
what is it exactly ?
&quot; when e @-@ sport become computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends &quot; , &quot; Dot@@ A 2 &quot; , &quot; Counter@@ strike &quot; or just the football simulation of FIFA to competition level . &quot;
&quot; long ago , like in normal sports , Li@@ gen established , where the pros compete against each other . &quot;
and at the Asian @-@ playing 2022 e @-@ sport is already part of the official program .
but are the right sport at all ?
for many is the idea safe to be used .
also In@@ go F@@ rob@@ ber has long been dealing with the question for a long time .
&quot; for the professor at the German Spor@@ tho@@ ch@@ schule in Cologne is E @-@ Sport a sport , because it is com@@ ic and lots of biological and physical reactions show that one can also find in classical sport - for example increased heart frequencies , hor@@ monal changes , hor@@ monal changes . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , cog@@ nitive abilities require a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a fast response capability . &quot;
&quot; professional gam@@ ers should not only be on the console , but also to exercise their body and pay attention to the diet . &quot;
&quot; the fine player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; fats also sees problems : &quot; intelligence is becoming more and more a topic . &quot;
controls are difficult for online games and in the scene the structures of the classic sport .
positive highlights the scientist highlights the high integr@@ ative effect of the e @-@ sport .
&quot; the players are on the road internationally , that is like a big global family , there are no intercultural shirts . &quot;
a study of corporate consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal association Inter@@ active entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) tells the e @-@ sport a rapid growth ahead .
&quot; in 2016 , so in Germany have been implemented for 50 million euros , mainly on advertising , sponsor@@ ing and great tournaments . &quot;
sales at 130 million are expected in three years .
against the barely 2.@@ 4 billion euros in the Bundes@@ liga it is little .
&quot; however , the E @-@ Sport &quot; is no longer far from the other established sports like hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , write the Del@@ o@@ itte consultants . &quot;
international are many countries already .
great markets are Asia and the USA where Ex @-@ basketball h@@ oop Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Ro@@ dri@@ gu@@ ez at the US Team NR@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ashton &apos;s inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sport @-@ competition Uni@@ kr@@ n .
also in Europe is a lot of things .
&quot; in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport was introduced as a classroom , says F@@ rob@@ utes . &quot;
&quot; in the Netherlands and in France , the football first @-@ first @-@ first @-@ liga was obliged to set up an e @-@ sport department . &quot;
&quot; in the European comparison , Germany lag@@ ging behind Germany , explains VF@@ B @-@ Board R@@ öt@@ t@@ German@@ ann . &quot;
&quot; only in no@@ stal@@ gia to fall , and the old times to clarify enough is no longer sufficient . &quot;
&quot; it is to keep the tradition of the association , but the company is at the same time to set up the modern market at the same time . &quot;
&quot; we live in a digi@@ tised world , &quot; says Dut@@ y . &quot;
&quot; because you can not stick to it that only in football , everything remains as it was always . &quot;

Mich@@ elle Carter because of the lyrics , the Conrad Roy pushing for su@@ ic@@ ide , &quot;
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because they encouraged their friend by texts and calls for su@@ ic@@ ide .
&quot; Mich@@ elle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of their condem@@ nation behind G@@ it@@ tern and five years were exposed to admir@@ ation . &quot;
Carter was sentenced in June due to the casual killing of Conrad in July 2014 on 13 July 2014 .
the father of Roy said to Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is unlimited .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to stay free up to calling .
&quot; she had been confronted with a maximum of 20 years , but their legal representative was argu@@ ed that both she and Mr Roy suffered in a mental illness . &quot;
&quot; dres@@ sed in red p@@ ants and a cre@@ me@@ colored bl@@ use , stood Carter da with t@@ ears in the eyes , with folded hands and according to below eyes , when it was condemned . &quot;
&quot; their actions have brought to Conrad Roy , &quot; said the government of the Court . &quot;
they ended his life to make their own better .
&quot; she has no responsibility taken &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; she has not shown any rep@@ ent@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; but car@@ ters lawyer , it was a &quot; terrible circum@@ stance that they are completely depl@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said , he did not find that her &quot; age or Rei@@ f@@ eg@@ rad or even their spiritual disease has a significant impact on their actions . &quot;
&quot; a prosec@@ ut@@ or read an explanation of Ro@@ ys mother Lyn@@ n Roy , the said that there is no day that I don &apos;t miss the loss of my beloved Son . &quot;
&quot; I would like to be proud of me and how I go with everything . I try , despite all my pain , which we will be with us for the eternity with us to be there for his sisters . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she will never be persec@@ uted by the knowledge &quot; &quot; that they will never be participating in the wedding of their brother or a t@@ ante for his children . &quot;
&quot; no longer this only person to have , with which I have been together since my birth , is a pain that I will always keep in my life for the rest of my life . &quot;
&quot; the case seems to put a legal preced@@ ent , since there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to commit another , su@@ ic@@ ide . &quot;
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon oxid@@ ation in a vehicle .
&quot; the case moved national attention to himself , after car@@ ters text messages , that they had encouraged him to end his life . &quot;
&quot; Hang@@ g you on , spring of a building , ste@@ er yourself , I do not know there are many ways , she said in several news , which had sent them in the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family . &quot;
&quot; looking ahead of his su@@ ic@@ ide , she wrote : &quot; you must do it , Conrad &quot; and &quot; Every@@ thing , what you must do is to turn the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter was sought by the death of Roy and ord@@ ained that they will benefit through some press from the case .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
&quot; to the few , the Carter defended , belonged to Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , which was condemned in Italy due to Mor@@ des at their British co @-@ habit@@ ant in Italy before it was acqu@@ itted 2 years ago . &quot;
&quot; Mrs Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published in Los Angeles Times a comment : &quot; Mich@@ elle Carter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua K@@ im@@ me : learning from the new mini @-@ l@@ ah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua have allowed K@@ im@@ me at the Audi Cup as a captain . is no coinci@@ dence .
the FC Bayern Con@@ aut the Con@@ fed Cup winner won a large season - Extra motivation does not exist .
&quot; what was there differently on his place in the cabin , that looked Joshua K@@ im@@ me immediately , even if the extra clothing was very small , very small . &quot;
&quot; but since far and wide on the second day of Audi C@@ ups , of course no Philipp l@@ ah@@ m and also no Manuel new@@ er was to see , he made himself a shared bon@@ ding to the arm . &quot;
&quot; the trainer did not announced it , &quot; told the Con@@ fed Cup winner , after his first use as a Bavaria captain . &quot;
good one could have better run than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the sign from coach could also indicate that way .
&quot; not the eight years older Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al was in the group of youth players , Deb@@ ut@@ ants and just returned from the holidays to comment the existing C @-@ El@@ f as a guide . &quot;
sugars are distributed well in those who want to do much to those who want to keep in La@@ une .
&quot; so who became au@@ ser@@ k@@ ors , the heritage of l@@ ah@@ m can be found , a small extra @-@ motivation can only have used well . &quot;
K@@ im@@ me confirmed : &quot; this is what you want to take as players : taking responsibility .
on Wednesday fl@@ it@@ ated the 22 @-@ year @-@ old as a mini @-@ l@@ ah@@ m over the field .
&quot; right back , which is now its position , the white bin@@ de on arm did its rest . &quot;
&quot; and at all , K@@ im@@ me in this start formation like the one who can take the rest in the hand . &quot;
&quot; he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ played trou@@ pe . &quot;
&quot; he had the view for the whole , while many others were occupied with himself . &quot;
&quot; Vid@@ al means to over@@ play his missing fitness ( fol@@ ds hardly ) ; Ren@@ ato Sanit@@ ary to connect to the devil ( fol@@ ds , even ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ l@@ essen in order to fall into their first appearance in Bavaria jer@@ sey . &quot;
that at all fol@@ dable completely well .
&quot; Sü@@ le ran alongside K@@ im@@ me , Rud@@ y in front of the defense , both ag@@ ed sover@@ eign . &quot;
&quot; the nam@@ es@@ ful Nap@@ oli storm was often difficult , in addition , Sü@@ el tried to be successful in the game building a few times . &quot;
&quot; his colleague Rud@@ y was indeed given that the result was &quot; &quot; not that way , as we have hop@@ ed up . &quot;
but also he showed an extraordinary performance at the debut appearance .
&quot; shift , temp@@ o change : &quot; for this style I was also fet@@ ched . &quot;
as un@@ used this Bavaria world still for the new ones that you saw in connection to the game .
&quot; Rud@@ y for example gave in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs not one or two , but determines six or seven interviews . &quot;
K@@ im@@ me passed down after a few cr@@ acking statements in the back of his new player .
&quot; he heard of sweet@@ ness an interesting sentence : &quot; &quot; what is going on , I have now already painted . &quot;
at Bavaria you just have to win every game .
&quot; after all , he does not have to teach the new one . &quot;

company pleased with rh@@ et@@ land @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ an Minister : economy lo@@ bes Wis@@ s@@ ings Tempo
&quot; it often designed often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) nor the Minister of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palatinate . &quot;
&quot; this shows itself after more than one year , where the new Minister Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office . &quot;
chambers and companies from the region speak on T V @-@ request of a change in economic policy - and bl@@ ero@@ ding the old Minister at the same time .
&quot; Frank N@@ atus , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer Company ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wis@@ sing acc@@ esses the wishes of the economy , the Lem@@ ke is blocked . &quot;
the largest k@@ eh@@ sti@@ ce sees N@@ atus in the infrastructure policy : the L@@ ück@@ en@@ ue of the highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and A@@ den@@ au stands in the pri@@ ori@@ tis@@ est list of the country .
&quot; again this year the Ministry is hoping for a plan of plan , up to 2021 the building shall be right . &quot;
a role in the plans of the country also plays the western direction of Tri@@ er which stands in the urgent need of the federal traffic plan .
&quot; the goal is to take the track in December 2020 , says Minist@@ erial @-@ speaking Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; N@@ atus sees this a sign@@ post to support regional , but internationally competing companies . &quot;
&quot; the Chamber of Commerce and Commerce of Commerce ( I@@ HK ) Tri@@ er seeks to increase the sale in the Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palatinate , in order to increase the sale in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German wine exports for ten years . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to create their own company , praise the Chamber of Commerce . &quot;
&quot; the Handwerk@@ skammer Tri@@ er sees an additional incentive for young appr@@ enti@@ ces , says CEO Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; provided is a premium of 1000 Euro for the best master exam and 2500 euros , when graduates are employed in the training period of ten years after the master@@ ing training . &quot;
the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
&quot; the planned road construction is quick to create , at the same time the country at the necessary staff , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , captain of the Chamber of Commerce Tri@@ er . &quot;
&quot; of 56 new engineers , to set the Wis@@ sing in the operation of mobility , have so far only 29 positions occupied . &quot;
the Chamber of Industry calls for more orders to external offices .
&quot; CD@@ U Group Leader in Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf refers to calculations of the Court of Audit@@ ors , the country invested in 2017 and 2018 more than 20 million euros less in the preservation of national roads . &quot;
Frank N@@ atus also expects a concept of the country as it wants to fix the skilled workers in the region .
harv@@ ester was also the old broad@@ band construction in the country .
&quot; in 2016 , regional companies had been rated the power supply in a HK @-@ survey only with its note . &quot;
it values on stock@@ pil@@ ing Internet connections and down@@ s .
&quot; in contrast , ex @-@ economic Minister E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and still sits in the Supervisory Board of wind turbines Pro Wind . &quot;
the Gre@@ ens left Lem@@ ke on April to become the president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where they already pointed out the field after four months .
&quot; Audi should change 85@@ 0,000 diesel vehicles - car @-@ vehicles faced with a counter @-@ action . &quot;
&quot; a day before the announcement of Audi said BMW , that it would offer to update the software in more than 35@@ 0.000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the BMW chair said , the company is the opinion that &quot; there is intelligent options as a limited restrictions , and related to European cities - including Munich , where BMW ans@@ is - diesel vehicles to offer or limit . &quot;
Daim@@ ler announced on Tuesday that there will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the enterprises as a recall .
European automobile manufacturers have strongly supported the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support the compliance of carbon dioxide emissions .
&quot; but the nit@@ rogen Ox@@ ides , the diesel engines , apply as car@@ cin@@ o@@ gens and can cause as@@ thma . &quot;
&quot; the cost of automobile manufacturers , systems for neutr@@ alization of diesel vehicles to install gra@@ v@@ ase , also take advantage of what makes it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel will also indic@@ ted to ignore the powerful car firms and ignore signs of the problem .
&quot; the companies try to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called off @-@ off devices to control the regulations when a car was tested , but with normal driving conditions . &quot;
&quot; in the United States several candidates were charged by Volkswagen , others will be examined on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
last month the former director of the Ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ics was arrested in Germany in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
&quot; the former manager , Zac@@ ch@@ eo Giovanni Pam@@ io , Itali@@ ans and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be judged in the United States . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year Audi was included in German criminal investigations by Volkswagen , after the authorities , Audi will have installed a system to deal with the emissions regulations in Europe and a request that focused on the United States . &quot;
&quot; the inclusion of Audi to the investigation could be heavy loads : the luxury car manufacturer carries out proportional to the profit of Volkswagen . &quot;

Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ us@@ hes and the laughter against suffering
Mor@@ di@@ llo was time to be one of the best published cart@@ oons @-@ drawing of his figures are his hall@@ mark .
&quot; also with 85 shows the Argent@@ inian , and works on a film . &quot;
&quot; his message : laughter , &quot; &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 in the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
&quot; in the first years as an artist , he proposed himself among other things as a character for fortune cards , which was frustr@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost in my job , &quot; he said once . &quot;
&quot; after stations in Lima , New York and Paris managed at the end of the 60@@ s of the breakthrough : with the release of his cart@@ oons in &quot; Paris Match &quot; and then also in &quot; star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot;
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
again and again the artists of cities will be inspired again .
&quot; large , round Mor@@ di@@ llo figures tum@@ ble in drawings with the sl@@ ate tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow . &quot;
&quot; in the early morning he is currently sitting on the character , even today , works almost ten hours every day . &quot;
&quot; via calendar , puzzles , books for Gross and Klein , T @-@ shirts , Pl@@ ü@@ sch@@ tiere and clo@@ cks find his d@@ rol@@ ley figures still much distribution worldwide . &quot;
for six years he also works on a cartoon film and a TV series with its figures .
&quot; the main person in the film &quot; &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; &quot; is a gi@@ raffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los any animal in his drawings - which has a pig@@ eon @-@ sler as a counter @-@ player . &quot;
&quot; for the first time his figures speak in the 3D film , the 2019 will come to the cinema wall . &quot;
&quot; I know not exactly what they say , it is strange for me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot;
the screen@@ play is not written by him .
&quot; therefore , it is based on the TV series , which is produced as its original labels , wor@@ t@@ less . &quot;
Lav@@ ender from Provence from climate change threatened
&quot; it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change . &quot;
&quot; the Lav@@ ender is due to the d@@ rought of d@@ rought , and because of the diseases transmitted by insects , which scientists and farmers who try to find solutions , great head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the agricultural research institutes C@@ RI@@ EP@@ P@@ AM in Provence , said : &quot; the Lav@@ ender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change over the past few years and much more in the fall . &quot;
this has effects on the lifetime of lav@@ ender .
&quot; there is also a small bi@@ ik@@ ade , a micro @-@ bacterial , the d@@ warf @-@ straight , and at very dry weather there are very many of it . &quot;
and there is much on the game .
Lav@@ ender oil attracts not only for vac@@ ation@@ ers ; it is also very popular for perf@@ umes and cosmetics .
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having very long plant watches with a large number of flowers , we have minor , UN@@ TE@@ REN@@ TW@@ IC@@ K@@ EL@@ TE and either missing or curved . &quot;
so we have less parts with ether@@ ic oil . &quot;
&quot; among the solutions that are considered to be considered , a better water distribution and the slow@@ ing of the dun@@ geon from the ground , but also the con@@ dens@@ ation of the plants with a protective mix of sound and water and the development of varieties that are resistant to dry resistance . &quot;

the ass@@ ass@@ ination of a journalist under@@ scores the growing threat in Mexico
the staff of the Week@@ ly Ri@@ odo@@ ce usually meet at home to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt high and discreet drug wars . &quot;
&quot; but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to speak about security . &quot;
it was told to them that it is important to change their routines .
&quot; two high @-@ level journalists discuss what to feel safer : they are supposed to take their children to the office , who were the goal of an attack with gran@@ ates , or at home it at home . &quot;
&quot; safety experts have written three words on a board at the front of the room : opponent , neutr@@ ale , allies . &quot;
&quot; you ask the re@@ porter , names for each column - no proof is necessary , percep@@ tions and ab@@ dom@@ inal . &quot;
&quot; there are drugs decoration , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who will di@@ gest@@ ed on the salary list of the government or the cart@@ els , a catalogue of crimin@@ als , which make the chaos of Mexico dangerous . &quot;
&quot; there is no retirement of violence , and throughout the country the corp@@ ses are increasingly taken at least 25 , since President En@@ ri@@ que Pen@@ a NI@@ E@@ TO in December 2012 . 589 are standing according to attacks and threats under federal protection and until now this year there were at least seven dead in seven states . &quot;
&quot; among the latter , their publisher and their inspir@@ er of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , the co @-@ founder J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot;
&quot; his absence will be deeply felt , although his presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Val@@ dez , which shows its middle @-@ finger with the word &quot; Justice &quot; , &quot; T I@@ barra and Mi@@ riam Ram@@ i@@ rez , wear T @-@ shirts , which show its ridicul@@ ous face with glasses or its typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut . &quot;
&quot; the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ porter discuss their shared topics , the trau@@ ma , their night@@ mar@@ es , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although 2010 has been established a Son@@ der &apos;s office , in order to edit the cases of journalists , these according to the Committee for the protection of journalists only two criminal proceedings . &quot;
&quot; as with most thousands of Mor@@ den , each year with drug wholesale and organised crime , the mur@@ der@@ ers are only rare in judgment . &quot;
&quot; at Ri@@ odo@@ ce they still ins@@ ist to treat the violence from Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are un@@ spoiled , and even though the terrain is still in stock . &quot;
&quot; without any information about the mur@@ derer , without justice , the meeting for the discussion of security , says I@@ barra . &quot;
&quot; it is very stup@@ id to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we do not know the Why , we do all . &quot;
on the morning of May 15 Val@@ dez has left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the state capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; he managed only to drive a couple of blocks far before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was raised by two men . he was forced by his car and 12 times , probably due to the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; &quot; twelve &quot; river &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the pe@@ pper drove away in his car and damaged it in the vicinity .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to move freely around in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ mans arrest in the past year and delivery in the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the blo@@ o@@ dies@@ t districts of the country , as ri@@ alis@@ ing groups here fight to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it does not make things that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or several people are shot on the street , or that the cemetery is full of consuming , two @-@ story mouse tracks for drugs , which are larger than many houses for the living . &quot;
forget about a minute that there is a state of &apos; peace &apos; if only a cart@@ el control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs of trade routes in the United States .
&quot; nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , with blame was broken that he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings have contributed to the murder .
&quot; first of all , in February the publication of a interview with Dam@@ as@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the riv@@ alled cart@@ ons in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans S@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; this publication may have anno@@ yed the sons , susp@@ ected the members purchased every copy of the output as soon as they have been delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; the second fault was to force Val@@ dez , after the sign of another newspaper , which had released the same story to leave the country into its own security . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and its murder is seen as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists . &quot;
&quot; he had so long survived his friends and colleagues , that he would always be there . &quot;
&quot; he was active as an experienced re@@ porter for Nor@@ o@@ este , when he joined together with five colleagues to the formation of Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism , without encounter@@ ing the pre@@ d@@ ow@@ ry problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the newspaper served a reputation for brave and honest reporting , and sales and promotion took place . &quot;
&quot; re@@ porters loved it , hard to publish harsh investigations without fear of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they were able to read stories otherwise . &quot;
eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ odo@@ ce she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Prize &quot; for their reporting in Latin America .
&quot; in the same year Val@@ dez has won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the protection of journalists for his courage in the persecution of the Mexican drug history , wherever it lead to it . &quot;
he gave himself voluntarily that he had fear .
&quot; I want to continue living , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot;
&quot; drug wholesale in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento TV . &quot;
they need to take the task that you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ pl@@ ings .
&quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; what did you do so many things ... why did you not say what happened before ? &quot;
&quot; the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team missed Val@@ dez , the Sp@@ a@@ ß@@ vog@@ el , who was like a port labor@@ er , the friend , the generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survived . &quot;
you trust on his routine .
he would always bear his hat .
&quot; he would always go to El Guay@@ an@@ illa , the bar towards the office , go there and always sitting at the same table . &quot;
&quot; now , ask them : was his love for routine his worship ? &quot;
&quot; his death has also forced them to question their own assum@@ ptions , how they can do their work best and stay alive . &quot;
&quot; they do not like it if you are dealing with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their home start and cross @-@ country ways to move drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even at the best times , a high degree of self @-@ adhesive and self @-@ keeping . &quot;
his own inst@@ inct trust .
&quot; if it was wrong , lead away from it . &quot;
&quot; the anger is , said the editor of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real that &quot; smell can be a sense that can be decei@@ ved ... and then the thing happened with J@@ avier . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , as he and others say , are in Sin@@ alo@@ a no longer - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a gi@@ fted mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ are , weak institutions and corrupt government institutions at home . &quot;
the landscape is constantly changing .
&quot; in the room where the employees of Ri@@ odo@@ ce to safety training met , there were suddenly no mobile phones . days previously known that Spy@@ ware , which has been sold exclusively to governments , for monitoring journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
&quot; out there two police protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree . &quot;
they were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a mid @-@ class neighborhood of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; half in the trade , some of the re@@ porter asked if this officers belong to the 50 percent of polic@@ emen , which belong to the Govern@@ or itself as not trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; it is months ago , since the re@@ porter have gone into the mountain landscape , where the drug ban@@ ces are de facto under control . &quot;
for the edition of this week Ri@@ odo@@ ce has bent on three main layers .
there was the ass@@ ass@@ ination of the brother of the former known Box@@ ers Ju@@ lio Ces@@ ar Cha@@ á@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an ex@@ pos@@ é to the prosec@@ ution that focused on the hom@@ etown of the Govern@@ ors .
&quot; and there was a group that led in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , one block from the office of the state . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who has been kid@@ n@@ apped or how it happened , so that was time to write as it was time to write what everyone in the city know : that the restaurant is a favorite local area of drug agents and authorities . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ porter from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a policy , which ruling almost all the political levels of all political levels . &quot;
&quot; recently , several PR@@ I @-@ Govern@@ ors were acc@@ used because of high @-@ class cases of corruption . &quot;
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real bat the re@@ porter to write about previous inci@@ dents in this locality , including one where a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man depart@@ ed a military attack . &quot;
only a few months ago the readers had seen the Kolum@@ ne of Val@@ dez as the best informed source about the kid@@ n@@ apping .
&quot; formerly we had already knew what happened is , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nickname &quot; El FLACO &quot; because of his slim body @-@ stat@@ or . &quot;
&quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
&quot; the office of Val@@ dez was dedicated to the storage space for signs and sti@@ ckers , devoted to the Mor@@ de of journalists , because the employees have never expected to have : activists in the name of the press . &quot;
Re@@ por@@ k Mi@@ riam Ram@@ i@@ rez sn@@ ap a few signs and went on the next morning to a demonstration due to another journalists to the office of the state .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez was killed in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; a bur@@ nt body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests that it is its . &quot;
&quot; throughout the country journalists have become aware of journalists by making them written in organized proteins &quot; &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; &quot; due to and construction . &quot;
&quot; on this day the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez weg in Washington and tried to collect international support for justice in the case of Val@@ dez . &quot;
&quot; with a meeting with the Govern@@ or of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the ass@@ ass@@ ination of Val@@ j@@ unt@@ ul@@ th@@ ened Ram@@ i@@ rez of the authorities , journalists and bring them down , because they have said the truth . &quot;
&quot; it has since then asked that she is again divided by the government , because it is concerned that their anger has hurt their objec@@ tivity . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly been told that journalists in Mexico of organised crime , part of government officials and a uniform society . &quot;
&quot; in his last book &quot; &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ journ@@ alism &quot; he wrote that Re@@ porter are not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the instruction of politicians and security forces , which were organised by organised crime under a ceiling . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ulo &quot; &quot; media has been assigned over the last year more than half of the attacks on journalists of police and officials in the last year . &quot;
&quot; in Mexico you are there , because they want you to dis@@ proportionate to the mouth , &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot;
obviously the Mor@@ de have a horri@@ ble effect .
nobody for@@ gets the death of the Blo@@ g@@ ger@@ in Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; your body was found along with a note that alleg@@ edly been signed by the Z@@ etas @-@ Kart@@ ell , &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer literature and ear@@ phones were next to their separate head .
some branches have chosen to close how the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the ass@@ ass@@ ination of the correspon@@ dents Mi@@ ro@@ sl@@ ava Bre@@ ach in March .
others make further how it did El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo according to the ass@@ ass@@ ination of their director in 2004 .
in 2010 the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ arez is public on the drug cart@@ els with a leading article on the title page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ?
some journalists have flow@@ n out of their home country or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
&quot; it &apos;s hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and search for dangers . &quot;
&quot; and sometimes they will be hun@@ ted , as it is apparently the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , the 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot;
&quot; for those who remain back and continuing work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions . &quot;
&quot; I@@ barra , the once le@@ po@@ et wanted to be , gives that the drug wholesale him sc@@ ares him . &quot;
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and therefore I became re@@ porter , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce on the citizen &apos;s go before the office and d@@ rank beer when all their phones began to be sum@@ med . &quot;
a set of sho@@ cks with absor@@ bing ri@@ val@@ ed and safety gu@@ ards near the bathing Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed T@@ ote .
the war continues as it was promised by a number of Kart@@ ell messages in the region .
&quot; from the board , they released the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce on mobile phones . &quot;
the front page had to be changed the next day .
Sir@@ ac@@ om@@ ats close to - another shooting in the area .
&quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the police officers , the guard held to see if they were in readiness . &quot;
&quot; if they had fear at all , they showed it not . &quot;
&quot; under the vast portrait of the fallen Grün@@ er of the newspaper , whose middle @-@ finger was visible for all Sin@@ alo@@ a , followed the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce its traces . &quot;
&quot; how can you also just remember &quot; , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; when the same day he has been mur@@ dered to the J@@ avier , who asked me to send them to the reporting . &quot;
din@@ os@@ aur used to escape its enemies
at first glance it looks like a statue when also a fri@@ ght@@ ening .
&quot; now , researchers have found out that the first findings of the unbelievable Nas@@ horn of a Canadian mountain labor@@ ers were so well preserved that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; it was so well preserved that they could even notice that his ch@@ asing skin was of her , and they said they could have had something of a &quot; un@@ quiet past . &quot;
&quot; the report in the magazine &quot; &quot; Current Bi@@ ology &quot; &quot; drew him as the &quot; &quot; Din@@ osau@@ rs Din@@ osau@@ rs , who has ever been found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs in the world . &quot;
&quot; Fossi@@ l is a newly discovered form of N@@ od@@ os@@ aur , which lived in the middle of the chal@@ k time between 110 million and 112 million years ago . &quot;
&quot; his unbeliev@@ ably good er@@ hal@@ er condition has researchers that describe it as &quot; truly remarkable &quot; , &quot; aston@@ ished &quot;
&quot; according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the cra@@ ftsmen is the best preserved fossi@@ ls of its kind . &quot;
&quot; it was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k , when he was born on 21 March 2011 in the S@@ unc@@ or M@@ illen@@ ium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the North of Alber@@ ta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; he met something that seemed from the surrounding rock ab@@ l at Plat@@ ze , and decided to see more precisely . &quot;
the fossi@@ ls discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; they spent the next six years , to cover the wild animal within the 2,@@ 500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy earth . &quot;
&quot; after all this hard work , the finished result is ready now to be revealed . &quot;
&quot; if you only have a little with the eyes bl@@ oss@@ om , you could almost believe it has slept , &quot; said the main aut@@ or Cal@@ eb Brown , scientists at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum , where the cre@@ ature is seen . &quot;
&quot; it will enter into the history of life as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the Din@@ os@@ aur . &quot;
&quot; researchers have found that this plant v@@ ore is covered , although he is covered with a arm@@ or and a changing tank , probably by meat and din@@ osau@@ rs was threatened . &quot;
&quot; the strong din@@ osau@@ rs used a red and white clo@@ ves to hide a red and white cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ ection , which is known above smo@@ kers , and used a sh@@ iel@@ ding technology that is also used as counter@@ part , which is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this could have allowed to blend better into its surroundings and to ex@@ ert their enemies , say experts , which is estimated that it was threatened by larger Din@@ os@@ aur . &quot;
the 110 million years old cre@@ ature from the family of the N@@ od@@ os@@ aur has made the Head@@ lines in May and is now at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; researchers have now studied the wild animal and it has called Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the Muse@@ um@@ bers Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team that has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours to cover it carefully . &quot;
&quot; the amazing preservation of the spec@@ imen allowed the Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists , the pattern and the form of shed and arm@@ aments of his body . &quot;
&quot; you discovered the con@@ ter@@ sh@@ ading , a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom , which means that the top of the cre@@ ature was dar@@ ker than its under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the counter @-@ sh@@ ady is usual , the results are surprising , as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta is by far the survi@@ ving the animals survived . &quot;
&quot; it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ rs had been hun@@ ted by enough pressure by meat , din@@ osau@@ rs that the evolution of the confrontation as a means of survival . &quot;
&quot; but most contemporary animals , who use the ter@@ sh@@ aded - think of deer , z@@ eb@@ ras , or g@@ ür@@ tel@@ tiere - are much smaller and more vulnerable than boot@@ y , what sign@@ alized that this N@@ od@@ os@@ aur was exposed to a real fight for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong rob@@ b@@ tier behaviour on a massive , strong bre@@ aded din@@ osau@@ rs , how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs rob@@ ber@@ nation of the chal@@ k @-@ era have been to be , &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the chemical analysis organic connections in their skins also shows that the skin of the din@@ os@@ aur @-@ brown was red .
&quot; scientists continue to examine the animal on references about his life , including his con@@ gl@@ ed Dar@@ min@@ ed , in order to find out what it has eaten as his last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs , when he died out into a river and went into the sea , where he sank on the back to the sea . &quot;
&quot; at that time Alber@@ ta was so warm like south fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably widespread far more widespread than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this N@@ od@@ os@@ aur is really remarkable , because he is fully covered with con@@ dens@@ ation of the skin , but also in three dimensions remains and the original form of the animal re@@ tains &quot; , &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the result is that the animal today looks almost exactly as in the early chal@@ k time .
&quot; you do not need much imagination to use it . if you just want a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that he is at sleep . &quot;
&quot; the chal@@ k was a time , as huge Ther@@ opo@@ den , saus@@ age din@@ os@@ aur , which stood on two legs , the earth had passed . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them , the Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ os@@ rus Rex , millions years ago after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta lived , the cruci@@ fied din@@ osau@@ rs was hun@@ ted by some of its terrible ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this belongs to the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ os@@ aur , a 38 feet ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters . &quot;
&quot; scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Bi@@ ology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta after death in the sea was laid down and in mud . &quot;
&quot; the cre@@ ature was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k , when he was born on 21 March 2011 in the S@@ unc@@ or M@@ illen@@ ium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the North of Alber@@ ta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum , it is the defe@@ ated din@@ osau@@ rs in the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is complete from the mou@@ sta@@ ze to the hips . &quot;
the creatures were average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and have up to 3.000 pounds ( 1.@@ 300 kg ) .
&quot; it contained two 20 @-@ inches long tips , which are supported by his shoulders . &quot;
the researchers believe that the cra@@ ftsmen were curved through Western Canada until a floo@@ ded river it was floo@@ ded into the open sea .
but the underwater cre@@ mation of the Din@@ os@@ aur has kept its arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the hidden remains of this particular spec@@ ars are so well preserved that the skin remains still hol@@ lowed Pan@@ zer@@ boards along the Din@@ os@@ aur
how Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko has written for National Ge@@ ographic is such a level of maintenance as &apos; rarely as a profit in a lot@@ tery .
&quot; the more I do it , the more conf@@ using it will . &quot;
pet@@ ri@@ fied the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ ed panels that carry the sk@@ ull of the animal .
&quot; his right point is on his side , his five fingers crossed out . &quot;
I can count the sli@@ pping at his sole .
in the storm : mass car@@ amb@@ ol@@ age on A8 : many last
&quot; fier@@ ce accident on Thursday night on the A8 : almost 30 vehicles are wrapped in a mass @-@ kar@@ am@@ age . &quot;
&quot; there are numerous recent , kilometres long St@@ aus - and G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
on the highway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A8 ) on the late Thursday morning at a mass car@@ amb@@ ol@@ age some 20 people have been inju@@ red .
&quot; according to the first details of the police at 17.00 h between the connection represent Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district of A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during an th@@ under@@ ters almost 30 cars , including probably also trucks . &quot;
on the exact number of the last years no information is available at first .
it will handle light up to moderate injury , a police spokes@@ person said . &quot;
a large b@@ lown on rescue vehicles was at the accident .
the A8 was fully locked in the direction of Munich .
&quot; in the direction of Munich , a around ten kilometers long returns . &quot;
&quot; like an A@@ Z Re@@ porter reports , it also came on the opposite way to massive disability - through numerous gen@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
the fire@@ men have noted the label of the vehicle &apos;s vehicle that now have to reck@@ oned with sensitive pen@@ alties .
&quot; shortly after 18 : 45 hrs there was another second accident on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot;
it was a coll@@ ision between an Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ spor@@ ter and a car .

Deutsche Bahn : Group test@@ et &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone experienced ever : nothing you sit on the train and sleep .
or she is deeper into his work and just has a geni@@ ful thought .
and then : pu@@ ff@@ f .

chassis control .
but times of inter@@ ruptions are over soon .
the German rail@@ ways is currently the creation of the managed driving roll .
you simply be confirmed by mobile phone that you have taken his place and vali@@ date the ticket .
&quot; currently , a test run on two routes is running . &quot;
&quot; if the offer depends on , we expand it . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be available at the beginning of next year on many other remote routes in Germany , &quot; said a train @-@ speaker . &quot;
&quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; is called the train card , without Schaff@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; to use the use , however , some conditions must be met : you need a smartphone or a tablet . &quot;
and you must have booked an online ticket - which already do most of the passengers .
&quot; you also have to have bought it via the App of the railway , the DB Navigator purchased , which is the most convenient way of ticket booking . &quot;
and finally you need a seat reservation .
&quot; because the &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; works : one rises in the train , calling its ticket under &quot; My Tickets &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the test client will then appear a button for the electronic de@@ valuation .
the traction companion on their mobile devices get a message that the g@@ ast X is on the train and taken the booked seat Y .
comes the Zug@@ companion in the driver &apos;s bike roll at No. Y white he knows that there is a passenger with already vali@@ dated online ticket .
&quot; so you can continue to sleep , continue working , further silent . &quot;
&quot; check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customers , one for the train - which in turn should be used to act . &quot;
&quot; those who want to travel without ticket control by our draw@@ backs would like to travel , chec@@ kt in the DB Navigator simply itself . &quot;
&quot; this allows the passenger guests to make their travel time in the train personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing Board of DB Explorer . &quot;
second Plus : &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs .
&quot; who often goes train , knows that next to delays and passive , the driver @-@ card rollers are among the greatest trouble . &quot;
&quot; for many times , one does not have , in any case , but one of the competitors not all the documents required for the de@@ valuation of online tickets . &quot;
either missing the credit card or the personnel ID or otherwise a document that you have to point .
&quot; the result are endless discussions between tension and bicycles , which leads to a bad mood in the evenings or large room and delays in the control of their own tickets and take the work at the end time to take care of other concerns . &quot;
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that also only on the links ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .

&quot; how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rell was sh@@ aken to its core .
&quot; only one day after they arrived in New York City , sitting in St. Louis Geb@@ der on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment that they rented and scroll through Facebook on their phone . &quot;
they stum@@ bled over a post office of someone from high school .
&quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year child , and there is still on the road &quot; , &quot; it was there . &quot;
&quot; confused , since nobody else had posted the information on her feed , closed her Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot;
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Ph@@ aro@@ ah was constantly based on their tim@@ eline ret@@ we@@ et@@ et .
&quot; Rap@@ id from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year old , who was killed by a white polic@@ emen in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , Mo . , killed live . &quot;
he posted a picture of browsing experience living on the street and would stay four hours there .
&quot; that is wild , &quot; thought Fer@@ rell . &quot;
but death was nothing new for her and her community .
she placed her cell phone to return later in the evening to T@@ we@@ ets on people on the Can@@ field drive .
&quot; there were photos of the police band and people , the prescribed , and of a man who wor@@ shipped a sign with the wording : &quot; &quot; Fer@@ g@@ us@@ ons police have just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
&quot; watching a live feed , where a polic@@ eman is before a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bell@@ ful dog stood . &quot;
&quot; in another video , she said , un@@ insured another polic@@ eman is his gun and cri@@ ed : &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill . &quot;
&quot; this is not common , &quot; rec@@ alled Fer@@ rell to their statement . &quot;
&quot; this is not the kind of murder , which we have used to us and which we can name typical . &quot;
in this moment I felt ru@@ ff@@ ers .
I was angry and we@@ pt . &quot;
you booked a flight and went home next day home .
after landing at 23 o &apos;clock she moved her 6 year old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two next morning would drive to Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on .
&quot; what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , is the subject of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; , &quot; in the cinem@@ as from the 11 . &quot;
&quot; it is a story of survival and Protest@@ ant , of love and loss , the strength and resistance force , which consists of the vision of the people who live in the community and filled the streets to challenge answers . &quot;
&quot; as Fer@@ rell with her daughter who drove a flower dress and a suitable crown , according to Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , the two a conversation that they had countless times in this morning &quot; about the black experience and black condition . &quot;
&quot; you remember how I have taught you when black people have to fight for this , what they believe ? &quot; remember what she said . &quot;
&quot; we are now going to Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , because the police have killed a 18 @-@ year boys and that was not right . &quot;
&quot; I could not take her , &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rell later . &quot;
what is happening today is a climax whose ... what happened in the past .
you have to know it and see it and be raised in it .
&quot; it must be well developed , not only acti@@ vis@@ m and organisation , but also know the different layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we must do to free ourselves to free ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even if I have the luck to give her an experience in which she is personally experienced in racism , it is not different from the next black female child . &quot;
&quot; I have the feeling , I would prove her a bad service to keep them away from it . &quot;
&quot; the first station when they arrived in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on Road , located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority which became a camp@@ ground as the activists of the possible non @-@ indic@@ t@@ ment by Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
&quot; there , Fer@@ rell and her daughter joined together with a local business owners , the lunch made . &quot;
they prepared po@@ ckets before and hal@@ ted them to pass on demonstr@@ ators .
slowly started a new kind of acti@@ vis@@ m for Fer@@ rell &apos;s shape .
&quot; my acti@@ vis@@ m changed after the 9th of August , she said and noticed that she was as a student at the University of Miss@@ ouri @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student N@@ urs@@ es Association and focused on food fairness and health ine@@ qualities in black congreg@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I had no experience in organizing . &quot;
it all came . &quot;
&quot; weeks later , Fer@@ rell during an evening @-@ demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said , she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ r@@ ar wanted to document &quot; , &quot; what happened . &quot;
&quot; a question came Fer@@ rell in the sense : &quot; &quot; you want to document or try to find a story that you can use ? &quot;
&quot; these skep@@ tic@@ ism was nour@@ ished through countless cases of people , often by wh@@ ites - in a community that benef@@ ited from her pain and their resistance . &quot;
&quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently explained in an interview : &quot; &quot; we had heard that people who have born in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on and grew up their votes and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the then Co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area , which is known for his acti@@ vis@@ m rum . &quot;
his engagement brought the project closer together with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after browsing .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us . we speak &quot; , &quot; said Davis . &quot;
&quot; that was the main thing for me as these people are represented , as I will be represented . &quot;
&quot; the goal was not to focus on Fer@@ rel@@ le &apos;s experience - to show that it is at the movement &quot; &quot; not around a Messi@@ ah leader , but a community , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it proved to be the most obvious participation in the film . &quot;
&quot; consequently show documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Fer@@ rel@@ le &apos;s life , as she loves and mar@@ ries her wife . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed , when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
&quot; but I understood that there must be certain viol@@ ability at this work , and in the in@@ arity of black people . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Fer@@ rel@@ le &apos;s story repeated the role of the black schw@@ ow@@ ls women in the broader Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founders of the movement , which after the murder of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 have shaped the film &quot; Black@@ li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identify themselves as schw@@ ul . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have borne the movement &quot; , &quot; Fer@@ rell , &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women need to wear the main last of everything . &quot;
&quot; follow @-@ up , to notice that &quot; the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women . &quot;
&quot; however , it is not that &quot; this is not a affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; at the Fer@@ rell was selected because of their identity as the heart of the film . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who sp@@ ills this energy , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it is not a coinci@@ dence , although she was at the front front , because with a life on these cru@@ m@@ ations than a black , gay woman is so much on the game . &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile the news cameras have gone long in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , but the r@@ acial connections between the church and the police exist . &quot;
Fer@@ rell is for granting 2 ½ years due to the block of a highway in a demonstration .
&quot; it describes the social policy atmosphere of the area , which she calls her home : &quot; a chaos . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , she agrees to a voc@@ als and she feels committed to that memory since three years ago in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on went on the road three years ago . &quot;
it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we must love and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;

&quot; but the idea of a shopping centre at the southern exposure of the pedestrian zone has been out@@ dated since the first presentation , 2009 the population in pro@@ pon@@ ents and opponents . &quot;
cold leaves the subject hardly any one .
also on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; will be discussed .
&quot; while the one to the bit Galerie say : &quot; &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; &quot; that would be real great &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; does not need a human &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or quite simply : &quot; &quot; w@@ ahn ! &quot; &quot; ( L@@ ars Sch@@ olz ) . &quot;
&quot; during the pro@@ pon@@ ents build that a gallery more customers can benefit into the city , which also profit the remaining business , fear that the pedestrian zone ble@@ eding . &quot;
&quot; added : the gallery is planned exactly on the plot on which the farmers market hall stands , in the 13 direct market their products . &quot;
with the beginning of construction work will thus be an end .
&quot; the gallery Mach@@ er want to integrate a market hall in the new building , and for the Bed@@ a place , with the possibility of sitting outside sitting . &quot;
Simone Rooms : &quot; we have been almost weekly in the farmers market for many years .
&quot; mostly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the rural fr@@ auen always very will@@ ingly . &quot;
also the but@@ chers we discovered for us .
we would like to wish that during and above all after the construction of the gallery an opportunity to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also this .
especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ensing : &quot; whether direct marketed in a market hall in the gallery will come to the amount of rent .
&quot; however , this is not likely to be low in the new project . &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what is shopping in Bit@@ burg ?
&quot; clothes , shoes , Dro@@ ger@@ ie@@ - or supermarkets : I find the super@@ flu@@ ous . &quot;
there are already enough in our city .
&quot; however , one sees how many stores stores here are empty - some have been here for months and years . &quot;
&quot; but there is not even a proper weekly market , it is the more important that us at least get the market hall . &quot;
&quot; after all , the goods offered there is fresh@@ ly fresh , is mostly offered directly from the producer and is above @-@ purely inexpensive . &quot;
&quot; as one sees , store shops in a shopping center can only be registered by larger companies for a retail@@ er often not portable . &quot;
&quot; too bad , special shops there is almost no more and what still exists , will probably be disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ trading : &quot; a shopping center with a market hall does not fit together for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
especially : where is the farmers market hall during construction time ?
the old E@@ DE@@ KA would be the solution - even if the bit Gallery is actually coming here .
or does it create the bit bit bit Galerie to sell all the shops from Bit@@ burg ?
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; this is simply not going to work .
&quot; and a shopping center , that is empty , no one needs no . &quot;
&quot; in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farm market , instead of this gallery . &quot;
but for a farmers market hall you give it thanks to the w@@ ahn@@ sin@@ ess many - as I find - sensu@@ less construction projects in Bit@@ ch no place anymore .
when the farmers market hall is broken down again a piece of culture will disappear .
a suitable simil@@ arity : artist creates portra@@ its with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
in the middle of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York are many faces to see - white , black and bra@@ une that are almost un@@ noticeable same - which hang on cables from the ceiling . &quot;
the 30 portra@@ its were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ tions and hair@@ styles that were sent to her by Chelsea M@@ anning .
M@@ anning sent out the excer@@ pts from the prison Fort Le@@ ave worth where the former secret service analy@@ tic was a 35 @-@ year arrest . after they made a secret diplomatic messages about the Wi@@ ki@@ Le@@ aks website .
&quot; the new exhibition that was opened on 2 August , is called A Bec@@ oming res@@ emb@@ lance ( A suitable simil@@ arity ) . &quot;
&quot; it is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline was transformed its expertise in technology , computer sciences and art , and m@@ anning , whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama as he had only three days in his office . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has created by the algorithms analysis of DNA that could be extrac@@ ted by M@@ anning , such as someone can be interpreted with these gen@@ om@@ ic data - the many ways , as they can be interpreted and the in@@ curing determ@@ in@@ ism of these inter@@ pret@@ ations - but also for identity . &quot;
&quot; M@@ anning which was born as Bra@@ d@@ ley Edward , but already since its pu@@ ber@@ ty openly spoken about identification as a woman , in 2013 was sentenced to 20 counts , including six violations against the Sp@@ ion@@ ag@@ eg@@ es@@ etz , computer fraud and theft . &quot;
&quot; through the prison her picture was oppressed , so much that there was only a single photo - a qu@@ aint , black @-@ white bl@@ f@@ ie , in which M@@ anning is evident un@@ argu@@ ably on a driver and a plat@@ el@@ blonde Perl - with which she was associated . &quot;
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg just came from the great success of their 2012 project &apos; stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions &apos; .
&quot; in this , the artist portra@@ yed by foreigners from for@@ ensi@@ c arti@@ facts like cigar@@ ette mu@@ mel and C@@ aug@@ um@@ mi by re@@ extract the DNA from the fall to produce a picture of how these people could look like . &quot;
that was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper mag@@ azin .
&quot; they led an interview with Chelsea M@@ anning , while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press show of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; and she could not be visited at this time , and she could not be photograph@@ ed , so they took contact with Chelsea , and asked them if they wanted a DNA portrait . &quot;
the artist and their imprison@@ ed m@@ use were inter@@ rup@@ ting Bri@@ eff@@ ected that inter@@ changeable several letters over the course of two years .
they did even illustrate one of Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o illustrates the Com@@ ic &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images , who would have to convert a future in which the President of Ch@@ ali@@ as judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot;
&quot; that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ings release after seven brutal years in a military event in K@@ ans@@ as was a welcome kind of happy to@@ g@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; there is also now at the opening of the exhibition a bit deep and Star@@ kes , since Donald Tru@@ mp takes a war against Inform@@ atics from the government camps and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , un@@ fold paths that it should actually fix , further down . &quot;
&quot; as De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg after the strange timing of all these things was asked , she said that &quot; things come from a certain reason . &quot;
&quot; in one on the wall of the Gallery of the written artistic statement called M@@ anning with her over@@ big description including ( &quot; &quot; i &quot; in their family name is provided with a heart ) an end of &quot; automatic tick @-@ pl@@ ings , whose basic sex , race , sexu@@ ality and culture have been . &quot;
on the opposite wall its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a Millennium of C@@ s and GS and As , in pencil . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hop@@ ed , due to the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or no@@ c@@ le@@ ot@@ id after the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist ) , how amazing similarly , at least in biological ways , we all are . &quot;
&quot; what people will hopefully take to take care of who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective them are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works from 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , also to see . &quot;
DNA data can tell so many different stories so they are 30 of these stories .
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room , is a page from the above mentioned Com@@ ic @-@ No@@ vel@@ le . &quot;
&quot; it shows M@@ anning , as they appear with a Fre@@ is@@ pre@@ ch@@ phone in hand from the disciplines in the United States like King of Hong Kong . &quot;
&quot; if they face your speech , then they have won &quot; , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; so , never forget the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter that she wrote me , &quot; said the artist who greeted from Philadelphia . &quot;
&quot; I still get go@@ ose , when I speak about it . &quot;
&quot; M@@ anning has not yet seen the exhibition - as it was pres@@ sive in the Com@@ ic@@ book pre - but if they should do it , then they will be welcomed in the middle of the room from the mas@@ ks , characterized by their own gen@@ om@@ ic sim@@ ulations , who merge themselves as hor@@ des of proteins . &quot;
&quot; that was also focused , as all in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ings St@@ atur ) , where their genetic h@@ ap@@ logical groups were written with pencil . &quot;
&quot; in the past I had it on the wall , but I wanted to feel like a crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portra@@ its . &quot;
&quot; I wanted that it feels like a mass movement that feels with Chelsea , as the movement , which was also behind their liberation . &quot;
Professor of the University of North@@ west and was sought by the University of Oxford because of killing
a country @-@ wide human hunt is underway for a professor at the North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford which had been looked after a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with fat@@ al injuries .
&quot; on Monday , for Wyn@@ d@@ ham La@@ sen ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest on the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au presented as the acts of the Official Regional Court of C@@ ook County . &quot;
&quot; the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , after several pins died . &quot;
a part of the police agency of Chicago publ@@ ishes shared warning system that the Lei@@ che was discovered on 27 July .
&quot; officials received a call , came to the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the sacrifice with several injuries in his body . &quot;
&quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared dead , and det@@ ec@@ tives examine the foundations as murder , while the police actively seek after the two susp@@ ects , said officials . &quot;
La@@ it has been extraordinary Professor for Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at the North@@ western University since 2007 .
&quot; Alan K. Cu@@ bb@@ age , the Vice @-@ president for University relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ it was now in an email and from the prayer of the campus of North@@ west University was excluded . &quot;
&quot; this is now a criminal issue that is examined by the competent authorities , and the North@@ western University co@@ operates at this investigation , &quot; said Cu@@ bb@@ ons . &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; a spokes@@ man of the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that we are in touch with the police in the UK , in contact and ready to help the U.S. Re@@ mitt@@ ance authorities in any way . &quot;
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens colleagues were sho@@ cked and wish that he set himself .
&quot; Chief Communications Officer of the Police Authority of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he urge the susp@@ ects to ask the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police have a conception of their stay , and our efforts to locate them , reinforce Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said , the police received a call from the building of the Grand @-@ Plaza building that had just received a pu@@ zz@@ ling tip , the said that in apartment 1008 has happened . &quot;
the police drive the scene as a very cru@@ el .
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said , it was un@@ clear whether the incident took place on 27 July . &quot;
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ ws and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation of the inhabitants : &quot; &quot; the police works at the tim@@ eline and the background of the O@@ pole and expl@@ ores a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will complete the WA@@ DA roadmap in the near future &quot; - the Russian Viz@@ ep@@ re@@ mi@@ er Mut@@ ko
&quot; the Russian Viz@@ ep@@ re@@ mi@@ er Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said , it won &apos;t take long until the remaining criteria of the world anti @-@ intelligence agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ doping Agency ( R@@ USA@@ DA ) . &quot;
&quot; at a certain stage of fulfillment of the criteria of the bicycle , R@@ USA@@ DA has the right to plan and test in collaboration with UK@@ AD ( UK anti @-@ doping ) . &quot;
&quot; the WA@@ DA roadmap was updated in this respect , &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the PM commented on the second part of the Plan of the WA@@ DA to comply with the Code , which describes the criteria for the re@@ composition of R@@ USA@@ DA and recently published on the website of the organization . &quot;
according to Mut@@ ko he does not contain anything that could cause for Russia reason .
&quot; everything was announced , everything is being implemented . &quot;
&quot; and the results will be submitted to the International Olympic Committee ( I@@ OC ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , he added . &quot;
&quot; however , one of the criteria mentioned in the list respects the Russian anti @-@ doping authorities reported the reported results obtained by the WA@@ DA approved by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren to publicly co @-@ ordin@@ ated by D@@ op@@ ings in Russian sports . &quot;
&quot; in regards to the matter Mut@@ ko : &quot; we carry out the investigation by , since our anti @-@ doping system has been a fault . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there was no state programs , and we will not admit something that does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Mut@@ kos &apos;s words voted with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the head of independent Russian anti @-@ intelligence Commission . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with the Russian sales point R@@ Sport at the beginning of the day Sm@@ ir@@ nov had been added to the past in Russian anti @-@ doping organisations , but then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report is contro@@ versi@@ al positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; nobody has to accept this report uncondi@@ tionally , &quot; Sm@@ ir@@ nov added . &quot;
R@@ USA@@ DA was eliminated in November 2015 when the WA@@ DA was excluded from the implementation of D@@ op@@ ing@@ controlled in Russia in November 2015 .
&quot; however , you have been allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ doping ( UK@@ AD ) . &quot;
&quot; after a visit to the headquarters of the Organisation in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA @-@ General Director Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli , that R@@ USA@@ DA moved in the right direction &quot; &quot; moved to again . &quot;
Al@@ di sold only no eggs sold
this shared the business groups .
&quot; it handmade in order to have a pure precautions , it could not continue to pass by no health draw@@ backs , it was in the message . &quot;
&quot; from now on , only eggs can only be delivered to Al@@ di that have been tested negative on fi@@ ref@@ il@@ hal@@ ously Anti @-@ L@@ äus@@ em@@ ittel . &quot;
Al@@ di wants to make clarity and transparency to its customers .
&quot; the start @-@ ups , which will help your business will not become the next U@@ ber &quot;
A@@ my Cre@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure the luck with your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up but the surveys did not function .
&quot; answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; and even if you talked to an@@ onym@@ ity , some workers were not talking to the process . &quot;
&quot; there was simply never consistency and objec@@ tivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce H@@ air Care Society Ma@@ dison Reed . &quot;
it was called people from outside to help .
&quot; a new race of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is at w@@ ax@@ ing to help companies to find out how their employees feel . &quot;
&quot; by creating and licensing of software that has the specific purpose of the measurement of staff commitment , it allows companies to provide surveys , speci@@ fic@@ s groups and demo@@ graphic groups to offer , employees an@@ onym@@ ity and complaint handling , the C @-@ suite managers to deal with and directly to the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; they now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for the persecution of their health , but where is Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; &quot; said J@@ im Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive Officer at Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software Analytics tools used by companies to measure staff commitment . &quot;
salvation said that they have a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t .
&quot; in addition to the Sn@@ ap @-@ surveys and surveys of certain teams , there is a heat card of the company , which shows most complaints and what managers have low addi@@ tives results - so that you can watches . &quot;
&quot; the company will come to see that at the top of the workplace culture , so that you won &apos;t be the next u@@ ber that has been published in sc@@ and@@ als since then a former employee has published a blog post , which have spoken an environment of expos@@ ures , where those who have spoken , pun@@ ished . &quot;
for start @-@ ups like G@@ lin@@ t this desire is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity .
&quot; global governance , regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion in 2020 , after the financing technical website let &apos;s talk Pay@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up conver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and identify a rising behavior and activity at the beginning of this year in the midst of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ cent has nearly 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la . &quot;
u@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
&quot; how G@@ lin@@ t , conver@@ cent companies can send tailor @-@ made &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , confidential answers in real time and view the warmth maps of your problem areas . &quot;
&quot; it also offers an anonymous SMS hotline , with the employees of bad behaviour . &quot;
&quot; and if the chief executive guide is included , complaints direct to the Supervisory Board . &quot;
&quot; the court of public opinion is recorded the regul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Conver@@ cent . &quot;
&quot; if a company is found that his staff is treated poor@@ ly treated or un@@ ethical , it can be precious consequences by consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , workers &quot; escape and kis@@ ses , &quot; said Qu@@ in@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant @-@ chain with more than 25@@ ,000 employees and over 500 locations , conver@@ cent for more than one year to ensure that staff are aware of politics and procedures and an easy way to achieve their company headquarters . &quot;
&quot; earlier , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she found a phone number or email for the company headquarters , a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; it was often a in@@ tim@@ id@@ ation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Co@@ uns@@ el , who said there was no good opportunity to track the complaints from employees . &quot;
&quot; well , since the company uses conver@@ cent problems , problems that have previously been hidden in offices in cities or countries - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unauthorized internship - faster and addressed . &quot;
&quot; I can near@@ er to this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view into the experience of employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who manages the risk management Group of Ruby Tuesday . &quot;
and we protect our shareholders on employment law .
&quot; companies began to feed ethics , values and employees involvement in 2002 after the accounting company Arthur Ander@@ sen due to ethical violations by the En@@ ron @-@ sc@@ andal said Qu@@ in@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; but it took until the &quot; social media came to their right , &quot; that corporations realized that you could not prevent their dirty che@@ eses online . &quot;
&quot; before using technology to monitor the ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; both G@@ lin@@ t and conver@@ cent offer your software as a service , and bel@@ lows the companies with recur@@ ring fees for the use of their products . &quot;
it is a business model and a chance that will find the approval of Venture Capital investors which have supported both start @-@ ups .
&quot; conver@@ cent received $ 10 million in financing in February of companies such as Sap@@ ph@@ ire Ventures and T@@ ola Capital , which was raised the entire capital to $ 47 million . &quot;
&quot; Gl@@ itz@@ ers attended by $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners , and brought its entire financing to $ 60 million . &quot;
&quot; these investments are hardly surprising , given the networked nature of companies , culture and venture capital . &quot;
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees more expect from their jobs than before .
in competitive markets like Si@@ licon Valley are high sal@@ aries and interesting projects just inser@@ ts .
the employees want to feel that you are accepted and valued and that you give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to feel in a company that &apos;s their voices are worthwhile , then they feel stronger to make this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Employe@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which is used both Conver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
investors reach R@@ end@@ its when their portfolio companies are well run . company run good when employees are committed and committed .
&quot; if the Analytics tools are promising , commitment and commitment to employees , it is no wonder that you will find support . &quot;
the data on staff engagement according to the experts of the workplace culture is important .
but the data are us@@ eless if the administrator of a company does not take action .
&quot; in fact , if a company asks for your feedback , it can have a expectation that change on the way . &quot;
&quot; and if the change does not come fast enough , or not at all , this can be dis@@ rupted and dem@@ oti@@ ves . &quot;
&quot; if you ask for more than 4,000 suggestions , you must have prepared to have 4,000 talks , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , who have seen themselves very much on collecting data . &quot;
&quot; for if you do not follow employees , &quot; &quot; have you really heard me ? &quot;
do you care about it ?
and who don &apos;t care about why should I go ?
&quot; Ma@@ dison Reed , who now performs a monthly employee surveys , was able to engage in action on the same day when a problem is reported about G@@ lin@@ t , so Er@@ ret@@ t . &quot;
&quot; and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated workers , she was able to re@@ organize multiple teams within the company and add multiple teams within the company and add a communication training to tackle the problems . &quot;
&quot; with Ruby Tuesday , the company gets new insights on the employees , and it hopes that in a long term , this leads to a better binding of workers in a industry that is known for high turnover . &quot;
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose man , &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you lose also customers . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose customers , then you will lose businesses . &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for Bru@@ ins
&quot; it is available at 23 o &apos;clock , when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ ers are enter@@ tained on one side of the new exercises of the team on the campus . &quot;
&quot; some have moved their tribute , and show the back full of swe@@ at from the first day of the training camp . &quot;
for a good part of the team they represent a lunch break .
&quot; players who are written to the summer days , will return after the thir@@ st exercise to their final examination , before going back next morning at 6 : 30@@ pm to the water@@ man Football Center . &quot;
&quot; this is for the guys the next three days a real trekking mill , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer J@@ im Mor@@ a just before the Monday to Tuesday was closed . &quot;
&quot; the N@@ CA@@ A eliminated two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the burden of players , and she has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the first three trainings of the U@@ C@@ LA at 19 : 15 will start to meet the already completed time schedules of the player . &quot;
&quot; the compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Br@@ ins postponed the beginning of the Camp@@ s almost one week after the last season postponed during the summer time during the summer time in West@@ wood practical exercises . &quot;
they should hold 18 exercises in the course of August 18 exercises . 20 before the beginning of the formal game preparations for their pre@@ lu@@ de against Texas A &amp; M in September .
&quot; Mor@@ a said , he said the rules of the N@@ CA@@ A support , even if they add the many busy routes of the player to add another point . &quot;
&quot; we put this enormous load three or four days on them , and it is very challenging &quot; , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; and they simply pushed it , they plac@@ ements themselves , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; I think as soon as we come up to Saturday and we have more time , it really will be great . &quot;
&quot; the U@@ C@@ LA will end up its practices as soon as the camp is finished , which given the clear sight@@ line of its fields from an adjacent parking and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the up@@ scale class , which has already been planted with foot , no easy task . &quot;
&quot; Bru@@ ins @-@ Player should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a dre@@ amed that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far to think that people can hire a room and then set up there to draw a exercise . &quot;
&quot; if you have the video from an exercise , it is a fairly good deal . &quot;
&quot; but we have security forces there , and we have security forces at parking 8 . &quot;
we will do the best with what we have .
so I do not have too big worries .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensify facts in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit news
&quot; Facebook wants to send more potential articles with Fal@@ sch@@ ed@@ ging of third parties , and then show their results under the original application , said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News . &quot;
&quot; the company said in a statement on his website , that it will begin with the use of updated machine methods to recognize possible fal@@ seh@@ ood , and to send them to fac@@ simile , which may display the results of the sample @-@ check out of the original article . &quot;
&quot; Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News , of which many believe that they also have influenced the U.S. presidential elections . &quot;
&quot; the problem is also become a major political issue in Europe with the French voters in advance of the presidential elections in May with false stories , and Germany supports a plan to pun@@ ish the social media networks , if it does not manage to eliminate h@@ asser@@ ted post@@ ings as before the elections in September quickly . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate declaration in German , that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany have launched a test of the new facts check . &quot;
&quot; in addition to knowledge , which stories of fact @-@ handed over the third parties want to meet the people more context to sound decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara S@@ u , Product man@@ ag@@ ress for Facebook @-@ News in a blog . &quot;
&quot; you added that Facebook will continue to test its feature to the &quot; &quot; test &quot; &quot; and to other changes to his messages , to reduce false messages . &quot;
creating a Com@@ ic @-@ novel : a lock in the history of England
&quot; in his younger past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a Squ@@ ee@@ ze music video and was for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ he and 1980 @-@ er years . &quot;
&quot; however , Scot@@ ney has witnessed 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from its cozy seat in the Guar@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and is now available for inspiration for a graphical novel by Jam@@ ie Rhodes , a m@@ op@@ ha@@ ari@@ gen Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents . &quot;
&quot; I find it so nice to look at the manus@@ cript of someone who is dead , who has been dead for 300 years . &quot;
what a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand .
&quot; a Castle in England &apos;s sp@@ ans the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scot@@ ney - Isaac Di@@ ie@@ wi@@ cz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isa@@ bel Green@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book of Rhodes that is based on an archive : he wrote 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he was unexpected . &quot;
&quot; I have only re@@ acted on the thum@@ b pressure on the site of a letter so that was written by a col@@ ag@@ enten in the 1700 &apos;s years , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is his thum@@ b pressure ! &quot;
&quot; and letters always cra@@ w@@ ling after smoke , because at that time you have a fire because of the light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect , as if he himself did . &quot;
&quot; Oh , I love Archives ! &quot;
&quot; for someone who is so with old papers is that he will be supported by National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; &quot; honestly , &quot; ) seems to be too beautiful in order to be true . &quot;
&quot; Rhodes spent his days to study the Vietnam@@ ese &quot; new &quot; castle , the archives go to the walls and the many treasures and curiosity of the castle , such as the mon@@ archy of the castle , and the bottles , the centuries spent in the dit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; he emig@@ rated by the terrain and the ruins of the old castle , and spoke with coun@@ ties , gardening and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; then , at night he d@@ rank &quot; wh@@ is@@ key and started to write . &quot;
&quot; the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust was first received the full access as the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died . &quot;
&quot; as an Rhodes a decade later , the staff started to take care of the archive which he said as &quot; hundreds of years , in which Arist@@ ocr@@ ats said &quot; Oh , wir@@ f it on the loft . &quot;
&quot; Tag@@ eb@@ ags , letters from the time of English Emp@@ ires , cards , who , who had said , &quot; &quot; you could mean that landing will be boring , &quot; &quot; says Rhodes , &quot; but there was a Bir@@ ch to have fought the two families . &quot;
guys , let everything go down ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to enter into the English story , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; who leaves a man who leaves the newly built castle in order to join the farmer of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a record from a tur@@ mo@@ il , the 13@@ 80 in the castle appeared , in this book with the title &apos; Kn@@ ight@@ ly family of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; says Rhodes . &quot;
&quot; the farm started in this area and I thought , an u@@ prising was a good start . &quot;
perhaps the two are connected to each other ? &quot;
&quot; other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - as &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , who told the story of the Jes@@ u@@ it , who hi@@ d the family of Dar@@ rell seven years during the English Reformation . &quot;
&quot; or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ ator &apos;s , in which the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers Arthur Dar@@ rell was shown from the 18th century by filled a coff@@ in with rocks ( a discovery , which was only years later when his Sar@@ g was excav@@ ated ) . &quot;
&quot; the Dar@@ rel@@ le are Rhodes &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; &quot; the gentlemen seemed to be quite honest g@@ aun@@ er to keep on debt and spend money for things that they could not afford to afford . &quot;
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ rell @-@ men proceeds their debt crisis , giving them rich old wives - I imagine it as a p@@ ile well @-@ looking guys before , with a talent to advertise Er@@ bin@@ nen . &quot;
after the end of his use in the castle Rhodes is on the search for other unique shot experiences
&quot; he has brought a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a com@@ ic novel about Alsace , dating back to the early 20th century , which has since been restored by nature since then . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back again , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; Oh , now I must be ready again with the dam@@ n life . &quot;
campaign launched : more than 300 years old Marien@@ chapel in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
&quot; with the envel@@ ope of the 301 year old Marien@@ chapel in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the City of Bad Honnef on Friday started its campaign to introduce a new roof @-@ brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) . &quot;
&quot; even until Thursday , Mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team to hold Nel@@ son Art@@ z the logo and the slogan . &quot;
at the end of August it is intended to give a feast on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; too beautiful for us .
&quot; or ? &quot; , &quot; ask the makers of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer chapel . &quot;
&quot; we think that ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; write them on their yesterday released website . &quot;
but we use this measure to gain your attention .
and to make clear that man@@ ure is better than it seems .
&quot; basically , we are firmly convinced that we as a bath Hon@@ ne@@ fer citizen to know the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot;
&quot; in action it is more than &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , is it further . &quot;
&quot; it is true to form@@ ulate an allergi@@ c promise , one that gives the city a distinctive character . &quot;
&quot; finally , they stand in the competition with other municipalities . &quot;
&quot; the city of Bad Honnef will be the city of Bad Honnef , its new umbrella @-@ brand and the campaign . &quot;
military re@@ forms in Turkey - Earth - fear of the army
each year at the beginning of August advis@@ es in Ankara of the Ober@@ est military Council ( Y@@ AS ) on Pensi@@ on@@ ations and tran@@ sports in the Off@@ iz@@ ier@@ sk@@ or@@ ps .
so also this week .
at first glance a normal procedure .
but nothing is routine at Turkish forces a year after the coup .
&quot; the meeting did not place any more in the building of the general letter , as before , but in the office of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; during the presidency of the Heads of State , the five Vice President and the Minister of Defense , Home , Justice and Foreign Affairs took part . &quot;
&quot; thus , the civilians in Y@@ AS were in the number of people . &quot;
the government moves the to@@ es in the military .
&quot; President Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the comm@@ anders of the he@@ eres , the air forces and the Navy have been dis@@ placed . &quot;
since the failed Cou@@ p has consolidated Erd@@ og@@ an 169 of the 326 Gener@@ als and Admir@@ als .
&quot; more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleg@@ ed connections to the movement of the exile @-@ Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , the Erd@@ og@@ an as a wire @-@ attraction of the coup . &quot;
&quot; against 486 people who have been participating in the coup , will be involved in Ankara since this week . &quot;
&quot; already on the day after the coup Erd@@ og@@ an had referred to the overthrow as a &quot; divine gift , &quot; as he give him the opportunity to puri@@ fy the armed forces &quot; . &quot; &quot;
but has Erd@@ og@@ an the army really under control ?
&quot; at the end of February the newspaper &quot; &quot; hur@@ ri@@ yet &quot; &quot; article with the heading &quot; &quot; discomfort in the military @-@ chief &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the general strike it concerns concerns about the increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which is among others in the abolition of the head@@ sc@@ arf ban for Sol@@ dat@@ ors , wrote the newspaper . &quot;
the large fle@@ ece near the army and the security forces continues at any rate .
&quot; mid July he left Erd@@ og@@ an by decre@@ e further , state duty , including 230@@ 3 Poli@@ zi@@ sten and 5@@ 46 soldiers . &quot;
it seemed that Erd@@ og@@ an began the military .
the gener@@ als earlier than the actual men of the country .
three times put@@ ted them under calling on their role as guar@@ dians of the world@@ ly state .
&quot; after his election of 2002 , Erd@@ og@@ an passed the power of the military step by step , not least by calling on the reform@@ ists of the European Union . &quot;
&quot; former officers say , Erd@@ og@@ an is targeted by a Islam@@ ization of the armed forces . &quot;
&quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; V@@ oc@@ al Europe &quot; &quot; had not been killed in the magazine &quot; V@@ oc@@ al Europe &quot; which was sought after the coup against persecution in foreign countries asylum , who will be the Turkish army in a few years &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and sal@@ af@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; meets this , such development could not leave the N@@ ato . &quot;
&quot; anyway , in the alliance , there is a doubt about the deployment of the Turkish army . &quot;
&quot; the leadership structures and operational abilities are &quot; &quot; weak@@ ened &quot; , &quot; say N@@ ato diplom@@ ats . &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
&quot; there will be a new U.S. immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tru@@ mp , quoted from the media . &quot;
&quot; he sees to lower the legal immig@@ rant to 50.000 per year , stric@@ ter rules for obtaining vis@@ as and limitations for families @-@ oriented visa . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the re@@ public@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and increase billions of dollars for tax@@ payers and will do this by the US will be able to change the way from other countries of Green Cards . &quot;
the law will prevent the chains to prevent the chains and replace the current system .
&quot; this new application procedure will come to the candidate who speak English , which will have the financial means to support themselves and knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; said Tru@@ mp , quoted from the American media . &quot;
Ministry intends to relax route for racing
&quot; over the past few months over the future of the race growing sh@@ utt@@ les , it was supposed to go very quickly . &quot;
&quot; even before the end of the year , at the mar@@ o@@ den route , on which the tourist circuit is to be built . &quot;
&quot; to ensure the future of the race growing sh@@ utt@@ les in the long term , we are supposed to begin by the traffic of the traffic in this year . &quot;
&quot; with the decision , the route of Il@@ men@@ au @-@ rac@@ er continues to order and re@@ alizing , the country is especially important for tourism , &quot; declared traffic Secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Erfurt . &quot;
the cost of rep@@ airing the route is about 2.5 million euros .
&quot; by this sum , the land takes 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; the contract , based upon which the shuttle is to be ordered also in the future from the country , I will finally be tuned , &quot;
the ministry and the south @-@ east railway as operators are already agreed on the technical details .
&quot; this means that the roadmap , the used vehicles and quality standards are tra@@ ded , &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
thus the race @-@ rigid @-@ shuttle will be ordered on December 2017 .
the racing @-@ wearing shuttle is one of the most popular rail link between the railway stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ et .
&quot; over the past few months , in the course of a pilot plant , if the route was used by sufficient many people to order them in the future again . &quot;
the track is also very cold in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should worry
&quot; just as you thought it may not be crazy , a new report comes about technological developments in the field of sex robots . &quot;
&quot; yes , actually . &quot;
sex @-@ robots are currently a big thing .
&quot; recently published the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for responsible Robotics ) ( FR@@ R ) , a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years . &quot;
&quot; according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , em@@ eri@@ ved Professor of Robotics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we must start their Ascension seriously . &quot;
customers can choose the eye color of the robot to choose his shape of the ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of fingers .
&quot; the people make themselves funny , but the companies deliver every quantity of it , and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; &quot; said Mr. Shar@@ key in the publication of his new report . &quot;
modern sex pupp@@ ets have developed from their infl@@ atable partners with a si@@ licon @-@ skin that feels warm - with deliber@@ ately human reactions to be achieved by the artificial intelligence .
&quot; the user can also adjust his robot according to its beliefs &quot; &quot; and therefore select everything from the eye @-@ color of the robot to the type of ni@@ pp@@ le to the type or colour of its f@@ ing@@ geh@@ ogs . &quot;
&quot; but it is still wor@@ rying , as many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; who would look like a step@@ ford @-@ wife . &quot;
modern sex ps have developed to robots with a si@@ licon .
&quot; the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot makes it for example its users to adjust their robots to the properties which they might be appealing , such as sp@@ ch@@ asing . &quot;
&quot; and then there are still those of True Comp@@ an@@ ion developed Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold Sex @-@ robots with pre @-@ programmed personalities like &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which gives the impression of sh@@ ch@@ tern@@ ity and &quot; Wild Wendy &quot; with a &quot; advent@@ urous &quot; personality . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as well as possible , He@@ ating the website of True Comp@@ an@@ ion . &quot;
&quot; so she likes what you like , and she does not like what you may not like , etc . &quot;
she also has her m@@ oods over the course of the day - quite like real people !
&quot; it can be tired , be fixed on conversation or can be &quot; &quot; in mood &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are many disturbing aspects in this ascent of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the under@@ estimated female characteristics , if one goes a step to Fri@@ gi@@ d ( means : contra@@ dic@@ tive ) Far@@ rah . &quot;
on his website True True Comp@@ an@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator but for men .
&quot; if women ( si@@ c ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; is it on the website . &quot;
&quot; however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or simply just another sex . &quot;
their formation and its increasing refin@@ ement point to a bit more dar@@ ker and deeper in our culture to a retreat from the Ideal for gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition .
&quot; most men will of course hold no sex robots , and while the FR@@ R re@@ tains its rising popularity , they remain pro@@ visional on the edge of consumer culture . &quot;
&quot; but what eman@@ ed from the border zones , can be in relation to the spirit of time in which we live , very instruc@@ tive . &quot;
and many people are not strange or revi@@ ving until they give their free market permission .
&quot; however , there is a certain extent that these highly developed sex robots are threatened in a time where the rights of women are threatened around the world , in which there has been in the White House to have women sexually attacked , women sexually attacked . &quot;
&quot; the horri@@ ble aspect of the television series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s Tale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the Mag@@ d &apos; ) are not the graphical images , the en@@ umer@@ ated body and the extinct eyes , but how realistic this vision works . &quot;
&quot; the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment this does not feel like a great leap . &quot;
the goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( if also with por@@ no@@ star propor@@ tions ) .
their buil@@ ders want that they feel humanity to im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; but , on the point when it comes to their &quot; personalities &quot; , the robots do not represent real women . &quot;
they cannot separate yourself from their companions or simply go away .
&quot; they have no mediation or a background story , nothing , which could distur@@ b on independence or anything , which could distur@@ b the fant@@ asy tot@@ ality . &quot;
in other words : they are f@@ eit@@ y slaves .
or to express it in the Re@@ de@@ wise of 2017 : ma@@ ids
Tru@@ m@@ ps great achievement ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney for the in@@ compreh@@ ension of the healthy man .
&quot; it has become a binary of the Tru@@ mp era that the political divisions , which have split the U.S. elect@@ oral pol@@ ari@@ zed , also families in small format . &quot;
around Christmas and Ern@@ t@@ ed@@ ank@@ fest there was in the United States newspapers with advice on how to l@@ end with the hor@@ ror of Tru@@ mp .
we rig@@ orous ourselves all supp@@ osedly to leave our filter bu@@ b@@ bles .
&quot; even less noticed is the power of Tru@@ m@@ ps , families . &quot;
&quot; I have chosen this because my C@@ ous@@ ine , a lin@@ ks@@ y po@@ et who lives in Chicago and has long been visiting with the Republi@@ cans in our family , who has visited this week in New York . &quot;
they reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
&quot; with Tru@@ mp in the White House everybody knows which she knows , including the re@@ publi@@ can relationship , with which she had fought for decades due to politics , suddenly and very peculi@@ ar on the same side . &quot;
&quot; for the dining table this is certainly a good thing , but it falls into a further context that this also involves significant risks . &quot;
&quot; the left was strengthened by Tru@@ mp , but the creation of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right . &quot;
&quot; when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and Tru@@ mp , we refer to the gr@@ us@@ el@@ ty option that we will no longer encounter his m@@ bling of one day . &quot;
&quot; however , there is still a shot @-@ time scenario in the Tru@@ mp re@@ public@@ ans of the right wing &quot; norm@@ alized , &quot; which appear at once in comparison with its standards suddenly as in@@ compreh@@ end of Vern@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; I find myself nowadays about an active no@@ stal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney Roman@@ esque Version of the Cancel - the dog on the Aut@@ od@@ ach , the 14 % income tax ( but at least knew how his tax statement looked ) - both compared to Tru@@ mp in fact , as a very mild criminal off@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; when Tru@@ mp goes , the next candidate of the re@@ public@@ ans must be just spirit@@ ually healthy to qualify as in@@ emp@@ tive improvement . &quot;
&quot; when my c@@ ous@@ ine was in the city , we brought our children to the Car@@ ousel of New York Park@@ department , and the best three dollars , which one can spend in the city , if you don &apos;t have a caffeine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are enormous , the fiber@@ glass designs on the central cy@@ linders - all c@@ low@@ ns are kn@@ ur@@ rig and the animals turn to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and clim@@ bed music gives this in a noticeable way . &quot;
&quot; so many plumbing of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of high buildings are old , the Sky@@ lines become familiar to offer a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city will not meet the dream . &quot;
&quot; fifth thirty years later , and I am still not quite happy about the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is in fact no Swiss Cottage - the theme @-@ pub YE Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not - but a big roundabout in the North of London . &quot;
&quot; however , Central Park Car@@ ousel is still a strange magical experience , as here two two years old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ s can go on it and all have a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could have been able to evaluate the carousel , I could have given him the full score , but fortunately no one was asked . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , I was forced to evaluate my &quot; &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before going through my credit card . &quot;
&quot; in the coffee house , on the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to buy the rating with a 15 % tips . &quot;
&quot; this does not only lead to a slow@@ ing of what actually should be a neutral exchange , but exercise pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation in which no need is required . &quot;
&quot; the poor woman in the department was ap@@ ologi@@ ze gr@@ in@@ ative , while I tired the experience made her credit card with five stars . &quot;
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us to be transferred from prison into hospital
Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit .
&quot; last year , he was brought into hospital because of the treatment of cuts in the hospital , which he was according to the prison authorities , according to a case in his cell . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to an appeal against an appeal against an appeal against an appeal against an appeal .
he d@@ rank Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning hours of St. Valent@@ un@@ days 2013 by taking them several times through a door of the toilet@@ ries in his house in Pre@@ tor@@ ia on her .
&quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his girlfriend for a night intru@@ ders , who hidden himself in the cabin . &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention , this time against the six @-@ year @-@ year warranty of Pist@@ ori@@ us appe@@ ell , from which they say they say . &quot;
&quot; the National Criminal Code said that it will be ab@@ sent to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the claim could be heard this year . &quot;
&quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us runs a danger that his sentence has increased to 15 years , when the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful . &quot;
there are no death penalty in South Africa .

software update for diesel vehicles : what people concerned now have to know
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers need to participate in action ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
&quot; at the Diesel Summit , BMW , Daim@@ ler , Opel and the VW Group updates are offered for a total of around 5,@@ 3 million cars . &quot;
you should improve the exhaust behaviour of cars of emissions from Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ Diesel or worse are exemp@@ t from them .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin by ACE Auto Club Europe gives guidance :
is the new action compulsory ?
no , the tra@@ ded software updates are optional . &quot;
&quot; the binding updates before only apply to the vehicles , the Schum@@ an software , says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
their retro@@ fit has arranged the power station of the Federal Chanc@@ ellery ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
&quot; the manufacturers announced a quick implementation in the coming months , but still no exact date . &quot;
Daim@@ ler has communicated to write every person concerned .
&quot; if anyway , an inspection must be paid , this will be done within their framework . &quot;
how long should the conver@@ sions go to a total of altogether ?
&quot; difficult to say , &quot; means S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
the settlement of the engagement of manufacturers as well as of political pressure .
&quot; because we have seen , voluntarily do not act the aut@@ oh@@ er@@ ers on the environment so far . &quot;
how long is the update to last ?
refurb@@ ishing itself could last only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming can be it to get an appointment .
&quot; what do drivers do , who do not drive a car from BMW , Daim@@ ler , Opel and the VW Group ? &quot;
the ACE tra@@ ys for the wait .
&quot; probably , foreign manufacturers would withdraw , so S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
threat@@ ens a massive price @-@ case of Euro @-@ 4 @-@ cars ?
the ACE fear@@ ed that .
&quot; but just in the regions , where Fahr@@ enheit threat@@ ens . &quot;

&quot; thus , in compliance with the regular notice of cancellation - even enough time for writing . &quot;
&quot; da Has@@ l@@ ach for the administrative community as a sub@@ ordin@@ ator , the applic@@ ant must show the corresponding deduc@@ tions . &quot;
because this function wants to keep the city definitely .
&quot; if they would no longer be able to do this , the citizens would have to drive to consultation until city of Offen@@ burg . &quot;
&quot; but citizens are important to the city and himself , says w@@ acker , who reported by a good farm climate , as well as good mood between authority and citizens . &quot;
&quot; over 30 years in office , some significant projects have collected to look back to the w@@ ackers with pride . &quot;
&quot; we are living the town of living , he is aware of the office and its staff . &quot;
&quot; but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the transform@@ ations of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Area and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen@@ park@@ Square are approximately . &quot;
&quot; the chin @-@ bridge between B@@ oll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium is still subject . &quot;
&quot; the latter will strike up with approximately 1.5 million euros , &quot; if we are &quot; &quot; s correctly &quot; &quot; under@@ h@@ acker . &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks are waiting for my success@@ ors . &quot;
the work here makes fun . &quot;
creative is present for an urban construction of large scope .
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s en &apos;s own building yard and gar@@ den@@ ers can be quite flexible in many cases .
&quot; you can move much &quot; , &quot; so w@@ ler , and the design of green plants will often be mentioned by citizens and visitors . &quot;
&quot; since the old town is as an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to have an eye for what it fits , if new buildings are approved , empha@@ sizes the turn@@ key urban construction . &quot;
&quot; anyway , the urban construction has high responsibility . &quot;
&quot; he is Baumeister , &quot; in the end everything runs here over my table . &quot;
&quot; in case of support and coordination he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( high @-@ building ) has been , Manfred Schön@@ ma@@ ier ( super@@ structure ) for ten years . &quot;
&quot; also that his successor is long , wishes w@@ acker : &quot; we are looking for someone who want to be really identified and stay . &quot;
&quot; continuity is not only important for a good farm , but also for the further development of the city . &quot;
&quot; who wants to inher@@ it Roland &apos;s h@@ acker , should be informed about the city of Has@@ l@@ ach a closed study as a diploma engineer or by Bachelor &apos;s architecture , and have good expertise in the fields of construction and construction law . &quot;

bike on lines thrown : south @-@ route locked
&quot; according to the police , the blue bike carried out the blue bike on the rail guide in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) on the lines . &quot;
these were so strongly damaged that the her@@ end goods must be lifted up .
the investig@@ ators go from two male perpet@@ rat@@ ors and look for the night hours after them .
near the Tat@@ ort the witness of a ros@@ ary bike and a bicycle driver have been observed .
&quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ bu@@ zz &quot; , &quot; said Ö@@ BB @-@ Spe@@ aker Christoph Pos@@ ch at APA . &quot;
the perpet@@ rat@@ ors or the perpet@@ rat@@ ors have brought himself in great danger and also threat@@ ens the train traffic .
&quot; in addition to the damage to the L@@ ok and the system , as well as the delay and the costs for rail transport , even passenger car transfers could also come to the perpet@@ rat@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; overall , be made by a &quot; substantial &quot; sum , &quot; said the speaker . &quot;
&quot; the damage was fixed on Friday afternoon , rail traffic on the south line could be guided without disabilities . &quot;
&quot; just a decade of persons have been a Friday afternoon , two of them are concerned the distant traffic . &quot;
&quot; goods are not made , but they had a delay . &quot;
according to Ö@@ BB @-@ speakers Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be exchanged for around 200 meters
isol@@ ators and ma@@ sts have also been damaged .
&quot; red meat , milk products and chocolate could help , IB@@ D ( En@@ tz@@ oral representations ) . &quot;
red meat and chocolate can sound the diges@@ tion process as a night@@ mare .
&quot; but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet , which is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and milk products , could lead the symptoms of patients with infl@@ amed representations . &quot;
&quot; the incur@@ able condition that affects USA around 1,@@ 3 million and in the UK 300@@ .000 , causes magnets , loss or blo@@ od@@ ation , weight loss and extreme fatigue . &quot;
&quot; while those affected are usually going to avoid meat and dairy products to alle@@ vi@@ ate their symptoms , they found researchers at the Wash@@ ing@@ ton@@ er University that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han from proteins contribute to develop immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant intest@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; the conduc@@ tive researchers , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells in the intest@@ ine , to ensure that dam@@ aging micro@@ bes , which hide in the food , not penet@@ rate into the body . &quot;
&quot; cells that are capable of allow@@ ances , infl@@ amm@@ ation , are balanced by cells , which promote tolerance and protect the body without sensitive tissues . &quot;
&quot; if the balance is too far in the direction of infl@@ amm@@ ation , it may result in an infl@@ am@@ ply result . &quot;
&quot; in experim@@ entation was determined that a kind of tolerance and immun@@ isation of immun@@ ology comes in mice , which carry a particular bacter@@ ium into their initi@@ ates . &quot;
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the blocks of proteins - to dis@@ solve the appearance of cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have a connection between an bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
&quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han had the mice in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he proposed that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and an an tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han rich diet toler@@ ant , less infl@@ ated Dar@@ mm@@ ili@@ eus when the same system also co@@ ke for people . &quot;
&quot; the Post@@ dok@@ tor@@ and@@ in Dr. Luisa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an under@@ sought a kind of immune cell that had found the tolerance that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe who had not accommodated this . &quot;
&quot; it susp@@ ected that the difference had to do with the intest@@ inal @-@ micro@@ bes of mice , viruses and fung@@ us that usually live in the stomach @-@ gut Tra@@ kt . &quot;
&quot; the dy@@ e of mice have been DNA sequ@@ encing and they were found six bacterial species that were present in mice with immune cells , but without them to mice . &quot;
mice were raised in a ster@@ ile environment so that they lack@@ ed a intest@@ inal micro@@ bi@@ ome and they did not have this kind of immune cells and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
&quot; to understand how the bacteria present on the immune system , the researchers showed L. reu@@ ter@@ i in a liquid and then led small quantities of fluid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe imm@@ unity , which were isolated from mice . &quot;
the immune cells developed into toler@@ ated cells .
&quot; when the active component was puri@@ fied from the liquid , it proved to be known as a by @-@ product of the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ met@@ abo@@ ism that is known as In@@ do@@ l @-@ 3 @-@ Mil@@ chs@@ acid . &quot;
&quot; if the researchers re@@ doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the feed of mice , the number of such cells increased by approximately 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ values were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an explained that people have the same toler@@ ated cells such as mice , and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i can protect them in our stomach @-@ representations . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ side products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i , the cells in humans develop as in mice , but defects in gene@@ tics in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han have been found with people with infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory representations . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; The development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote , since these cells control infl@@ amm@@ ation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ines . &quot;
potential can lead high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i to extend this population .
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho thinks that Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic a &quot; geni@@ us has committed
&quot; at Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic a &quot; &quot; geni@@ us &quot; , &quot; believes Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ field player at the mid@@ day evening his debut against Samp@@ dor@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; the 40 million pounds of Chelsea began with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game , before the U@@ EF@@ A Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday begins , and impressive in the Hal@@ ter role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira after Bel@@ i@@ eben . &quot;
&quot; however , MA@@ TIC had been eliminated from the prepar@@ atory @-@ Asia tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes , what M@@ our@@ in@@ ho was that he had to improve before the beginning of the Premier League season . &quot;
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a geni@@ us in the way he thinks - he thinks soccer &quot; , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot;
&quot; we will help him , sooner than later . &quot;
apart from M@@ atic start@@ ups also Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Luk@@ ak@@ u in Avi@@ va @-@ Sta@@ dion as M@@ our@@ in@@ ho his start @-@ XI ready for the beginning of the season .
&quot; the Independent enth@@ s this week , that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho still had three further new commitments , but he insi@@ sted that the Klu@@ b already made a &quot; fantastic job &quot; &quot; three of his four main commitments to fulfil . &quot;
&quot; three of four to get , for this I thank the association , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; I will be happ@@ ier when they get four of four , but they have given great effort . &quot;
Boeing &quot; m@@ alt &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers in the sky .
&quot; the pil@@ ots fle@@ w from Seattle in the US state Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state Michigan and moved to the form of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers over the USA , which are several thousand kilometers . &quot;
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the ra@@ dar sh@@ iel@@ ded the form of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers was to be .
the whole thing was a constant test for new engines .
Boeing had already made such advertising earlier .
&quot; thus the number &quot; &quot; 787 &quot; &quot; and the Boeing @-@ logo was painted in the sky . &quot;
&quot; new Tief@@ rest for Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a problem &quot;
&quot; like the wind yet , as Sig@@ mar Gabriel still SPD boss was , looked after social @-@ democratic Prime Minister before elections always with a certain concern to Berlin . &quot;
&quot; just not a disturbing fire from the Party central , just no counter@@ wind from the covenant - so much the most important wish of the elect@@ oral struggles . &quot;
&quot; since Martin Schulz , the party has changed fundamentally . &quot;
&quot; since then , the employees from the Willy Brandt of the Willy Brandt has been watching the events in the SPD @-@ governed State Capit@@ als . &quot;
&quot; what Schulz received from there since the beginning of the year , it would not be described in the approach . &quot;
there were hot sur@@ charges .
and indeed one after another .
the federal government @-@ CD@@ U will look after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Niedersachsen with a general signal against co@@ ali@@ tions by SPD and Green .
&quot; this shows once more : red @-@ green can simply not be re@@ igned &quot; , &quot; said CD@@ U @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber the editorial network in Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
the surprisingly frac@@ tures of a Green Members has over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) into a severe crisis .
five months before the Sunday election lost its red @-@ green coalition with its A @-@ vote majority on the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green Managing Director Michael Kell@@ ner has promp@@ ted the Ab@@ sin@@ ful Nieder@@ s@@ äch@@ sische Green Valley El@@ ke T@@ iny to return to their mandate .
the crossing to the CD@@ U means a clear understanding of the elect@@ oral .
&quot; El@@ ke T@@ iny must immediately return its mandate , &quot; said the Federal Managing Director and elect@@ oral campaign of the Green Network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; this must not be true at all , se@@ ated a SPD constitu@@ ents , as on Friday morning the new Hi@@ ob@@ s@@ message was reached the party central . &quot;
&quot; Stephan W@@ eil , SPD @-@ prime minister of Lower Saxony , stands after crossing the green members of El@@ ke T@@ BC on the CD@@ U without own government . &quot;
it is the pro@@ visional height of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD feder@@ ations .
and no one knows what comes next .
the Mis@@ ere began with the unexpected defeat at the Saarland election in March .
&quot; a blue eye , more not , so@@ othing the comrades of the time . &quot;
after the parliamentary elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia will be everything differently .
this was then - and indeed everything was considerably worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to d@@ oves the party @-@ side hau@@ te the party smooth .
&quot; lab@@ orious , the comrades in the weeks after that come back . &quot;
&quot; then when they had just had new courage , the G @-@ 20 @-@ summit came from Hamburg . &quot;
and with him the next stop came .
&quot; O@@ laf Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD @-@ Land@@ esch@@ ef , lost his n@@ im@@ bus because he sat in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmony , while his city burned . &quot;
&quot; and because he was in the crisis communication , then pretty everything was wrong , what you can do wrong . &quot;
since then Sch@@ olz struggles for its political survival .
now also Stephan W@@ eil .
&quot; due to the VW @-@ exhaust and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Nieder@@ s@@ äch@@ sische Prime Minister had already been in criticism for a long time . &quot;
mi@@ ese turn was added .
&quot; nevertheless , or perhaps just so , W@@ eil tried over the past weeks ever stronger , in the case of the acc@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; the ambition of the former Mayor of Hannover , to develop his power in Berlin , also remained hidden in the surroundings of Martin Schulz . &quot;
they let him allow him as she said by W@@ eil a stabili@@ zation of the party .
&quot; now , the exact opposite could enter . &quot;
there is W@@ eil at the cross @-@ party internal compul@@ si@@ fication Gre@@ ens in essence no fault .
and Schulz is not at all .
&quot; sometimes , the comrades strive to hold its own ranks . &quot;
&quot; your wrath is aimed at the Gre@@ ens , and above all on the sin@@ ks of parliament@@ arians in Western Europe . &quot;
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democr@@ acies , such as woman , their own careers over the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , Chief of the Party of Party in the SPD Bundestag , the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; Ms. T@@ iny is not elected because of its person as a direct can@@ did@@ atin , but on the state list of the Nieder@@ s@@ äch@@ sische Gre@@ ens to the Parliament , so the low @-@ Sax@@ on member states continue . &quot;
the logical consequence would be that she returns their mandate back .
&quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , Chief of the SPD Bundestag , is a &quot; un@@ democratic man@@ eu@@ ver . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the voting w@@ ille four years ago was clear : the people have made Stephan W@@ eil for the Prime Minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who carries the Nieder@@ s@@ äch@@ sische SPD as the nickname in the Bundestag , the R@@ ND . &quot;
&quot; now the personal career of a future CD@@ U members of the vote &quot; , &quot; Op@@ per@@ mann said . &quot;
he called to clarify the backgrounds .
I want to know if more has been or there has been further endor@@ sement of the CD@@ U Lower Saxony .
conveyor belt for the center III
who wants to be commented in the years to get back from the country soon .
&quot; in addition , Mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representative St@@ eg Stadt@@ development on Wednesday in delicate . &quot;
at the beginning of the information event Sch@@ ind@@ ler has once again a look back to the present events .
since 1991 it has been in received san@@ itation areas .
&quot; at that time , in the San@@ i@@ fication of I from 1991 to 2004 , the country of Baden @-@ Württemberg has adopted two thirds of the funding amount . &quot;
&quot; in the San@@ i@@ fication Area II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still at 60 percent . &quot;
&quot; for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the existing renov@@ ations are a &quot; &quot; success project &quot; &quot; - it is finally important to promote internal development , and not only tap new building areas . &quot;
on April 4th I received the information for the information that it will be a san@@ i@@ fication III .
&quot; the total amount of 833 333 euros , of which would be 500 000 Euro of the country , the rest of the community . &quot;
how do I create a san@@ itation area ?
&quot; you will continue to examine so Sch@@ ind@@ ler , where the &quot; truly old &quot; houses are . &quot;
&quot; however , it also plays a role whether in the planned territory is interested in rehabilitation . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , the area of the area may then also shift again . &quot;
&quot; the St@@ eg agreements at the Wednesday night Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel . &quot;
&quot; Keller presented the content of the federal states &quot; social @-@ program &quot; , &quot; in whose framework the san@@ itation will then be carried out . &quot;
&quot; core of the program are the Rev@@ it@@ alization of internal towns , improving the living and employment and the conservation and expansion of infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; the measures would mean obj@@ ectively , which means per plot , performed . &quot;
the re@@ organisation would eventually set up as a stat@@ ute .
the acquisition period for funding runs since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026 .
&quot; even until September this year , however , a questionn@@ aire would only be carried out until September this year , within the framework of those who fill in the san@@ itation area to fill a questionn@@ aire . &quot;
&quot; in November or December , as possible as possible the typ@@ ing process is scheduled to be started in the coming year . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann , subsequently , that each Comm@@ une perform the defe@@ ated lectures . &quot;
it &apos;s going to assess and decide the urban development and to decide when re@@ lies and to what extent .
it will also be entered for the particular property for the respective property .
&quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will once again come back again and get a picture of the situation , saying it . &quot;
Got@@ zel emphas@@ ised an essential success factor for the project is the involvement of the participants .
&quot; therefore , the questionn@@ aire will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and will be filled up until the end of the summer holidays . &quot;
&quot; the yellow questionn@@ aire is the &quot; building and basic &quot; &quot; building &quot; &quot; which is among other things about the structural condition and san@@ itation views . &quot;
&quot; the gray questionn@@ aire , the &quot; budget and housing &quot; , &quot; characteristics can be made up to size , distribution and residents of a living room . &quot;
&quot; the blue &quot; &quot; operation &quot; &quot; is only possible to fill in the building business areas . &quot;
&quot; however , to note that Got@@ zel pointed out that a completed questionn@@ aire is not at the same time an application for funding . &quot;
&quot; moreover , new construction measures are not conduc@@ tivity . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ ind@@ ler stressed , that the distribution of funds according to the &quot; &quot; wind@@ ous principle &quot; &quot; - who comes first , &quot;
&quot; there are no funding for &quot; &quot; reserve &quot; &quot; for later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; to conclude , photos of the project &quot; &quot; center II &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a rehabilitation &quot; tasty &quot; . &quot; &quot;
bri@@ tical invent@@ ors even sets itself a micro@@ chip to come with a handful of movement in house and car
&quot; a bri@@ tical invent@@ or is the first in the country , which is equipped with a micro@@ chip so that he can open his door , his office and even start with a handful of motion . &quot;
&quot; Steven North@@ am , 33 , had impl@@ anted the tiny chip between Dau@@ men and po@@ inters and now offers the service for businesses and individuals who want to simplify your life with technology by its company Bio@@ Te@@ q . &quot;
&quot; he has conducted himself with Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory an@@ a@@ es@@ thesi@@ ists at the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the impl@@ ant procedure is carried out according to medical standards . &quot;
the technology resem@@ bles a cats and dogs impl@@ anted micro@@ chip and takes only 30 seconds .
&quot; the company of Mr. North@@ am also wants to change the castles of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , everything for an additional cost of £ 300 per lock . &quot;
&quot; the married father of one has now built both at home and with his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel . &quot;
the advertising costs of the White House cost the tax@@ payers thousands .
&quot; the decision of the White House , an marine helic@@ opter to fly to the South La@@ wn for an event that costs American production in the last month , costs tax@@ payers have been left to the TI@@ ME magazine , up to 24.@@ 000 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on 17 July in the White House with American construction programmes . &quot;
&quot; President Donald Tru@@ mp , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and conduc@@ tive officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states . &quot;
the helic@@ opter set in Connecticut was shown next to a yacht from Maine , a fire@@ man from Wis@@ cons@@ in and a forkli@@ ft from Mississi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; the military Office of the White House slow@@ ed the presence of helic@@ opter in a frag@@ ment@@ ary Order or FRA@@ GO , barely 36 hours before the helic@@ opter on the South La@@ wn S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit which is responsible for the operation of helic@@ opter . &quot;
&quot; I just wanted that you are aware of it , because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the Comm@@ an@@ de@@ ur of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 at the eve of the event of his super@@ visor , the dep@@ uty nav@@ al cancer for aviation . &quot;
&quot; the message showed that the helic@@ opter arrived at 7 am on 17 o &apos;clock in the morning at the South La@@ wn on the event at 3 p.m. , and so long remained until the grass between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 p.m. in this evening . &quot;
&quot; the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed , due to the limitation of the hours a second team would need for the return flight . &quot;
the original Air@@ ships were during the event at the helic@@ opter while the security sp@@ ers@@ ed of unity during the period remained on the ground on the plane .
the records provided from the TI@@ ME were not clear whether ultimately a second flight was required .
&quot; H@@ atch act provides state @-@ owned , state property for political purposes . &quot;
illustrate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 is asked whether the event could hurt the destiny .
&quot; a question that we asked , was whether it was a violation of H@@ atch A@@ cts and we were informed that this was not the case , wrote the command@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you are closed , &quot; rep@@ ent the dep@@ uty command@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event , and would not be covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot;
but also official events have political super@@ tones .
&quot; at the event , the president gave an impetus to the reform of the health reform , which was in the Senate on the Senate and he exercis@@ ed efforts to prevent penetration of government regulations . &quot;
&quot; the use of the aircraft , which is known as Marine One or Air Force One , for politically beneficial purposes is hardly a new phenomenon . &quot;
Presidents are obligated to use them for the journey .
&quot; but their use only for a photo @-@ operation , is unusual . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp introduced a investigation in February , when the Pres@@ idential plane before the background of his first Kamp@@ en@@ r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages , which can be used through its predecessor . &quot;
&quot; the White House is enthusiastic about the show &quot; Made In America &quot; - the products from all 50 states shows , which are manufactured by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the Vice President of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 @-@ occup@@ ations perform common training flights in the area around Washington and in the South La@@ wn by setting the US president in the White House with precise cen@@ tim@@ eters .
&quot; as Tru@@ mp in early July at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 led H@@ MX @-@ 1 in White House 58 practice . &quot;
&quot; the flight for &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; event was one of the training needs of the flight condition for the month , said an official . &quot;
&quot; helic@@ opter units also fle@@ w 11 hours on this day for &quot; &quot; non @-@ presidential system &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the White House said that tax@@ payers were the burden for none of the different pro@@ ps , which were presented at the event . &quot;
&quot; a speaker of Si@@ kor@@ sky said , the company has not been involved with the helic@@ opter on the South La@@ wn . &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not hold budget design@@ ations for the presidential and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
&quot; according to St@@ und@@ ent@@ ari@@ fen of the U.S. Defence Ministry for the budget@@ ary year 2017 , the DO@@ D @-@ Er@@ a kit for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per lesson . &quot;
records of the unit draw the flight time of the aircraft than 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Cor@@ ps Air Facility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House arg@@ um@@ ented that the actual cost of the operation of helic@@ opter is far below this rate .
&quot; the costs for tax@@ payers are based on the basis of estimates for the surveys , is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; these estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual resources . &quot;
&quot; according to a margin of the year 2015 the refund rates for DO@@ D does not include the personnel costs , but also take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and conclusion of contract . &quot;
&quot; at this time , the former press pre@@ aching of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , the use of the helic@@ opter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present this week things which are produced in America , &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot;
&quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the State of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I go out of that hundreds , if not even thousands of people depend on it . &quot;
&quot; and I think , like most Americans , we are all proud of helic@@ opter and other military equipment , for which so many Americans have been ti@@ reless . &quot;
it is of course appropriate to highlight this .
&quot; it was not clear whether Tru@@ mp with helic@@ opter , when he bet@@ ray@@ al his stroll over the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s head office . &quot;
in the White House Tru@@ mp to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and j@@ ok@@ en with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very good , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;

roll backward : the city provides 46 kitchen aids
the town organizes the K@@ ita lunch itself again .
with fixed contact partners for the children and a assignment to the team .
in the urban kinder@@ gart@@ ens the clock is returned .
on 1 September the city of Kre@@ feld takes over the city of Kre@@ feld @-@ headed care in the urban kinder@@ gart@@ ens ( Kit@@ as ) again .
&quot; for Son@@ ja P@@ omm@@ er@@ anz , Deputy Head of Art Nou@@ veau , is that good news : &quot; we all have very pleased . &quot;
&quot; continuing to be cooked except house : a cat@@ erer is taking this task and delivers fresh G@@ ek@@ och@@ tes cool@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the city operates in the fields of 46 kinder@@ gart@@ ens , in 44 the kids get a warm meal . &quot;
&quot; in the past Kit@@ a@@ year , 28@@ 00 children at the tables , and the need is growing steadily . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile not only children , the 45 weekends hours are looked after , in the K@@ ita &apos; lunch , &quot; explains P@@ omm@@ er@@ anz . &quot;
the offer also applies in the 35 @-@ hour care when children until 14 am .
&quot; 46 divi@@ ding forces have come from 1 September kitchen service : they warm the Angl@@ o @-@ cooked meals , complement them at salad , raw materials and fruit , por@@ ate the meal individually , give the food from , sp@@ rice and clean the kitchen . &quot;
&quot; the employees are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says P@@ omm@@ er@@ anz . &quot;
the size - there are open @-@ up institutions as well as seventh facilities - decides about the rate circum@@ ference .
&quot; the chef now belong to the K@@ ita team , &quot; says P@@ omm@@ er@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; in this way , they are much stronger and it is easier for the capital of a simple , ped@@ agog@@ ical concepts . &quot;
for this reason it is about healthy nutrition and cooking .
the children should help to prepare the food .
the direct connection of the kitchen force of the team is since useful .
also for the kids .
&quot; they have a known force in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar to them , and not ever changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the cleansing of the K@@ ita rooms - so far is the task of the kitchen forces - will be completed in future by special cleaning solutions .
&quot; this variation - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - in addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen performance even the charm , which is placed in the cost @-@ comparison between own reg@@ ression and foreign ver@@ itable for the city as the most economical choice , is it out of the press office . &quot;
and that even though 46 divi@@ ding will be re@@ set .
&quot; but these hours fall at around 750 people in the Educ@@ ational area , not as strong into weight , &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja P@@ omm@@ er@@ anz . &quot;

G@@ MB concern about investments in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie @-@ Fabrik in Glasgow
&quot; a trade union would like to con@@ stituted at the managers of the Bis@@ ku@@ it manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie , about the long @-@ term commitment to production in their factory in Glasgow . &quot;
&quot; G@@ MB Scotland said , the company attracted over the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ ection location . &quot;
more than 500 employees work in the work next to other products Hob@@ no@@ bs and R@@ ich Tea K@@ ek@@ se .
&quot; Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said , he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years . &quot;
he added that employees and trade union representatives would be experienced as the first to change their activities .
&quot; in a letter to the Fili@@ ppo of the company , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s up to express concern that funding for the modernisation of production lines cannot be pushed forward . &quot;
&quot; G@@ MB @-@ senior organizer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said , &quot; &quot; the fact that we can win no clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , concerns our members . &quot;
&quot; generations of families have worked here and the workforce focus on the local community and the region to Glasgow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , under the perspective of jobs , the wage rate and prosperity , and against the background of Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising end of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the eastern end of Glasgow strongly strongly a thri@@ ving production hygiene at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ person from Pla@@ dis said : &quot; the Fili@@ ppo at T@@ oll@@ cross has only received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland yesterday and the company will respond directly to this , as we appreciate the continuous engagement with employees and trade union representatives . &quot;
&quot; two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were discussed . &quot;
&quot; we discussed with the employees that we are active in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , our shops constantly check - and that applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive . &quot;
&quot; it added : &quot; &quot; in recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ ection location , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot;
&quot; we recognise the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site and fully involved . should our operational flows at the location , the employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to know this . &quot;
does the PS@@ G Barcelona war@@ ned three years ago by N@@ ey@@ mar ?
the site of La Liga likes her interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
&quot; Paris Saint @-@ Germain will not aband@@ on in its persecution of N@@ ey@@ mar , after having given an offer of £ 189 million in order to aver@@ aged its free@@ wheel , but have they war@@ ned Barcelona three years before the world record ? &quot;
&quot; the sens@@ ational approach has raised the transfer window in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world &apos;s day , with Paul Pog@@ ba in the past season for 89 million pound to Manchester United . &quot;
&quot; after the end , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive players in the world and at the highest paid professional athletes in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP a week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is angry above the way , as N@@ ey@@ mar has imposed his way out there , although a source near the Catal@@ ans is that the club always gave his best to take care of his arrival in 2013 for his arrival . &quot;
but was the football world for@@ war@@ ned three years ago by the PS@@ G president in front of this prospect ?
&quot; as Manchester City 2014 interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had given a strict warning for each association who wanted to sign the best player from PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; I am not worried because they know that if they tou@@ ching one of our players , then we will contact opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we respect all clubs . &quot;
&quot; but if they try to sign one of our players , so this will have consequences . &quot;
Barcelona seems to have exceeded this line with the Spanish Association at the beginning of this summer interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ field Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti .
&quot; PS@@ G made clear that she would not allow it to travel from Italy under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by choosing one of their prize offers for N@@ ey@@ mar . &quot;

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Report un@@ lock Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ report to the abuse of Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this means author and histor@@ ians Michael H@@ es@@ emann .
the final report on abuse at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further discussion for discussions .
&quot; Christian Weis@@ nder , spokes@@ man of the reform movement &quot; &quot; We are the Church , &quot; explained by the former Reg@@ ens@@ burger Bis@@ hop and today Cardinal Gerhard R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year brother of the em@@ eri@@ ved Pope Bene@@ dict XVI . &quot;
it would serve the reputation of Catholic Church when Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger her deep regret about their own om@@ issions or her then incorrect estim@@ ation of the processes .
the Vatican Council &quot; Os@@ serv@@ atore Rom@@ ano &quot; is cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed that in the reporting of violence in Dom@@ sp@@ atzen with &quot; two measurements . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the attacks in Regensburg , no one doubt that it would be prevented from &quot; sh@@ ame@@ ful and sh@@ ame@@ ful acts &quot; , &quot; however the &quot; degree of medi@@ al mani@@ p@@ ulation &quot; , &quot; says the &quot; degree of medi@@ al mani@@ p@@ ulation , &quot; so the author in Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , histor@@ ians and member of the national Italian bio @-@ Committee . &quot;
&quot; habit to call the Catholic Church as a source of all ev@@ ils , is already part of the everyday experience and prepare public opinion that is normal for normal &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot;
also Für@@ sti@@ n Gl@@ oria from Th@@ urn und Tax@@ is said in the interview with the Bav@@ arian Rund@@ funk : &quot; we will be happy to go on the church and that &apos;s a filmed for hours .
&quot; in addition , it pointed out that in her youth &quot; has been a quite normal educational means &quot; &quot; to be done with nau@@ ght@@ y children , as I was one . &quot;
&quot; it makes it possible to apply today &apos;s standards to past decades , because the world has changed . &quot;
&quot; in connection with the reports about the abuse cases , Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often looked upon . &quot;
&quot; completely to inj@@ ustice , author and histor@@ ians Michael H@@ es@@ emann , who translated with R@@ atz@@ inger the reminder &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; written ( in 12 languages ) . &quot;
&quot; I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; says H@@ es@@ emann , &quot; &quot; because all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the reporting . &quot;
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report which presented by the B@@ ist@@ um Regensburg with the clarification of a lawyer Ulrich Weber ?
&quot; a total of 5@@ 47 Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen have been sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and early 1990s , with high su@@ au@@ sibility &quot; victims of over@@ handles , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen sexually ab@@ used . &quot;
&quot; in the reporting period , it says to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger who worked from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg : &quot; &quot; in summary , so , that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. , in many cases , forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied . &quot;
&quot; especially at high E@@ mot@@ ion@@ ality , the punishment of the students could also be he@@ avier . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , as opposed to numerous other signs that many victims were distr@@ acted by R. , and therefore , in many cases , despite violence even positive memories with it . &quot;
&quot; in the interview H@@ es@@ emann , why the final report of abuse at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger says his opinion . &quot;
&quot; Mr. H@@ es@@ emann , the 440 @-@ pages report on the &quot; inci@@ dents of violence at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; gives an contra@@ dic@@ tory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; for the one hand many students lift up his &quot; &quot; humanity &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for the other , he also appears as a chol@@ ine and perf@@ ection@@ ist , which was gr@@ asp@@ ed by the ö@@ f@@ teren , when a domain was no top performance . &quot;
how do you evaluate this final report ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : if one reads the trouble and reads all the 440 pages long report from the front to the back , one has to ask yourself more , why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger must take place at all . &quot;
&quot; it is just eight pages dedicated to him , and he will be clearly acqu@@ itted from any sus@@ pic@@ ion or co @-@ creators with the terrible cases sexual abuse . &quot;
&quot; also , the non @-@ violence at the pre @-@ school dates back outside of its impact . &quot;
&quot; you can not throw from it , too late or have taken the first time to have taken seriously enough . &quot;
&quot; the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ ons School , on which he worked , was perceived by virtually all respon@@ dents than - so literally - &quot; salvation &quot; , &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot;
&quot; so also the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also presents him as &quot; warm &quot; , &quot; very good , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; competent , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; competent , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; competent , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; competent , &quot; &quot; competent , &quot; &quot; competent , &quot; &quot; competent , &quot; &quot; competent , and &quot; &quot; always har@@ dened by grapes of children . &quot;
only a minority is worth a minority over its perf@@ ection@@ ism and its high o@@ mot@@ ion@@ ality which has also led to we@@ aver .
&quot; that he threw it not only with chairs and bow@@ ed the key@@ chain , but also ear@@ ns guys to the hair or ears , he has already assigned himself to years ago , deeply regre@@ ts and ap@@ ologi@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; however , to its ambition , however , that such education methods have to be said in the ques@@ tion@@ able time , the 1960s and 1970s , widespread in parents like with teachers . &quot;
do you also know such bre@@ eder methods ?
&quot; of course , I think of each of us who was born in 1968 . &quot;
&quot; also I have seen this in a world@@ ly school , a state school , experienced . &quot;
&quot; compared to what it actually goes in this report , namely the re@@ plac@@ eable sexual abuse and non @-@ violence on the pre @-@ school , are the free Bag@@ at@@ elles . &quot;
&quot; you ask , if it is not a question about his acquain@@ t@@ ance and role as a brother of Benedi@@ kt X@@ VI@@ . to do , that many media has just been going on him . &quot;
&quot; in the Bav@@ arian Pope , so many who have never understood him , nor ever ei@@ fri@@ ght@@ y . &quot;
but the truth is : the report ent@@ ails Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
&quot; in connection with the report , the report was very much about the subject of mis@@ use at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
becomes Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the Final Report as well as any mer@@ ging or co @-@ operation with regard to sexual abuse on the load ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : very clearly no .
no single of the 67 victims of sexual attacks claims to have become familiar to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were inaugurated .
&quot; I never miss me to speak with my father or mother to talk about it , &quot; said a praying for the others , &quot; It was all very embarrassing . &quot;
the true issue in enlightenment of sexual abuse was and is that most victims are not silent .
&quot; if they were not even parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a choir leader , who would have been a colleague of the perpet@@ rat@@ ors . &quot;
how do you rate the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen student R@@ atz@@ ing@@ ers &apos;s role in terms of abuse ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : a survey student form@@ ulating it as : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he had been exhausted ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) and could have had the respective perpet@@ rat@@ ors .
&quot; I think it ... even for really absurd , accept that well @-@ out of him ... Bu@@ ben ad@@ ress or more explicit or more clearly opened , as opposed to their parents , Intern@@ at@@ sl@@ ing , confidence instruc@@ tors , etc . &quot;
that one speaks with him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; &quot; that him in the run @-@ affected students and / or their environment could not be confirmed in the study . &quot;
&quot; what sexual abuse concerns , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is therefore free to speak of any fellow workers . &quot;
so he can not be disc@@ ar@@ ded to him ; it does not prevent or have brought it to the ad .
&quot; therefore , there is no reason to bring his good name with these contra@@ dic@@ tory crimes , as unfortunately it happened in some cases . &quot;
&quot; in the media has been much of &quot; &quot; violence &quot; &quot; at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger will be disc@@ ar@@ ded in the report .
does he have to live with this privilege ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : this is the big problem that in reporting everything mixed and mixed became a huge mel@@ ange made of sexual abuse and non@@ violence and somewhere , in the middle of the Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
but that again is again a mis@@ use of the report .
&quot; namely , it is clean separately : between the pre @-@ school and the Gymnasium of Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and violence , we say once , other precautions . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the report negotiated inci@@ dents from the period since 1945 , thus also from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not the conductor of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; the whole terrible test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases where l@@ ad of sa@@ di@@ sti@@ ff@@ les were con@@ stru@@ ed and mal@@ portra@@ yed , and below they suffered , had been har@@ dened on the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ hofen , where really sk@@ ating states have to be har@@ dened . &quot;
&quot; but with whom had Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger nothing to do , for he got the boy only to face , when they were already on the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ht@@ ary School . &quot;
&quot; at that was , like the all@@ erm@@ ost witnesses emphas@@ ise the topic &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mary &quot; &quot; t@@ abo@@ o . &quot;
&quot; one was just happy to escape , and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; heavenly &quot; states . &quot;
what was different at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ht@@ a School ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : there was still discipline but no sa@@ ff@@ ron violence .
&quot; and that also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , where the report comes to the conclusion that &quot; many victims were estimated by R. , and therefore in many cases , despite violence even positive memories with it . &quot;
&quot; thus , at most at the most still the pre @-@ design , will have taken away . &quot;
&quot; however , despite all efforts , the report was able to define two periods in which he was reported by the states on the pre @-@ school . &quot;
&quot; the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish itself and was held responsible for a school in which he was not acting and responsible for ( so the witness ) nothing wanted to hear , and then again by 1993 . &quot;
lock Georg R@@ atz@@ inger before the states consistently consistently the ears ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : no , because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ou@@ der , which the report is even reproduced . &quot;
&quot; in this he pointed out that in the pre @-@ school , the test will continue to be practiced . &quot;
&quot; even in view of the danger of negative press , it became urgent priority . &quot;
&quot; that was of course at a time when legal clarity was included , as the test pun@@ ish@@ ops was also banned in Bavaria too . &quot;
&quot; before , they opened themselves in a legal heart zone , just like everyone of us know . &quot;
&quot; that was also difficult for him to estimate , where those affected may have been exagger@@ ated or dram@@ ati@@ zed , and where really the permitted border was exceeded . &quot;
&quot; but you can not say , he could have always been away . &quot;
that is just not true .
only in 1980 the testing was officially completed in Bavaria too .
Für@@ sti@@ n Gl@@ oria from Th@@ urn und Tax@@ is alleg@@ ed that today &apos;s educational standards to apply to the dam@@ aging time .
how do you see that ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : we histor@@ ians talking there of &quot; &quot; case of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; so the danger to evaluate the latter in today &apos;s moral standards . &quot;
that has the inter@@ c@@ ession already quite .
&quot; but that of course , does not apply to sexual abuse , who was w@@ ish@@ able at all times and also not for what was ab@@ i@@ ble in the pre @-@ school and violence against inno@@ cent inf@@ ants , that goes far beyond that time . &quot;
this is all very horri@@ ble and I am glad that it will finally be recorded .
&quot; but at the same time , I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger because all this had nothing to do with him . &quot;
&quot; his means for discipl@@ ining and punishment , so ear@@ ns and pull to the hair and ears were widespread in the 1970s . &quot;
&quot; as physical punishment , then he has also kept strictly strictly . &quot;
which picture of his Reg@@ ens@@ burger time has Georg R@@ atz@@ inger because in the conversation with you for the book &quot; M@@ ein brother of the Pope &quot; ?
did the theme test it also for the language ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Bene@@ dict XVI , tells of his perspective , because the cathedral played just one side @-@ role . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , I am not by no means that he carried there a stric@@ ter reg@@ iment there . &quot;
&quot; but even this must be said once again : without these perf@@ ection@@ ism , without these perf@@ ection@@ ism , it would probably hardly have been possible from which until then rather national known Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen a institution of Wel@@ tran@@ g to form the true cultural message of Europe and his musical tradition , which went to tour twice in the United States ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with bis@@ cuits and Bon@@ b@@ ons , one does not make a big singers , and there is no big singer and stand before each success , just in which area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ beyond . &quot;
what kind of people have you experienced by Georg R@@ atz@@ inger at the talks about her book ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond that I experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , and over again and again experienced as wonderful , hum@@ orous , fundament@@ als , deeply believing , and sav@@ ory good people from which one could not imagine , that he could only do a fly . &quot;
&quot; I regularly talk about how many former domains still talk today , 23 years after his emig@@ ration , regularly contact him to visit him , he &apos;s almost blind and him to treat him as a member of her family . &quot;
&quot; those who do not forgive him today , that he was once strict with them , so clearly in the minority . &quot;
&quot; the majority of domains are grateful to him today , that he enrich@@ es their lives and brought to them the world of music . &quot;
&quot; and that he is always a good , v@@ ä@@ ter@@ ous teacher - a hard father , certainly , that may be - but even a loving respect@@ able person , to which she still want to look up today and to honor them . &quot;
&quot; and please , once again quite clear : everything you are th@@ rows , are guar@@ dians , who were at that time on the order of the day . &quot;
we can be glad that we have long been overcome this time .
&quot; but it is most odd , a man , only because he is prominent and has a prominent brother , for medi@@ al sin@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; is the evil intent , which is behind it , only too obvious . &quot;
&quot; for the report , which was just published , un@@ loaded it . &quot;
&quot; now the attack there would have acquired a 93 @-@ year man who has acquired great services , and perhaps outside Bavaria , and perhaps in Germany no one would probably know the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace . &quot;
