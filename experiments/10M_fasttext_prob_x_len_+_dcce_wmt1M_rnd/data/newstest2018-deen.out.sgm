<seg id="10">"then, the cities and municipalities are changed in the spread-area of the Münchner Mercury since the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria Atlas is a patchwork which one does not recognise as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the large overview cards were used for towns and municipalities in more detailed maps, so-called judgment of sheets."</seg>
<seg id="13">This emerged according to the information of the Bavarian Vermeasurable Administration between 1810 and 1864 and originates from the first verse measurement of Bavaria.</seg>

<seg id="19">The Urpositional leaflet for Munich dates back to 1856 and is like all others on the website of the Bavarian State Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of fruits / loot is most impressive at the heart of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has spread across all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">"an example of this is Lower sendling, which appears in the map of 1856 still relatively isolated."</seg>
<seg id="23">"sendling was born 21 years after creating the map, so 1877, as Münchner district."</seg>
<seg id="24">"today, Lower sendling is in the middle of the city."</seg>

<seg id="26">"where today the West park is, one sees nothing but fields - at the first glance: in writing lines and numbers: handwritten numbers out of the so-called" "Urge", "derived from which the basic tax deduced."</seg>
<seg id="27">Small plots stood there today no farmers more - but small gardener of the plant in the sun.</seg>

<seg id="29">"the Theresienwiese, since 1810 locations of the October 2005, was in the 19th century still a meadow - and no concrete desert."</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the other side of the Isar, the historic card gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine."</seg>
<seg id="31">"in the judgment sheet, one reads in the locality of today's Au-Haidhausen not only the road names" at Gasteig "" or from the height "" On the ventilation "" - but also in large letters "irren Anstalt."</seg>
<seg id="32">"yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße, it was once used by people with insanity."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there was 1858 / 59 the Münchner circle-Irrenaline, On the Auer Lüins."</seg>
<seg id="34">"from 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden the decor - that psychiater that is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwigs II."</seg>

<seg id="37">"first place for 280 patients was first place, later on 500 places was expanded."</seg>
<seg id="38">"at some point, this capacity is no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the roundabout in hair 1905."</seg>

<seg id="50">Civil Group publishes Reisewarming for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Union for the promotion of color-above has issued a warning for colored people who travel to disdiscriminatory policy and racist attacks of the State to Missouri.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory Council will enter into force until 28 August 2017, visitors and Missourians, to leave special attention through the state, as a number of questionable, rassenbased incidents in recent times throughout the country and here are stated in the opinion of the group."</seg>
<seg id="53">"a recently adopted law of Missouri, which makes people difficult to win disdiscriminating authorities, as well as the criminal prosecution authorities of the state, the disproportionate measures of the state, the disproportionate to minorities, said the NAACP."</seg>
<seg id="54">"they have violations of civil rights, people happen."</seg>
<seg id="55">"they are raised because of their skin colour, they are beaten or killed," said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star. "</seg>
<seg id="56">We hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not heard before.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that has issued the organization for a state in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the group caused incidents like racial mergers against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">"Sanders died at the beginning of the year, after he had no petrol during the journey through the state no gasoline, and taken away from the police of Missouri."</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points to a recent report of the Office of the General Public State of Missouri in which it is shown that black motorists in the state is 75 percent more common than pastures.</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and their families, friends and staff will inform about what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel. "</seg>
<seg id="62">"people need to be willing to bring it to Caution or to know the relatives that they travel through the state."</seg>
<seg id="63">"Missouri recorded in 2015 100 Hassel, after the latest figures from the Hassinbred reporting program of the FBI, which entered the state with respect to the number of such injuries on the 16th rank of the country."</seg>
<seg id="64">The paration of travel is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to complain a company because of living or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">"previously had issued the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) Reisewarings for Texas and Arizona, after the states of immigration authorities had to assume that local criminal prosecution authorities shall commit to the local criminal prosecution, which will contribute to the view of the ACLU for further razor filing."</seg>
<seg id="66">"travel arings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but in recent times stakeholders have used the measure as a response to specific laws and trends within the United States."</seg>
<seg id="67">Weighaunproject is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The fisherman Weidezaun project is a success project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Bundestag Peter White and Kordula Kovac have provided a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">"at the rectangle of the family Schwendemann, representatives of the fisherman CDU local associations, together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members."</seg>
<seg id="71">"Markus Schwendemann received an insight into his farm, in which he has 55 acres of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 milk cows and also houses many young people and houses in five apartments Feriengaeste."</seg>
<seg id="72">The "Schwarzwaldmilch" is for him the alternative marketing way for the milk of his cows so Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="73">At the table of the Feriengaeste exclusively Regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">"as he is also the BLHV Chairman of the fisherman, it is important for the Weider project as" elementar. ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot gain profitable in such steep areas.</seg>
<seg id="76">The green area care for much work, much mts with the engine sense can be processed. "</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have here to fight with the conditions and with the topography," "Schwendemann". ""</seg>
<seg id="78">"in 2003 he took over the eltermed operation and beech these without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if he does not lead biooperations."</seg>
<seg id="79">"for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear:" "the Commune has recognized the importance of the wheely project and is happy about the leaders support."</seg>
<seg id="80">The farmers would have to support farmers at the expense of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare.</seg>
<seg id="81">One hope that the forestation of the surfaces could be moved out for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the greatest treasure we have, are people who work in agriculture and make thoughts about how to continue their operation," "said the Mayor."</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers have often been in criticism due to the promotion of funding.</seg>
<seg id="84">Over the Weiprivation promotion were fenced in 2013 in total 25 plots of eleven participants.</seg>
<seg id="85">"the disclosure surface is therefore 40 hectares, which will not be enforced until at least 2023."</seg>
<seg id="86">"from the total cost of 71 500 Euro, half over leader was promoted, a quarter carried the municipality of Fischbach."</seg>
<seg id="87">"thus, the farmers remained 12 610 Euro, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained Pidemann. "</seg>
<seg id="89">"Kordula Kovac stressed:" "you are doing a really good job, without farmers and landwives."</seg>
<seg id="90">Also for Peter White stood firm: "here are best food produced."</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscapes (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables the state promotion of pastdesaunas.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is the disclosure of the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">Prerequisite is the presence of one of the LPR signed.</seg>
<seg id="94">"in addition, it must not be a non-effective surface (slope incline above 35 percent) and must be threatened by the forestation."</seg>
<seg id="95">For the fisherman Weighaunproject 2018 currently runs the request of eight participants with 24 plots who want to build almost 16 kilometres fence.</seg>
<seg id="96">"the open space is 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros."</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attacking the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate this as well as any other - therefore the caring overthrow Saddam Hussein at the Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump-regimes, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axis with Jim Acosta of CNN on the proposals by the President to the drastic restriction of legal migration with the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">To be fair, Miller does not handle the statue itself. "</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and liberty Imitators would have liked him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but he handle their meaning, and in particular the meaning that it was written, as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, his base was added."</seg>
<seg id="105">"as Miller Acosta, I don't want to enter into a complete thing about history but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that is enlightened the world."</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem which you relate later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is knowledgeable, but as he forms it yourself, it is not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about contemporary resonate words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state does not only invites any old immigrants, but the hassled of the poor:" your fatigue, your poor, / your bedtime masses, which are after that longing, free to breathe, / the end of your rich coasts. "</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time in which the "elder waste" was better to see on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller has not engaged in literary criticism - he clearly did that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the meaning of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation: it is in fact a conflict around the meaning of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who sat down to place their words after their death - knew very well that they are a high political act.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American Republicanism by presenting the female embodiment of the female embodiment of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - it has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a very different name: mother of the exile.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on the American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and exactly how Lazarus changed the importance of the statue, people wanted to change it for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the great screier than Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argumented 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not take the American flame into the reared world:" Lady Liberty goes forward. "</seg>
<seg id="119">It is supposed to bear the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The Fackel should not enlighten the way into the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual is Limbaugh here on something razor.</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is quite and at all a question of the point of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great inventive act of Lazarus was to see them, as they had seen from the exhaustive, but hopeful people after long and often terrible trips to the decks of ships was seen."</seg>
<seg id="124">"it is in the true sense to see the world from the perspective of people, to seek the refuge and a chance to improve their lives."</seg>
<seg id="125">Her statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And this is of course not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever would like to recognise.</seg>
<seg id="127">"their torch should not enlighten the way, but the hatred, who is their only source of power."</seg>
<seg id="128">World championship 2017: Neil Black looted schotist Members of the United Kingdom</seg>
<seg id="129">"Eilidh Doyle reminds one of time, when only two heads to the team of Great Britain."</seg>
<seg id="130">"the director of the athletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-heads of a massive contingent in the world championship" is a massive contribution to the team. "</seg>
<seg id="131">A record from schottic athletes was selected for London 2017 that starts on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="132">Black believes that in Scotland develops a special specialist in Scotland and the athletics of the United Kingdom must learn from it.</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it, and we try to understand it and we will continue until we find it out," said Black. "</seg>
<seg id="134">I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The shotist athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type on the corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">"whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brillant."</seg>
<seg id="139">"several of the Scottish athletes are medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - which was elected against Sir Mon Farah, while Eilidh Doyle was elected by the team to the team of team."</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eiliie is quite modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">"their surrender speech was amazing," says Black. "</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, no matter whether they were narrow, or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">"the passion and the real feel, the Eiliie totally natural, were great."</seg>
<seg id="144">"Commonwealth silver mediteracy that will compete in their fifth world Championships at the 400-m hurdles, says that it is" incredible "is that 16 heads in the British team are amazing."</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total number of athletes on the world championship was seven which were achieved in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">Muir Muir runs on this path through British and two European records last year.</seg>
<seg id="147">"it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 metres."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, the 1.500 m runs, is another scored that one should observe the victory at the British team Trials and the Anniversary games."</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle reminds himself of her first world championships than the only other scored in the team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">"the teams of the capitol says that they are" great pride "to the fact that many of their landlords don't only belong to the team, but in some cases also with the medals and at the Finals."</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing to be part of the team is that they have chosen by the other members of the team so that they have voted for me, but to know that my team-mates chose for me and chose to me something very special for me", "she added."</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously, I am very proud of all the rots who belong to the team."</seg>
<seg id="153">It shows just how far we came.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here as established athletes, athletes, who want to ascend on poetry."</seg>
<seg id="155">What my speech is concerned as a chapter?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think she went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from it that we are back at the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">"I get a second chance to go there and compete, and it will simply be such a great atmosphere there."</seg>
<seg id="160">"block the critics via Facebook: Bewirb you not around a public office, if you can not wear the heat of constituents."</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">"the Americans loved George Washington, but it took not long until the newspapers stopped him because of everything, from the interior to its political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">"he shimpeed with criticism, safely."</seg>
<seg id="164">But he has not brought his critics to silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">"in the year 1783 said Washington:" "the freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute we shall be led to the sheep to battles."</seg>
<seg id="166">"this brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who must work to be more like Washington."</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinions on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">"and the American Civil Liberties Union said, this is the beginning of this week."</seg>
<seg id="169">"the stamp of the Governor left the lawsuit as frivol, and the online comment was full of a counter-action with" Na, and? "</seg>
<seg id="170">"it is only Facebook," said many people. "</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important if there is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republiic governor in a overwhelming democratic state which is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the two thest consent of the 50 Governors of the Nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary Hitzhead.</seg>
<seg id="176">He showed a firm hand upon the leadership of his state and strict compliance with principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">"he was also very skillful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his constituents and playful his hairy head to chemotherapy on his side."</seg>
<seg id="178">"therefore, the block of persons coming to the side of the Governors - the public forum is to be officially referred to as officially and by employees who are paid with public tax-Dollars - needless and ultimately dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post defended hogans Amelia Chasse the actions of the Governors and argued that the blockade of the comments were nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">"but it is too simple to use the image of Trolls or spammers or hasserted people, which swinged online the penises."</seg>
<seg id="181">The post spoke with some of the real people that were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">"and that are only real people who speak with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, no evil."</seg>
<seg id="183">They all told that their comments were respectful and not profound.</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest brought the Bible in his post and appelers to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">"attorney Sarshmi Sarma Ramani of Bolike, MD., was not filled with water, but they asked for hate."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I commented polite that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate and other current news, she wrote in the comment section of the message" The Post. "</seg>
<seg id="187">"I also appreciate this idea if a number of people on the same subject takes place, then they are considered by some rather than a so-called collective use, and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">"what the employees of the Governors referred to as" concentrated spam attack, others probably would call "" intercession "." "</seg>
<seg id="189">"the Facebook era makes it simple, cut a message by simply blocked a critic or deleted a negative comment."</seg>
<seg id="190">"it is much cleaner than in earlier times when you have done the same, that staff were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical ladders and to burn protesters and to silence."</seg>
<seg id="191">But that is exactly what happens digital.</seg>
<seg id="192">"Hogan is not the first public officials that is criticized, that he criticized Facebook and other social media."</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is negotiated by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question fell last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">"the chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County banned the First Amendment, according to US district James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she was named a voters from her Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky Governor Matt received a visit from ACLU because of its use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so hard.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the moment Washingtons had a similar effect on the internet as the internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">"the number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous briefing."</seg>
<seg id="200">And even at that time Washington had an anonymous Trole.</seg>
<seg id="201">"the people, the pseudonyms like" Juricola "," Valerius "," Belisarius "and" Portius "" wrote all letters of newspapers, the Washingtons decisions made. "</seg>
<seg id="202">"petitions who criticised his position on the Treaty of Amity, trade and navigation with the UK, overcome his office, according to the historical documents that were collected by the Online Papers of George Washington Project."</seg>
<seg id="203">But he has not brought them to silence.</seg>
<seg id="204">"freedom of speech, differences and discourse belong to the foundation of our nation."</seg>
<seg id="205">And true leadership means to accept that.</seg>

<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do.</seg>
<seg id="1391">"if so, he will be the first."</seg>
<seg id="1392">"Politico reports that the new Stabilief of the White House plans to restrict the information flow to President Trump - including reports of the news media, in hope to keep the boss on an even more moderate course."</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of Reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"as John F. Kelly, the new Stabilief of the White House, put together in his first working day with leading employees, he set a main problem in President Donald Trumps White House which he wants to repair: poor information that put into the hands of the president."</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in writing - because the President would make better decisions when he would receive good information.</seg>
<seg id="1396">"Kelley diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to count Trump by monitor his media."</seg>
<seg id="1397">"President Trumps relationship with television extends back - and now, where he is in the White House, his TV show is still strong."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"if candidate Trump was angry because of an unfair reporting it was productive to show him that he was a fair coverage of places that were to convince," said the former electoral adviser Sam Nunberg in February compared to Politico. "</seg>

<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">"but the idea that trumps Twitter-habit ever" under control "was ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these struggles were aware of what we don't know - that Trumps Tweets would have had even more ignition without their intervention.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never experience something about the tweet the Trump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">"if him have managed to keep him a few times, anger from him, then their efforts were worth it."</seg>
<seg id="1405">"but no one has consistently prevent it, that Trump contrasts."</seg>
<seg id="1406">"a part of the problem is that people in a pastor house consists of competing parties, always try to advance their own agenda by providing Trump material that might have their views from the world."</seg>
<seg id="1407">Politico - very busy with this story - reported in May on the preferences of the consultant to continue the president for strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example that was described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump-Beamte say that Trump can react to negative press sections, especially such with damaged Lectures and that he will find out to find out where they come from."</seg>
<seg id="1410">"this happened at the end of February, when someone called the President böswilling to printed a printed copy of a article by Gotnew.com, the website of the Internet-Provocateurs Charles C. Johnson, called the source behind a pile to be of Lecks" in the White House. "</seg>
<seg id="1411">"although Johnson's permanently banned from Twitter or that he has not offered a concrete evidence, or that he has expressed a concrete evidence in the past, and revoke them in the past."</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and started to ask people about Walsh.</seg>
<seg id="1413">"Goldmacher added that the damn Stef Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter," tried to implement a system to manage the paperm and document the Trump. "</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries three months later to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="1416">"perhaps he will prove to be more effective Manager as a priebus, but Trump is still its ultimate self, and his advisors still strive to influence."</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underscores the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The staff of the Weekly Riodoce usually meet at home to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt high and discreet drug wars. "</seg>
<seg id="1811">"but on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to speak about security."</seg>
<seg id="1812">It was told to them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">"two high-level journalists discuss what to feel safer: they are supposed to take their children to the office, who were the goal of an attack with granates, or at home it at home."</seg>
<seg id="1814">"safety experts have written three words on a board at the front of the room: opponent, neutrale, allies."</seg>
<seg id="1815">"you ask the reporter, names for each column - no proof is necessary, perceptions and abdominal."</seg>
<seg id="1816">"there are drugs decoration, politicians, businessmen, journalists who will digested on the salary list of the government or the cartels, a catalogue of criminals, which make the chaos of Mexico dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"there is no retirement of violence, and throughout the country the corpses are increasingly taken at least 25, since President Enrique Pena NIETO in December 2012. 589 are standing according to attacks and threats under federal protection and until now this year there were at least seven dead in seven states."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"among the latter, their publisher and their inspirer of Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist, wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1820">"his absence will be deeply felt, although his presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, which shows its middle-finger with the word" Justice "," T Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts, which show its ridiculous face with glasses or its typical Panamahut. "</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporter discuss their shared topics, the trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although 2010 has been established a Sonder's office, in order to edit the cases of journalists, these according to the Committee for the protection of journalists only two criminal proceedings."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with most thousands of Morden, each year with drug wholesale and organised crime, the murderers are only rare in judgment."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"at Riodoce they still insist to treat the violence from Sinaloa, although they are unspoiled, and even though the terrain is still in stock."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without any information about the murderer, without justice, the meeting for the discussion of security, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we do not know the Why, we do all."</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of May 15 Valdez has left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the state capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he managed only to drive a couple of blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was raised by two men. he was forced by his car and 12 times, probably due to the name of the newspaper - which is translated with" "twelve" river "." "</seg>
<seg id="1830">The pepper drove away in his car and damaged it in the vicinity.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to move freely around in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzmans arrest in the past year and delivery in the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest districts of the country, as rialising groups here fight to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it does not make things that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot on the street, or that the cemetery is full of consuming, two-story mouse tracks for drugs, which are larger than many houses for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget about a minute that there is a state of 'peace' if only a cartel control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs of trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">"nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, with blame was broken that he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"first of all, in February the publication of a interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rivalled cartons in the war with Guzmans Sons."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this publication may have annoyed the sons, suspected the members purchased every copy of the output as soon as they have been delivered to newspaper kioske."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second fault was to force Valdez, after the sign of another newspaper, which had released the same story to leave the country into its own security."</seg>
<seg id="1843">"Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and its murder is seen as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1844">"he had so long survived his friends and colleagues, that he would always be there."</seg>
<seg id="1845">"he was active as an experienced reporter for Noroeste, when he joined together with five colleagues to the formation of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars."</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa," it was impossible to operate journalism, without encountering the predowry problem, "said Bojorquez."</seg>
<seg id="1847">"the newspaper served a reputation for brave and honest reporting, and sales and promotion took place."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporters loved it, hard to publish harsh investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they were able to read stories otherwise."</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the establishment of Riodoce she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot Prize" for their reporting in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year Valdez has won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the protection of journalists for his courage in the persecution of the Mexican drug history, wherever it lead to it."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave himself voluntarily that he had fear.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to continue living," he said at the time of the CPJ award. "</seg>
<seg id="1853">"drug wholesale in Sinaloa" is a way of life, "he said in an interview with Rompeviento TV."</seg>
<seg id="1854">They need to take the task that you as a journalist - either that or you play the dumplings.</seg>
<seg id="1855">"I don't want to be asked:" "what did you do so many things... why did you not say what happened before?"</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the Riodoce team missed Valdez, the Spaßvogel, who was like a port laborer, the friend, the generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survived."</seg>
<seg id="1857">You trust on his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always bear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always go to El Guayanilla, the bar towards the office, go there and always sitting at the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">"now, ask them: was his love for routine his worship?"</seg>
<seg id="1861">"his death has also forced them to question their own assumptions, how they can do their work best and stay alive."</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they do not like it if you are dealing with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their home start and cross-country ways to move drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," "said Bojorquez."</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even at the best times, a high degree of self-adhesive and self-keeping."</seg>
<seg id="1865">His own instinct trust.</seg>
<seg id="1866">"if it was wrong, lead away from it."</seg>
<seg id="1867">"the anger is, said the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal that" smell can be a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing happened with Javier. "</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the old rules, as he and others say, are in Sinaloa no longer - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a gifted mixture of lucrative smugglare, weak institutions and corrupt government institutions at home."</seg>

<seg id="1883">Only a few months ago the readers had seen the Kolumne of Valdez as the best informed source about the kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"formerly we had already knew what happened is," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El FLACO" because of his slim body-stator. "</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."</seg>

<seg id="1934">"after all this hard work, the finished result is ready now to be revealed."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you only have a little with the eyes blossom, you could almost believe it has slept," said the main autor Caleb Brown, scientists at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is seen. "</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will enter into the history of life as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa of the Dinosaur."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers have found that this plant vore is covered, although he is covered with a armor and a changing tank, probably by meat and dinosaurs was threatened."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the strong dinosaurs used a red and white cloves to hide a red and white camouflection, which is known above smokers, and used a shielding technology that is also used as counterpart, which is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this could have allowed to blend better into its surroundings and to exert their enemies, say experts, which is estimated that it was threatened by larger Dinosaur."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the family of the Nodosaur has made the Headlines in May and is now at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers have now studied the wild animal and it has called Borealopelta markmitchelli after the Museumbers Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours to cover it carefully."</seg>
<seg id="1942">"the amazing preservation of the specimen allowed the Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists, the pattern and the form of shed and armaments of his body."</seg>
<seg id="1943">"you discovered the contershading, a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its underside."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the counter-shady is usual, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta is by far the surviving the animals survived."</seg>
<seg id="1945">"it indicates that the dinosaurs had been hunted by enough pressure by meat, dinosaurs that the evolution of the confrontation as a means of survival."</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most contemporary animals, who use the tershaded - think of deer, zebras, or gürteltiere - are much smaller and more vulnerable than booty, what signalized that this Nodosaur was exposed to a real fight for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong robbtier behaviour on a massive, strong breaded dinosaurs, how dangerous the dinosaurs robbernation of the chalk-era have been to be," said Brown. "</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis organic connections in their skins also shows that the skin of the dinosaur-brown was red.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists continue to examine the animal on references about his life, including his congled Darmined, in order to find out what it has eaten as his last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaurs, when he died out into a river and went into the sea, where he sank on the back to the sea."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at that time Alberta was so warm like south florida today, and rivers and oceans probably widespread far more widespread than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaur is really remarkable, because he is fully covered with condensation of the skin, but also in three dimensions remains and the original form of the animal retains", "said Brown."</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that the animal today looks almost exactly as in the early chalk time.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you do not need much imagination to use it. if you just want a little with the eyes, you could almost believe that he is at sleep."</seg>

<seg id="2059">"Folayan said, she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to document", "what happened."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"a question came Ferrell in the sense:" "you want to document or try to find a story that you can use?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">"these skepticism was nourished through countless cases of people, often by whites - in a community that benefited from her pain and their resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"as Folayan recently explained in an interview:" "we had heard that people who have born in Ferguson and grew up their votes and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">"Folayan had already worked together with the then Co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area, which is known for his activism rum."</seg>

<seg id="2076">"however, it is not that" this is not a affirmative type of action, "at the Ferrell was selected because of their identity as the heart of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who spills this energy," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is not a coincidence, although she was at the front front, because with a life on these crumations than a black, gay woman is so much on the game."</seg>

<seg id="2117">The old EDEKA would be the solution - even if the bit Gallery is actually coming here.</seg>

<seg id="2132">"through the prison her picture was oppressed, so much that there was only a single photo - a quaint, black-white blfie, in which Manning is evident unarguably on a driver and a platelblonde Perl - with which she was associated."</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of their 2012 project 'stranger Visions'.</seg>

<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a Millennium of Cs and GS and As, in pencil. "</seg>
<seg id="2145">"Dewey-Hagborg hoped, due to the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nocleotid after the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist), how amazing similarly, at least in biological ways, we all are."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take to take care of who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective them are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works from 2007, Spurious Memories, also to see. "</seg>

<seg id="2391">Sex-robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">"recently published the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for responsible Robotics) (FRR), a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years."</seg>
<seg id="2393">"according to Noel Sharkey, emerived Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we must start their Ascension seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot to choose his shape of the nipple and the type of fingers.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"the people make themselves funny, but the companies deliver every quantity of it, and we will see them much more frequently," "said Mr. Sharkey in the publication of his new report."</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sex puppets have developed from their inflatable partners with a silicon-skin that feels warm - with deliberately human reactions to be achieved by the artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"the user can also adjust his robot according to its beliefs" "and therefore select everything from the eye-color of the robot to the type of nipple to the type or colour of its finggehogs."</seg>
<seg id="2398">"but it is still worrying, as many robots have the" personalities "who would look like a stepford-wife."</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sex ps have developed to robots with a silicon.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"the RealBotix robot makes it for example its users to adjust their robots to the properties which they might be appealing, such as spchasing."</seg>
<seg id="2401">"and then there are still those of True Companion developed Roxxxy Gold Sex-robots with pre-programmed personalities like" Frigid Farrah, "which gives the impression of shchternity and" Wild Wendy "with a" adventurous "personality."</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as well as possible, Heating the website of True Companion."</seg>
<seg id="2403">"so she likes what you like, and she does not like what you may not like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2404">She also has her moods over the course of the day - quite like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"it can be tired, be fixed on conversation or can be" "in mood". ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">"there are many disturbing aspects in this ascent of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the underestimated female characteristics, if one goes a step to Frigid (means: contradictive) Farrah."</seg>

<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men then have no Roxxxy?" is it on the website. "</seg>
<seg id="2409">"however, these sex robots are not just a fetish or simply just another sex."</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their formation and its increasing refinement point to a bit more darker and deeper in our culture to a retreat from the Ideal for gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.</seg>
<seg id="2411">"most men will of course hold no sex robots, and while the FRR retains its rising popularity, they remain provisional on the edge of consumer culture."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"but what emaned from the border zones, can be in relation to the spirit of time in which we live, very instructive."</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or reviving until they give their free market permission.</seg>

<seg id="2415">"the horrible aspect of the television series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the Magd ') are not the graphical images, the enumerated body and the extinct eyes, but how realistic this vision works."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment this does not feel like a great leap."</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (if also with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want that they feel humanity to imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"but, on the point when it comes to their" personalities ", the robots do not represent real women."</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate yourself from their companions or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"they have no mediation or a background story, nothing, which could disturb on independence or anything, which could disturb the fantasy totality."</seg>

<seg id="2583">"while those affected are usually going to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, they found researchers at the Washingtoner University that the essential amino acid tryptophan from proteins contribute to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine."</seg>
<seg id="2584">"the conductive researchers, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the intestine, to ensure that damaging microbes, which hide in the food, not penetrate into the body."</seg>
<seg id="2585">"cells that are capable of allowances, inflammation, are balanced by cells, which promote tolerance and protect the body without sensitive tissues."</seg>
<seg id="2586">"if the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation, it may result in an inflamply result."</seg>
<seg id="2587">"in experimentation was determined that a kind of tolerance and immunisation of immunology comes in mice, which carry a particular bacterium into their initiates."</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the blocks of proteins - to dissolve the appearance of cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between an bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>

<seg id="2592">"the Postdoktorandin Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan undersought a kind of immune cell that had found the tolerance that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe who had not accommodated this."</seg>

<seg id="2594">"the dye of mice have been DNA sequencing and they were found six bacterial species that were present in mice with immune cells, but without them to mice."</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterile environment so that they lacked a intestinal microbiome and they did not have this kind of immune cells and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">"to understand how the bacteria present on the immune system, the researchers showed L. reuteri in a liquid and then led small quantities of fluid - without the bacteria - on unripe immunity, which were isolated from mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into tolerated cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"when the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be known as a by-product of the tryptophan-metaboism that is known as Indol-3-Milchsacid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"if the researchers redoubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of mice, the number of such cells increased by approximately 50 percent, but when the tryptophanvalues were halved, the number of cells decreased by half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">"Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerated cells such as mice, and that most of us L. reuteri can protect them in our stomach-representations."</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether tryptophan-side products from L. reuteri, the cells in humans develop as in mice, but defects in genetics in relation to tryptophan have been found with people with inflammatory representations."</seg>
<seg id="2602">"she said," The development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote, since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines. "</seg>

<seg id="2895">"with regard to the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubt that it would be prevented from" shameful and shameful acts "," however the "degree of medial manipulation", "says the" degree of medial manipulation, "so the author in Lucetta Scaraffia, historians and member of the national Italian bio-Committee."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"habit to call the Catholic Church as a source of all evils, is already part of the everyday experience and prepare public opinion that is normal for normal" "writes Scaraffia."</seg>
<seg id="2897">Also Fürstin Gloria from Thurn und Taxis said in the interview with the Bavarian Rundfunk: "we will be happy to go on the church and that's a filmed for hours.</seg>
<seg id="2898">"in addition, it pointed out that in her youth" has been a quite normal educational means "" to be done with naughty children, as I was one. "</seg>
<seg id="2899">"it makes it possible to apply today's standards to past decades, because the world has changed."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"in connection with the reports about the abuse cases, Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger often looked upon."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"completely to injustice, author and historians Michael Hesemann, who translated with Ratzinger the reminder" My brother of the Pope "" written (in 12 languages). "</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I must take Georg Ratzinger in protection," says Hesemann, "" because all this had nothing to do with him, "he evaluates the results of the reporting."</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report which presented by the Bistum Regensburg with the clarification of a lawyer Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen have been sexually abused between 1945 and early 1990s, with high suausibility" victims of overhandles, 67 Domspatzen sexually abused. "</seg>
<seg id="2905">"in the reporting period, it says to Georg Ratzinger who worked from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg:" "in summary, so, that by Domkapellmeister R., in many cases, forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied."</seg>
<seg id="2906">"especially at high Emotionality, the punishment of the students could also be heavier."</seg>
<seg id="2907">"nevertheless, as opposed to numerous other signs that many victims were distracted by R., and therefore, in many cases, despite violence even positive memories with it."</seg>
<seg id="2908">"in the interview Hesemann, why the final report of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger says his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2909">"Mr. Hesemann, the 440-pages report on the" incidents of violence at the Regensburger Domspatzen "gives an contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2910">"for the one hand many students lift up his" "humanity". ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">"for the other, he also appears as a choline and perfectionist, which was grasped by the öfteren, when a domain was no top performance."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"Michael Hesemann: if one reads the trouble and reads all the 440 pages long report from the front to the back, one has to ask yourself more, why the name Georg Ratzinger must take place at all."</seg>
<seg id="2914">"it is just eight pages dedicated to him, and he will be clearly acquitted from any suspicion or co-creators with the terrible cases sexual abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2915">"also, the non-violence at the pre-school dates back outside of its impact."</seg>
<seg id="2916">"you can not throw from it, too late or have taken the first time to have taken seriously enough."</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the Domspatzons School, on which he worked, was perceived by virtually all respondents than - so literally -" salvation "," heaven "and" better world. "</seg>
<seg id="2918">"so also the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger also presents him as" warm "," very good, "" competent "," competent, "" competent "," competent, "" competent "," competent, "" competent "," competent, "" competent, "" competent, "" competent, "" competent, and "" always hardened by grapes of children. "</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority is worth a minority over its perfectionism and its high omotionality which has also led to weaver.</seg>
<seg id="2920">"that he threw it not only with chairs and bowed the keychain, but also earns guys to the hair or ears, he has already assigned himself to years ago, deeply regrets and apologized."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"however, to its ambition, however, that such education methods have to be said in the questionable time, the 1960s and 1970s, widespread in parents like with teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeder methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think of each of us who was born in 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"also I have seen this in a worldly school, a state school, experienced."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared to what it actually goes in this report, namely the replaceable sexual abuse and non-violence on the pre-school, are the free Bagatelles."</seg>
<seg id="2926">"you ask, if it is not a question about his acquaintance and role as a brother of Benedikt XVI. to do, that many media has just been going on him."</seg>
<seg id="2927">"in the Bavarian Pope, so many who have never understood him, nor ever eifrighty."</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report entails Georg Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"in connection with the report, the report was very much about the subject of misuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2930">Becomes Georg Ratzinger in the Final Report as well as any merging or co-operation with regard to sexual abuse on the load?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: very clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No single of the 67 victims of sexual attacks claims to have become familiar to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were inaugurated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I never miss me to speak with my father or mother to talk about it," said a praying for the others, "It was all very embarrassing."</seg>
<seg id="2935">The true issue in enlightenment of sexual abuse was and is that most victims are not silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they were not even parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir leader, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do you rate the Domspatzen student Ratzingers's role in terms of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a survey student formulating it as: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he had been exhausted (Georg Ratzinger) and could have had the respective perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I think it... even for really absurd, accept that well-out of him... Buben adress or more explicit or more clearly opened, as opposed to their parents, Internatsling, confidence instructors, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"in this way, the report comes to the very clear result:" "that him in the run-affected students and / or their environment could not be confirmed in the study."</seg>
<seg id="2942">"what sexual abuse concerns, Georg Ratzinger is therefore free to speak of any fellow workers."</seg>
<seg id="2943">So he can not be discarded to him; it does not prevent or have brought it to the ad.</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore, there is no reason to bring his good name with these contradictory crimes, as unfortunately it happened in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">"in the media has been much of" "violence" "at the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger will be discarded in the report.</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this privilege?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that in reporting everything mixed and mixed became a huge melange made of sexual abuse and nonviolence and somewhere, in the middle of the Georg Ratzinger. "</seg>
<seg id="2949">But that again is again a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">"namely, it is clean separately: between the pre-school and the Gymnasium of Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violence, we say once, other precautions."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"in addition, the report negotiated incidents from the period since 1945, thus also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not the conductor of the Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"the whole terrible test pedagogy, the cases where lad of sadistiffles were construed and malportrayed, and below they suffered, had been hardened on the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really skating states have to be hardened."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with whom had Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger nothing to do, for he got the boy only to face, when they were already on the Domspatzenghtary School."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"at that was, like the allermost witnesses emphasise the topic" "Primary" "taboo."</seg>
<seg id="2955">"one was just happy to escape, and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even" heavenly "states."</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different at the Domspatzenghta School?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was still discipline but no saffron violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"and that also applies to Georg Ratzinger, where the report comes to the conclusion that" many victims were estimated by R., and therefore in many cases, despite violence even positive memories with it. "</seg>
<seg id="2959">"thus, at most at the most still the pre-design, will have taken away."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"however, despite all efforts, the report was able to define two periods in which he was reported by the states on the pre-school."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish itself and was held responsible for a school in which he was not acting and responsible for (so the witness) nothing wanted to hear, and then again by 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Lock Georg Ratzinger before the states consistently consistently the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Hesemann: no, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the Domspatzengouder, which the report is even reproduced."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"in this he pointed out that in the pre-school, the test will continue to be practiced."</seg>
<seg id="2965">"even in view of the danger of negative press, it became urgent priority."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"that was of course at a time when legal clarity was included, as the test punishops was also banned in Bavaria too."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before, they opened themselves in a legal heart zone, just like everyone of us know."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"that was also difficult for him to estimate, where those affected may have been exaggerated or dramatized, and where really the permitted border was exceeded."</seg>
<seg id="2969">"but you can not say, he could have always been away."</seg>
<seg id="2970">That is just not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the testing was officially completed in Bavaria too.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Fürstin Gloria from Thurn und Taxis alleged that today's educational standards to apply to the damaging time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Hesemann: we historians talking there of" "case of anachronism," so the danger to evaluate the latter in today's moral standards. "</seg>
<seg id="2975">That has the intercession already quite.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"but that of course, does not apply to sexual abuse, who was wishable at all times and also not for what was abible in the pre-school and violence against innocent infants, that goes far beyond that time."</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all very horrible and I am glad that it will finally be recorded.</seg>
<seg id="2978">"but at the same time, I must take Georg Ratzinger because all this had nothing to do with him."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"his means for disciplining and punishment, so earns and pull to the hair and ears were widespread in the 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"as physical punishment, then he has also kept strictly strictly."</seg>
<seg id="2981">Which picture of his Regensburger time has Georg Ratzinger because in the conversation with you for the book "Mein brother of the Pope"?</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the theme test it also for the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, tells of his perspective, because the cathedral played just one side-role."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, I am not by no means that he carried there a stricter regiment there."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"but even this must be said once again: without these perfectionism, without these perfectionism, it would probably hardly have been possible from which until then rather national known Regensburger Domspatzen a institution of Weltrang to form the true cultural message of Europe and his musical tradition, which went to tour twice in the United States (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with biscuits and Bonbons, one does not make a big singers, and there is no big singer and stand before each success, just in which area, but always discipline, passion and self-beyond."</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people have you experienced by Georg Ratzinger at the talks about her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond that I experienced Georg Ratzinger, and over again and again experienced as wonderful, humorous, fundamentals, deeply believing, and savory good people from which one could not imagine, that he could only do a fly."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I regularly talk about how many former domains still talk today, 23 years after his emigration, regularly contact him to visit him, he's almost blind and him to treat him as a member of her family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who do not forgive him today, that he was once strict with them, so clearly in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">"the majority of domains are grateful to him today, that he enriches their lives and brought to them the world of music."</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he is always a good, väterous teacher - a hard father, certainly, that may be - but even a loving respectable person, to which she still want to look up today and to honor them."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, once again quite clear: everything you are throws, are guardians, who were at that time on the order of the day."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have long been overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is most odd, a man, only because he is prominent and has a prominent brother, for medial sinful."</seg>
<seg id="2996">"is the evil intent, which is behind it, only too obvious."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"for the report, which was just published, unloaded it."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now the attack there would have acquired a 93-year man who has acquired great services, and perhaps outside Bavaria, and perhaps in Germany no one would probably know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally in peace."</seg>
