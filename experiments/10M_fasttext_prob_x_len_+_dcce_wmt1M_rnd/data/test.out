Gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the Sport@@ pyramid
his experiences on the horse are over@@ looked .
at the end of a golf tur@@ ni@@ ers in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger also sought a little variety with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a pre@@ mier@@ ed .
CH@@ IO : &quot; Golden Sport@@ pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
&quot; after a few minutes , the horses rec@@ eded the horses to their holiday , they were in the fast Gal@@ op@@ p home to the feed tr@@ ench . &quot;
&quot; a kilometer at this pace , I have had fear . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger . &quot;
and thus the equ@@ estrian career ended then again .
on Saturday Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fers of all times - 101 tournament places - again close to horses .
&quot; he left himself with his family over the plant of the AL@@ RV , on a horse , he did not get a photo purpose . &quot;
long was the first time in Aachen and thus also with the CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sport assistance exceeded the man from An@@ hausen in the framework of a small gala the Golden Pyram@@ id pyramid .
&quot; hon@@ ors , it is not a lack of sympath@@ etic ath@@ l@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreu@@ z , sil@@ ber@@ nes Lor@@ be@@ er@@ blatt , Champions @-@ Tour player of the year ... &quot;
even the British Queen has triumph@@ ed him already .
long is the 18th winner of the Sport@@ pyramid .
in Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler .
&quot; this award means me much , &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; because it is not only awarded for sporting achievements , but also for social commitment . &quot;
for decades Lan@@ ger encourages the off@@ spring .
and so he gave the prize money of 25@@ ,000 euros equal .
&quot; with 15 additional outstanding sports@@ men , the two @-@ fold US @-@ mast was recorded on Saturday into the &quot; Hall of Fame of the German Sports . &quot;
&quot; the excellent belong to the excellent include Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the natur@@ ner Eber@@ hard G@@ ien@@ ger , the Ru@@ ff Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ru@@ ff Peter Wien@@ eke , the jumping ho@@ ite Al@@ win Sho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um of the hand of all Er@@ hard . &quot;
many of these athletes had come to Aachen on Saturday .
&quot; after the official part , illustr@@ ating the illustr@@ ating society into the Spring@@ stadium where the Lav@@ azza Prize ran . &quot;
Bernhard Lan@@ ger held distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ tons and Tru@@ m@@ ps economic policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and trade agreement T@@ TP - that would like both Clinton and Tru@@ mp .
&quot; however , the two U.S. presidential elections are however at the control and energy policy as well as in a fundamental demand . &quot;
&quot; the differences in economic policy between Donald Tru@@ mp and Hill@@ ary Clinton is a basic , rather philosoph@@ ical difference . &quot;
the role of the role of the state .
Tru@@ mp wants to keep the doubts rather small and war@@ ned how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations .
&quot; Clinton wants to pun@@ ish the economy to death and regulate death , he says . &quot;
&quot; he himself would be quite different , the Tru@@ mp itself would be . &quot;
&quot; he will take Reg@@ ul@@ atory regulations , and he makes for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower controls , strong - for private residents and for businesses . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , Clinton says : the State has specific tasks to fulfil , he has dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money for it . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the taxes would increase for the rich , says it . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , both very close to the subject of infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; inv@@ ests in the committees , say Tru@@ mp and Clinton almost wor@@ t@@ alike . &quot;
the democratic applic@@ ant is the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes in the infrastructure are classical democratic policy and are strictly rejected by the state @-@ state @-@ wing @-@ wing of the re@@ public@@ ans .
&quot; so , on Tru@@ mp we could communicate with internal discussions . &quot;
clearly the differences in the energy and climate policies are more evident .
Tru@@ mp wants to build coal power stations and reg@@ ain the coal mining in the US again .
oil promotion should also be possible in so far @-@ protected areas to cancel the Paris climate protection agreement .
&quot; on the other hand , Clinton wants to strengthen and calls for the renewable energies with its investment program : &quot; a country will create the clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot;
&quot; however , not only in the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other . &quot;
&quot; T@@ PP , the tran@@ sp@@ azi@@ fic Trade Agreement , do both do not want to sign . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the US does not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade - but simply American jobs better . &quot;
&quot; the should also be paid better , calls for about Clinton . &quot;
the current minimum wage of 7,@@ 25 US dollar is a hungry .
she wants to increase them to 15 dollars per hour .
&quot; what Tru@@ mp is to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must be , then he does not seem to be changed . &quot;
but the great discussion of the coming months is likely to become more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
&quot; on the one hand is Tru@@ mp , who wants to escape the economy and the citizens to boost growth . &quot;
&quot; his critics hold him before , so that the budget was only bigger . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , Clinton , who want to demand at least from the rich , that they pay more taxes and their critics are saying : more taxes are not the solution . &quot;
escape : &quot; each ar@@ ded woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence belongs to women who alone flee almost for everyday life .
&quot; when they arrive in Germany , they are often traum@@ atis@@ ed . &quot;
a house offers refu@@ ge .
in a large kitchen sitting four women .
each has a baby here that is at most one year old .
one has laid her little son in the arm .
he gu@@ ed with big eyes curious in the room .
his mother died on the table top .
until they notice that it is observed .
they ridicul@@ ed short and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene works normal .
until one speaks with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
&quot; she is the business leader of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a bear@@ er for social assistance in Bavaria , and deals among others with the subject of women on the run . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are ti@@ led .
&quot; they live in the Mün@@ ch@@ ner North , in one of the few de@@ central accomod@@ ations for all women and their children in Bavaria . &quot;
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs established the establishment along with Pro Familia and the Mün@@ ch@@ ner Frau@@ enh@@ ilfe .
&quot; long ago , she was officially opened . &quot;
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men do not exist - even as visitors .
the exception is a w@@ ax@@ man in front of the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here , has done on their escape experience with sexual violence , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; men flee for wars because they thre@@ aten politically , because they thre@@ aten torture or death , or because their families send them as hope to ship them to Europe . &quot;
&quot; in wives , other reasons for the flight : &quot; many res@@ isti@@ ble themselves , because they do not see any other way . &quot;
&quot; in their home country they have experience with sexual violence , forced honor , honor@@ ary mor@@ den , sla@@ very or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot;
that drives them away .
on the run it goes on .
&quot; that tu@@ gs challenge for example for a bottle of water a sexual act , is not rar@@ ity , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families . &quot;
&quot; who believe that the end as soon as they are anch@@ oring in Germany , ir@@ re , tells us . &quot;
&quot; in this case , all women in refugees would often be considered inferior and worse . &quot;
&quot; this leads to that about 90 per cent of women , who live in the accommodation in Mün@@ ch@@ ner north , appreci@@ ates them . &quot;
&quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntary voluntarily . &quot;
many women don &apos;t know that they say nothing .
&quot; or they do not fail to talk openly about the experience , because the shame is too big . &quot;
&quot; as they often do not cure him , I need more accommodations just for them , demands true . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , the seven District governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees . &quot;
&quot; on the question , whether they are convinced of a similar project like in Munich in their responsibilities , answer some with no . &quot;
&quot; in Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , there is no such thing in front of the governments . &quot;
&quot; also in Sw@@ ab@@ ians themselves are not separated alone , Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , Press@@ es@@ pre@@ cher of the government . &quot;
&quot; in Ober@@ bay@@ ern , Unter@@ - and Medi@@ fran@@ ken there are in some common accommodations Stock@@ ings or own houses only for all the women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central properties exclusively for women . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; rights of women and gender equality &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be accommodated in the European Parliament . &quot;
&quot; in a study that was published for the Committee , it says : &quot; it is very important that men and women are separate . &quot;
lacks the privacy or will be accommodated men and women they can come to - on @-@ going violence against women .
&quot; especially the wash@@ rooms should be separated and easily accessible for women , stands in the study . &quot;
&quot; as much the women of this safeguard , can be felt at the con@@ j@@ ump@@ ed , which gives it to the house in Munich . &quot;
&quot; since getting around us there is , we have a long waiting list , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
one could easily make a second home .
pedi@@ atri@@ cs : demands for new working measures
&quot; &quot; &quot; Deputy of the assist@@ ants have called their trade union to read new work measures in their dispute regarding a new contract . &quot;
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has demanded his entire Council starting from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said that it would have been agreed to respond to the worries of the contract .
assist@@ ants and Medi@@ z@@ un@@ ud@@ der have been coordinated in July concerning the rejection of a contract which has been agreed with the BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted in elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members , which was published on Thursday evening on Twitter , said the President of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court that the government was &quot; persistent &quot; to problems , which led to that the treaty was rejected . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; in En@@ light@@ ness of the J@@ DC Executive Board , the proposed new contract will completely deny the proposed new contract and requested official negotiations on all p@@ ours . &quot;
&quot; as an answer to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Executive Board has made a formal request for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to start a continuous program escal@@ ating working measures , which begins in early September . &quot;
the disputes led to that assistance supplements this year Six@@ sm@@ al strikes that the first total accidents in the history of N@@ HS .
&quot; the leader of the BM@@ A Assistant Doctor Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana stood after the election for the rejection of the agreed contract conditions , which were recommended by BM@@ A . &quot;
&quot; he shared BM@@ A members during the meetings , which were still held prior to vote by 5@@ 4.000 assistance agents and medi@@ z@@ un@@ ud@@ der , with that the contract should be beneficial and accepted . &quot;
&quot; after the vote of the Health Minister Jerem@@ y Hunt , that the contract for doctors in England would be introduced . &quot;
Russia and Turkey : a &quot; Alliance of foreign meetings &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure that ended up a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce their hands and to pro@@ claim an official end of the eight months long @-@ term war of words and economic sanctions .
&quot; but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counter in the gol@@ d@@ plated hall of St. Petersburg Pal@@ ast@@ es , I cannot deny me of the intru@@ sion that Ankara wants to do this reconciliation . &quot;
&quot; there was the tow@@ ing , yes . &quot;
&quot; but Put@@ ins sm@@ iles cra@@ fted and he pointed hardly warmth , even for its back conditions . &quot;
Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an on the other hand spoke repeatedly by his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report all five times .
I could no longer count it anymore .
he also spoke that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis but even better .
the next day described a newspaper that Erd@@ og@@ an would have fun as if it would never happen to happen .
I seemed to give me enthusiasm rather the opposite .
&quot; but one of Putin radi@@ ant , sustainable cool@@ ness showed that the state of Russia had forgotten nothing . &quot;
&quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first what he mentioned in his introduction : the shot of a Russian struggle from the Syrian border through Turkey . &quot;
Moscow from reaction to time was w@@ ut@@ ent@@ bran@@ nt .
Putin shared and acc@@ used Ankara to have fallen back in the back .
the aband@@ on@@ ment was even bigger since it was committed by a alleg@@ ed friend .
the Vet@@ r@@ ust re@@ build is difficult to re@@ build if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; for months long , the state @-@ controlled media led a fier@@ ce , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara . &quot;
&quot; at one time it seemed , as if the Tur@@ ks bear all the blame . &quot;
&quot; at the trial , the acc@@ us@@ ations of conduc@@ ive officers , that Erd@@ og@@ an had benef@@ ited from their own family from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria , which could be controlled by the so @-@ called Islam@@ ist state . &quot;
he made this veh@@ ement .
&quot; but in St.@@ Petersburg , the official message was that it is time to look forward . &quot;
&quot; after all , this meeting took place only because Putin received by the President Erd@@ og@@ an ap@@ ologies that he wanted to hear . &quot;
Russia could book a way of victory .
&quot; for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ ase@@ fire are obvious . &quot;
&quot; Erd@@ og@@ an is first in first line all friends who can get , after he was given last month at a failed coup d almost of his ministry . &quot;
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey also have sh@@ aken him too .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit hard Turkey - especially the prohibition of charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast .
the number is reduced by almost 90 % .
&quot; in Russia , travel agency and charter companies will be easier when the flights are taken back . &quot;
you count on a late crash at the Mediterranean .
&quot; this week forecast the state television , cheap fruits and vegetables , as soon as the Turkish ag@@ onic imports will be allowed again . &quot;
&quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti form@@ ulating the following : &quot; tourists there long , tom@@ atoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an extra political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry on the West as it was the reaction to the tried and tried a weak response .
&quot; in addition to this , the continued Gro@@ ll pass on the sn@@ ail of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ ke to draw from the cool atmosphere and to reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West . &quot;
&quot; in Ankara , the Russian state of State has won a bonus for ensuring that he sought after attemp@@ ted state @-@ rich support for the elected state organs . &quot;
this is well @-@ making for Moscow a matter of course which has changed a profound fear of rain rain .
&quot; the summit meeting in this splendid palace by the sea made possible Russia and Turkey , one , as it was an analy@@ st once described , &quot; alliance of outside &quot; &quot; alliance : two countries that are viol@@ ated and poor@@ ly treated in the West . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite of public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two still . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave the role as peac@@ emakers , but where Russia and Turkey support oppos@@ ing pages . &quot;
&quot; it could be sig@@ nat@@ ched that after almost three hours of initial talk , both President at the press conference said that they had not even stri@@ pped the issue . &quot;
&quot; the President of Turkey ver@@ mi@@ ed it inten@@ tionally to answer a question about their differences , while Putin decided to stress this . &quot;
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator to Syria can be found .
&quot; but after months of open hos@@ tili@@ ties - and given the potential for a perfect dis@@ ruption , as the NATO member Turkey ab@@ sent the Russian martial arts - it is certainly better that the two heads of state at least once again talk to each other . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland are no longer available
&quot; according to the R@@ BS brand , the R@@ BS brand should be reduced more on a b@@ aking office . &quot;
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland .
R@@ oss Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland with that the R@@ BS brand associated with the global ambitions of the Bank .
the Bank has since dist@@ anced himself since eight years ago and had to be saved and saved .
&quot; in this period , bran@@ ding &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; is used to protect other end consumers . &quot;
she supported the international sport with millions of pound to sponsorship by the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ bl@@ edon winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now she decided to push more national brands in the focus .
&quot; the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized . &quot;
&quot; in England and Wales all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centralized headquarters and the IP@@ O to change to Nat@@ West . &quot;
the Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are other , smaller brands for the private client business that will receive more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dru@@ m@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military bank . &quot;
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in inver@@ ness Sh@@ ire .
&quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B will be employed to our investor brand as well as the brand , among which our staff will be busy because we are now more to a bank of brands . &quot;
&quot; when the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand . &quot;
&quot; I say that we have no global goals , but pursuing local goals . &quot;
each of these marks will be completely different in their own communities for something completely different and our employees will work among these marks .
R@@ BS has already said that it will no longer continue the Six Nations sponsor@@ ing and that it will increase the perception of different brands in his sport sponsorship .
&quot; it is time for us to develop into the bank of the brands , as we focus on inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the pres@@ et ef . &quot;
&quot; it would have been very Cypri@@ ot three years ago , if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and would have launched these marks . &quot;
&quot; but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes . &quot;
&quot; we can launch these brands again , so I think that the time has come . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori reaches in Pre@@ dil@@ ection its 3.@@ 000@@ ten win at New@@ market

&quot; he put on Pre@@ dil@@ ection , which is trained by John Gos@@ den , on his local rac@@ et@@ rack with his second win of the night a milestone . &quot;
the 45 @-@ year Itali@@ ans is the sixth Jo@@ ckey which reaches the milestone in the flat race .

&quot; the three @-@ day winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who has won on G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar , said : &quot; it is something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is here
I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I am here 30 years ago .
&quot; it is not a big meeting , it is not Royal As@@ cot - it is a ban@@ ker Friday evening with 20,000 people . &quot;
I am easier and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes the che@@ ers when he goes on Pre@@ dil@@ ection to victory
two Jo@@ ckey@@ s have reached the milestone in the obstacles - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the re@@ tired winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y which reached more than 4,@@ 300 vic@@ tories in a re@@ warding career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ go@@ t - the ninth of Der@@ b@@ ysi@@ eger had 4.@@ 493 careers
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of the modern age and it is not a surprise that he reached this milestone reached only a few before him .
&quot; he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intell@@ ect that distingu@@ ishes it from the other in the weight control room . &quot;
&quot; he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and char@@ isma have been enthusiastic fans for this sport . &quot;
I said Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ s@@ om that he had already received 6@@ ,000 gains if he would not only be a weekend and grand@@ son jo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie has suffered in GB for almost 30 years , which is great . &quot;
&quot; he has a vibrant personality , which is good for a bri@@ tish race , but in addition he is an incredible yo@@ ckey . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Fl@@ ying Dis@@ mount
&quot; from Fl@@ ying Fin@@ ish to Fl@@ ying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the British flat for two decades . &quot;
it was ner@@ ve wre@@ cking .
&quot; a whole series of major tournaments , including its famous &quot; gl@@ acier Si@@ eben &quot; 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug . &quot;
&quot; three years ago he had difficulties , when he returned from his six@@ sm@@ on@@ ati@@ gen sp@@ re , but he showed impressive strength to de@@ activate his branches and return to his punishment . &quot;

Russia Putin fier@@ ert Stab@@ ili@@ ef Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
the Russian President Vladimir Putin has un@@ expect@@ edly released his grid of Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was many years part of the narrow@@ est trust of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ ol@@ ds was appointed for the promotion of environmental and transport matters .
&quot; in a opinion of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , it is that Putin without giving reasons &quot; the discharge Ivan@@ ov@@ s provided by his duties as Chairman of the Russian presidential administration . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o who has been Deputy since 2012 Ivan@@ ov@@ s Deputy was appointed his successor .
&quot; V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; 1972 born in the Estonian capital Tallinn , he made his finale at the renowned state of the Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; on the website of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , it is called ( in Russian ) that he later called protocol and executive manager of the government . &quot;
&quot; about his appointment he said to Putin , &quot; thanks for your confidence . &quot;
&quot; I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as a state of law , and inspections to implement your instructions . &quot;
&quot; Putin shared the Russian TV broad@@ band on Friday with that Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post , and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor . &quot;
convince the ridicul@@ ous faces ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious world .
Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov was a long time in one of the narrow@@ est of Vladimir Putin and works as he is for the Soviet secret service that K@@ GB .
as a St@@ ef he was one of the most powerful men of the country .
&quot; at a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast on television , claimed both men that the beam head comes back on their own desire . &quot;
&quot; but despite the lam@@ ination for the cameras , here are only a few of them - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
is here the sequence of a kind of power struggle ?
that knows no one .
&quot; but the official asser@@ tion - that a man , which was once delivered as a potentially president , at once the Russian Environmental Policy would lead to great skep@@ tic@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; in his comments on Putin who are quoted on the website of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , said Ivan@@ ov &quot; &quot; it is true that I asked you in early 2012 in a conversation , I could almost say this very complicated posts - you could almost say - compl@@ aining about four years . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , I have been Chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months . &quot;
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December 2011 .
previously he was dep@@ uty Minister and Defense Minister .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and how Putin former member of the State security service K@@ GB .
&quot; in the late 1990s when Putin was chairman of the German security service ( FSB ) , which was appointed the K@@ GB ( FSB ) , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his de@@ pu@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; when Putin spoke to the power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people to whom he most trusted . &quot;
&quot; once was adopted , Ivan@@ ov would be President of Russia after Putin &apos;s second term president of Russia , since a third period of office would not viol@@ ate the constitution . &quot;
&quot; but this post was taken by another , registered allies Put@@ ins , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev . &quot;
Putin became prime minister before he became a president three and a half years later .

Queens@@ ferry Cros@@ sing : bridge now connected to Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion expensive project should be completed by May 2017
engineers have joined the northern deck of the Queens@@ ferry Cros@@ s@@ ings with the Vi@@ a@@ duct - what means that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; it is the first of four verses of the &quot; cover &quot; , &quot; which approach the completion for each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
the bridge cut of fi@@ fe is now 600 meters long and weighs 30@@ ,000 tons .
&quot; it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons concrete and 46 divi@@ des . &quot;
the £ 1,@@ 35 billion expensive project should be completed by May 2017 . &quot;
the Minister K@@ eit@@ h Brown workshop was a visit today and was one of the first that went from the country to the bridge .
he said : &quot; this is a historical and symbolic moment when building the Queens@@ ferry Cros@@ s@@ ings .
&quot; we are all witnesses of a engineering art by a truly an issue in this project , with over 30@@ ,000 tons concrete and steel , which were alone used for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the closing is between the vi@@ a@@ duct and the bridge deck a delicate activity , which require extremely precise toler@@ ances for fit . &quot;
&quot; overall , nearly 79 % of the entire bridge ende@@ avor in their place and the last section of the Dec@@ ks get a Bet@@ ong@@ uss for the deck , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted up to its place on the bridge . &quot;
Michael Martin , project leader of For@@ th Cros@@ sing Bridge : &quot; &quot; the first verse marks an important milestone in each of the bridge project . &quot;
in this fantastic project the laying of tr@@ end@@ setting high @-@ quality and low @-@ construction work represents .
&quot; after installation of the last street section and its connection with the north @-@ tower deck , we had to close the existing gap in the north or country side . &quot;
this was reached by hand of the northern fe@@ eder bridge 700 millimeters south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
&quot; massive , as the vi@@ a@@ duct 222 meters long is , about 6@@ ,000 tons weighs and had to be drawn up at a slope of approx . 3 % . &quot;
&quot; as the toler@@ ances , since the toler@@ ances were working , tiny - on each side they bet@@ ray them only a few millimeters . &quot;
fortunately everything went very well .
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay : three men have &quot; happiness to be alive &quot;

the three men had difficulty to swim in security while their boat moved out of their own strength .
&quot; we saw , as the boat turned into its proximity to themselves and set us the worst before , &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot;
&quot; fortunately the strong winds is already b@@ lowing into the boat except her reach , until we left water , he added . &quot;
two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and transferred to a boat without any life@@ jacket .
they all arrived on board the coastline and were brought back to the rescue station .
&quot; Mr. Jones said : &quot; the three men , which were cast into the water , have happiness and still being alive . &quot;
&quot; although the boot motor does not have an emergency , however , these proceeds from the c@@ ots of the person from the person who controls the boat . &quot;
someone has awak@@ ened today about these men .

who builds up for cheap apartments ?
the SPD and Green : investors will continue to be a lot stronger in the future .
how does one react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 low apartments in the next few years ?
the SPD proposes a &quot; action plan for the next R@@ ats@@ meeting . &quot;
but dispute is programmed .
&quot; first of all , it is about the question : who should actually build the cheap apartments ? &quot;
a regulation is missing up to date .
&quot; SPD faction leader Christoph Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; we are dealing with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build on urban areas , in future , must be 20 percent of all the apartments as social housing . &quot;
&quot; however , the cheap apartments can also arise in the stock . &quot;
&quot; however , the big central point in the city hall is however , as Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; how to build investors around , who want to build on private areas ? &quot;
&quot; we want investors on such areas at least 10 percent , but as 20 percent of the apartments are building as social housing . &quot;
&quot; a new municipal housing programme , the millions of costs will cost and be financed , is to provide incentives for incentives . &quot;
&quot; the problem , as Brat@@ mann : &quot; there is currently no agreement between the groups . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as few rules as possible .
the left intends to create hard@@ - runs for investors .
&quot; regardless of how Brat@@ mann , bah@@ an , a tight@@ ening of the situation on the housing market . &quot;
&quot; the concept of action will be implemented , that will ensure additional tasks in the building management . &quot;
more staff is needed .
it is un@@ clear whether we will get the professional forces .
&quot; yet , the program is not entirely different : for the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway . &quot;
how does one compar@@ es the loss of further around 1300 low apartments whose support is going to run in the next few years ?
it will be 500 apartments only by 2020 .
&quot; to prevent this , such as the plan@@ policy spokes@@ person Nicole Palm , should now be purchased at current ties from the city . &quot;
&quot; moreover , it would have to be thought to get back into the price . &quot;
this is possible in the West town .
on one stroke will solve the problem .
for the end time in the West town run out of the year .
&quot; around 1800 apartments , one could get back in the price for cheap apartments there . &quot;
&quot; only : this want the owners , the apartment construction companies . &quot;
&quot; for the number of social housing in the West city will be dr@@ as@@ tically dramatically , from the goal of the so @-@ called force . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a concentration of social weak in just a few districts will no longer exist . &quot;
the Gre@@ ens expect that there will be movement in discussion .
&quot; Group Chief Executive Officer Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says , &quot; &quot; for a wide majority , the CD@@ U must boot into the boat . &quot;
it focuses on more construction sites for family homes .
but what does not mean that could not be found yet a compromise .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go to a hunt for health and happiness which pays off
it is fascinating to watch how the world is changing .
&quot; that teen@@ ager and child to play no longer go outside , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time , on screen , was caught in the last decade of many . &quot;
&quot; at Pok@@ em@@ on Go it is about to get people from the sofa , and be active . &quot;
&quot; the time on the screen was initially on television , then on video games and last on smartphones . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is great to see that technology and activities are not mutually exclusive . &quot;
&quot; I looked forward to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that is based on the characters , which initially created for the video games in the 1990s ( later , resulting from a string series , game cards and other spin @-@ off@@ s ) . &quot;
&quot; how many phenomena of popularity declined , the interest in the publication of the game in the U.S. , Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July . &quot;
the launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that over@@ loaded the server .
within a few days Pok@@ é@@ mon had more users than ink and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , the players with their smartphones go outside and search for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons who have been prosec@@ uted with a GPS and once they were found once again &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; ( via a screen@@ shot on the mobile phone ) or captured . &quot;
&quot; a generation that played the game when she was still younger , closed to the we@@ ave and sp@@ rang for the search of the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , the game led to a considerable rise in steps which leaves the &quot; average &quot; person every day . &quot;
&quot; Car@@ di@@ ogra@@ m , an app for Apple Watch , the 3@@ 5.000 users recently published , distributed by Washington Post recently with that within two days after market launch of the game , the number of re@@ persec@@ uted people every day 30 minutes , from 45 percent to 53 percent . &quot;
the company does not know who plays out of which Pok@@ é@@ mon Go plays - it only sees the raw data for an increase in performance .
&quot; many public awareness campaigns on health , people want to take &quot; &quot; get 30 minutes time to come &quot; &quot; from the sofa to come &quot; and &quot; each day is active to be active , because many public messages are boring to be boring and come from people coming . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the meaning of sport cannot be evaluated . &quot;
&quot; who regularly drives sports , reduces its chances to ill cancer or depression . &quot;
&quot; physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here . &quot;
&quot; but the wonderful at Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors , making them fun . &quot;
&quot; thus , three pillars of health covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine , as well as fun . &quot;
some people join hunting even new friend@@ ships .
as always there are m@@ ür@@ rical play@@ ber who have to always complain about something .
&quot; and yes , someone could run against a door . &quot;
what is it ?
it has been a breakthrough .
&quot; even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit has already been able to follow our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to drive sports as it does this game . &quot;
the new will lose his maturity and use it with time .
&quot; however , because of Pok@@ em@@ ons success , there will be more games to unite the apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ites in the real world and can help many people on hunting , active , f@@ itter and health@@ ier . &quot;

the 19 year old American tur@@ ner in er@@ kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday for a multi @-@ scale title and increased the gap between themselves and the rest of the world from all eyes under the spot@@ light of the Olympic Games .
&quot; their final result of 6@@ 2.@@ 198 was clearly located in front of the Silver medal , and &quot; Final Five &quot; team in A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bron@@ z@@ em@@ ed@@ a@@ illen@@ ium Ali@@ ya Mu@@ st@@ af@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; the Americ@@ ana Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ nt on the Swedish tree during the individual struggle of women at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osexu@@ elle Americ@@ an@@ erin , which wins a multi @-@ scale title and overall the fifth , while she consoli@@ dates their reputation to be the best of their generation or even at all . &quot;
it broke out in t@@ ears as their final result was shown and their long journey came to this moment .
&quot; this success represents them in the same league like unique athletes such as Michael P@@ helps , which brought their sports to new heights : &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es has dominated their sports art , 15 world @-@ class ch@@ illing - including 10 gold med@@ als - including 10 gold med@@ als - with such amazing exercises , that the Olympic Games of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u rescue on her said that she is &quot; the best tower in that I have ever seen . &quot;
&quot; it was expecting a final test in Brazil , a competition which was not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of athletes , but rather between her and a burden over@@ sized expectations . &quot;
&quot; not return with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be considered as disappointment . &quot;
&quot; the Americ@@ ana Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace her after each gold and silver in the individual campaign of women at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday , have won &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es took the first medal on Tuesday , while on the far@@ ewell party he served on the far@@ ewell party of the upcoming team Co@@ ordin@@ ator in Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi . &quot;
&quot; although Bil@@ es consisted on it , during their long way@@ marks on the top to have never planned the future , this is not really true . &quot;
part of their soil exercises - which contain its typical tum@@ bling pass - is matched to Latin American music which would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
that is not a coinci@@ dence .
&quot; this girl , which adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and was discovered by Train@@ ee A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother during a school@@ ing into the gym was trained in the bo@@ or@@ man , became force . &quot;
&quot; since the summer of 2013 , it has no longer been lost since the summer of 2013 , a victory series which will keep as long as it desires . &quot;
&quot; even if Mu@@ st@@ af@@ ina led by two la@@ ths , which led the picture . &quot;
Swedish and Bo@@ dent@@ ur@@ nen - in which Bil@@ es the World Championship holds - lau@@ ered .
they picked up again with 15.@@ 433 on the flo@@ ck again - and sat with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground .
&quot; Ra@@ is@@ man im@@ pover@@ ished it gentle as she was her grand@@ ality - a pure form@@ ality - and t@@ ears currents on Bil@@ es sh@@ iny red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision which it was once in their collective bar@@ gain drive , to reality . &quot;
&quot; the performance Ra@@ is@@ mans was a reven@@ ge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal at a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke at Mu@@ st@@ af@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; this time the 22 @-@ year team capital had called &quot; &quot; O@@ ma &quot; &quot; by the Americans . &quot;
&quot; after their for@@ equ@@ ation , they threw the audience to the audience , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback that sometimes appeared . &quot;
what Bil@@ es affects , so the E@@ we@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ ol@@ ds from the beginning of this week has a very new meaning : &quot;
police : 3 victims in serial port when listening to music in the car
&quot; according to police reporting that were published on Thursday , two women and one 12 years old girls have been shot in one of the fat@@ al attacks for a decade in the first serial line of Phoenix , while they stopped in the car and heard music . &quot;

&quot; the police shared with that the thir@@ sty murder had not been to be the result of a smo@@ kers , as the att@@ acker does not have the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , which were owned by one of the adult victims . &quot;
&quot; Pol@@ z@@ ic@@ pre@@ cher from Phoenix S@@ g@@ e. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting of the investig@@ ator to become a closer look to whether they are connected with four previous attacks . &quot;

&quot; it happens in a residential neighborhood in front of a house , distributed Howard of the K@@ HP@@ O , an affiliate of CB@@ S , beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is believed that the susp@@ ects has used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln . &quot;

mother of a 6 @-@ year old with micro@@ z@@ ephal@@ ia : &quot; it becomes better &quot;
&quot; like most 6 @-@ year @-@ ol@@ ds loves Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to the singing , toys and of course his mother . &quot;
&quot; but like the least of his aging , Ed@@ mund micro@@ z@@ ephal@@ ie , the result of a genetic disorder , about his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to during their pregnancy nothing knew . &quot;
&quot; when he came home the first time , my first thought , I did not create this . &quot;
I do not create this .
I did not let myself go .
&quot; what is not right at all -- of course , you have turned on it . &quot;
her husband Vincent and her was told that Ed@@ mund she can never realize it under circumstances and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they sm@@ ashed it to institu@@ tion@@ alize .
&quot; my first answer to this was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still make , &apos; &quot; declared Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot;
Ed@@ mund can run with the help of a wal@@ ker .
&quot; Ed@@ mund was able to leave neither sitting down to his third year , and he can still not speak . &quot;
but he slowly makes progress .
he can run with support and cycling .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers and sing .
&quot; Elizabeth shows the character language , the Ed@@ mund for &quot; Please refer to me something ahead . &quot;
&quot; we bring him character in &quot; , &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to CB@@ S News . &quot;
but it is not a typical character language -- says it . Ed@@ mund has invented some characters alone .
Micro@@ c@@ ephal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as with Ed@@ mund and infections with viruses such as mascul@@ ine or the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
symptoms and forecasts may vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how to influence the life of the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus In@@ infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to reminds one of the emotional price of a certain future .
&quot; I asked , what will happen ? &quot;
what will happen ?
and they still did not really know .
I have no longer asked for the progn@@ osis since a long time because I don &apos;t expect that someone can really say to me .
&quot; but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers by inf@@ ants , which were caused by the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus . &quot;
it becomes better .
you know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .

&quot; Mah@@ aj Brown , 6 , &quot; &quot; by bul@@ lets &quot; , &quot; over@@ lives in Philadelphia &quot;
&quot; the police shares with that the 6 @-@ year old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time that a 6 @-@ year child is shot . &quot;

why we are Simone to need Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
this is what I present to me under the Frauen@@ ol@@ ym@@ pi@@ am@@ ann@@ eship in the Tur@@ ks and that made out of more than one reason .
&quot; first , I have been there since 1984 at any summer Olympics , and the US had never been so dominant . &quot;
&quot; and secondly , this team has three gymn@@ ast , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Dou@@ glas and Lau@@ ren &quot; &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ e@@ dez , which inspir@@ es for many young girls of other skin colour . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the J@@ ü@@ din is and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian who is Ka@@ tho@@ lic@@ in is , ab@@ round , makes everyone proud . &quot;
this team finally reflects the US .
it has pushed the black and h@@ isp@@ an@@ ic presence at the top of this sport art .
in the last four years the number one was one of the female genital inside an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americ@@ an@@ erin .
last year Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 .
that shows strength .
at the last Olympic Games Gab@@ by Dou@@ glas was a surprise Olympi@@ ag@@ ew@@ inner and America .
&quot; now the world was able to be witness of the incredible performance of the triple World Championship in Simone Bil@@ es , Dou@@ glas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ ary@@ dez as it was unexpected , but master@@ ful g@@ ym@@ as@@ tics routines . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Simone became the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ ex@@ ual American , who won an individual model event for women . &quot;
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won Silver .
&quot; we are experiencing the top of this sport , but as a turn@@ around classes in the whole country do not come out . &quot;
Simone to create Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to create it into the ol@@ ymp@@ ic team .
&quot; they are the &quot; Last Five &quot; , &quot; because the next Olympi@@ am@@ ann@@ eship will have four gymn@@ asts in the team . furthermore , this is the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a train@@ ee . &quot;
&quot; the reality is that Tur@@ nen looks like a bit more expensive sports and tur@@ ner can be maintained primarily in private trainers who will be maintained for training , furniture , travel - clothing , competition and hotel rooms ( for the trainers and their tur@@ ner and families ) . the list can be saved as arbitr@@ arily . &quot;
the majority of these trainers are lying in weal@@ thy suburbs which can support the business .
&quot; in these clubs , Tur@@ ner will receive its entire training and this is a great @-@ term commitment to the families . &quot;
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , Train@@ ee of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , Train@@ ee of Lau@@ rie Her@@ od@@ dez , both have started their athletes since they have started with the tower . &quot;
&quot; we have to make the municipalities au@@ n countless , young girls , who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , an increased and more easily accessible finishing . &quot;
I was founded my gym of 20 years .
&quot; with my events , we have free and affordable tur@@ bine in Harlem for more than 15@@ ,000 urban@@ e teenagers ( especially black and h@@ isp@@ an@@ ic ) , and national and international vic@@ tors . &quot;
&quot; in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer the youth high @-@ quality tur@@ bine , which deserve the opportunity to learn from this great ol@@ ymp@@ ic sport . &quot;
&quot; develop strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and identification for the mind . &quot;
this combination offers li@@ fel@@ ong benefits to health and education and professional success .
&quot; it is the inspiration of this team , the thousands of young girls to get involved in the tower , and that is great . &quot;
&quot; it is so important to participate in the sport , especially for girls . &quot;
this is such an exciting time .
&quot; thanks Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this genuine presentation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ en des ol@@ ymp@@ ic team blast and thanks to catch you so many young girls with different background motiv@@ ates their way to begin healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;

Jerem@@ y Hunt must now act the lift up and speak the concerns of assistance .
&quot; if he did not do this , so we have made the assistance veterin@@ aries that they are ready to perform further work measures . &quot;

&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , General Manager of the N@@ HS employees , called for assistance to quit the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; working measures do not reach only little , but already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patient , care and their families only worries , need and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
&quot; in the last two months , we talked to the comm@@ itt@@ ee of assistance and with the Ministry of Health , as well as other mini@@ stries in response to concerns about the m@@ und@@ ing and the wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ low@@ ings . &quot;

culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ es can be flour@@ ished in Muslim regions
&quot; the former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was last year on a transfer of government not@@ hing@@ ness because of corruption from office , &quot;
a culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ ess has led to that far @-@ widespread election was ignor@@ ant in Muslim congreg@@ ations and will be revealed today as an anni@@ hil@@ ation report today .
&quot; the former head of Sir Eric Pic@@ kl@@ es attack the police , elect@@ oral and Rath@@ geber that have ign@@ ores evidence of elect@@ oral abuse regarding ethnic and religion . &quot;
&quot; the former minister of integration and municipal government , who now is a Ant@@ kor@@ rup@@ tion@@ ist , said that the in@@ tim@@ id@@ ation of constitu@@ ents from religious motives would be so bad that it should be the police to protect dis@@ bur@@ ring outside of elect@@ or@@ inen in order to protect voters . &quot;
he recommends that voters should lead a credit card to prove their identity in elections .
at the moment a voters must name merely its name and address .
&quot; the report suggests , not remot@@ ely ink on the finger of a person when she vote their elect@@ oral vote to prevent that somebody has chosen twice . &quot;
&quot; W@@ hi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower should get more protection , says Sir Eric . &quot;
he calls for the press to have more access to common documents and decisions of not official comm@@ itt@@ ees or working groups .
&quot; this serves not only against elect@@ oral fraud , but also the municipal government before the broader corruption and financial culture , which goes to it , &quot; said . &quot;
the report was placed by Down@@ ing Street as a result of the Tower of Ham@@ lets elect@@ oral sk@@ and@@ als in the East of London .
&quot; last year a special optional court decided that the acting may@@ or of Lut@@ on Rah@@ man , after a l@@ itan@@ ism to corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry . &quot;
&quot; the court was that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community , &quot; and that he could not toler@@ ate his critics with R@@ is@@ sm@@ us@@ - and Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ ists on silence . &quot;
&quot; Rah@@ man should have led &quot; his campaign on the basis , that it is the most important duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
up to 300 voices were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the consequence of an im@@ itation to choose one person as someone else .
Sir Eric said that there were no evidence of fraud throughout the country .
&quot; in particular , he expressed particularly al@@ ar@@ ming for frau@@ dul@@ ent wall@@ et - for the older members of the Muslim community pressure on people could have made a candidate of their choice . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to s@@ our@@ ge the elect@@ oral system , including the leader of ways to prove its identity . &quot;
&quot; in his report it is stated as proof that pressure on the most vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exer@@ ted , especially women and young people in order to choose according to the will of the elderly , especially the communities with Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ic or Leb@@ anese background . &quot;
&quot; there were concerns that ... government institutions have been such a behaviour due to politically correct &quot; over@@ sensitivity , concerning the eth@@ nie and religion . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to s@@ our@@ ge the system , including the ban that political activists &quot; &quot; button to stop &quot; &quot; election &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report , which is drawn by Ther@@ esa May is also demanded for curing registration , to prevent the elect@@ oral directory to im@@ mig@@ r@@ ation and social bet@@ ray@@ al purpose . &quot;
consider options to consider voters before the election after your credit card .
&quot; not distant ink on the finger of a person , once they have given their voice to prevent that someone has chosen twice . &quot;
systematic review regarding the nationality of a person to ensure that they are entitled to be eligible .
a three @-@ year limit on applications to an automatic wall@@ et .
to edit that political activists complete stamp and edit envel@@ ope of stamp elections .
the police give the authority to set off for elect@@ oral work@@ stations .
a legislative change that facilitates an indic@@ t@@ ment due to in@@ tim@@ id@@ ation according to the representation of the People Act 1983 ( People &apos;s Act in 1983 ) .
Phot@@ ograph@@ s offered in elect@@ oral work@@ stations .
requirement that only English can be used in elect@@ oral stations ( except for Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that the employees will usually enforce that voters go alone into the choice .
Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it &apos; ast@@ ound@@ ing &apos; that after the Tower of Ham@@ lets fall no penalty show .
&quot; the elect@@ oral Court has declared to Rah@@ man and his de@@ pu@@ ties for a l@@ itan@@ ism to corrupt and illegal practices as un@@ de@@ dly , &quot; said . &quot;
he was sufficiently aware of a number of reasons - according to the high requirements in the criminal proceedings - guilty .
he also cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed the effective &quot; subscription controls &quot; of the Op@@ inion Pro@@ visions of the Rath@@ geber .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the court part of Tower Ham@@ lets of the last year was a warning signal .
&quot; our country contributes to the mother of the parliaments of a proud heritage , but the wor@@ rying spread of elect@@ oral and rej@@ ecting some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot;

&quot; at the honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces , FE@@ MA@@ IL created a lists to Olympi@@ oni@@ ken , which have more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Dutch pages . &quot;

&quot; except K@@ ates double rooms at the Rad@@ ren@@ n@@ bahn meadows many people on the internet , like a certain arch@@ ery of the Zw@@ illing of A @-@ pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ le could be . &quot;
&quot; the team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a storm on Twitter , after pictures , on which he looks similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the arch@@ ery got the mad@@ ness in social media with and gave to hear that he has already heard since his childhood , that he looks like Leo . &quot;
&quot; I myself see no big simil@@ arity with the exception of the fac@@ ial hair , distributed Bra@@ dy of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot;
&quot; he is a clo@@ cking guy , so I hate the probably as a comp@@ liment . &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly place more in the center : the sincere simil@@ arity between the British Weit@@ spr@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .

travel Ian W@@ right incl@@ ined for a guide his tongue to the dirty places of Europe
a bri@@ ghter travel under@@ went his immune system and wor@@ ger@@ ef@@ lex by a serious examination - by hi@@ ding some of the dirty and popular places of Europe .
&quot; the moder@@ ator and travel author Ian W@@ right , 51 , made of Suff@@ olk , his course at the Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a dishwasher as well as a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system . &quot;
&quot; in front of the distr@@ action of each object , he used a L@@ umin@@ ometer for itself and show us what he will get involved . &quot;
&quot; but the experiment , that under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength &quot; was fil@@ tered , some surprising results brought to day@@ light . &quot;
&quot; the thought , the fl@@ aw of a draw toil@@ ette cuts , which was already used by thousands of others , but actually , in a kitchen clo@@ aked more bad bacteria . &quot;
&quot; on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke with physicians and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria , as well as his own health . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , nothing left what he arous@@ ed , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth . &quot;
&quot; Mr. W@@ right was known to test the resistance of his Dar@@ ms by passing through the world , as well as wonderful things . &quot;
&quot; from public funds to train stations by toilets , the task set his immune system definitely under a sample &quot;
&quot; in the film he told me : &quot; already as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned what my health concerns and I have put all sorts of things into my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and mud water . &quot;
in the film he was justified by his reputation .

its pro@@ ofs showed a L@@ umin@@ om@@ eter@@ ies of more than 4000 units .
&quot; compared to this , the L@@ umin@@ om@@ eter@@ ies is fresh from less than 60 . &quot;

Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products vali@@ o produced the Reis@@ ef@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength &quot; which shows the bacterial number of different places like the bathroom
&quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; that comes to the worst thing I have in a toilet . &quot;
there is nothing dirt than that !
&quot; I will not check anything here , because it is here inside . &quot;

something that is fascinating to look and at the same time declar@@ es the advantages of probi@@ ot@@ ics .
we carried out Bra@@ in@@ stor@@ m@@ ings by so that we said &quot; L@@ ass us Ian . &quot;
pret@@ end that the interest in the intest@@ inal health is becoming a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment , the importance of the intest@@ inal health and how it is associated with the immune system . &quot;
&quot; the growing interest in the intest@@ inal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary , we were able to provide consumers with more information on an interesting way . &quot;
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the director of the film , added : &quot; &quot; let me say it so - I could have reli@@ ed my respect for Ian that I have reli@@ ed with him that I have instruc@@ ted to him , like the ec@@ umen@@ ical Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot;
&quot; of course there were things where it was easier to bring them , they tail and others where this was quite difficult . &quot;
&quot; I am glad we recorded some of these dirty delicacies in film . &quot;
&quot; in one of the survey conducted by the year 2015 , 84 percent of all surv@@ ey@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ i bacteria in particular with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ine and 58 percent said that they are at least occasionally products , the ad@@ ul@@ ter@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ i . &quot;
A@@ social family destro@@ ys the social apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall &quot;
a as@@ o@@ zi@@ al family left their social welfare after a delay of £ 5@@ 0,000 because they had dominated their neighbours .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall . &quot;
&quot; once they have r@@ ape removed from their property , they found sho@@ cked the property of housing in a ir@@ repar@@ able state . &quot;
&quot; the W@@ rit@@ ing holes on , wood di@@ elen were made up , rub@@ b@@ ish was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was for@@ ated to the walls . &quot;
the family were inhabited and it is believed that they are now living in a private accommodation
&quot; Donn@@ a Mc@@ Ev@@ oy that works for domestic administration at Corn@@ wall Housing , said that they fear@@ ed that the apartment is no longer repaired . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; It was for the people here an absolute night@@ mare and I am the view that people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot;
there are many things to consider since this property is probably not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is mountain@@ ous and their reputation is also .
&quot; the couple had three sons , the inter@@ time lived in the apartment , and the police said that the terror that the family had joined , flo@@ or@@ ating with bas@@ eb@@ radi@@ ators , drug addi@@ tives and excessive swe@@ eping , ar@@ gue and floo@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ don , 47 whose name was on the rental agreement , received an arrangement for anti @-@ social behavior in June . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house , which will be demol@@ ished under certain circumstances , old refuse &quot;
&quot; in the estate we were tra@@ ded in the estate , in which in the past drugs were tra@@ ded , the wood@@ di@@ sti@@ ces . &quot;
neighbours spoke out that they saw them on the road and had to be called on the police regularly .
Corn@@ wall Housing del@@ o@@ gi@@ ed her and her partner this week r@@ ape from the property after they gave them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer them voluntarily .
&quot; the Del@@ o@@ gi@@ tion were hon@@ oured by light@@ ened neighbours , that said their lives was made to hell . &quot;
&quot; one said : &quot; &quot; she sent herself to anyone . &quot;
we lived 20 years beside them and it was always terrible .
&quot; the countless times , which we say the police here are incredible . &quot;
&quot; today , tomorrow we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood on because it was so quiet - this we are not used !
&quot; now , where they are finally gone , it will be nice . &quot;
&quot; Adam Fit@@ z@@ patri@@ ck , Neigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ light@@ Manager of Corn@@ wall Housing , said that it would have agreed the family to cooperate with the local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house , to which the police was called in regular intervals , 20 years of age . &quot;
on the over@@ flowing side of the congreg@@ ations were under@@ cast and old toys .
&quot; he added : &quot; &quot; it is a dis@@ grace that there is the ten@@ ant to accept any responsibility for their behavior and their family because a delay always is the last step , the Corn@@ wall Housing . &quot;
this was a very difficult case since the behaviour was extremely difficult and their deeds have to be horri@@ ble for their neighbours .
&quot; I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the community , who have cour@@ ageous in us and have the information we have provided . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this development of some neighbours is trou@@ bled and the message convey@@ s that anti @-@ social behavior will not be toler@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; Fit@@ z@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons have lived at different times in the house , but that they all have 20 . &quot;

&quot; in 2014 , the police led a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ es and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ don was given an ATM , after they had guilty of the property of a drug of class B in trade supervision . &quot;
&quot; they claimed that money for a tom@@ b@@ stone of their son Lee Skel@@ don be , who was in 2013 at a car accident . &quot;
&quot; after having been without Ob@@ d@@ ach , it will happen that T@@ anya and her partner now live in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh . &quot;
many gu@@ ards of the house were described with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
&quot; the police says that it ten@@ ant to enter ten@@ ants , which do not hold on the domestic order . &quot;
Angela C@@ row of the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall divided the delay of a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants that will not stop at home .
&quot; this goes to those who are thinking about themselves without self @-@ esteem , as well as those who were damaged by such a behavior , &quot; said she . &quot;
De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never toler@@ ate criminal and anti@@ social behavior that continue to work with partners to protect our communities .

President Donald Tru@@ mp now gave weaknesses of his election campaign in the previous re@@ publi@@ can Alta burg Ut@@ ah .
&quot; a rare moment , where usually large @-@ sp@@ uri@@ zes and self @-@ confident M@@ ultim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire expressed something like concerns , such as correspon@@ dents reported . &quot;
&quot; after spending 16 ri@@ vals in the own re@@ publi@@ can camp from the race , now grow the doubts about his success in the fight for the White House . &quot;
&quot; we have huge problems in Ut@@ ah , &quot; said Tru@@ mp before Evangel@@ ical Christians that he asked for support in important federal states like Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot;
&quot; gu@@ ilt be false reports about his can@@ did@@ acy , he took again his well @-@ known media . &quot;
re@@ publi@@ can Hoch@@ bur@@ ns
Ut@@ ah is usually a safe bank for re@@ public@@ ans .
&quot; according to a survey of Surv@@ ey@@ USA from June , Tru@@ mp and its competitors from the democr@@ ats , Hill@@ ary Clinton , equ@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; other institutes see tru@@ mp forward , but not with the distance that are common for re@@ publi@@ can candidates in the federal state . &quot;
regarded as endangered also Arizona and Georgia .
&quot; in an interview of the sen@@ ders CNB@@ C , Tru@@ mp answered on the question how he wants to stop rep@@ ent Clin@@ tons again : &quot; just as I have done it up until now . &quot;
&quot; and whether back : this will be &quot; &quot; either successful , or I will make a very nice , long vacation . &quot;
he is doing nothing other than to tell the truth .
&quot; if it is not an end for him at the end of reasons of political correc@@ t@@ ness , be that in order , said Tru@@ mp further . &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
&quot; according to Press@@ views , the Party Tru@@ mp should have been threatened with the support of his election campaign , he should not present no better conversion . &quot;
&quot; instead of doing , one wants to attack the candidates of the re@@ public@@ ans for the Congress stronger among arms . &quot;

&quot; in short notice , the Kur@@ dish Church Germany expects a short notice of ten @-@ thousands of protection seeking from Turkey to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the medium term , it can even become &quot; &quot; several hundred thousand &quot; , &quot; believes in the &quot; &quot; president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; due to the harsh action of the Turkish president Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an after the coup , the Kur@@ dish Church is expecting a mass flight to Germany . &quot;
&quot; at short notice , I recommend using ten @-@ long @-@ term protective seekers from Turkey in Germany when the Erd@@ og@@ an regime fought the minorities and the democratic opposition continues &quot; , &quot; says the Secretary @-@ president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k the &quot; world &quot; from Friday . &quot;
&quot; because the government has already passed Kur@@ dish high @-@ bur@@ ners with prosec@@ ution , be 500,000 Kur@@ ds within Turkey on the run . &quot;
after the de@@ ed put@@ sch is still sec@@ ular and op@@ ted ethnic Tur@@ ks .
many are going to start in Europe if they will continue to be oppressed in Turkey .
&quot; it cannot be that a state that takes up refugees in their own country of refugees , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; the wr@@ apping of the targeted settlement of Syrian Arab@@ s in Kur@@ dish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tic cities . &quot;
&quot; thus , Erd@@ og@@ an wants to increase Erd@@ og@@ an to the remaining Kur@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; they are the last major minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have already been mature or marketed in the past hundred years , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also the CD@@ U member . &quot;
&quot; the ab@@ duc@@ ks called for that the Federal Government has positioned itself as sharp as Austria against Erd@@ og@@ an and its followers . &quot;
also in Germany there is a &quot; wit@@ ch @-@ hunt &quot; against Erd@@ og@@ an critics .
I feel no longer in Germany for the first time in Germany .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len Movement also fear@@ ed the flight of many towers abroad .
&quot; more Tur@@ ks are looking for asylum in Germany , mainly Kur@@ ds and visual positioning . &quot;
the fire mark@@ ings as goods @-@ supporters and other academ@@ ics will be the professional existence .
&quot; whoever does not fit and Erd@@ og@@ an lo@@ af , sits on the packed k@@ off@@ s , the way also the Kem@@ alists and Sä@@ kul@@ ele , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as the newspaper reported by calling on numbers of the Federal Ministry of Finance , the Tur@@ ks already reported the largest group of the persecution of political persecution . &quot;
&quot; on the date of 30 June , this is 11.@@ 386 people and thus nearly 29 percent of all recognized as asylum has been justified ( 39.@@ 625 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this survey , not the front of war , poverty or a perspective of perspective . &quot;
&quot; asylum entitled to the Basic Law are exclusively politically , so by state side , individually followed . &quot;

&quot; in 2005 the country @-@ day elections will not take place again at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ in parliament decided already at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; for bl@@ ö@@ der than so far it is not : summer holidays , He@@ ating and Land@@ tag@@ on fight . &quot;
the locals who are to be convinced by the elect@@ or@@ ators are on vacation .
&quot; the most popular holiday makers , which are on the country , on Us@@ edom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are no locals , so are not allowed to choose the country . &quot;
&quot; these are practical problems : in the holidays are hel@@ pers who spread the posters , ballo@@ ons , fl@@ aps , fl@@ aps and pass at the end of voices , just trou@@ bled . &quot;
&quot; until September 4 , 2016 , the elect@@ oral and last Fer@@ i@@ entag , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to go over the people in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; the hot phase , if one can say that at all , has just begun . &quot;
&quot; and it is also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition must fear his office . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , since 1998 strongest party , is now in surveys clearly behind the CD@@ U . &quot;
exciting is how strong Neul@@ ing Af@@ D cuts and what remains at the end of co@@ ali@@ tion@@ ist .
&quot; Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 Prime Minister , makes an almost in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous election campaign , one sees from his grandfather . &quot;
&quot; he travels through the land , divided ro@@ ses and pl@@ omas a little with the people , just as it did as already his legendary predecessor , Harald Ring@@ storff did . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , sail@@ ors get cold feet and gives the ch@@ anc@@ ellor Merkel the gu@@ ing of the Af@@ ales of the Af@@ D . &quot;
&quot; their refuge@@ e policy , you &quot; &quot; We create &quot; &quot; have accelerated the rise of the right @-@ op@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably also cost him the beautiful ministry . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U with their nickname data , the Interior Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced as it is , if you are at the wrong time at the right place election campaign . &quot;
she was invited twice the ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel ; Merkel &apos;s Bundestag is in the north @-@ east .
&quot; but the target group does not vote , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony da as Mec@@ kl@@ en@@ burger and Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; there was probably the majority from other federal states , &quot; &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR . &quot;
&quot; but it is a shame to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , the Nord@@ ost CD@@ U largely disp@@ ens@@ ed to the usual elect@@ oral conditions on market places and in m@@ alls with umbrellas and ballo@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; this , so co@@ conut , plays only a &quot; lower role &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Union also has ma@@ stered that you have taken away on the land , that it needs to be very strict to find a wire to the people again . &quot;
&quot; you are doing it like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : in the breadth of the country hardly there . &quot;
&quot; the Council of the CD@@ U elect@@ oral struggles Kok@@ ert at his fellow ar@@ gue is also self @-@ un@@ lar@@ v@@ ating : &quot; you must go there , namely where people are : dor@@ sal , Golden Wed@@ dings , every Birth@@ day party must be used . &quot;
&quot; because much at stake , Sell@@ ering has now called for a particularly committed election campaign . &quot;
&quot; in surveys , the Socialists and Democrats last at least 22 percent behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just just before the Af@@ D ( 19 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the election of 2011 , the SPD had still clearly gained with 35,@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Gre@@ ens , small part@@ ei with seven percent in surveys , should probably be able to create the jump into the land day . &quot;
they make a modern virtu@@ e from the holiday @-@ need for a modern virtu@@ e and put their elect@@ oral cre@@ ase in the Internet .
&quot; online elect@@ oral campaign , &quot; it calls the national CEO Claudia Müller . &quot;
otherwise the green elect@@ oral cont@@ ests on track search for local stimulation under the tourists .
&quot; Sil@@ ke Ga@@ ek , the nickname @-@ did@@ atin , cur@@ v@@ t straight with a boat through the m@@ ec@@ kl@@ en@@ burg@@ ische lakes and finds it even beautiful . &quot;
&quot; your impression : &quot; &quot; election in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is no punishment . &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ rehabilitation : restaurants suffer from blocking
&quot; when the B 27 is filled with the B 27 , there is nothing to complain . &quot;
&quot; for those responsible for the construction of constructions , starting at 5.@@ 30 am and only at 20 o &apos;clock , there are all@@ ay praise . &quot;
&quot; they have done everything fairly delicate , &quot; tells El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff of the jet gas station . &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is no default .
&quot; the construction site could be moved on the beginning of the mid @-@ season at the beginning of October , until the end of October is supposed to be ready . &quot;
&quot; praised will also be the resulting from the responsible for construction work , for example if it comes to establishment of comfort . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site on Monday to the south , and also the blocking of the asphalt road in O@@ f@@ ter@@ dingen has been removed and therefore also the connection to Rot@@ tenburg is again , the traffic situation within the place relaxed . &quot;
the citizens can now proceed from O@@ f@@ ter@@ dingen from the B 27 again .
transportation through the place seems to go back .
&quot; there were partly substantial complaints , &quot; &quot; says the responsible management of the renovation management of the rehabilitation leader Florian King . &quot;
&quot; residents of Bach@@ ar Road , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and the White @-@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many shaf@@ ts were sear@@ ched and more their Nav@@ i confidential than the sign@@ ment . &quot;
what led to man@@ ne@@ er trucks in residential areas .
&quot; since the speed tr@@ ages were not respected , the community called for the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen . &quot;
&quot; there was considerable transi@@ tions , &quot; says King , who continued himself on the spot about the situation . &quot;
we have been planted two to three per minute .
the quick@@ est was on the pace with 77 St@@ und@@ per per cent in the temp@@ o @-@ 30 zone .
&quot; since the construction site , it has become more quiet . &quot;
for business@@ men at the B 27 it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ tenburg now the street is open again .
business@@ men don &apos;t like to have a look at the maps .
&quot; but that the B 27 rehabilitation has led to sales in sales in sales , everyone lets you look through . &quot;
&quot; however , some more and some less affected . &quot;
&quot; who has less to do with the &quot; &quot; end customer &quot; , &quot; for other companies , for which the rehabilitation has no consequences . &quot;
&quot; even when the aut@@ oh@@ aus Ma@@ ier speaks Thomas Sul@@ z from a &quot; &quot; most light decline &quot; , &quot; but also one that of course lacks . &quot;
most exploited are the locom@@ otive along the road .
&quot; J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds clear words . &quot;
this is already existence .
&quot; not only him , but all guest places have made it hard . &quot;
&quot; there was the customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil . &quot;
we have to be happy about every euro sales .
&quot; the sales figures rose by &quot; &quot; far over 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
road marking did not cast its operations for two years .
half of his employees have to release .
&quot; if I would have been a company with 4000 employees and the half would have been released , the policy would have re@@ acted differently . &quot;
&quot; instead , President Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request by g@@ öh@@ ner if it could give a financial balance , otherwise benefit from the advantages of the position at the B 27 Now they also have the dis@@ advantages that arise through the rehabilitation . &quot;
&quot; g@@ öh@@ ner knows from other farms , where such things have been dealt with . &quot;
with all boiler is g@@ öh@@ ner is certain that his host care will continue .
&quot; finally , the family run has been settled since 17@@ 15 , it refers to the long history . &quot;
&quot; that other regul@@ ars are now being subject to complicated traffic , less frequently , can he understand . &quot;
&quot; if you cannot drive , it is also elsewhere . &quot;
&quot; that his master kli@@ el after the end of the san@@ itation will be returned again , it has no doubts . &quot;
&quot; despite the crises with BSE and bir@@ d@@ oll , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the impact of the B 27 construction work on its customers for the greatest crisis that has experienced its hospitality in their long years of history . &quot;
&quot; six months of construction work , that is already brutal . &quot;
constantly being scre@@ ened in the name of the terrorist attack .
&quot; after the recent attacks , the Minister of Ma@@ izi@@ ère presents a di@@ ck@@ es security package . &quot;
but what has a patient status to do with terror ?
and what does the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the Com@@ promis@@ ers .
&quot; all his proposals are &quot; politically reasonable &quot; , &quot; says the Federal Minister of Ministers at the presentation of his new safety deposit . &quot;
you call for anybody .
&quot; other , further points would initially be discussed within the parties . &quot;
also on the part I could give myself .
&quot; but as an interior minister , he was located in the results and at a &quot; &quot; achiev@@ able consensus &quot; within the coalition . &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère has a little bit of time after recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach . before he presents its conclusions for safety in the Republic .
but they are now the more extensive .
&quot; a lot is already known , announced that a new safety office is to take care of the b@@ aking encrypted communication , is not new . &quot;
&quot; also , not the fact that Germany must implement multiple EU guidelines for passenger data and arms . &quot;
the call for more video surveillance and staff for safety authorities is also not surprising .
&quot; partly , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , a second place for proposals which had not been able to do with the SPD so far , he wants to deny sympath@@ ies for terrorist groups among punishment and ji@@ hadi@@ sts with double citizenship with double citizenship . &quot;
&quot; that will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; spatial the CD@@ U man . &quot;
&quot; however , it is still reasonable for reasonable and demanding , nothing but what the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ ists do not have any chances . &quot;
a few new ideas presented de Ma@@ izi@@ ère .
they are partly in themselves : he plans fast procedure for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for preventing people from deport@@ ation .
refugees who are targeted to the country should let their own smartphones and leave social media account for a safety check @-@ check .
&quot; when used asylum seekers , he wants to make some even worse than so far - about such a criminal off@@ ences or simply throwing their papers to waste their identity . &quot;
some of them is political and legally delicate .
man@@ ches also works un@@ balanced and leaves questions open .
&quot; and with some points - in the im@@ balance of thought , for example - the question arises : what does this actually have to do with security and terror ? &quot;
&quot; yes , says de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the topics of refugees and terror . &quot;
&quot; but it cannot be seen in speech , that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were dis@@ placed . &quot;
&quot; in addition , many people in the face of high refugees pay attention to safety . &quot;
&quot; and things which people deeply stir@@ red , left now also in elect@@ oral periods . &quot;
the inner security is enormous in the focus .
&quot; only the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the f@@ use is great .
&quot; and yes , there are elect@@ oral cont@@ ests . &quot;
the Union and the SPD can therefore become increasingly important in the subject of internal security .
in the past few days there was high up between the two parties .
&quot; only a gar@@ ment dispute over the equi@@ ties of the federal police , then over a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons Minister , in which the Ress@@ orts has also calling a Bur@@ ka ban and a de@@ conversion of the double citizenship . &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère lab@@ elled also here to reconc@@ iled sounds .
from a drop from the double pass he did nothing .
we have under@@ gone the discussion in Germany .
re@@ lu@@ ct@@ ance to make you new is not meaningful .
and at a Bur@@ ka ban he put constitutional concerns .
&quot; whether his own package is constitutional for all corners is constitutional and whether it is actually &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; is still to show itself . &quot;
there is a lot of what might think about dispute .
&quot; however , the SPD is trying to disp@@ ose of internal security in the subject of internal security . &quot;
&quot; party Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ alized only by cau@@ tions and says : &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to contribute to the security . &quot;
yet Volkswagen is still coming through .
despite diesel sk@@ and@@ als the delivery figures worldwide .
but not in all markets it runs round .
in the recall campaign there is vor@@ tex around a term .
Volkswagen starts with deliveries of finishing in the second half of the year .
&quot; in the course of Europe &apos;s biggest high@@ ways , the course of the course of the course of the year despite its many brands and some well @-@ going markets will continue to point out further . &quot;
&quot; but in July the core of the VW was in particular in Western Europe , and thus dist@@ res@@ sing the total sales as that in D@@ ax not@@ ated companies . &quot;
&quot; in July with 4@@ 49@@ 100 cars , 1.8 percent less vehicles than in previous year . &quot;
&quot; in Western Europe alone , to China the second most important market , sales of 14 percent below the previous year mon@@ at . &quot;
in the home market Germany s@@ ack@@ ten the deliveries to almost a six .
brand name Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weak@@ ening figures from July especially on two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; in addition , it has given it in some core markets through &quot; changed economic conditions &quot; a purchase order . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the situation around the coup in Turkey , the British V@@ ot@@ um was pushed out of the EU , explain a spokes@@ person . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , where the exhaust @-@ gases first escal@@ ated first , is also further a mini @-@ book now . &quot;
big support for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; overall , the mainly affected domestic brand of the Lower Saxony will continue to pass through diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , only one supplier minus minus 20 percent to 3,@@ 37 million vehicles . &quot;
the Group tri@@ b@@ sch@@ ef Fred Kap@@ pler was able to continue a sales point from January to July .
1.@@ 3 percent more vehicles delivered Volkswagen at this time around 5,@@ 904 million .
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated with a software exhaust tests .
&quot; alone in Germany , VW around 2.5 million wag@@ ons calls for conversion to the workshops . &quot;
&quot; in the course of conversion , VW , that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects . &quot;
&quot; after refurb@@ ishing the vehicles give it in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions , or engine power no deterioration . &quot;
&quot; the auto point of the customer after refurb@@ ishing a &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; &quot; certificate , but do not speak of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was on Friday in business days . &quot;
reason are legal reasons .
&quot; the &quot; Focus &quot; had reports , Volkswagen grant its German customers now a guarantee for re @-@ compens@@ ated diesel models . &quot;
this was confirmed by the last Monday VW representative in the Federal Ministry of Affairs .
the Ministry of Finance was confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; VW has to fulfil the requirements of my investigation Commission and the KBA . &quot;
&quot; devi@@ ations from it will not be accepted , &quot; stated Federal Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( C@@ SU ) according to the ministry . &quot;
VW has taken the guarantee that in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions , or engine power after refurb@@ ishing no deteri@@ or@@ ations take place and all the typ@@ ing relevant vehicle levels have been unchanged . &quot;
Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; warranty &quot; but not as it was in corporate travel .
&quot; with the wide term &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; &quot; Volkswagen is the possibility that customers come for example a half year after refurb@@ ishing about with a engine harm in a workshop - and this can lead to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do . &quot;
&quot; even in the customer interest , it is important to avoid that it is possible to do with any other damages which has nothing to do with the ab@@ norm@@ alities regarding possible warran@@ ties , as it was called . &quot;
&quot; therefore , VW does not use the term &quot; warranty &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands from rich savings in the future as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; ban@@ ker Josef Paul said on Thursday , &quot; it is only about 139 customers who park the 40 million euros on gyp@@ sum or daily cash . &quot;
&quot; the German Association of German banks speaks of an individual case , and does not see a signal : normal austerity must not be afraid to pay for their austerity pen@@ alties . &quot;
&quot; store banks money over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay her 0,@@ 4 percent pen@@ alties . &quot;
this fee requires the Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund from September from private and corporate clients for deposits of more than 100.000 euros on gyp@@ sum or daily basis .
&quot; the first 100,000 Euro are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100.000 costs EUR 400 euros in the year , &quot; said Paul . &quot;
&quot; he stro@@ ked for over 40 million euros , which could be with@@ drawn from one day to the other , and that he could not toler@@ ate it . &quot;
&quot; they lie with me on the central bank account and cause 0,@@ 4 percent costs , &quot; said the bank officer . &quot;
&quot; I cannot lie for every million 4000 euro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs he will continue to be further on the course of the exchange rate .
&quot; the cash is easy to let the deposit of Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank lie far too dangerous : &quot; I have experienced it four times , I don &apos;t have the fifth ! &quot; , &quot; said the ban@@ ker . &quot;
most of the customers would have understanding and inter@@ acting upon other forms of application .
only a few hiking to other banks .
&quot; the cooperative association of Bavaria stated : &quot; &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the ECB causes significant costs in all banks . &quot;
&quot; to wear alone , be &quot; business @-@ economically permanently possible . &quot;
&quot; some German banks have therefore increased their charges for account , credit cards or transfers . &quot;
&quot; with prosec@@ ution for deposits of three million euros , the Thuring@@ ian People - and Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank Al@@ ten@@ burg country had made with its skat@@ bank @-@ branch 2014 Head@@ lines . &quot;
&quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , chief executive officer of the banking association , said : &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay for deposits , to this is the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks have much too strong . &quot;
&quot; a ban@@ ker said , at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see , there is a cliff that is equipped by the property of something sum@@ p@@ tu@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; this can be a problem for a small bank to the problem , if they stro@@ ked for free money . &quot;
&quot; the 1911 founded Gen@@ oa bank G@@ mund has two branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot;
&quot; in the region live well @-@ known actor , athletes and entrepreneurs . &quot;
&quot; the cooperative association of Bavaria &quot; are currently no further banks known , which calculate an ex@@ ener@@ ation for deposits of private customers , &quot; said Spe@@ aker Ernst . &quot;
&quot; the President of the German National Banks and Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank ( BvR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had explained the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go to the neg@@ atives , is very , very high . &quot;
&quot; competition is tough , and it threat@@ ens the emig@@ ration of an@@ ions to the competition . &quot;
the customers in Germany will not like this in the width .
destination plates : who purchases actually sound@@ boards ?
lonely men middle aged men love plates .
&quot; before you come to the comm@@ ent@@ ail , in order to over@@ load it under the pseud@@ onym non @-@ emp@@ ower@@ ment of age , this statement leads to current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the multi@@ plic@@ ation of sound plates don &apos;t want to welcome a boom in m@@ illenni@@ als that would like to welcome re@@ alism of physical objects , but at Mid@@ life @-@ no@@ stal@@ gia . &quot;
those who have recently bought a record are all pre@@ dictions after the age of 45 and 54 .
&quot; in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most prob@@ able pot group . &quot;
&quot; there is also no hor@@ des by hob@@ by@@ collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older plate tists retain their feelings rather for itself ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it , alone time to spend ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) . &quot;
but do not agree the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
&quot; if this blog would be a news report on TV , I would follow the camera while in the midst of a busy road in Soho , a hum@@ ble way to keep my hands and conf@@ ess as : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
&quot; so , let &apos;s take a look at it . &quot;
&quot; even if the heart sole is slowly moving to its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent sellers were located - there are still a handful of fantastic record stores . &quot;
&quot; I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman , to turn the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and vegetable through observation . &quot;
&quot; Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , which I found by S@@ ister Ray ( data number : eight men middle age ) into the Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( data number : eight men middle age ) , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is a day long because of a meeting in London and passes through the shops in order to fill the few hours . &quot;
&quot; is he a Coll@@ ectors , ask me ? &quot;
&quot; I already value &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates . &quot;
&quot; this sound@@ ed boards , above shown ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I am not followed him home ) , dress the walls of his living room . &quot;
&quot; the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and sing@@ les , the result of its available income : he is now able to buy plates , which he could not afford , when they appeared and once again buy objects which he has sold , when he was young and pl@@ edge . &quot;
&quot; many things I buy , are out of the late 60@@ s , early 70@@ s , which appeared , when I was 11 or 12 . things I was probably too young to buy it , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; he agrees that those who want to buy the plates , rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and gladly spend alone time , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t and I don &apos;t drink too much . &quot;
that is my l@@ aster .
&quot; WE@@ Z , 25 , who works at S@@ ister Ray also believes that many customers , which he meets to the You@@ Go@@ v @-@ profile . &quot;
&quot; he also has noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the medi@@ enh@@ pe , people who have heard about the com@@ eback , and let us see their old records again . &quot;
&quot; by the discussions I have led , people usually have been entru@@ sted by 1998 or 1999 of their collection . &quot;
&quot; customers that once sold their plates , to buy CDs , sell their CDs to buy their records back again . &quot;
this would explain the boom to followers of the turn@@ table of a certain age .
but what about the alleg@@ ed emotional significance of plates ?
&quot; it takes only a few seconds in a shop like Ph@@ onica , to recognize that record is a so@@ othing community of equality . &quot;
&quot; according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers attended the contact @-@ free payment system . &quot;
&quot; some record @-@ fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world , and would like to withdraw to the stability of familiar sound clips , of objects , the happ@@ i@@ able che@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; I think sometimes , sometimes it can be filling a void or pos@@ eful ownership as a sort of con@@ sol@@ ation , &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot;
this is with me as collectors so and I think it is with many people so .
it is a simple way to deal with mentally .
&quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; fl@@ k@@ ills a staff of a record p@@ ile . &quot;
&quot; a survey of IC@@ M in April assumed that nearly 50 % of the people , who bought a record last month , they have not yet heard . &quot;
&quot; the survey also found out that 41 % have a record player that they never use , while 7 % of those who have a record , no turn@@ table . &quot;
&quot; at this time of news , I would probably be very concerned , while running through a p@@ ile of Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works with Sounds of the Universe ( data number : three men middle aged ) , has noticed a &quot; Trophy &quot; of Re@@ vi@@ vals . &quot;
&quot; someone came only recently here and said , &quot; &quot; I have no record player , but I would like to buy a radi@@ oh@@ ead sound plate , so that I can put them into the shelf &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is not a great percentage , but it definitely happens . &quot;
&quot; more product @-@ las@@ ered , less musi@@ cally . &quot;
we have people who say : &quot; I have no turn@@ table . &quot;
&quot; these are younger people , not older that are only slowly coming . &quot;
&quot; f@@ op@@ p that has dedicated the vinyl , almost a whole floor , has a b@@ lower audience , when I re@@ w@@ r . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ ag@@ ej@@ ungs and women middle ages . &quot;
&quot; even if the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above @-@ standing shops - Wild Be@@ asts , syn@@ thesi@@ zer and sex@@ ter pop instead of experimental jazz dr@@ yers from the speakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers . &quot;
&quot; none of them looks strange , but nag@@ ging psych@@ mat@@ a are hard to be imagin@@ able if one stands next to someone over 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , runs for several minutes in the shop and considers the variation of the available plates for sale . &quot;
it is more likely to make a window man@@ ne@@ a than a big purchase .
&quot; it does not deserve much , so the collecting of plates is not a real option , says it . &quot;
it costs much .
&quot; it &apos;s easy to listen to music from a computer or to other way , but the beauty of plates is ... it drives with a lov@@ able s@@ eu@@ zer . &quot;
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it really is unique .
&quot; my last stop is a shop , by which said that a new generation of turn@@ around were said : urban out@@ f@@ itters . &quot;
&quot; while I give the impression that Je@@ ans @-@ Hot@@ p@@ ants to patterns , I observed a group of young teen@@ ager , before a father and his daughter to think about a cros@@ ley turn@@ table . &quot;
&quot; on the left is a staircase , a wall full of plates of Adel@@ e , J@@ eff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; no one sees himself - maybe because they are only pure decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to grasp them . &quot;
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
&quot; but considering that any attraction for these objects mean more money for the industry , and to send some customers to the depths Soh@@ os for more , there is nothing to complain . &quot;
&quot; there is no surprise that a population group , which has more time and money than others , also the one that is most for luxury , like plates . &quot;
&quot; even if my neigh@@ bor agree that the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote , let them be , at least in record business in Soho , the large number of female collectors , who exist in reality , turn@@ around and Online@@ for@@ en exist . &quot;
these people are probably working hard at school or in offices .

French dish re@@ jects supply of demo@@ li@@ tion of businesses in the jungle refuge@@ e camp
&quot; a French dish has rejected a proposal from the authorities in Calais , doz@@ ens of pro@@ visional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais , where thousands of refugees live . &quot;
&quot; for a place of jurisdiction this week argu@@ ed the authorities in Calais that the state should be authorized to offer 72 pro@@ visional businesses to offer , hair@@ dressing services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 P@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in pro@@ visional restaurants . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ f@@ ecture Calais arg@@ um@@ ented that these places should be lower , because they would represent a parallel economy , from which no taxes would be paid out of which a fire and san@@ itation risk . &quot;
&quot; humanitarian groups shared the court that the shops and restaurants are important , as the free meals offered by the state supported association and other groups that would offer sufficient food for the growing numbers in the camp . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it led out that the pro@@ visional shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need . &quot;
&quot; a court in Lille decided that there were no legal basis for the instruction of people who operate 72 pro@@ visional transactions , but spatial that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Calais . &quot;
&quot; judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that the grocery stores , cafes and restaurants play a much greater role to feed as merely folks who live in extremely prec@@ ari@@ ous conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas of quiet meeting places between refugees and volunteers will offer .
&quot; one of the places that was threatened by the decay , the young Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , the non @-@ profit classes , and 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as a consultation regarding asylum seekers for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot;
more than 17@@ 0,000 people have signed the petition to keep the Kids &apos; Café .

here comes the En@@ light@@ trailer trailer
&quot; Germany Ras@@ er must adapt to the next generation of speed devices : in various federal states , among others in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash devices are tested , the Tem@@ pos@@ als are to be particularly effective . &quot;
&quot; the fut@@ uris@@ tic end@@ ow@@ ering trailer of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example at accident points , where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police . &quot;
&quot; for example , on highway construction , or to san@@ itation bridges with temporary cap@@ tion , there is often no necessary infrastructure to provide there with a stationary aper@@ ture for the compliance of the speed limit . &quot;
a lasting construction can however be too dangerous or costly .
the En@@ light@@ trailer is self @-@ sufficient : his battery keeps on un@@ interrupted measurement operation five days , the case data is encrypted via a modem . &quot;
&quot; with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can be recorded across multiple tracks simultaneously . &quot;
variable speed display as well as passage to time , chassis and vehicle class can also be monitored . &quot;
&quot; in high @-@ reaching condition , one can move the p@@ endant according to manufacturer with each car with a trailer h@@ it@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; so that it is not easy to use , he is lower@@ ed in the measurement operation so that the wheels in the pan@@ zer@@ ks and the way also disappear . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should be protected from V@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; since 2015 , the trailer will be tested according to details of Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and now also used . &quot;
&quot; in addition , foreign authorities bl@@ ashes with the new technique : younger has France 100 pieces , after an order of 150 pieces last year . &quot;
United Kingdom gets silver in the 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold
&quot; the impressive performance of Great Britain at the 7 @-@ he Ru@@ g@@ by came to a final stop at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when she was negotiated with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the De@@ adly Stadium in Rio . &quot;
&quot; Fi@@ ji , a master@@ class in handling , side @-@ Step@@ ping , post @-@ liner , liner and ro@@ her strength to win Gold - their first Olympi@@ am@@ ed@@ aille of any colour . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was promised by the not too bad Tro@@ st@@ allion of silver medal - Great Britain in this day - and they could certainly be proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they sm@@ ote New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the distinct defeat of the bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ finals on the same day could fall back on them in the final . &quot;
but independently of it could have be@@ aten a 15 @-@ man team in this form .
it could be for GB a con@@ sol@@ ation - but it will probably not - at least a bridge tomorrow a gold medal for its neck is : Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben Ry@@ an , the former Chef for England from Wim@@ bl@@ edon . &quot;
GB had a difficult path behind .
eight years ago she lost under Ry@@ an every game with the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they lost only one .
&quot; this fl@@ ap is going to do , but progress is amazing . &quot;
Fi@@ ji was wonderful and made the attacks GB@@ s from fun abor@@ tion .
&quot; it felt for the captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co . an , when you run in driving buses . the World Series winner left 5 @-@ 0 to the top , as O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au in the corner . &quot;
&quot; with even four minutes of playing , Jerry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner , which he turned . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB has hardly taken the ball .
a Pre@@ par@@ rag@@ ing T@@ ackle of Mit@@ ch@@ ell stops the mountain of Mann Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa a third gate to achieve but it has fi@@ ji only kept .
in the seventh minute J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua in the right corner a touch down and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the re@@ petition and there was still over a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ ides by other weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB teams and stor@@ med up to line to make a goal .
the transformation brought up a 29 @-@ 0 up to a break .
&quot; it is so , as if Fi@@ ji was born to play that 7 to play , while GB is still da@@ allow@@ able . &quot;
it is that way .
&quot; GB led basic changes to the half @-@ time by and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for all four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time , up to Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova after a brilliant Interim play of Fi@@ ji . &quot;
&quot; Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt to GB , made a touch @-@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game ran for a long time in favour of the South @-@ isl@@ anders , whose fans were st@@ aves , flags and dan@@ ces on the tri@@ bun@@ es . &quot;
it was not hard to admire the play@@ ful approach fe@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame took the i @-@ bag with an additional attempt in the last seconds .
the P@@ fi@@ ff @-@ ön@@ te , the Fi@@ j@@ is um@@ arm@@ oured and GB k@@ ick@@ ed cr@@ ushed in the grass . &quot;
earlier on the day Fi@@ ji Japan had defe@@ ated in the semi @-@ finals with 20 @-@ 5 defe@@ ated and Great Britain in the middle of the race - Great Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference .
&quot; K@@ yle Brown brought the boom in the first half of the front , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke down the line with an impressive foot@@ work and achieved a gate among the positions in the second half . &quot;
&quot; a brilliant Tac@@ oma of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side teams , insured the gain - and thus the silver medal . &quot;
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by battle with the Cancer of trainer to the rowing machine
there will be no em@@ ot@@ in@@ aler@@ es gold than with these games and that wants to be hot .
&quot; from the first rowing up to the last , 220 hard H@@ ieve which enter the story , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional importance in their golden moment at Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; even though it was only the appl@@ ause that were on the ruin , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was all@@ present when they ru@@ ined the second Olympi@@ ag@@ old at two without tax wife in a row , the first women in the history of British sport , which laid down on such a scale . &quot;
&quot; their domin@@ ance was absolutely , at least their 39.@@ ter un@@ trained commitment , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant Ath@@ let@@ ches , which reflect on the surface with the elegance of t@@ ears , which is not reflected the way of the tri@@ ch . &quot;
behind every gold in the ruin there is a batt@@ ali@@ on willing to contribute to the incre@@ mental progress which would make the difference and it was nobody ever wonder@@ ful@@ ler as the coach who would not survive this day when he was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said he ris@@ ky .
&quot; I had bu@@ b@@ ular bs , the oper@@ able and they did it . &quot;
if you do not do that it spreads everywhere .
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
there is a little bit the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio had happiness that he could be treatment early 2014 , outside the season , start what the inter@@ ruption was held to a minimum , in case that in such circumstances is the correct term . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , so I had to go back again soon . &quot;
it was an incentive .
&quot; I was in hospital and ran on the station around - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice . &quot;
this is how it begins .
&quot; the ruin itself is already a challenge , but that makes it an even bigger one . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the victory of the victory , their first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a ner@@ ve @-@ up morning to talk to something more than usual and tried to work with his own fears . &quot;
&quot; St@@ anning , which was as captain in the Royal Arti@@ ll@@ ery Reg@@ iment in a bet in Afghanistan , &quot; I was this week an emotional wre@@ ck . this is perhaps something extremely , but it means so much . &quot;
&quot; it is repeated only , how much I mean that much I and Hel@@ en and Robin worked . &quot;
it was three fantastic years with hel@@ pers and Robin .
&quot; without Robin we would be no one , therefore a massive thanks to him . he is the best coach of the world . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t have a better person for training or a better coach .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have lost no race in the last five years .
the pair had a hard rhythm that could not help her opponent .
&quot; even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark had begun , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve . &quot;
we were caught very at the moment .
&quot; Hel@@ en called &quot; &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it really is important to s@@ nat@@ ch himself .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not to make something t@@ oll@@ es .
&quot; we had no fire@@ works today , we just wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race what we did . &quot;
the pair will take a time for one year before making decisions about his future will come .
Glo@@ ver must appear next week at a wedding , their own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall . &quot;
now they just want to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that my last race was .
that would have taken a lot of pressure .
&quot; in London it took around six months to concei@@ ve that I am an Olympic Games . &quot;
it was all that new for me and I was so gest@@ ed .
here it took about four minutes .
&quot; that feels so much better , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
31 years of exempl@@ ary education for clarity
&quot; the director of the water @-@ purpose &quot; &quot; V@@ eit@@ en@@ stein@@ group , &quot; R@@ upper@@ t Gö@@ ller , goes into retirement . &quot;
the association is regarded as &quot; bay@@ ern@@ al &quot; . &quot; &quot;
a small fr@@ ame@@ ful drinking water association as a model for large water producers .
this was the name of some time in the original world in a contribution of the Bav@@ arian radio broad@@ casting .
little later the water@@ forum of the government of sub@@ fran@@ ken the Zw@@ eck@@ verband .
the work of the V@@ eit@@ en@@ stone group yellow &quot; bay@@ ern@@ far as pre@@ formed . &quot;
&quot; behind all this is Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller , the 31 years in the Zw@@ eck@@ verband Staff was 28 years as managing director . &quot;
at the age of 65 he was passed into retirement in the age of 65 .
&quot; the drinking water purpose of the V@@ eit@@ en@@ stone group based in K@@ ott@@ endorf , municipality of Breit@@ brunn , which is annually about 150@@ 000 cu@@ bic metres of water and provides 32 places and hamlet with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; members communities are the congreg@@ ations Kirch@@ lau@@ ter , Breit@@ brunn , lau@@ gh , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the city Baun@@ ach . &quot;
for further towns and villages there are water supply agreements .
&quot; the current chair , broad@@ brun@@ ns of the Championship in Ger@@ tru@@ d stages ( F@@ W ) , reminded that Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller 1985 as Aquari@@ sten has been appointed member of the Executive Board since 1988 . &quot;
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they over@@ looked at the water conduc@@ tion and maintenance work on office and organizational activities , budget@@ ary systems , calcul@@ ating fees and lectures by weekends , &quot; said the chairman . &quot;
&quot; as outstanding events they called the start @-@ up and inaugur@@ ation of the new wells ( 1994 ) , plot of purchase in the area of the new wells ( 1998 ) and compensation for farmers , the re@@ purchase of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the sub@@ missions of water pipes . &quot;
&quot; there have been no stand@@ still , and you always record new additions because water life was be@@ ute and drinking water the most important food . &quot;
&quot; in her lau@@ dation , she praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers , reliable and correct service over 31 years . &quot;
&quot; he has used a lot of heart bl@@ oss@@ om for its water purpose , and it has lived in the water @-@ purpose association , as if it would be his own company . &quot;
a few weeks ago he had to present the success concept of the v@@ eit@@ ing group for nit@@ rates before the water forum of the District Church .
so he received a lot of recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller on her part commen@@ ced waters of Al@@ f@@ ons g@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years . &quot;
he is the best water@@ side and he was a loyal li@@ ck@@ board .
together we were an unbeatable team .
&quot; as a high point of view from his view , he signed the Brun@@ nen@@ bau and the re @-@ structured of the compul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; however , the biggest challenge and the hard@@ est use were however the quar@@ ry at the high vessel at Kirch@@ lau@@ ter on a 3rd of January . &quot;
&quot; here we had to work at minus 17 degrees throughout the night , so that the villages were supplied with water . &quot;
also the supply of new brunn can only be maintained because you filled the high vessel of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses .
the management of drinking water @-@ verbal association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from the succession of Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller .

steel - Licht@@ blick for German steel industry
the kr@@ isen@@ das exploited and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed from additional costs in milli@@ on@@ enh@@ öhe .
financial bur@@ dens that are threat@@ ening the industry from the green electricity fo@@ ams are from the table .
&quot; it lead in the liberation of renewable energy sources in the implementation of so @-@ known production in the German steel industry , &quot; Federal Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West German Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Fri@@ ag@@ Output ) . &quot;
I &apos;m really happy that we could finally reach negotiations after two years .
&quot; the European Commission was initially planned , the steel manufacturer , the G@@ ases of the Ho@@ cho@@ fen for generating electricity generation for their own consumption , to ask for cas@@ hier . &quot;
the steel industry threat@@ ens additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , there is now a fundamental certificate with the European Commission for talks with competitive advantage in Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager . &quot;
only when the generators are replaced in the steel pipes , all an EEG conversion of 20 percent . &quot;
but also these will not be collected in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed the agreement of Germany with the European Commission for self @-@ consumption .
&quot; thus , the status quo of the previous regulation will be largely fixed . &quot;
particular importance have the successful effort of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; steel &quot; &quot; future is a first step . &quot;
&quot; others must follow . &quot;
&quot; even in the reform of the emission level , climate and employment targets have been cut off , &quot; said IG Metall @-@ Chef Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from the financial crisis in 2008 and a significant price pressure .
last year the situation continues to be the world &apos;s largest revival in China in view of the weak@@ est domestic demand mas@@ sen@@ sive steel on the world market .
European manufacturers throw Chinese steel concerts for dump@@ ing .
in the course of this spring the situation has something relaxed .
&quot; to the one hand in@@ fu@@ tile v@@ aul@@ ts on import impact , for others , the economic views in China have turned into China . &quot;
un@@ clear how sustainable the price recovered .
the German industry pri@@ mus ThyssenKrupp remained in effect on Thursday .
last but the prizes could be more stagn@@ ated .
the industry react to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
ThyssenKrupp wanted not least to exclude certain works of single works .
&quot; in the German steel industry end of 2015 , around 86@@ ,000 people were busy at the end of 2015 . &quot;
in July the German steel manufacturer remain careful despite rising prices and increasing orders .
&quot; they produced with 3.4 million tons of good six percent less raw material than in previous year , such as the economic certificate of steel on Friday . &quot;
after a short increase in May the crowd returns the second month in a row .
&quot; since the beginning of the year , production is about two percent under the previous year . &quot;
the association is counting in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation with an increasing output .
&quot; community , spirit , health : sing sen@@ iors good
&quot; the singing has been accompanied her whole life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , in the school degree , she har@@ med the subject of music , and today s@@ ings the 78 @-@ year @-@ old in a sen@@ iors choir . &quot;
&quot; singing moved me - emotional and physically , &quot; describes it . &quot;
&quot; after a rehear@@ sal they feel balanced , cheerful and overall lively , says it . &quot;
&quot; in addition , they are doing something good in the way of doing their health and spirit . &quot;
&quot; for singing is equal from several perspectives a great hobby for sen@@ iors , says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ ker from the German senior liga . &quot;
&quot; most sen@@ iors sang in the choir and share with equality , the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; through the regular merger , the sen@@ iors can establish social contacts and maintain . &quot;
&quot; for frequently solve social and family structures at the age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
&quot; this experience also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in their choir : &quot; to speak and organise themselves on the others , and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of co@@ existence . &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in the positive sense .
for the elderly a deep and controlled breathing .
&quot; whoever calls for his l@@ ungs regularly , it is not so fast from the d@@ ust in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; even if it is about getting the sound of voice at the age , singing is an optimal hobby . &quot;
&quot; in elderly people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz of the senior community of sen@@ iors . &quot;
&quot; in the older generations , the shared singing had a much higher priority , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and in leisure , explains it . &quot;
&quot; L@@ enz frequently observed that singing or hearing from songs with older people have awak@@ ens many memories , often associated with positive emotions of their youth time . &quot;
&quot; through Li@@ ed@@ tex@@ te and especially melo@@ dies , even if the sick people suffer from long past events . &quot;
&quot; at singing , the head will also require a special performance , explains L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , to concentrate on their own voice and on a pre @-@ given rhythm and adapt to the other sinn@@ ers - that is a big cog@@ nitive challenge . &quot;
&quot; older people who live alone , exercise so , not just concentrate on yourself . &quot;
&quot; another positive aspect is the recognition that is driving through singing in choir , H@@ ac@@ ker . &quot;
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
also the self @-@ esteem grows through singing in choir .
&quot; to show yourself : if I have long something for something , I become better and alert about me - this experience strengthens . &quot;
good reasons to start with singing is so enough .
&quot; who wants to try a new hobby , should not hesitate - even if he means to have little talent , coun@@ cils . &quot;
&quot; man s@@ ings not alone - with 50 sin@@ ful people , who hear you hear when a tone goes beside it ? &quot;
&quot; in search of the right offer , sen@@ iors have different possibilities , says H@@ ac@@ ker . &quot;
sing someone out of the acquain@@ t@@ ances in a senior &apos;s choir , you can easily connect . &quot;
many cities also offer over@@ views over choirs in the area .
&quot; who would like to sing in a church choir , can directly contact the church or the church of the church . &quot;
many senior choirs can also be found via the Internet .
&quot; who does not have access to the internet , the family , friends or neighbors can ask for help in the Internet access . &quot;
&quot; who desire has to sing , should necessarily join a choir , in H@@ ac@@ ker . &quot;
singing is doing the soul good and has something to do - that applies to any age .

&quot; to her surprise the males did not leave the males too cold , but they stopped in contrast to the females always alike . &quot;
female cats can recognize the arous@@ al of cat &apos;s babies at the les@@ see of the little ones .
they respond to ten percent faster to Lau@@ te of k@@ ittens who have found themselves in great need as scientists from the veterin@@ arian University and the Medical School of Hannover ( MH@@ H ) .
&quot; K@@ ater also react on the ruins of k@@ ittens , but always alike . &quot;
&quot; evi@@ dently the acoustic differences between the renting of less and strong conf@@ isc@@ ated for the males either not perceived or not of significance , &quot; said the Bi@@ olog@@ in Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding by the MH@@ H . &quot;
it is first authorized in the study that was published on this Friday in the journal BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Bi@@ ology .
in a previous study the research team had already found out that the duration and sound height of the k@@ ittens have been distinguished with the ur@@ gency of their assistance .
&quot; observed , a total of nine adult men and eight men from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the MH@@ H . &quot;
they were played for a herd of little ones who were picked up for three minutes from the wor@@ f@@ box and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
&quot; for the others , they were confronted with scar@@ fs of stronger k@@ ittens , which were in addition high . &quot;
the researchers hold their results in spite of the low level of sample for informative .
&quot; all females , even those who had not had their own off@@ spring , differenti@@ ated on the terror &quot; , &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot;
they turned faster to the loud@@ speaker if this call@@ out of the very rainy k@@ ittens .
this ability may possibly be inn@@ umer@@ able or developers with the sexually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; said the Bi@@ olog@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; in the past , scientists have already examined many times when people studied the reactions of women and men in baby . &quot;
&quot; some studies also showed that women are sensitive to inf@@ ants , no matter if they were already mothers or not , reported the Bi@@ olog@@ ation Marina Sche@@ um . &quot;
Pod@@ ol@@ ski falls with &quot; gala &quot; after Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
in Turkey against the ru@@ sty football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ sed a arrest warran@@ t .
&quot; he is thrown , a member of a terrorist group . &quot;
&quot; for the first time after the coup , Turkey takes place again an important football match in Turkey . &quot;
&quot; before the Du@@ el of the Arch@@ riv@@ al between B@@ esi@@ kt@@ as Istanbul and Luke Pod@@ ol@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul to the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya is the official line clearly : &quot; business as usual &quot; &quot; is stated . &quot;
&quot; already when the exp@@ iration of the exp@@ ulsion of the exp@@ iration of the trial in July , the government , the everyday life of normal brush should not be affected . &quot;
&quot; but this does not apply to the di@@ gest@@ ure , the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who are responsible for the coup . &quot;
there is no contents before football .
against the former Star@@ k@@ ick@@ er Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ r introduced the prosec@@ ution of a arrest warran@@ t .
&quot; therefore , the meantime in America living in America living in South America , a member of a terrorist group . &quot;
Sü@@ kis@@ r should be supporters of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the coup Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an for the coup .
&quot; although first of all , it is valid for 90 days until October , in fact , this is the life of most Tur@@ ks , but as good as no effect . &quot;
the next &quot; democracy @-@ Wa@@ ine &quot; on public places throughout the country has declared Erd@@ og@@ an on Wednesday for ends .
the sport is - like all the land - split into p@@ endant and enemies of Earth .
especially fans of the worker club B@@ esi@@ kt@@ as are traditionally not among the friends of the President .
&quot; what the Gro@@ s of the Tur@@ ks , but considering dramatic experiences in history , is the strict rejection of military put@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; even so , even the fans agree - no matter whether their heart is for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or B@@ esi@@ kt@@ as . &quot;
at Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger &quot; gala &quot; will be there especially in Luke Pod@@ ol@@ ski .
his sporty value presented the Köl@@ ner in the ex@@ pi@@ red season under proof : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitors ended the 31 @-@ year @-@ old his first game time as a Top@@ sc@@ orer of his club .
in the end game against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he posted the 1 : 0 @-@ Sieg@@ tre@@ ffer .
&quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; Fan@@ atik &quot; &quot; said it : &quot; he was the best in the square . &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured his team of poker .
thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; took the dis@@ appointing season for the record a reconc@@ iled conclusion .
&quot; after the round @-@ round K.@@ o in the Champions League , &quot; lions &quot; also made in the Europe League early . &quot;
in the south by Li@@ g it was only for rank six .
the season was not good .
the Pok@@ al was the only way to win something .
&quot; this is what we managed and this is the most important thing , &quot; said Pod@@ ol@@ ski . &quot;
for Master B@@ esi@@ kt@@ as went better the game year better .
&quot; primarily thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who recorded with 26 strings as South @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ sch@@ ütz@@ en@@ nig the basis for the 14th title . &quot;
this is also the reason that the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31 @-@ year old .
&quot; at the AC Florence , the Gom@@ ez had not only announced the Gom@@ ez under the Treaty and not to return to B@@ esi@@ kt@@ as , because of the political situation in the country after its EM @-@ vacation . &quot;
&quot; when Mario is to come to us , he must only say &quot; , &quot; the journal &quot; &quot; K@@ ick@@ er &quot; &quot; Club chief F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; to this end the stor@@ ms should be ready to refrain from around a third of his to 7.5 million euros , Or@@ man set clear : &quot; &quot; its salary in Florence we cannot pay . &quot;
&quot; despite intelligence : these athletes have even med@@ als , chances at Olympia in Rio &quot;
the 34 @-@ year Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin has already been blocked twice due to D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower in Julia Step@@ an@@ owa must not start in Rio .
other over@@ led athle@@ tics @-@ sinn@@ ers can only lau@@ gh - they are fighting in Rio to med@@ als .
the theme certainly determines how the Head@@ lines at the Olympic Games in Rio .
&quot; the Russian swimm@@ ers in Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ owa , which had played after a doping @-@ lock her starting pretty short before playing , was replaced with their start ( 100 meters chest ) gr@@ ac@@ ess and expanded . &quot;
&quot; it offered a sk@@ ur@@ ri@@ le scenario : with a set @-@ up smile , she was still proud of the hall and had pro@@ vo@@ iced with their appearance . &quot;
&quot; as a place that they will not get gold , the audience broke out into a ju@@ bel@@ storm . &quot;
&quot; however , there are many more sports@@ men who go to start at the Olympic Games in Rio despite the intelligence of the past . &quot;
here an overview :
&quot; Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4@@ x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ ol@@ ds belongs to the contro@@ versi@@ al figures in the athle@@ tics . &quot;
he was locked two times because of D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
&quot; since his spell the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex World Champion even faster than before , it is more than 100 m in 9,@@ 80 seconds the number one in the world and is considered to be the biggest editor of Us@@ ain Bol@@ t . &quot;
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ y@@ ce ( 100 , 4@@ x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Season / Jam@@ aica ) had to sit in 2010 a six@@ sm@@ on@@ ati@@ ge lock , after you have been proven the intake of pain using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don . &quot;
&quot; she had had strong co@@ aches after surgery , defended the 29 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
Sandra Per@@ ko@@ vic ( Dis@@ cus / Croatia ) : 2011 was a positive effect in 2012 and European Championships from 2012 to 2016 positively on the banned stim@@ ul@@ ant means meth@@ yl@@ h@@ ex@@ an@@ amine .
Per@@ ko@@ vic enters the wis@@ ely intake and has been blocked for six months .
the four most widely lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the great gold fav@@ ori@@ tin .
&quot; La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ enters ( 200 , 400 , 4@@ x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ Season / USA ) : the Beijing @-@ Olympic champion and two @-@ painting world champion over 400 m , was already tested positive and 21 months . &quot;
a remedy for penis enlargement would have been responsible for bet@@ ray mer@@ ry .
&quot; this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ old over 200 and 400 m is the fastest man in the world . &quot;
&quot; I@@ wan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ ing , Belarus ) : probably hardly a athletes were recognized as many med@@ als . &quot;
&quot; so lost T@@ ich@@ on its World Championship title , from 2005 nine years later , after with him testosterone intelligence was established . &quot;
the meantime 40 @-@ year @-@ ol@@ ds had to leave Olympia @-@ Silver 2004 because of ster@@ oid @-@ D@@ op@@ ings and EM @-@ titles 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
the bronze bronze medal of the Olympic Games 2008 was given back to a judgment of the International Sport@@ sman Court of Justice in 2008 .
with 8@@ 0.@@ 04 m it is located at the rank two of the rank list .
&quot; Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km of walking , China ) : the Wel@@ tre@@ k@@ ord@@ ator and gold fav@@ ori@@ tin was only tested in May positive , but not yet in Rio . &quot;
&quot; at the 29 years old World Championship in the 29 years , references to the ing@@ esting of a bot@@ tled food supplements were found , the sp@@ re of the world @-@ anti @-@ doping @-@ agency WA@@ DA fell mild and ran already on 13 July . &quot;
Bom@@ b@@ enter@@ ror in Thailand - Austrian wo@@ unded - Mehr@@ ere T@@ ote
&quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand stand with the woman in contact , said the spokes@@ person of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Fri@@ day@@ early . &quot;
&quot; they have suffered cuts and have been treated in the hospital , but this has already been abandoned . &quot;
it was planned for the beginning of September .
&quot; whether the other explo@@ sions on the holidays ber@@ ian island Ph@@ uk@@ et , as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ GA , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ anned on also Austrian citizens are not yet un@@ clear . &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stand in this respect , with local authorities , so Schn@@ ö@@ ll . &quot;
&quot; at about 200 kilometres south of the capital of Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in were first explo@@ ded on Thursday night of two bom@@ bs . &quot;
&quot; according to the police an Tha@@ il@@ änder@@ in killed and around 20 people were wo@@ unded , including the Austrian , three German , three Lower Saxony and three Itali@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; on Fri@@ days , we went back two jumps at the same time , according to the authorities a further person was killed . &quot;
also from Ph@@ uk@@ et was reported in the morning a bom@@ bing .
in the det@@ on@@ ation close to the tourists popular Bad@@ est@@ ran@@ ds Pat@@ ong has been inju@@ red to police information .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani at the southeast coast of the country then explo@@ ded another bom@@ b that was a municipal enrich@@ ing .
the spr@@ inkl@@ ing was according to the authorities in a flower flo@@ oring in front of the Re@@ four of the coastal police force in the air .
&quot; finally , det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ GA and tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast as well as in Ch@@ anges on the southeast coast several associations . &quot;
they go from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was called . &quot;
&quot; the bom@@ bing bear the same manus@@ cript , &quot; said arm@@ ies Dan@@ ai Krit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Fri@@ days before journalists . &quot;
we assume that it is a coordinated attack .
&quot; it is too early to express yourself about possible motives - probably , however , it is about the deeds of Muslim reb@@ els . &quot;
also Thai media wanted to recognize a pattern for the bom@@ bing Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
&quot; in contrast , the Thai police stated that the attacks are not related to the Islam@@ ist movement or with international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is only a local Sab@@ ot@@ age , which is limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a speaker in Bangkok . &quot;
it is rather one of that the bom@@ bs of oppos@@ ites of the ruling military j@@ un@@ ta were laid .
&quot; in recent days , the authorities would have been informed in the past days of secrecy in the south of the country - but they don &apos;t have been informed about the exact time and places . &quot;
still be un@@ clear which group behind the attacks .
&quot; the police pointed its officers throughout the country , security around important government buildings as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and am@@ usement districts . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand there are still smaller bom@@ bing attacks , but they usually do not direct against tourists . &quot;
&quot; in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace built over the years of Thailand , King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j . &quot;
&quot; after the nun@@ tum Bom@@ ben@@ sions , the Austrian Foreign Ministry recommends to its homepage , the instructions of Thai safety authorities necessarily result . &quot;
&quot; high safety risk ( safety level 3 ) used for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ iw@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a and Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surrounding area . &quot;
&quot; according to disputes between security forces and Muslim populations , there is no necessary travel to these provinces . &quot;
elevated safety risk ( safety level 2 ) pun@@ ched for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday were successful in a few days after a contro@@ versi@@ al referendum on one of the military j@@ un@@ ta .
the military factors influence the military even in the years to come .
&quot; Jun@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ Ch@@ a said , the bom@@ bs have been an attempt to sti@@ p@@ ate chaos while the country in direction stability , an improvement of the economic situation and tourism . &quot;
&quot; the military un@@ ta that took power in 2014 after a phase of blo@@ ody un@@ rest , keeps the power itself to have led the kingdom to stability and order . &quot;
&quot; however , the military has not been able to have succeeded in control over the extreme south of the country for years in the extreme south of the country . &quot;
&quot; in the conflict , more than 6@@ 500 people have been killed . &quot;
just a year ago in Bangkok on a popular Hind@@ u @-@ Sch@@ purely 20 people were killed - most of them were foreign tourists .
it was the blo@@ od@@ est attack of the younger history of the country .
the right &quot; identity movement &quot; is coming into the vision of the Federal Constitutional for Constitutional protection .
&quot; according to several countries , the Constitutional Court also asked the group under observation . &quot;
&quot; we see at the &apos; identity movement &apos; anch@@ oring for efforts against the freedom of the democratic principles , &quot; &quot; said constitutional governance Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate the German Presse @-@ Agency in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; thus , the emig@@ rants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are diff@@ used in extrem@@ ist manner . &quot;
&quot; therefore , we watch the movement too . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; is an group@@ ing with French roots that has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot;
&quot; it turns against &quot; &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ a- W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; In@@ controlled mass migration &quot; and the &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity through foreign affairs . &quot;
&quot; constitu@@ tion@@ ists in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Saxony and Thuringia - observe the &quot; identity &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ate said , his authority have agreed closely with the country &apos;s decision . &quot;
&quot; groups like the &apos; identity movement &apos; try to pick up their target group , where it stands , &quot; said the Constitutional Court . &quot;
&quot; in general try extre@@ mi@@ sts , they speak with adol@@ escent language often with p@@ opp@@ y music . &quot;
the identi@@ ties of Islam@@ ists as well as legal extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not a bed advertising for your own thing .
the propaganda is meant to emotional people .
young people are due in a special way .
this is dangerous .
&quot; recently , there had been reports from several federal states reports on contacts of &quot; &quot; identi@@ ties &quot; &quot; to Af@@ ales politicians . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ate said , he did not have findings . &quot;
&quot; for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this type are only relevant to a certain point . &quot;
&quot; it depends on whether the respective party - in this case , the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who changes extrem@@ ist , their target area and so extrem@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; thus , whether such people controls the impact on the party . &quot;
this is not recogni@@ z@@ able .
&quot; with a view to the significant increase in legal criminal off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seekers and refuge@@ e accommodations , Ma@@ ate he would not speak of new rights in this context . &quot;
but we have observed over the past few years that it can give rights @-@ terrorism structures .
there were the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Fri@@ aler Group .
&quot; it can be quite , that further rights @-@ terrorism groups or small groups form the attacks against asylum seekers , against refuge@@ e sh@@ ei@@ me or attack from other illegal extrem@@ ist motives . &quot;
a German @-@ wide or Europe @-@ wide control of legal terrorism is not recogni@@ z@@ able .
the previous groups were created on the regional level or in social networks .
&quot; concerned , Ma@@ ate expressed concern about that many attacks on the account of people left , which were not assigned to the right scene in the right scene . &quot;
that is wor@@ rying .
many of the Tatra in attacks on Asyl@@ um are not previously known as a crime , politically motivated pen@@ cils , or trailers of the right scene . &quot;
&quot; many people have committed criminal off@@ ences who had previously been afraid with legal extre@@ mi@@ sts , which were perhaps politically in@@ different , or chose for example CD@@ U , SPD or left , which then have radic@@ alised by right extrem@@ ist m@@ oods . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is becoming Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it

this shows the brave performance of RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te during the summer play in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; in the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly overweight swimm@@ ers from Ethiopia so slow that he was no longer seen in the TV pictures . &quot;
he disappeared the wall - no matter how far the output was selected .
in social networks we subsequently became the vir@@ al Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it .
&quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ ol@@ ds with a return of 48 seconds of his pre @-@ run and bes@@ ieg@@ ed the 5@@ 9th place of 59 Star@@ ters . &quot;
but it was rather his not just sports figure that moved the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year still participate in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ians got a special start from the international swimming association .
this will be distributed to make swimming in backward countries .

&quot; his time , he proposed only with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters of Fre@@ is@@ til , there was no role . &quot;
&quot; compar@@ isons with &quot; &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also pulled . &quot;
at the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney the run of Eric M@@ ous@@ s@@ ban@@ i for medi@@ ale attention .
unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from the Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea in Guinea as he had to compete in a pre @-@ run over 100 meter .
fr@@ en@@ e@@ tically was filmed in M@@ ous@@ s@@ ban@@ i at that time .
&quot; the then 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim only eight months before Olympia and had never completed such a long distance before the competition . &quot;

the fees per cu@@ bic metres is starting from 1 October 2016 for the area of the se@@ wage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ahl 3.@@ 44 Euro ; for Z@@ ult@@ enberg / Lind@@ p 3.@@ 36 Euro ( up to 2.@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 Euro ( up to 2.@@ 18 Euros ) .
&quot; at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the wast@@ ew@@ ater fee will increase later than once again , if appropriate improvement measures are necessary . &quot;
after a ski@@ pper lim@@ estone will be the wast@@ ew@@ ater price in Az@@ endorf then at 4.@@ 37 euros per cu@@ bic meters .
&quot; as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( C@@ SU ) reported , was established during the approval of the budget through the land of Kul@@ mb@@ ach , that for these se@@ wage systems run . &quot;
&quot; in the market of Kaz@@ endorf , the market is committed to legal fundament@@ als , to operate the facilities cost . &quot;
&quot; from 1 October 2016 , the citizens as well as the commercial and industrial companies from Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lind@@ enberg , and Z@@ ult@@ enberg will have to take deeper into the budgets . &quot;
the excav@@ ations lie between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; as Chairman of the Herbert Schmidt Secretary the Gre@@ ater was necessary , a new conclusion of fees for the se@@ wage systems of the market community was necessary . &quot;
in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 also over@@ - or sub@@ sections from the previous li@@ cul@@ ation period is equal to the same .
&quot; the engra@@ ved boost increased by all three se@@ wage systems in order to handle relatively small facilities with a very small waste water , between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cu@@ bic meters per year . &quot;
&quot; thus , due to the low distribution basis for example expenses for the repairs of several thousand Euros would have a serious impact . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the wast@@ ew@@ ater will be easily retro@@ fitted in all three installations . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the last calories period of all three systems will not last but not least due to their age of san@@ itation and repair applications in a significant extent . &quot;
&quot; the plant in Az@@ endorf is almost 30 years old , the facilities for world wide , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth and Z@@ ult@@ enberg , Lind@@ enberg and Lop@@ p almost 20 years . &quot;
Schmidt dism@@ is@@ sed that in the wast@@ ew@@ ater Az@@ endorf the mechanical ventilation system had to be exchanged due to a damage .
&quot; in the p@@ umping world , the nearly 20 year old convey@@ ors had to be over@@ hau@@ led for nearly 20 years of operation of the first mon@@ ast@@ ed area , after nearly 20 years of operation , the frac@@ tional pot@@ ency ensures and an additional ventil@@ ating possibility to be able to keep the water @-@ legal requirements in future . &quot;
Schmidt : &quot; to these extraordinary expendit@@ ures the continued support and maintenance costs have been taken into account according to the new spec@@ ulation period .
the same applies to electricity costs which resulted in the previous lim@@ estone in the years 2011 / 2012 still considerably below the current level .
Stein@@ häuser made clear that at low wast@@ ew@@ ater in the three plants the expenses for the operation and maintenance .
&quot; in doing so , supplementary Schmidt , the market community of great entertainment costs in the wast@@ ew@@ ater treatment have been spar@@ ed over the past 20 years . &quot;
&quot; the situation for the above @-@ mentioned plants will continue to be pre@@ ached in the duration of stone houses on the duration , especially since the supply area of the wast@@ ew@@ ater network of the Fries@@ land @-@ Fries@@ land to these systems are not possible because it is de@@ defic@@ its facilities . &quot;
Bulgaria for the first time in 8 months of inflation
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria in July 1 % was on a monthly basis .
&quot; this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year , as a positive 0,@@ 2 % . &quot;
annual average de@@ flation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.@@ 8 % .
&quot; the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1,@@ 0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1,@@ 0 % . &quot;
the in@@ tim@@ ation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was compared to 0.3 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 amoun@@ ted to 0.3 % .
&quot; in July 2016 , the following groups of consumer goods has been observed : food and non @-@ talented drinks ( 1.@@ 7 % ) ; transport ( 1.8 % ) ; transport and culture ( 6.6 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0,@@ 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the prices fell by clothes and shoes ( 2,@@ 2 % ) ; Mo@@ bili@@ ar , appliances and Rout@@ ines ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0,@@ 1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the prices were as advertis@@ ed at alco@@ ho@@ lic drinks and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas , gas and other power materials ; communication , as well as education unchanged . &quot;
Snap@@ chat &quot; anim@@ e &quot; effect cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed as Asian car@@ ic@@ ature
Snap@@ chat says that this filter anim@@ e @-@ inspired but some ob@@ servers say that it is not sensitive to bre@@ eds .
&quot; with its filter tool , Snap@@ chat will allow about 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identi@@ ties in such a way , which it borders . &quot;
&quot; you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lich@@ tenstein painting . &quot;
&quot; the filters are un@@ bl@@ ur@@ red , independent tools that produce more than 30 million improved sel@@ fish@@ ness per day . &quot;
all mis@@ steps get to the public .
Snap@@ chat filters have drag@@ ged critic@@ ised in the past that the app Black@@ face @-@ face or white skin as beauty ideal .
&quot; when this week ending a filter a filter , who gave them sli@@ pped , incorrect teeth and asc@@ ending che@@ eks , called it some critics &quot; rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; gels &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they asked if this repeated contro@@ vers@@ aries on a larger problem , that the company has a diversity . &quot;
&quot; the news and the rebel@@ lion were widespread on Wednesday , with reports of The Ver@@ ge and motherboard , one day after Snap@@ chat , that it would have been de@@ activated . &quot;
the company offered an ap@@ ologies : the filter was intended as a hom@@ age to anim@@ e @-@ characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
&quot; but external links , the r@@ hy@@ m@@ atism have experienced , rec@@ alled the filter by wo@@ unded clause . &quot;
others have chosen the anim@@ e @-@ comparison .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail he wrote Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American Kunst@@ student whose T@@ we@@ et were widespread over the photos , that the filter was &quot; &quot; vulnerable and read more uncomfortable . &quot;
it added that &quot; it was difficult to ar@@ gue with the counter@@ part of a very conflic@@ ting Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects .
&quot; it shows that the filter is not en@@ force@@ able , but that the money was drawn into the w@@ ak@@ able extreme . &quot;
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural pride .
&quot; the American culture seems to be involved in a endless diet and integr@@ ation@@ ally , from meeting rooms up to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand . &quot;
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats large audience of young people - who are in race race than their older counter @-@ players - could be more likely to expect sensitivity .
&quot; when one of snap@@ shots filtering a picture creates that such things remain un@@ noticed that such things remain un@@ noticed when it was the case before , &quot; said 25 @-@ year K@@ atie Zh@@ u in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Zh@@ u chose to delete Zh@@ u who works as a product manager and engineering engineer for medium , their Snap@@ chat account to clear others to do the same . &quot;
&quot; in a set of medium and in a phone interview , she said that she believe that rapid cont@@ ent@@ ails a lack of diversity among the inser@@ tion practices at Snap@@ chat . &quot;
Zh@@ u cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed the big part of white , just male leaders and ended its appearance with a has@@ ht@@ ag : # Del@@ ete@@ Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colours in their staff , so that they can meet such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Zh@@ u , &quot; or they have people with other skin colours , who work there , but not in positions where they are safe or feeling to tell what to say about it . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinion , a complaint , the Snap@@ chat mostly left un@@ answered . &quot;
the company does not publish numbers of diversity of its staff and points to its status as a private corporation .
&quot; on Thursday , Snap@@ chat starting to discuss the cultural background of his staff , but according to a spokes@@ person , the company has recently set up a human personnel responsible for providing population groups and focused on internal integration efforts . &quot;
&quot; Zh@@ u said in her , Zh@@ u said her Snap@@ chat account will be closed and added , &quot; I ask myself whether they need more users like us to say that this is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
&quot; military leadership , ISIS &quot; intelligence information , presents the Committee of Congress Festival &quot;
&quot; military associated with the United States Central Command changed the formal information to draw an optim@@ istic image of war against the so @-@ called Islam@@ ist state in Iraq and Syria , as it would have allowed the actual states on the venue in a report on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the preliminary report , created by a task force of the inter @-@ publi@@ can Committee , intelligence agencies and the Wehr@@ budget , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command Myst@@ eri@@ sts , reported as the set up their duty to the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; central Command , short Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in Tampa , Florida , which controls the American military forces in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; new@@ s@@ tical information provided by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com comm@@ anders , recorded regularly a positive image of the American efforts against terrorism as it would have allowed the actual states on site and were consistently positive as analysis of other news services , &quot; zi@@ pped a newspaper article . &quot;
&quot; what happened in the Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer , if bad analyses will be presented to our political leaders , presented K@@ en Cal@@ ver@@ t , re@@ publi@@ can@@ ic member of the representative . &quot;
the leadership error in Cent@@ Com range up to the top head of the organization .
the ten @-@ sided report presents detailed problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the education of the Ira@@ qi forces .
&quot; although there is no direct evidence that government tips have given that government tips to change the reports , it shows how analy@@ sten the pressure from their pre@@ clu@@ sion saw , an optim@@ istic picture from the threat of the Islamic state , also known as ISIS or IS@@ IL . &quot;
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many central command press releases , statements and statements were clearly stated before the congress clearly positive than it corresponds to the facts . &quot;
&quot; for example , a Cent@@ Com anarch@@ ist publicly known that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s can already start in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ sul , the second largest city of Iraq remains under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigations , is so clear . &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , re@@ publi@@ can@@ ic Congress of K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the Heads of Central Command changed the following reports to see the danger of ISIS in Iraq . &quot;
re@@ public@@ ans the Task Force into life after being played that an@@ alysts were worried about the mani@@ p@@ ulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday report will be completed by more detail and will be continued during investigations .
&quot; in addition , further investig@@ ators of Cent@@ Com reports are underway . &quot;
&quot; democratic members of the news officer published on Thursday their own findings , which coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the re@@ publi@@ can Task Force . &quot;
&quot; in the years of 2014 and 2015 the Cent@@ Com creates an over@@ ly restricted process for the creation of form@@ ations related to IS@@ IL and the Ira@@ qi security services , Member of the representatives of Adam B. ship , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; this process , so Mr. ship , &quot; consuming the publication of subsequent reports , pe@@ eling the mor@@ als under an@@ alysts and &apos; gave a little room for different opinions . &quot;
&quot; but Mr. Shi@@ p and the Democratic Party , no references to a intervention of the White House at the Cent@@ Com Analy@@ sts have found in respect of a particular political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the convention were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast &quot; .
&quot; last August , the New York Times reported by the General Insp@@ ection of the Pent@@ agon , which were recorded according to complaints from Cent@@ Com analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; L@@ t. C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a press pre@@ aching of the Pent@@ agon , announced in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not be reports of the Congress . &quot;
&quot; but he also gave that &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ ting opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data , and that the news and the Defence Ministry welcome a contro@@ versi@@ al discussion of these important topics of national defense . &quot;
the investig@@ ative impacts on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that is now made by an increasing number of members of the Federal Ministry of Defence ) .
&quot; however , the acc@@ us@@ ations of the past year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assess@@ ments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; the cri@@ tique of the compensation information regarding the Islamic state remind of the occupation of more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , a font , written about the consequences of many an@@ alysts in Iraq and had little time to worry about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 thoughts . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in u@@ prising against the current reporting of the Islamic state .
&quot; last year , the team led to Mr. Hoo@@ ker according to the provision of government attacks against those of the government attacks against the terrorist attacks on the financial situation of the terrorist attack , as these pro@@ visional refin@@ eries in operation could have taken to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; however , this realization was not published , the Times in September . &quot;
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger Command Command , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legislative and positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate . &quot;
general Austin went to retirement in April and was replaced at Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the US win fourth match in the field @-@ ho@@ ckey of women ; a show@@ down with Britain is before
&quot; a day after they had shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 year over Japan , K@@ atie BA@@ M made the first two gates for the American Feld@@ mann team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans with 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five gates in two games should actually represent a memorable performance , but BA@@ M ( 27 ) said she could not remember that ever done . &quot;
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; said she . &quot;
&quot; I have not agree to the people who kept their gates in mind . &quot;
&quot; however , it knows : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the ol@@ ymp@@ ic competition , and are equivalent to the first place in their group with the Britain in their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan . &quot;
the United States and the United States will follow the first lap on Saturday in the last game .
&quot; both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ finals , the game will decide which both within their group of six teams will gain the first and second place . &quot;
the first job will take a bit longer out of the way that the other group will lead .
&quot; as always the game out on Saturday , the Americans have triggered by their success story , four years after they landed in the last London Games at the last of 12 squares . &quot;
BA@@ M was part of this team .
&quot; it grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years of ho@@ ckey m@@ ack@@ ets in hands ( their two older sisters played the sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became the National Team of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team . &quot;
she missed the Olympi@@ ad in 2008 because they could not qualify for the K@@ ader .
then the year 2012 came into that for her and her team was wrong .
&quot; in the following year , Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham became an Engl@@ ish@@ man , Trainer of the National Team and thus began to contact the things better . &quot;
&quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said BA@@ M . &quot;
we did not have the work@@ station in London that we now have .
we have s@@ nat@@ ch the rest of the rest .
on Thursday night BA@@ M opened the door@@ man in the first half of the game with a rear stop from the close area .
&quot; India was gone without victory in the tournament , but the team showed surprisingly strong , and held the game stood from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter , up to BA@@ M the game in their hands . &quot;
&quot; it carried out a spr@@ int with the flat ball on the left f@@ lange , then moved to the middle and lu@@ ded the ball to the door to get a 2 @-@ 0 leadership . &quot;
Mel@@ issa GON@@ ZA@@ LE@@ Z made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the door@@ ke@@ eper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs who had to book a gate at each of the previous games . &quot;
it has a run .
just like BA@@ M .
&quot; we are in good position &quot; &quot; Par@@ n@@ ham but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline &quot;
&quot; wherever you are , how late it is , it is the Olympic Games . &quot;
the events in Rio de Janeiro feel resistant and un@@ ev@@ asi@@ vely to a rapid run between competition and quest .
&quot; it is , as if the ol@@ ymp@@ ic tor@@ ch itself is a burning st@@ ab , which will protect from w@@ rist@@ y to a swimming pool for the wa@@ iter . &quot;
&quot; you can not switch the television , read a paper or listen to the conversation of your neighbors in the queue in the queu@@ es , without over Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ un@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and ch@@ ad le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s warm with di@@ m@@ ples , could quite well be sent under this familiar name that are being sent to Prime Time , thanks to sponsors and well @-@ being TV advertising if he would be a swimm@@ ers , tur@@ ner , or even f@@ oul . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights in the ol@@ ymp@@ ic trampoline of gold . &quot;
the ol@@ ymp@@ ic flame is not illuminated every event .
&quot; further from the center , partly in the shadow are the sports , which are not widely recognized : air@@ brush shooting , arch@@ ery , Bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the breast swimming and let it rule for a long time .
&quot; but if I might be hum@@ ble as arguments for my particular love , then let me draw attention to the discreet char@@ me of the trampoline . &quot;
&quot; although the trampol@@ ines have already been an ol@@ ymp@@ ic event since 2000 , when it had been in Sydney , it was the last 16 years so much that many people I asked , did not know that there is a Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ art at all . &quot;
this might be regional ignor@@ ance .
&quot; although the US athletes sent to the competition , it has never won a Med@@ al in the trampol@@ ines and had made a athletes , who has managed to end up to the end of 2012 . &quot;
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadi@@ ans who share for women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
&quot; the trampoline of the trampoline has a certain out@@ conductor char@@ me , partly because it sounds for the un@@ enlight@@ ened ear suitable for a c@@ lown school than that sounds for the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; in this place I should admit that I am not an expert , but only an inher@@ ited enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; it has hum@@ or@@ istic potential - the cart@@ o@@ on@@ est tre@@ m@@ bling of his never ends - but also the Grazie of the gym and diving , the two sports , which is essentially united . &quot;
&quot; the word &quot; trampoline &quot; dates from the Spanish El Trampol@@ ine , which means so much means as &quot; spr@@ ing@@ board . &quot;
&quot; emerging winner jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements ( rotating , h@@ real and sal@@ tos ) before they land on the feet . &quot;
&quot; they are evaluated according to official Olympi@@ ap@@ ro@@ gram according to execution , difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot;
&quot; two @-@ day athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete in Rio . &quot;
the most common ol@@ ymp@@ ic vector is straight .
&quot; hop@@ eful need to go on in their quest for gold , faster , upwards and dr@@ on , sometimes up to finish , sometimes back and back , upwards and down on the playground . &quot;
&quot; they have not only the Zi@@ ell@@ in@@ ie or the output wall , but in the TV transmission also another height goal : that of the world or the Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ords . &quot;
&quot; the pur@@ pos@@ eful quest is no@@ bel , ad@@ mired , even fan@@ atic - and it &apos;s enough to even sti@@ r up a viewer to t@@ ears . &quot;
but it is also what I think even when entering these games as a bit ti@@ reless .
of which the trampoline offers a breathing .
the vector of the trampoline is above .
a forward @-@ forward movement is not the goal .
&quot; he or she pre@@ all@@ t from , seem@@ ingly heavy el@@ os like an ast@@ ron@@ aut , goes up , then after down , then effort@@ lessly back up . &quot;
&quot; also here is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no h@@ ectic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves into the distance , only the trendy , elegant lifting of time and gra@@ v@@ itation . &quot;
it is as Zen like the competition at the Olympic Games can be only .
&quot; the qualification and extension of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming around 13.00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13.00 . &quot;
N@@ BC will cut off the ends as part of an after@@ no@@ blocks of both days from 14.00 .
&quot; in the midst of Olympia man@@ ie they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that will probably be over@@ looked after the general tum@@ ult . &quot;
&quot; when the Cons@@ ci@@ ousness can be achieved only through the anxiety and the objecti@@ fication of male athletes , as it has recently pushed the male US tur@@ ner according to The Wall Street Journal recently - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey awaits its after the air of rin@@ ing , new fan@@ atic . &quot;
&quot; a generation Protest@@ ant in Ethiopia , Long an exile of the USA &quot;
non @-@ violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators calling for political changes in Ethiopia on violent resistance of the government .
witnesses say that many proteins have killed during the cl@@ ashes with the police with the police have been killed .
is Ethiopia exactly together to break up ?
&quot; in the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid branch of the West with a fast growing economy . &quot;
&quot; but in recent months , protests against the government of the country and spread themselves more and more . &quot;
last week thousands of people on the streets and slow@@ ed fundamental political changes .
the response of the government was un@@ charitable according to human rights organisations .
witnesses gave him that polic@@ emen were shot at zig @-@ armed demonstr@@ ators and killing .
&quot; in the run @-@ being videos about the protests , which are probably from the last or beginning of this year , show how security are young people with b@@ loc@@ s , while these were forced to make a hand stand against a wall . &quot;
the boss of the UN Authority of Human Rights is now demanding an incoming investigation .
&quot; it was always difficult to meet this country and will even become harder , &quot; said Ras@@ hi@@ d Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot;
Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
&quot; American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terrorist attacks on the region , especially in Somalia . only few countries in Africa , if at all , receive so much western help . &quot;
Ethiop@@ ian economy was expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new p@@ endant in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
the roads are usually quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; even if Ethiopia have anything other than an example of democracy - human rights organisations have continuously led the oppression of the government - the opposition in the country became restricted , whereby dis@@ sid@@ ents are effective to silence . &quot;
&quot; many were sent into exile , or sent into prison , or driven into the breadth of the desert . &quot;
but that could change .
&quot; if you press people and they have no other options apart from prot@@ esters , it breaks out , &quot; said N@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in central Ethiop@@ ian . &quot;
the entire youth prot@@ ested .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from the ground utilization to the lit@@ ters with respect to the power of the ruling coalition .
after a far @-@ end election last year the ruling party and its allies received the final seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of parliament .
&quot; at the same time , tensions desc@@ ends along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea ; a fight for this delicate , contro@@ versi@@ al line called for hundreds of life . &quot;
&quot; analy@@ st fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the Oro@@ mo @-@ liber@@ ating front , or the nation@@ ale liber@@ ating front of the O@@ g@@ aden that were more or less imposed in recent years , the tur@@ mo@@ il can benefit more or less . &quot;
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ tern@@ ess after years of absence is now explo@@ de under the surface .
the first seems harm@@ less : smartphones .
&quot; only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate with social media , as cheap smartphones are becoming more common and improved the Internet services . &quot;
&quot; even if the government reserves the access to Facebook and Twitter , whatever it does in regular intervals , especially during protests , many people can still communicate via Internet pro@@ x@@ ies which hide where they are . &quot;
several young artists gave them to be gathered together .
&quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Ci@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ cities in Ethiopia . &quot;
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; since offices , the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from ae@@ dic@@ s , predomin@@ antly Christian , in politics and economy , while they are the Oro@@ mos exploited , of which many Muslims are living and in flat @-@ areas . &quot;
but even this is changing straight .
&quot; we are here to coordinate under one screen , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot;
the biggest protests found in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Ci@@ mos .
&quot; many Am@@ har@@ as and Ci@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of tig@@ ray , which constitute approximately 6 percent of the population and which are dominant in the military services , trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; Mr. Mel@@ es , a former vine leader , was until his death in an un@@ attended disease in 2012 17 years of Ethiopia . &quot;
&quot; he was seen as tac@@ tical geni@@ us , a man who could think of corners . &quot;
an@@ alysts say that he was particularly embarrass@@ ed in it to take early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and use special commission@@ er to process opponents and make it un@@ harmful .
&quot; the current regime is lacking in this fundamental skill , &quot; Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; Ethiop@@ ians of new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ at Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen from relatively und@@ ill reasons to assume the position of Mr. Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of Nord@@ ä@@ Ethiop@@ ian , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am coming from the south . &quot;
analy@@ st say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the tig@@ ray controlled security services .
many fear that the result will be more blo@@ od@@ shed .
&quot; the last time that Ethiopia was one such an tur@@ mo@@ il lived in 2005 , after thousands of elections prot@@ ested by the government and subsequently stolen from the government and subsequently were stolen . &quot;
&quot; during the following raid were killed many proteins , even if there were less than in the past few months and this time the un@@ rest went relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; development experts praised Ethiop@@ ian leaders for their vision@@ ing infrastructure , such as the new p@@ end@@ ure , as well as for their measurable progress in poverty reduction . &quot;
but obviously this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal mis@@ mis@@ st of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and she takes a dangerous ethnic form .
&quot; last month of attacks in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ ic town , from Tig@@ ray guided shops and the hat@@ red towards the Tig@@ ray is becoming increasingly popular in social media . &quot;
analy@@ st say that the protests will bring the USA and other Western allies into an independent position .
&quot; the American government used Ethiopia as a basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ ary flights over the neigh@@ bou@@ red Somalia , even if they recently listened to this base . &quot;
&quot; while the West does not want to support democracy during the West , he does not want his allies merge into an already vol@@ ati@@ te area . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , &quot; is a very thin atro@@ cities . &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp explains his asser@@ tion Obama has been established ISIS &quot; Sar@@ k@@ asm &quot;
&quot; Donald J. Tru@@ mp tried to dis@@ si@@ p@@ ate the last contro@@ vers@@ y that his campaign surrounds , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the terrorist state , not serious . &quot;
&quot; this clari@@ fying new questions about the communication skills of the presidential system of the re@@ public@@ ans , whether it is able to communicate clear and understandable with the American public . &quot;
&quot; it also brings his fellow stre@@ ak , who strive to take him during an event@@ ful phase in protection , in the peculi@@ ar position , statements that he could not be meant at all . &quot;
&quot; after he had taken the approach at a elect@@ oral event at the Friday evening , ru@@ by Mr. Tru@@ mp with regard to the claim on Thursday and consisted in interviews that he really did not intend to interpret , the President and Mrs. Clinton would have made ISIS . &quot;
&quot; but in early morning T@@ we@@ et on Friday said Mr. Tru@@ mp , he was simply s@@ arc@@ tic . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ we@@ et was the opposite to the previous day when Mr. Tru@@ mp said in a series of interviews , he said the blame is totally serious . &quot;
&quot; as the conservative radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tru@@ mp I wanted to weak@@ en the statement something that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS , wanted nothing to know the re@@ publi@@ can presidential candidate . &quot;
&quot; the final storm of criticism pr@@ as@@ ings to Mr. Tru@@ mp , while he tries to direct the focus of his campaign because of falling circum@@ stance on the economic situation . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp and Mrs. Clinton stopped talking to the business situation in Michigan in this week .
&quot; on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp tried to return to this issue . &quot;
on Twitter he war@@ ned that Mrs. Clin@@ tons proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring .
Mr. Tru@@ mp has already taken care of his defence .
&quot; at the end of July he moved strong criticism of himself , when he said , the Russians should b@@ ake Mrs. Clin@@ tons E@@ mails , but stated later , I said the s@@ arc@@ tic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tru@@ mp to move the lingu@@ istic boundaries in politics and then back as needed .
&quot; I think it is one of its methods to test how certain messages from his fans are absorbed as they arrive , and then if appropriate &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sh@@ erman , a communication expert , the language of both candidates observed . &quot;
&quot; but I also believe , he is clever enough to keep his statements v@@ ague enough so that they can be interpreted in several ways . &quot;
&quot; instead of shar@@ pen the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tru@@ mp has adopted a little more appreciated , since its circum@@ stance will continue to go back . &quot;
&quot; a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was published on Friday showed a guided tour with great advancement in the federal states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ in @-@ head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tru@@ mp is generally trying to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his prov@@ ok@@ ing expressions , he acc@@ uses his critics , frequently to understand his statements or to understand his humor . &quot;
&quot; but while he is strengthened in the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tru@@ m@@ ps Scher@@ ze have brought his loyal situation to him , regardless of how prov@@ ok@@ ant his statements also like . &quot;
&quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former may@@ ors of New York and one of Tru@@ m@@ ps most prominent princip@@ ally , gave great effort to defend the candidates today in a CN@@ N @-@ interview from Thursday to defend . &quot;
&quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani so he was asked to the correctness of Mr. Tru@@ m@@ ps statements whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had established the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is true in that sense that Obama was an almost un@@ familiar , small organization , he called her back , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he moved the troops from Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most ma@@ instream Republi@@ cans try to ar@@ gue that the government served by Obama , in the Mrs. Clinton as an outdoor Minister , it has allowed to spread out the situation in the Middle East aggressi@@ vely . &quot;
&quot; before the elect@@ oral decorations in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp has continued his attacks on the media and cast them before , upon each of his words and to be taken against him . &quot;
&quot; he made the &quot; poor , poor &quot; television experts , who try to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; You can not ! &quot;
some of the democr@@ ats asked about Mr. Tru@@ m@@ ps Ad@@ ven@@ ation as a further proof that he is un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
&quot; once over the price of the market , café comes back to Green@@ point &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ b Cafe was an ash@@ oured cafe in William@@ sburg , where one could only pay cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi , but for 15 years a good coffee . &quot;
&quot; of course , the prizes from his Bed@@ ford Avenue is attached to the front . &quot;
&quot; the shop So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , made the ver@@ b in summer 2014 , sold soap in the form of cu@@ pc@@ akes . &quot;
locals found it as the last loss in a gene@@ ous city .
&quot; the artist in Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ elle wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I can still not believe that CB@@ GB dead@@ lock , the Chelsea Hotel is exemp@@ t and de@@ b now a silk @-@ shop . &quot;
&quot; but if New York change is , it is also new finding . &quot;
&quot; a revi@@ ving cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than one mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new Ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similar atmosphere . &quot;
the coffee is still good .
&quot; the new owner of the Ver@@ b is Cisco Ro@@ dri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ standing staff of the old coffee cafes , the owner and managing director of the new café . &quot;
he began to work in 2001 at Ver@@ b and stayed there until the end .
&quot; when he offered a customer to provide money for a new outside place , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ dri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , be@@ held much . &quot;
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the Bag@@ els purchased the same es@@ pres@@ som@@ asch@@ ine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old ver@@ b .
but Ro@@ dri@@ gu@@ ez said that he wanted to experiment too .
he led new ingredients .
on the menu are sand@@ wich@@ es with sp@@ eck and cheese and there are gar@@ ni@@ ers like KA@@ Per@@ n and sau@@ oni@@ ons .
there are natur@@ al@@ iss@@ ing .
&quot; the café serves not a beer more , so there are fresh juice . &quot;
after nine months Ro@@ dri@@ gu@@ ez said that he noticed a st@@ amp@@ ed flow of old root customers .
&quot; many old customers were also sei@@ zed by prices from William@@ sburg , &quot; he said . &quot;
recently on a Sunday was Re@@ bec@@ ca Oli@@ v@@ eira such a customer .
&quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , dwelt earlier in William@@ sburg and visited the promises regularly . &quot;
&quot; even after having moved to Green@@ point , she would take the way up . &quot;
&quot; after the ver@@ b had closed , she gave them a while the coffee t@@ ines said she said . &quot;
&quot; I was clear that it was in the coffee and the culture in the mo@@ b that fell to me , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now she d@@ row@@ ns again coffee , even if they ordered on this day instead of their usual i@@ ced coff@@ ees a Bl@@ ot@@ C@@ hai Tea , which is another new addition . &quot;
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a further long@@ standing and loyal client since the beginning of the competition in 2003 .
he went there before work and ordered in@@ vari@@ ance always the same .
&quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket clock and they prepare my Every@@ thing @-@ Bag@@ el with but@@ ter , &quot; he said . &quot;
photo Ro@@ dri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and record new ingredients in the menu .
&quot; nowadays Ros@@ enthal gets still his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing Bag@@ el with sp@@ eck , egg and cheese . &quot;
Ro@@ dri@@ gu@@ ez said he does not have Gro@@ ll above that the soap @-@ shop has taken the old business space .
&quot; in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie made to produce a special silk for ver@@ b with the cold coffee of the coffee as an ingre@@ dient . &quot;
&quot; I think we will go back to her offer , &quot; said Ro@@ dri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; and the traditional , Polish inhabitants Green@@ points have also accepted the café . &quot;
&quot; a new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Ro@@ dri@@ gu@@ ez said that he pres@@ et , they soon will be able to welcome them soon , so that his new neighbors will feel welcome . &quot;
the location also has other advantages .
a local juice locally wants to fill the cold coffee into the bottles and sell .
there is an opportunity to expand the café on a margin@@ alized building .
for many customers a new verse is enough to get their old favorites .
Joseph W@@ itt was Chief Certificate and said he was destroyed at the ground as the café closed .
&quot; as the new Café opened , Wh@@ itt , told the prayer of the restaurant and the best a new coffee like a hom@@ ec@@ oming . &quot;
&quot; I had to cra@@ w@@ ling that , &quot; he said . &quot;
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; an abundant meal &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after its rise to the President , Franklin DE@@ LA@@ NO Roos@@ ev@@ elt , his lunch at the O@@ val Office . &quot;
as an enemy had President Roos@@ ev@@ elt a Fai@@ ble for ingeni@@ ous Del@@ ic@@ at@@ essen the Fifth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland water tur@@ tles soup .
&quot; his menu on this day was somewhat hum@@ ble : filled eggs in Tom@@ at@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , pot@@ ato p@@ us@@ ree and as dessert a p@@ au@@ men@@ pu@@ d@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , It was also a message to the Americans as they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food histor@@ ian .
&quot; Co@@ es last book &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; was of Chinese food in the United States , while Zi@@ egel@@ man told in their book &quot; &quot; 97 Orchard &quot; &quot; about living in a residential house at the Lower East Side of the food perspective . &quot;
&quot; their latest co @-@ operation , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at the Har@@ per publishing house , illustrates the history of American cuisine while the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity , when they meet with a re@@ porter at the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop to dinner , a small , schn@@ ör@@ k@@ ell@@ os@@ em Im@@ bis@@ s in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has already been in business since the stock market in 1929 . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh k@@ es@@ and@@ wich with olive @-@ piece , while Co@@ e , 57 , Tru@@ ste@@ er with pot@@ ato trees and vegetable garden . &quot;
&quot; when the re@@ porter ordered me@@ at@@ ched , this found the pair of a discussion about the food in the era of Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; there was pe@@ anu@@ t bro@@ t , liver cheese and b@@ ohn@@ en@@ bro@@ t . &quot;
they were prepared from a ingre@@ dient and a bit of tri@@ lig@@ ently that could be taken away .
imagine how many pe@@ anu@@ ts have to eat they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ e gr@@ in@@ ste .
&quot; it has to be placed in the stomach like Ble@@ i , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the years before the Great Depression was the table in a American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at @-@ buffet . &quot;
cre@@ ws of women ko@@ chten for male dirt workers and it was served fresh b@@ aked past@@ ete for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; they were the Americans who sent to the hungry for Europeans during the first World War food . &quot; &quot; A Square , &quot; stands out the way to which the country went with it , no more to be the Schl@@ ar@@ aff@@ enland . &quot;
&quot; it was a time , in the food for the Americans a central which was a central issue , &quot; gi@@ fted Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; just as soon ten@@ se was the new Bud@@ get@@ ary : mysterious food such as Br@@ ote and K@@ asser@@ tions were found to ground@@ nutri@@ tious , the K@@ asser@@ ols as a &quot; wonderful way , Es@@ sens@@ ory re @-@ feeling &quot; , mer@@ ed Zi@@ egel@@ man , since Kö@@ che un@@ ob@@ s@@ able ingredients were able to hide un@@ ques@@ tion@@ able ingredients under a m@@ ud@@ dy sau@@ ce . &quot;
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dry drying .
&quot; meat , the years of the center of American cuisine was , became a rare luxury . &quot;
&quot; peculi@@ ar mixtures have been tried , since a cal@@ orie and nutri@@ tious satisfaction has preced@@ ence over taste or even healthy kitchen . &quot;
&quot; during their research for the book , which also includes recipes , prepared Zi@@ egel@@ man a dish from this epoch , b@@ aked oni@@ ons with Erd@@ n@@ uss@@ but@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; it was not a popular supplement on the mid@@ day , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot;
Zi@@ egel@@ mann continues from : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ anu@@ t but@@ ter and b@@ aked oni@@ ons do not fit each other .
it was typical for many of the household recipes .
&quot; as never before or since then , budget@@ ary events - including Lou@@ ise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - the eating habits of the country . &quot;
&quot; by making recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; household policy &quot; and the challenge to transform Pamp@@ er like cre@@ m@@ h@@ etti with car@@ r@@ ots into delicious meals . &quot;
&quot; a Square , &quot; is a celebration of historic delicacies . &quot;
&quot; in particular , tasty are the reports of the response of the government to the hungry citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ cake @-@ food @-@ attitude . &quot;
&quot; while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa Farm@@ houses of his kitchen , blessed as the milli@@ on@@ ous man of the world , to which he became . &quot;
&quot; he mo@@ ate continental cuisine like fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ ce , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
he ate in a almost deser@@ ted dining room and carried a smo@@ king .
he was delightful and strange .
&quot; President Roos@@ ev@@ elt might have been committed to the same mistakes if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or would have promp@@ ted him to stat@@ u@@ ate with his stomach . &quot;
&quot; as described in the book , the recru@@ iting of a household with no interest in flav@@ ours by Mrs. Roos@@ ev@@ elt , that the White House brought the boring food in Washington , but also one of the most celebrated food prepared . &quot;
&quot; many of the species from the era of the Great Depression , with eating , was rejected once the country came back to the legs . &quot;
&quot; legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food , said Zi@@ egel@@ man , as well as science on food applied . &quot;
the couple gave thanks to writing the book the dining habits of Zi@@ egel@@ mans @-@ in @-@ law - for example how they could not throw food .
&quot; she had a real fear of waste of food , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
Zi@@ egel@@ man reminded itself : &quot; she made people really sick . &quot;
there was the wind@@ exploited .
&quot; after the T@@ eller at Eis@@ enberg &apos; s were cancel@@ ed , they went and co@@ e an dessert that had prepared at home : the pat@@ ches of Roos@@ ev@@ elt , the President Roos@@ ev@@ elt . &quot;
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man and added that there was a m@@ ples tri@@ ck , hum@@ ble to miss a send name . &quot;
&quot; there was no stor@@ ms , just pl@@ au@@ ms , some fl@@ our , sugar , water and c@@ innamon . &quot;
everyone liked a bit contra@@ dic@@ ed a spo@@ on in the zäh@@ en , brown li@@ me . &quot;
surprisingly it is not bad .

&quot; like an Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ get@@ ti@@ zer said to his wife , &quot; A couple of ch@@ opp@@ ed wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
with bom@@ bs attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life to help others : Khal@@ ed Om@@ ar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed Om@@ ar devoted his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ er everything to save the life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old itself has died in a facade attack of Assad .
&quot; Om@@ ar was a member of &quot; White Hel@@ mets , &quot; a civil protection group that has so far saved almost 6@@ 0,000 people &apos;s life according to the picture . &quot;
&quot; 29@@ 00 Volunte@@ ers put their own life on the game to draw people from bom@@ bed houses and to make first aid in the war . &quot;
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
&quot; Om@@ ar was the face of the group : a video of civilians , which shows him in a 11 @-@ hour rescue of a inf@@ ancy of a house , in 2014 around the world . &quot;
it made the Sy@@ rer on the shining symbol in the Gre@@ ys of the war .
&quot; however , as a hero he never seen himself , said according to the picture : &quot; for me it is the real Jih@@ ad . &quot;
&quot; when I hope to save life , I think God sees in me a mart@@ yr . &quot;
&quot; shortly before Om@@ ar had fallen even an attack on the victims , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ bing attacks in Syria . &quot;
the helic@@ opter have turned four façade bom@@ bs via the Alz@@ adia region . it was filled with chlor@@ gas .
&quot; a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from resp@@ ir@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; we now eliminate the toxic remains of the bom@@ b , so that children do not play with them , the picture quoted its last words before he died . &quot;
the de@@ adly bom@@ b of Assad had to meet terrorists .
Greenland : the oldest sp@@ ine is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Gr@@ ön@@ n@@ ha@@ ie usually occur only in winter to the surface .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an examination on board the river S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and with a good 1 km / h through the Nor@@ dat@@ lan@@ tics - until today .
Greenland did not get up with 150 years of off@@ spring .
&quot; floating around Greenland , along the bottom of the Nor@@ dat@@ lan@@ ti@@ ks , in an hour he is currently on average 1,@@ 220 meters wide . &quot;
&quot; only when it comes up , the five meter long animal up to s@@ atte 2,@@ 6 km / h - and it is half as fast as a Rob@@ ot . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this of long lon@@ eliness of life seems to be a pat@@ ent@@ ance concept for a high age . &quot;
&quot; Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues will report in the magazine &quot; Science &quot; at least one Greenland , the 392 years old could be old . &quot;
&quot; mad@@ ness , &quot; commented Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein by Max @-@ Planck @-@ Institute for demo@@ graphic research in Rostock this lifetime , which means for sp@@ elling a world domination . &quot;
indeed the evolution bi@@ ologi@@ an is already long ago that Greenland will become stone @-@ old .
only lack@@ ed the evidence .
&quot; Greenland are difficult to observe , finally they live mainly in the ice sea front of the thin @-@ stretched co@@ asts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and Spit@@ s@@ bergen . &quot;
&quot; because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually dive at the surface only in winter . &quot;
researchers know about the lifestyle of the Greenland &apos;s life accordingly little .
&quot; their time lu@@ p@@ ent@@ emp@@ o Ma@@ ßen them , when they sh@@ aded six animals with a transmitter equipment . &quot;
&quot; boot@@ y still make these hat@@ red , nevertheless , in the stomach of a animal , researchers found the remains of a Rob@@ ot , a different had failed to swal@@ lowed up a young ice cream . &quot;
possibly j@@ ars them sleeping animals or pat@@ rou@@ illi@@ ers on the bottom of the ice cream and seek Kad@@ aver , which tor@@ tured from higher water layers to bottom tor@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues were examined 28 Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Gr@@ ön@@ land or Spit@@ s@@ bergen as a appl@@ ause from the depth of the Nor@@ dat@@ lan@@ ti@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cen@@ tim@@ eters , while the biggest of 502 cen@@ tim@@ eters . &quot;
to identify the age of the animals analy@@ zes them with the carbon @-@ 14 method the ruler of shar@@ ks .
&quot; this centre of the ey@@ lin@@ se is already created before the birth of the shar@@ ks , which contained therein are no longer re@@ done . &quot;
the two smallest shar@@ ks had a lot of carbon @-@ 14 in the lin@@ ares .
their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s than nuclear @-@ aff@@ en@@ try bigger quantities of this radio@@ active carbon dioxide in the atmosphere .
&quot; in the length of 220 cen@@ tim@@ eters , length of the smallest animal contained the lens to a small over@@ shot of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear @-@ aff@@ en@@ ary , it is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 . &quot;
all major atro@@ cities had normal carbon @-@ 14 large quantities that arises from cosmic radiation in the atmosphere .
&quot; in fact , carbon @-@ 14 @-@ watch showed for a 493 cen@@ tim@@ eters of long gr@@ en@@ land a age of 335 , while the re@@ k@@ ord shar@@ k with 502 cen@@ tim@@ eters even 392 years old might be . &quot;
&quot; that Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ hai females can get up after it , if they are longer than four meters , was known . &quot;
&quot; now , the researchers of the length could be assigned an old age . &quot;
&quot; since one of the animals with 392 cen@@ tim@@ eters , probably at the threshold to the sexually mature stand and his age with 156 years was determined , Greenland with the multi@@ plic@@ ation obviously at least one and a half centuries . &quot;
also this is likely to be used for sp@@ elling .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme live mainly in iron waters is not a coinci@@ dence .
&quot; also the previous record holder , a 211 year old Gr@@ ön@@ n@@ w@@ al , in whose sp@@ eck at the N@@ acken a 120 years old har@@ pun@@ en@@ spitze , was caught in front of Alaska . &quot;
&quot; due to the low temperatures , the body of the living animals often runs on spar@@ ks . &quot;
so they mature later - and s@@ lower s@@ lower .
&quot; in order to warm up in the cold water , the animals are often particularly large . &quot;
because the volume grows much faster than its surface caused by the animal heat .
the heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much bigger than with a gram Ele@@ ph@@ ant .
another advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous , and should concentrate on as many desc@@ endants as soon as possible as possible desc@@ endants , explains the evolutionary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a very big animal should rather invest its resources into a long life . &quot;
background in the double pack
with topics around B@@ auen himself is focused on the focus of the most recent session .
&quot; with relief the panel took the message of Mayor Robert P@@ utz on that &quot; finally , the marketing of the younger dw@@ ellers can begin . &quot;
&quot; after the property , par@@ zel@@ li@@ zation and final surveys have been clari@@ fied , the sale of plots in residential areas &quot; road &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( area Bin@@ der@@ straße ) is nothing more in the way to interested parties . &quot;
the community at the community is convinced that the streams within the rural and peaceful residential community Schön@@ au young families and un@@ favorable sen@@ iors alike .
&quot; as it was called , Bau@@ willing to report immediately at the City Hall , the allocation of the plots is expected to advise the congreg@@ ations in his September session . &quot;
&quot; to also request requests regarding appropri@@ ation of other commercial enterprises , linked to job creation , decided to change the congreg@@ ations that will only change in the spring of this year . &quot;
&quot; thus , in the field of sub@@ tim@@ lar@@ n , the commercial area is extended by two plots in direction of the State Street . &quot;
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
&quot; the city on the Main has therefore in competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg to attract the best opportunities to move from London to London . &quot;
&quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt benefits most from Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ countries , Head of the Competence field financial markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; after Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether money @-@ houses will continue to operate from London to financial transactions in the entire EU . &quot;
&quot; so far , for the so @-@ called EU pass , it has previously been granted approval in the UK . &quot;
this just use large U.S. banks .
several banks already announced to shift jobs .
&quot; the lob@@ b@@ bing &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; is counting on 10000 new jobs on the Main , five years . &quot;
&quot; for Frankfurt , such as I@@ W , the headquarters of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro area , as well as other important authorities such as European Insurance View IS@@ R@@ B . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) is its headquarters , but these be less significant for the financial sector than the ECB . &quot;
&quot; the proximity to the Not@@ en@@ bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ countries . &quot;
&quot; as a result of Luxembourg , a large fund industry , cuts , but as well as Dublin in the infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; Frankfurt is much easier to reach the big airport , thanks to the big airport . &quot;
further points of town with easy available business property .
&quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ countries . &quot;
&quot; at the Seine , they also be the renting for first @-@ class business property by 50 percent higher than the Main . &quot;
&quot; moreover , Frankfurt offer better quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as fewer crime . &quot;
&quot; in a ranking of the consultancy Mer@@ cer stand the city on square seven , Luxembourg to No. 19 , Dublin in place 33 and Paris at 3@@ 7. place . &quot;
&quot; even if quality of life is a question of preferences : &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a financial location for the European internal market , Frankfurt will attract further banks and investors &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , in spite of Bre@@ x@@ it V@@ ot@@ um @-@ V@@ ot@@ um are the most important financial center in Europe , my business researchers . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the power relations : in London worked according to numbers of the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba at the end of 2015 around 14@@ 4000 people in the banking sector , in Frankfurt there were 6@@ 2500 . &quot;
Gilead receives legal costs from the h@@ epatitis C patent stre@@ it
a U.S. authority decided that Gilead sciences is entitled to a refund of the legal costs that you have emerged from the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ te C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
&quot; in June Gilead was fre@@ ed from a damage payment of $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which arose in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster @-@ medication S@@ ov@@ al@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i by Gilead , after a U.S. judge a pattern of mis@@ behaviour , including the opinion and other un@@ ethical actions . &quot;

Mer@@ ck tries to engage with Gilead that can cure the market of a new generation of h@@ epatitis C medications that can cure more than 90 per cent of patients with liver disease .

Clin@@ tons deserve 10.6 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 2 % Federal control
&quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton had published their tax statement on Friday , this flow@@ ed for the presidential and her husband a income of USD 10,@@ 75 million and an effective Bundes@@ tax rate of 34,@@ 2 % . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the Clin@@ tons of USD 1 million for charitable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; the former President Bill Clinton gave an income of USD 3 million by Verlag Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for her book about their term in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs . &quot;

they paid a effective state tax of 20,@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to continue standards concerning financial transparency , &quot; was Clin@@ tons Kamp@@ en@@ hel@@ fer@@ in Jen@@ ni@@ fer Pal@@ mier@@ i in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; in a stark contrast , Donald Tru@@ mp hidden behind false dis@@ agreements and back@@ wards in relation to his previous promises to publish his tax statements . &quot;
&quot; it is common for U.S. presidential data to publish their tax statements , although they are not obliged to do so by law . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp , a New Yorker &apos;s business@@ man and his lawyers have given the reason for his obj@@ ection by tax authorities . &quot;
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; wrote Clin@@ tons elect@@ oral hel@@ pers in Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , with regard to the release of the presidential and Democrats . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Michael C@@ oh@@ en , Tru@@ m@@ ps Special Consult@@ ant , to CN@@ N , that he would not allow Tru@@ mp not to release something before tax inspections are not finished . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ m@@ ps Kri@@ tic , among other things also the re@@ publi@@ can presidential candidate of the year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already made obsol@@ ete questions concerning assets , his donations for charitable organisations , its business and various other ties , especially with Russia . &quot;
&quot; Clinton had already thrown on the subject , and published on Friday a video on the internet , published in the high @-@ ranking Republi@@ cans Tru@@ mp to publish his tax statement . &quot;
on Thursday she spoke the theme also during a speech to the economy in Michigan .
&quot; he refused to do what any other presidential candidate in recent decades has done and his tax explained . &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ tico has reported that tru@@ mp during the 1990s did not pay or only very little taxes , and a business journalist of the New York Times cited on Friday a number of tax evasion and tax advisory services , the data that still could be the case . &quot;
Federal control has become a theme in the election campaign .
&quot; Clinton supports a regulation that is named after milli@@ on@@ aire and Investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett , which would make sure people earn more than USD 1 million and pay a tax rate of at least 30 % . &quot;
President Obama also supports the proposal .
&quot; during a election event for Hill@@ ary Clinton in the past week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called Buff@@ ett , whose Berk@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away Industri@@ et@@ aker here his seat , Tru@@ mp for a meeting in order to exchange their tax statements . &quot;
&quot; Buff@@ ett said , he was also subjected to a tax check of the I@@ RS and Tru@@ mp have &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; before the constitu@@ ents and not before tax authorities . &quot;
Clin@@ tons &apos;s campaign has released tax return to 2007 .
&quot; the Clin@@ tons , which now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , and paid for an effective German tax rate of approx . 32 % between the years 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax set of approximately 40@@ ,@@ 5 % . &quot;
&quot; the tax statement of the Clin@@ tons of 2015 showed that this only takes only USD 100 of their income as wage , different from the majority of all Americans . &quot;
their major terrain was an effective index fund for which the Clin@@ tons divi@@ den@@ ds and earnings of USD 10@@ 9.@@ 000 .

&quot; the method has proven to be effective and the honey@@ guide Foundation , which had already begun years ago , together with the US nature conservation has intensified , by using volunteers in the north of Tanz@@ ani@@ as , a non @-@ violent quad@@ rup@@ ting method to protect their houses and harvest without injury to animals . &quot;
&quot; previously , many food used to defend itself . &quot;
Friday is a puppy day dedicated to animal protection .

the first two steps include the illumin@@ ate of the elephant with a tor@@ ch and the bu@@ b@@ bles into a horn .

Jewish director be@@ ats Berliner Hotel because Israeli pre @-@ election was removed after &quot; Arabian &quot; challenge - RT News
&quot; a French director with Jewish roots un@@ ra@@ ined a media tur@@ mo@@ il , after he betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list Israeli pre @-@ election as there were Arab guests according to a staff . &quot;
&quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Hol@@ oc@@ aust@@ documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; &quot; made his anger in the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by giving an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann Israel tried to find on the country @-@ list of the hotel . &quot;
&quot; however , the country was not listed between the countries that can be moved directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; what happened in the year 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , is possible that Israel are eliminated and deleted ? &quot;
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
&quot; instead , the Kemp@@ ink@@ si Bristol offers a possibility to choose Israel through its own call center . &quot;
&quot; after a statement , the director turned to the hotel reception . &quot;
&quot; the answer that he received it , &quot; scho@@ ote him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot;
the hotel employed is that the measure is a &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotels .
&quot; the reason behind it , the director stood still more anger . &quot;
&quot; the majority of our guests are Arab@@ s and they demanded that the pre @-@ election is er@@ ased , the an@@ et was quoted from Lanz@@ mann . &quot;
the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov H@@ adas &apos;s trade sman named this a &quot; great dis@@ grace , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
we were pres@@ umed by this event and trou@@ bled .
this is really very sh@@ ame@@ ful .
&quot; the fact that this has taken place in Germany in exactly this hotel chain , even even greater dis@@ grace . &quot;
this requires no explanation .
&quot; we expect the hotel &quot; &quot; the right conclusions &quot; , &quot; said of the ministers . &quot;
the incident sol@@ dered a pretty big reson@@ ance on the internet where people sc@@ anned the whole of a sc@@ andal .
&quot; some under@@ estimated the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that would have been given the alleg@@ ed &quot; &quot; Arab guests &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; ash@@ amed you , it was in a different post in which it was pointed out that the hotel , which is located at the no@@ stal@@ k Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , near a Synago@@ gue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel passed quickly all the acc@@ us@@ ations of themselves and called the incident , &quot; and &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reports The mirror . &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct statement &quot; , &quot; Israel did not record in the quick@@ est list , &quot; declared the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung a spokes@@ person of the Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot;
it adds that the country code has now been added .

&quot; with the repe@@ aling of the sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ h@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trading set between Moscow and T@@ ehr@@ an in comparison to 70@@ ,@@ 9 percent . &quot;
&quot; since international sanctions against Iran , the interest in both Russian companies grew strongly in shops in the country , divided the amb@@ ass@@ adors with . &quot;
Russian companies take existing connections with Iran while new companies are ready to get access to the market .
&quot; of course , the further merch@@ ant construction is one of the largest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ z@@ h@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan . &quot;
&quot; he mer@@ ges that the trade rate between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 was increased by 70@@ ,@@ 9 per cent compared to the same period in 2015 , and $ 8@@ 56 million . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the Russian imports in Iran rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent spr@@ un@@ gh@@ s and bet@@ ru@@ ined $ 697 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; the down@@ turn was reached by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the Amb@@ assador . &quot;
D@@ z@@ h@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan goes for this year from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
&quot; last year , the Russian subsidiaries of around 3@@ 5.000 Vis@@ as , primarily from travel citizens . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Iran reached the top 20 countries which concerns the economy in Russia . &quot;
&quot; one could say that the record are ir@@ an@@ ic tourists in Russia from the last year , broken , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , only relatively few Russians do Iran , something , of which the amb@@ ass@@ adors hopes that it will change . &quot;
&quot; personally I can recommend the visit to the towns of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , the monuments of the old Persian civilization in a good condition . &quot;

Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ hole : Pil@@ ate to the gate of mercy
the mini@@ atures from the past@@ ors unit E@@ ven@@ tal @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the road on a fort@@ night pilgrimage from Vill@@ ingen to Freiburg .
together four stages were accomplished .
&quot; to over@@ pass the time until the next Rom@@ wall@@ et of all ministers in the expected two years , the colon@@ el @-@ round of St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a multi@@ day pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; different pilgrimage goals was checked and one finally decided for the Bis@@ hop &apos;s city of Freiburg , where this year was offered by the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy with the birth of mercy on the Frei@@ burger Münster , a special pilgrimage destination . &quot;
&quot; 16 Min@@ is from Bitt@@ el@@ bronn , Gru@@ ol , Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ hole and Hei@@ ligen@@ rooms made themselves on the way . &quot;
in the evening of the past@@ or Stor@@ ost the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna blessed the mush@@ room sk@@ est@@ nut and the pil@@ lows .
&quot; from Hor@@ b , it was driven by train to the starting point of Vill@@ ingen , where also a Münster una loved woman , and so the mush@@ room was taken away from Münster . &quot;
&quot; the single day trips were par@@ ked in the morning and in the evening , depending on a short impulse with various enco@@ ders , songs and letters . &quot;
&quot; but also on the way , the min@@ is on Field crosses , chap@@ els or churches again and again R@@ ast to sing a song from the intr@@ insi@@ sted pilgri@@ m song . &quot;

&quot; cave Call@@ um Sk@@ inner stor@@ ms home , as Br@@ ite gold for cycling forces &quot;
Scotland &apos;s call for Sk@@ inner ra@@ ste last night in the Men@@ od@@ team @-@ Spr@@ int in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio to glory than the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ ol@@ ds from Glasgow took the anti @-@ role , took up his land Sir Chris Ho@@ y . the J@@ ure and made the legend proud when he died at home , in order to take a victory from the favour@@ ites of New Zealand . &quot;
&quot; England claimed a sho@@ cking victory before four years ago , while Ho@@ y the fifth of six Olympi@@ ag@@ old@@ med@@ als . &quot;
&quot; they repeated the tri@@ ck , after they took place in March at the railway Championships in London in spite of the res@@ ign@@ ation Ho@@ ys , only a hum@@ ble sixth place . &quot;
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jam@@ ie Staff .
they did this in time as a way out .
Ho@@ ys re@@ tired created a gap that were K@@ ian Em@@ adi and Mat@@ t Cr@@ ampton tried to close .
&quot; Sk@@ inner was the man , where they stayed , when they saw the potential in the vill@@ i , which has now developed . &quot;
&quot; Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - the four years ago with Ho@@ y vict@@ orious and Sk@@ inner put together in the qualification rounds of a Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ord , but in the still@@ s winning the New Zealand in the first round . &quot;
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
&quot; after his turn , after his turn left behind , but Kenn@@ y brought the team to the front and Sk@@ inner held it . &quot;
&quot; a strategy change made a large part of the transformation , with the execution of driving into a higher gear to slow it and allow it to keep the pace . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ y looked at his position as BBC @-@ Expert , and fell Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des as these on the po@@ dium . &quot;
the 23 @-@ year Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a lubri@@ cation comparison . &quot;
I am only here to do my best and make a name .
we have placed a Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ord and defe@@ ated the World Champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
&quot; after the triumph of 2012 at the page Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ des that he fell down after a weak start to the train . &quot;
he moved this statement later and there was no invitation from England ri@@ vals .
with such a superior victory there was no such problem .
&quot; Hin@@ des : &quot; &quot; it feels with all the GB flags on the Tri@@ bun@@ es as London . &quot;
we have come together in the last three months as a team .
&quot; we have gone so badly with so many world titles that it was incredibly , to win again at the Olympi@@ ad . &quot;
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which were seven of 10 titles both in Beijing and London . &quot;
if that &apos;s a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the last five months is that we expect a successful five days at the Vel@@ od@@ rom .
&quot; with the shape of Kenn@@ y , it is in the area of possible that he repeated Ho@@ ys victory of three ol@@ ymp@@ ic gold med@@ als in a contest . &quot;
&quot; that would be born for Kenn@@ y - the exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on 23 March ( a apparently holy date for British sport ; on the day were also Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster was born ) - an excerpt of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal . &quot;
the c@@ ams of Ho@@ y is equal .
Kenn@@ y is taking part in the spr@@ int that starts today and will go over three days .
&quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels something lonely to win alone .
&quot; saying , &quot; &quot; if he wins two more gold med@@ als , he should be be@@ aten to the k@@ night . &quot;
&quot; it was the only good competition of the day , but there were further good news for England . &quot;
&quot; Sir Bra@@ us@@ W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified himself with the fastest performance in the four @-@ four @-@ o@@ dom@@ eter . &quot;
they came to 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 942 at the destination .
&quot; the Wel@@ tre@@ k@@ ord , who won in London Gold , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,6@@ 59 . &quot;
&quot; today , the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition , where the W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on safety . &quot;
&quot; he had stopped yesterday with carrier before the qualification , when he sm@@ elled to measure his body size yesterday . &quot;
&quot; in the relative female competition , the morning continued and ended , av@@ anci@@ ed Laura Tr@@ ott , Jo@@ anna Row@@ ing Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie Archives of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ av@@ ie in Wel@@ tre@@ k@@ ord@@ ship in 4 : 13.5 260 . &quot;
the GB team leaves itself on its strong Bahn@@ rad@@ team to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a sn@@ ar to med@@ als .
&quot; after a truly extraordinary representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were driven . &quot;
&quot; in the background , Dr@@ amas played in the background , thus the res@@ ign@@ ation of the technical Leit@@ ers Sh@@ ane Sut@@ ton in April in the midst of sex@@ ologist and har@@ b@@ ing@@ vor@@ es , as well as retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria P@@ end@@ let@@ on . &quot;
&quot; however , if one sees himself the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks exactly afterwards , when the legendary reputation of the GB@@ s has reached its peak again to be repeated again . &quot;
future of the mel@@ ting of Port@@ land based on lifting of the energy demand
&quot; the future of the aluminium mel@@ ting of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs - stand on the game , since the system operators terminate the energy supply contract and thus lift all the supply agreements , like the supplied energy company . &quot;
&quot; this step followed the decision of the government at Victoria beginning of this year , no other subsidies for the operation of the plant . &quot;
one for 20 years fixed sub @-@ invention runs in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the plant of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land are on the game .
no less than 2000 jobs - direct as well as indirect - could be endangered at a closure .
&quot; in addition , it could come to domin@@ ating effects , since the mel@@ ting is consumed around 10 percent of the entire electricity generation Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 Al@@ coa , the Point Henry Sch@@ mel@@ zer@@ ei closed , which resulted in the closing of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power station last year . &quot;
the mel@@ ting of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and ris@@ ky a closure .
&quot; this step follows the years of long spec@@ ulations with regard to the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Austr@@ al@@ ischen dollar and last due to the electricity price for the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , who supplies the large aluminium mel@@ ting with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , divided that three other owners will announce their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the facility is owned by a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which Chinese companies CI@@ TIC and the Japanese Mar@@ u@@ ben@@ i Cor@@ p smaller shares . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L continues to run that the plant in Port@@ land continues to operate , which means another physical demand for electricity by the mel@@ ting &quot; , &quot; shared the company . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L continues to continue to enter into force that the contracts called &quot; &quot; backup stores &quot; , which should enter into force from November 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the contracts have a 12 @-@ month cancellation period , so that they will end 2017 . &quot;
&quot; from that , AG@@ L is from that the contracts will contribute to the revenue in the financial year 17 , &quot; said the electricity supplies . &quot;
all potential impact on AG@@ L starting on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong termin@@ ology for major retail prices .
&quot; AG@@ L shared with that the value of the Treaties were already written in the amount of $ 187 million in &quot; expectation of a cancellation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; ability of Al@@ co@@ as ... &quot; &quot; the mel@@ ting &quot; &quot; or the power supply to the mel@@ ting &quot; &quot; are not imp@@ aired . &quot;
&quot; the US company said that 2010 has concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang , which should have occurred in force from November this year , even if it is still guilty of an explanation why it came back from the contract . &quot;
analy@@ st war@@ ns on the bad economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of the Port@@ land mel@@ ting in Victoria and the Tom@@ ala plant near New@@ castle .
&quot; in reference to the statements of the analy@@ st beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen , that Port@@ land had some 600 meg@@ aw@@ att and Tom@@ ago about 900 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity . &quot;
&quot; should both plants disappear from the market , it would mean considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; power market &#93; . &quot;
&quot; and for us as a generator that would not be good , &quot; he said . &quot;

the un@@ veil@@ ing of the Co@@ vers followed a bizar@@ re ( or just Ke@@ eping Up with the car@@ das@@ hi@@ ans similar ? ) as they forget the entire Car@@ th@@ hi@@ an J@@ denom@@ ination family ( except the problem @-@ known Show@@ biz @-@ On@@ k@@ els and producer of Ke@@ eping Up Ry@@ an Se@@ ac@@ rest ) as they are using the cover of her sister and ends that with a classic wound : they all have a surprise party planned .
&quot; this represents the cl@@ aust@@ ee@@ able action nearly every Birth@@ days of a children &apos;s shipment ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the set , &quot; you thought that we had forgotten you ? &quot; &quot; with the honest@@ y of a symbolic place at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kr@@ is needed to participate her other girls somehow in this publication city . &quot;
with a view to the Sept@@ em@@ ber@@ al of the Vo@@ gue has certainly started a new era for car@@ das@@ hi@@ ans .
&quot; K@@ end@@ alls great sister Kim she likes to see what the Vo@@ gue covers ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September 2014 edition is a league for itself . &quot;
the Sept@@ em@@ ber@@ al issue is the most selling issue of the year for Vo@@ gue .
&quot; with a girth , which resem@@ bles rather a picture band as a fashion journal , the output draws a large number of adverti@@ sers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ist@@ a were obtained from the 8@@ 32 pages of the r@@ amp@@ e 615 pages advertising ) . &quot;
the un@@ veil@@ ing of his co@@ ver@@ stars is expected to see that in the last two years pictures of the magazine nor before the official announcement .
&quot; women who were already on the cover , the Na@@ om@@ i Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ist@@ a and K@@ ate M@@ oss . &quot;
&quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; celebr@@ ity , the mod@@ al &quot; &quot; as &quot; &quot; Models , the celebr@@ ity @-@ pages are &quot; on the cover . &quot;
Oscar @-@ awar@@ de@@ fer and Di@@ or @-@ Trade@@ mark of Jen@@ ni@@ fer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover , a year after Lady G@@ aga . &quot;
&quot; but even at the low chance that woman is denom@@ in@@ ator - that is described by the magazine as the &quot; &quot; flow model &quot; &quot; of its generation - under the earlier category , it is in good company . &quot;
&quot; these tr@@ end@@ times are not related to famous people or Reality Stars or young people of today who know how to turn a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if everything is applied to j@@ denom@@ in@@ ator ) . &quot;
they are really talented women who are reflected in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once released on the last cover with the publication of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of her career .
&quot; of course , Jenn@@ ers does not like success . &quot;
&quot; with their Reality @-@ TV , Jenn@@ ers was always very ten@@ se in the fashion world . &quot;
in June cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ Modell Steph@@ anie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ denom@@ in@@ ator and her colleague Gig@@ i H@@ adi@@ d and called &quot; the mist@@ aken of the eye . &quot;
these feelings cast back high when the message came out with the creator of Jenn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue Cover .
but on the mis@@ sm@@ ut ride seems to walk out at the point .
K@@ end@@ all J@@ in@@ ator is on the cover of the Sept@@ em@@ ber@@ al of the Vo@@ gue .
it is in the tru@@ est sense of the word a super@@ model .
it runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
you and all their sisters sell you pictures of their respective Pay@@ wall Apps .
they sold by her made pictures of C@@ ind@@ y Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds daughter to the magazine LO@@ VE .
and in their spare time it is seen in the Reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
&quot; annual centers of 16@@ 0,000 people annually from &quot;
&quot; more than 16@@ 0,000 of the country &apos;s supporters are refused annually by the congreg@@ ations centers throughout the industry , while the industry increases the effects of further medi@@ ations on already over@@ loaded transactions . &quot;
&quot; in Queens@@ land , three of five persons - mostly older people , im@@ mig@@ rant workers , victims of violence , and those who have no means for unfair delay and similar products - if they are looking for free legal advice and legal coun@@ seling . &quot;
&quot; legal services of the municipality , which are already crowded , are ready for further cuts . &quot;
&quot; as of June next year , these legal centers will be more than 30 percent of their federal remedies . &quot;
&quot; the director of the congreg@@ ations of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell , said that the last collection of the National Association of community centers that already rejected thousands of people every year . &quot;
Far@@ rell said that the situation would be even worse without a lifting of the federal government .
&quot; Queens@@ land municipal centers are chronic co @-@ financed , which means that thousands of people are of important services that you need to be rejected . &quot;
&quot; people who leave non @-@ violent relationships , people with uns@@ ur@@ ably and vast@@ ly debts , families who have been released by separ@@ ations , workers , the un@@ equal way - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they can not get the help they need . &quot;
&quot; in June 2017 , the Federal Government will cut around 30 percent from June 2017 , which means that thousands of vulnerable people from Queens@@ land will be forced to return with their legal problems without any help . &quot;
&quot; we demand the gener@@ als and Federal Minister of Health Bran@@ dis , as well as Sen@@ ators of Queens@@ land George Bran@@ dis , to lift these central short@@ cuts immediately so that people may need help which they need to be given in legal problems . &quot;
&quot; last year , the national government filled its commitments , funding for legal sh@@ ells on the national average . &quot;
&quot; it is now time to look at the needs of the community centres and their customer communities , as well as the government Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k to this important work . &quot;

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey before countries @-@ elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) are significant losses for government parties in the SPD and CD@@ U .
this flow@@ ed representative surveys of the research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; &quot; Photo &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) . &quot;
&quot; while the red @-@ black government coalition in the north could rise further , this is not possible after re@@ use in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in both federal states , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances to continue to face the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD sh@@ aded from 35,@@ 6 percent to 24 percent five years ago . &quot;
&quot; according to the survey , the party saw only almost just before the CD@@ U , which could come back to 23 percent . &quot;
the third place is contro@@ versi@@ al between the left and the Af@@ D .
&quot; the left would be at 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented with 19 percent for the first time in the country . &quot;
the Gre@@ ens despite mild losses with 6 percent ( previously 8.5 percent ) again in the Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag .
&quot; with 3 percent , N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not be represented at 3 percent in the country . &quot;
the SPD of the survey was estimated that the SPD in the survey was estimated that only 23 percent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
they saw this still behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) but before the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
Af@@ D would be represented by 14 percent for the first time in the parliament house .
&quot; with 5 percent , the F@@ DP might hope to return to the pirates in contrast to 2011 . &quot;
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and internet in time lu@@ pe : 20 years ago the Nokia communic@@ ator on the market .
the successor is dominant today the world - its manufacturer had a disaster .
the unit is almost half a kil@@ ograms and was more than vi@@ erm@@ al as hard as an iPhone 5 .
&quot; it was thick@@ er and bigger , it was therefore not good at hand . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was rather kno@@ cked . &quot;
the built @-@ in memory was initially eight meg@@ abyte that would be sufficient for about two sel@@ ess with high resolution .
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 Gig@@ abyte .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator &quot; was exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , to the shops - and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a few euros lovers can buy the equipment still on the internet , but they were somehow out of the Stone Age . &quot;
but 20 years ago the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hannover as an &quot; office in the West End format . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent and received a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , also by fax it was the communic@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; even access to web pages was possible by HTML browsers , if also qu@@ int@@ ingly slow . &quot;
a calculator was available to a digital address and an electronic calendar .
&quot; there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone was similar to a laptop . &quot;
then there were a small keyboard and a black @-@ white screen .
&quot; quite proud was the price : 2700 D @-@ Mark , so about 1400 Euro . &quot;
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was charged at 392 euro .
nobody could see in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator of the beginning of the smartphone era would be .
since then everything is different .
the kl@@ u@@ gen phones are a success story if not for Nokia .
&quot; the fin@@ arte of the fin@@ er lived an unprecedented disaster , was eventually sold and handled in Microsoft . &quot;
the market master the market today who were all much later than Nokia .
&quot; always and everywhere be online , this is today for very many people everyday life . &quot;
there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
&quot; sold approximately 1,@@ 4 billion devices , on Samsung and Apple alone are 5@@ 55 million pieces . &quot;
worldwide sales with the devices lies around 400 billion euros .
&quot; in addition , the well @-@ running shops of the countless App provider and the telecommunications industry . &quot;
around the smartphone has now been created a whole industry .
&quot; the decisive breakthrough to the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007 , at that time I announced Apple &apos;s Steve Jobs on the Mac World for the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; he said three instruments in one : a musical player , a phone and a internet communic@@ ator , all easy to use by touch screen . &quot;
&quot; the winner of Apple began , still today the iPhone is the most important product of the Group . &quot;
&quot; Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry that had conquered the market , had the after@@ no@@ ises . &quot;
they disappeared finally to fight Black@@ berry .
the s@@ agen now have Apple and Asian suppliers like Samsung .
the smartphone is 20 years after his invention a matter of course .
&quot; in the cut , each German now looks 88 times a day on its mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; we must learn all the smartphone is also going away , &quot; &quot; said just Jan@@ ina Ball , in the Siemens Management Board of Personal . &quot;
permanent accessibility is now considered cur@@ se and blessing at the same time .
England must direct the ol@@ ymp@@ ic mind and expand He@@ ath@@ row
&quot; He@@ ath@@ row will not only bring in our local municipalities and throughout London , but throughout the country of renewal and prosperity . &quot;
&quot; for me , the greatest attraction of He@@ ath@@ rows dar , just as then in 2012 in London , when we benef@@ ited a great effort to ensure that all of our nations and regions benef@@ ited from the games . &quot;
the Olympi@@ ad brought great benefits for Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and we will achieve this again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; for our local communities , we will already create 10,000 new teachers , 4@@ 0,000 new jobs and prepare the youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot;
&quot; as they were ahead of us in London , there will be such that the challenge of enlargement He@@ ath@@ rows is too big . &quot;
&quot; I was told that England will never be ready for the games , and that we will bl@@ oss@@ om ourselves on the world stage . &quot;
the two @-@ fl@@ er had 2012 wick@@ edness and they will also be false at He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; there are still obstacles to over@@ appearance , but He@@ ath@@ row answers every question asked . &quot;
like the Olympic Games He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individual infrastructure project .
&quot; expansion is an opportunity to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion to wit@@ ch growth and to leave a legacy of abilities and employment to the airport as well . &quot;
&quot; we have implemented a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has been implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program , by T5 - the five years as a result of the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to T2 , which was built in the midst of two frequencies of the world . &quot;
&quot; now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment . &quot;
the London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row will also be one .
it is time that we direct this ol@@ ymp@@ ic mind and build He@@ ath@@ row as well as our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment to be proud of the England .

&quot; Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; &quot; K@@ atz @-@ and Maus@@ spiel &quot; &quot; with ad block &quot;
&quot; for companies that earn money with online advertising money , according to one of the software manufacturer attempts to handle advertising block , a &quot; &quot; cat and mouse game . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block the indication of his des@@ kt@@ op@@ page , published Ad@@ block Plus a blo@@ g@@ post in which it would like to update their filters in the program to re@@ block advertising in the social network . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared with that his desktop page would change the enco@@ ding with regard to his advertisements , in order to reproduce it , which part of the page advertising is to complain . &quot;
&quot; however , Ad@@ block proclaimed that it has found a new way to handle the new codes . &quot;
&quot; in a blo@@ g@@ post , the spokes@@ man wrote by Ad@@ block Ben Williams , that &quot; these kind of hal@@ ting Open Source Community and the Um@@ es already has been underway since the invention of indicator lock@@ ers in progress is &quot; &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution . &quot;
&quot; the fact that the world &apos;s largest company has left the fight for social media , is a strong indi@@ z , such as wor@@ rying adverti@@ sers for the industry . &quot;
&quot; according to a study from the last year of Pag@@ ef@@ air and Adobe about 200 million people &quot; &quot; lock@@ ers &quot; &quot; ; almost vi@@ erm@@ al so much 2013 . &quot;
&quot; with 1,@@ 03 billion daily users to access Facebook via their mobile devices , Hand@@ y@@ makers are 84 percent of the revenue generated fac@@ ebook . &quot;
&quot; the company has based on ad recor@@ ders on Desktop PCs , as mobile ad block does not have any effect on fac@@ ebook mobile app for the social network and inst@@ ag@@ ram distributed , distributed a speaker . &quot;
&quot; advertising on Desktop PCs makes a sufficient large proportion of revenue , so that Facebook will appear the investment of such a step@@ per . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared with that it would update his &quot; Ad pre@@ fer@@ tool &quot; &quot; to have more control over it on it to be targeted advertising . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook that Ad@@ block new filters would be wor@@ rying because they would also block content on the page which are not advertising . &quot;
&quot; for users , this does not constitute a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , shared a speaker of Facebook in an e @-@ mail message . &quot;
&quot; ad blo@@ cker are a mu@@ pf@@ ant means , which is why we have concentrated on developing tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences in order to put more control into the hands of the people . &quot;
woman with pres@@ su@@ ic@@ ide by Swiss motorway over@@ ride
the sacrifice was in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police calls witness to after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday with a susp@@ ected su@@ ic@@ ide by several vehicles on a highway crossing .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the Canton de V@@ aud shortly after midnight .
&quot; a woman placed himself in the Dark Ones , in an act of desp@@ air &quot; on the road and were hit by several cars , said the police in V@@ aud . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a Swiss in the age of 49 years , which was caused by several vehicles , including a load , over@@ ride , even wanted to kill itself . &quot;
it died on site .
&quot; several drivers have already been connected , but some are still not identified , said the police , which these as well as any witness of the incident arise . &quot;
&quot; it became an investigation procedure opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , divided G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter to the Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve with . &quot;
&quot; however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed . &quot;
was a cl@@ ash avo@@ idable ?
&quot; that is something that the government must decide &quot; , &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers will not be held accountable .
&quot; in each of the two cases - where a person ran in the Dark Ones on the highway - it was decided that drivers does not have to assume that a ped@@ est@@ ri@@ ans in the middle of the night running on the highway , as it was in the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; last year , a police officers have been acqu@@ itted after spending a man over@@ ride and killed that August 2014 had a night on the A1 near Pay@@ erne . &quot;
&quot; the 22 @-@ year sacrifice had dr@@ unk , and has been un@@ conscious on the road , took the court . &quot;
&quot; the court demonstrated that the polic@@ eman -- which took on an emergency way -- on an justified way , and that the presence of a man on the road had an entirely extraordinary and un@@ predic@@ table situation &apos; was said the judge . &quot;
&quot; anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday near Morges , should contact the police below the number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44 . &quot;
NA@@ SA Klim@@ amo@@ dell : Venus was once habit@@ able
the Venus was likely to be habit@@ able according to the proj@@ ections of a new NA@@ SA climate change once again .
scientists at Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies the NA@@ SA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms .
&quot; the model was designed to determine whether the Venus could be extended with their hot , water @-@ loose surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere once er@@ d@@ similar conditions . &quot;
scientists have previously pointed out that the slow overthrow of the Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
&quot; but the newest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , er@@ d@@ similar atmosphere and still slowly move . &quot;
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; the planet was pres@@ um@@ ably more dry areas than de earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to host life and be quicker . &quot;
early Venus also benef@@ ited from a Sun which was 30 percent .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model@@ ed simulation , the slow revers@@ al of the Sun nearly two months long , &quot; explained G@@ ISS scientists Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer of clouds , which affects the surface of a large portion of the sun war@@ ms . &quot;
&quot; the result are average @-@ temperatures , which are some degree of cooler than the earth today . &quot;
the model brought a history of Venus that resem@@ bles the evolution previously mentioned by Plan@@ etary research .
&quot; although it was once habit@@ able , the Venus was exposed to a lot of heat and ul@@ tra@@ violet light over the course of several years . &quot;
your oceans and her water v@@ ap@@ oration was burned down from ul@@ tra@@ violet light .
&quot; as their hydro@@ gen , there remained only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a de@@ adly greenhouse @-@ effect -- Venus that we know how we know it today . &quot;

&quot; in the course of the summer , I have been thinking about how I could improve this team to give it more depth to give it a higher level . &quot;
&quot; to achieve this , the vision of the trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations perfectly matched to the organization . &quot;
he also has to have a co @-@ determination with decisions that affect the performance of the team .
these conditions are currently not fulfilled .
&quot; Sak@@ ic , which was raised in Roy on 23 May 2013 , thanks to him for its contributions to the team . &quot;

Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ öl@@ Workers resume discussions again
&quot; the work @-@ ste@@ aming for the wage of Nord@@ se@@ e@@ o@@ workers are exposed , while all issues are set for a new conversation at the table , said negotiation guide . &quot;
&quot; strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were spor@@ adi@@ cally conducted on platforms in the North Sea , which are operated by Royal Dutch Shell . &quot;
&quot; wood Group as well as the Un@@ ites and RM@@ T Trade Uni@@ ons can confirm that we have agreed to start the process of the current Stre@@ ites , is it in a common statement . &quot;
&quot; we will hold some round @-@ day meetings in the coming weeks , starting at the beginning of next year to start the problems . &quot;
&quot; the unions said that their last strike , who is the first in over 25 years , a protest against possible pay@@ ings of up to 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; in the North Sea , Wood Group has shortened the R@@ ates to its contrasts within the North Sea by around 9 percent due to neg@@ ativity market pressure . &quot;
the rating of the company follows a 10 @-@ percentage decline for on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts in the company gives the required space to come through the down@@ turn .
&quot; Shell has released his part of thousands and plans for his part , to give up his oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries as a result of his business activities as a result of his meg@@ az@@ ing deals with the British Energy company BG Group . &quot;
&quot; due to the lower raw material prices under pressure , an economic situation that had to leave the European Union by the decision of the British in June , the European Union . &quot;

&quot; the North Sea is important for regional economy , he said . &quot;
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy , which works for many and not only for a few , &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , less than $ 1,@@ 4 billion of spending is expected for new projects in the North Sea in comparison with an average of approximately $ 7 billion in the last five years . &quot;
Ke@@ pler has the rotation rate of stars in the star cluster of the Ple@@ j@@ ades
&quot; the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Space teles@@ cope , astronom@@ ers helped to collect the full catalogue of rotation rates under the stars of the stars of the Ple@@ j@@ ades . &quot;
&quot; the new data will help the astronom@@ ers to understand why stars in the stars go to different ra@@ ils , as well as in which context the rotation periods with the planet Earth stand . &quot;
&quot; we hope that we know through the compar@@ isons of our results with other stars , more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Luisa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the stars in the P@@ lei@@ ades is 445 light @-@ years from the Earth .
&quot; many stars in this constell@@ ation , which emerged around 125 million years ago , now reach the ad@@ ul@@ th@@ ood . &quot;
they are now turning on the fastest .
&quot; for top @-@ top rates , this att@@ aches great amounts of stars in constell@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; since this win@@ ch travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a brake effect on the stars . &quot;
&quot; when a star is aged , its rotation begins to slow down . &quot;
&quot; Ke@@ pler , the rotation rate of each star , by passing the time between the appearance of an recogni@@ z@@ able star @-@ ch@@ equ@@ es -- like sun@@ spots -- &quot;
the newest catalog of rot@@ ational rates points out that a massive s@@ lower and lower than less massive stars .
&quot; Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with bigger star s@@ lower pi@@ rou@@ ters than smaller . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; Ball@@ et &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades , we see that slow rot@@ ors are to be massive , mass@@ aging against faster rot@@ ors to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; since the star p@@ ile of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare qualities such as red rates . &quot;
&quot; the stars in the Ple@@ j@@ aden provides an anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older &quot; , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; it is still a lot of us to learn how we would like to learn more about how , wh@@ ann and why stars slow their rotation rates down and say their &quot; dance shoes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues reported in three reports in detail about their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the Ple@@ j@@ ades reported that soon in the Astr@@ onom@@ ical Journal .
a contro@@ versi@@ al Bas@@ eball @-@ Star
the t@@ ears were running at Alex Ro@@ dri@@ gu@@ ez faster than the U.S. bas@@ eball Star in the best days from base to base .
after his emotional return announcement the 41 years old professional on 12 August against the Tampa Bay R@@ ays a last time the tri@@ h@@ kot of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es wear .
&quot; I love this game , and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &apos; Good@@ bye &apos; to teach the &quot; &quot; declared All @-@ Star Game Statis@@ tics of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; three times Ro@@ dri@@ gu@@ ez was elected for the most valuable players of the League , 2009 he won the Yan@@ ke@@ es the World Series . &quot;
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract gave him 27 million US dollars annually since 2007 .
&quot; until the end of the contrac@@ ts on 31 December 2017 , he will act in future as consultants and youth coach - at full content . &quot;
as players paid it Ro@@ dri@@ gu@@ ez long time with performance back .
&quot; with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for his teams ( &quot; &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 until 2004 ) and since 2005 he managed to create some milestones . &quot;
with the Hall @-@ of @-@ Fame @-@ members H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e M@@ ays just two more bas@@ eball players in the most important statistics of similar values .
&quot; however , in the center of the bas@@ eb@@ alls of the bas@@ eb@@ alls of the age of 41 @-@ old , nevertheless , it is not likely to be recorded . &quot;
&quot; for such successfully Ro@@ dri@@ gu@@ ez - nickname &quot; &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; &quot; - in the field was , so contro@@ versi@@ al is its occurrence outside of space . &quot;
&quot; already 2009 , the Super@@ star existed at &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; , &quot; between 2001 and 2003 to have taken a bot@@ her@@ ed ster@@ o@@ ids . &quot;
in August 2013 he was closed due to a winding in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis Sc@@ andal to the end of 2014 for 211 games .
Ro@@ dri@@ gu@@ ez is considered to be the main di@@ gest@@ ure for years about an anti @-@ aging clinic in South @-@ Florida .
&quot; after a dispute , the lock was still reduced to 162 encounters . &quot;
&quot; the League could even have done a favor for 2014 for 2014 because I had played over 20 years without a break , &quot; said Ro@@ dri@@ gu@@ ez back at that time . &quot;
even his far@@ ewell days did not go wrong .
&quot; while many bas@@ eball Legends in its last games will once again get the big stage , Ro@@ dri@@ gu@@ ez had often sit on the bench . &quot;
&quot; my job does not include a far@@ ewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job includes the attempt to win each game , &quot; &quot; Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ard@@ i . &quot;
&quot; after all , Ro@@ dri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married with the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az , and the relationship with Pop@@ star Madonna and the act@@ ress K@@ ate Hudson following , sympathy @-@ conversion of the fans of the Y@@ ank@@ ee @-@ Arch@@ riv@@ alen Boston Red SO@@ x . &quot;

Olympia 2016 : Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa and Adrian Tar@@ inski are the first d@@ op@@ ing@@ es &quot;
ignor@@ ant : because of a positive d@@ op@@ ing@@ sample may not start weight of the weight of Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 will be over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed by the first official d@@ op@@ ing@@ cases .
an inher@@ ently Ath@@ letin could have gained almost one medal .
&quot; in front of the seventh race , the first official d@@ op@@ ing@@ es became known as the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
&quot; the Chinese swimm@@ ers in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter @-@ obstacles in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa from Bulgaria and Polish weights have been tested positive in Brazil - immediately prior to the beginning of the already critical athle@@ tics competitions , these messages are coming to the in@@ era . &quot;
&quot; at Ch@@ en , the Di@@ ure@@ tik@@ um Hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ d had been proven to be used as a mass means for d@@ op@@ ing@@ sub @-@ distances . &quot;
the International Sport@@ Court CAS confirmed on Friday afternoon at the time of spending the Olympic Games .
&quot; on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ ol@@ ds had occupied the fourth place in the final over 100 m but@@ terfly , only at 0.@@ 09 seconds the Bronze Med@@ al . &quot;
on Friday Ch@@ en would have to take part in the pres@@ um@@ bers of 50 m of Fre@@ is@@ til .
Ch@@ en has requested the opening of the B sample and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee ( I@@ OC ) .
&quot; the national association take the matter &quot; very seriously and demands Ch@@ en full cooperation with the investigations , &quot; zi@@ pped X@@ in@@ hua from a communication : &quot; &quot; we will work with the International Sport@@ Court CAS and will accept the judgment . &quot;
&quot; the first time in history is no longer the I@@ OC , but the CAS for the re@@ direc@@ ting of the ath@@ l@@ ete with positive cases . &quot;
&quot; also at the night of Rio se@@ duc@@ ed the message about the positive test at Dan@@ ek@@ owa , that 33 @-@ year @-@ old went up into the offensive . &quot;
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; this is &quot; an unbelievable shock , &quot; she said the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; it be inno@@ cent , the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; said the athle@@ tics . &quot;
the report is estimated that it is meant to be a bot@@ her@@ ed substance for blo@@ od@@ op@@ ing@@ th@@ ep@@ o .
&quot; Dan@@ ek@@ owa was pro@@ visional suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B test should also be positive . &quot;
Bulg@@ arians &apos;s prime minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ w right now with criticism of the Ath@@ letin of Word .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes do not draw the right conclusions , &quot; he said : &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many are already excluded . &quot;
you may not participate in Rio all weights from the chronic d@@ op@@ ing@@ stress@@ ful nation in Rio .
&quot; on Friday the case was &quot; &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; , &quot; the London @-@ Olympic champion in class until 85 kg was tested as his brother Tom@@ as@@ z three days before positive on the an@@ ab@@ ole ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ rol@@ on . &quot;
&quot; both pun@@ ished the intake , both must not start in the class up to 94 kg . &quot;
&quot; before the start of the lightweight , Dan@@ ek@@ ova is a further serious blow to the reputation of the entire sport . &quot;
&quot; the world of IA@@ AF , the complete Russian team had not allowed the whole Russian team to an exception because of systematic dam@@ s the start , even the L@@ äu@@ fer@@ nation Kenya produces numerous bad news . &quot;
in the swimming pool we also had the previous los@@ ers in China for he@@ ed disputes even between athletes .
&quot; thus , the Fr@@ ench@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t the Chinese Olympi@@ asi@@ eger Sun Y@@ ang har@@ sch . &quot;
&quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ elt , li@@ la . &quot;
&quot; when I see the po@@ dium about 200 m Fre@@ is@@ til , I want to pass me , &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French radio . &quot;
sun was also at the heart of a discussion with the Austr@@ ali@@ er M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for intelligence , &quot; said this . &quot;
sun had been tested positive with the Chinese champion@@ ships on the stimulation of the Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but had only to sit down a tri@@ ck sp@@ erm@@ ati@@ ge . &quot;
datas@@ he@@ au : so per@@ fi@@ de er@@ presses h@@ acker her solv@@ ent
programmer from Er@@ press@@ ungs @-@ m@@ alware is currently targeted companies - and are successful .
&quot; according to a current survey of m@@ alware protection specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes , among 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the surv@@ ey@@ ed companies have been at least once , partly several victims of an attack using Er@@ pres@@ ser software . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies have already been the goal of a ran@@ som@@ ware pre @-@ ext@@ or@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; 40 percent of the victims are paid by the perpet@@ rat@@ ors , to use the challenged systems and data to be used again . &quot;
the perpet@@ rat@@ ors speci@@ alize their ext@@ or@@ ser software according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes to attacks on attacks in corporate networks .
&quot; they have been there successfully , the potentially potentially solv@@ ent in exchange is clearly higher than with private users . &quot;
&quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying fast evolution of harm software , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ Chef Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ z@@ yn@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , most of the Mal@@ war@@ e@@ Programs were still designed to send advertising . &quot;
then discovered the perpet@@ rat@@ ory software for itself .
&quot; only if private users were the target , but the change to the company was shot quickly over the past few months . &quot;
Ran@@ som@@ ware is working according to a simple sample : once active on the computer of an O@@ pf@@ er searches for un@@ long changed files such as Word@@ - , ex@@ cel@@ - or database files as well as to archives of pictures and videos . &quot;
these files encryp@@ t the Ran@@ som@@ ware and delet@@ es the origin@@ als in a sustainable way .
&quot; subsequently , the software presents the demands of the ext@@ inction . &quot;
&quot; to get the final turn@@ key code to get the files , the victims need money - mostly in the form of Cr@@ yp@@ ad Bit@@ coin . &quot;
&quot; however , where by private users the personal photo database is at stake , it is possible to provide sensitive customer data or project databases without which the production is bre@@ ast@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the damage falls when a ran@@ som@@ ware suggests . &quot;
&quot; 22 percent of the German companies affected by Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to break the business operations completely , with a case people were killed in life . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , several hospitals were already threatened by attack , whose patients may be threatened by the loss of sick@@ ak@@ ak@@ age . &quot;
&quot; we say the victims always : paying not , you thereby promotes only the problem , explains Kl@@ ec@@ z@@ yn@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; however , 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay , their data will be returned . &quot;
for managers it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpet@@ rat@@ ors .
the h@@ ackers again know this and try to build a good reputation .
&quot; in a recent study , the security researchers of F @-@ Secure has examined and get in contact with the pres@@ um@@ ers and come to the result : the perpet@@ rat@@ ors are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money . &quot;
&quot; they explain their victims by chat , as they can pay with Bit@@ coin , direct access support websites a or un@@ lock for free example . &quot;
&quot; and we will rede@@ em private people after payments of just a few hundred Euros , companies have to pay hard to negotiate and five @-@ digit tot@@ als to get back their data un@@ turn@@ key . &quot;
&quot; given the potentially high and relatively risk @-@ resistant profits from the Ran@@ som@@ ware @-@ ext@@ or@@ tion , the h@@ acker is becoming professional and sharing the work , explains security exper@@ te Chester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from Anti@@ virus provider Sop@@ hos : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware approx within one week . &quot;
&quot; more prob@@ able , it is that it is about three or four people . &quot;
the programmers sell their harm software then in the form of a software construction .
&quot; the m@@ alware kits have emerged from the m@@ alware itself , advice and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars . &quot;
&quot; the package includes a adapt@@ ability , so smaller configurations , appearance and bran@@ ding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
the pres@@ um@@ ers are then looking for further h@@ ackers to spread the fresh @-@ bought software under the victims .
we live in a service sector .
&quot; so you log in one of the forums in the bottom of the bottom , buying the set of a crime and commissioned another one to install the software on as many PCs as possible . &quot;
the payment is made per in@@ infected computer .
&quot; usually , the crimin@@ als then carry sp@@ amm@@ ers with the spread , explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
Ran@@ som@@ ware &apos;s risk is now known by many companies who ensure their data better .
over 50 percent of companies in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ survey trust in order to rep@@ el Ran@@ som@@ ware through file @-@ back @-@ ups and sc@@ anners software .
&quot; accordingly , the perpet@@ rat@@ ors are already pursuing new strategies . &quot;
&quot; if the encryption of data is not sufficient threat to successful growth , the perpet@@ rat@@ ors instead of sensitive data such as customer list or pricing , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ Chef Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ z@@ yn@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; this makes for damage , depending on the type of data is still much higher than before . &quot;
&quot; in future , the perpet@@ rat@@ ors may take completely new goals on the internet of things . &quot;
&quot; on the Hack@@ er@@ Conference Def@@ con in the Hack@@ er@@ Intergovernmental Conference , how they could get started with the Internet to get Thermo@@ stat under their control . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of winter , the activation of such blocked heating could be quite a ran@@ s@@ om worth a ran@@ s@@ om . &quot;
&quot; if the perpet@@ rat@@ ors then instead of the heating in the future block a whole production line in a factory , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a theme in Industry 4.0 . &quot;
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and affordable
&quot; in the small HR @-@ V , Honda wants to pack : a little SU@@ V , a little cou@@ p@@ é and also the versatility of a mini@@ v@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; sounds pretty over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , has actually been in everyday life than extremely flexible . &quot;
&quot; although the only 1,@@ 60 m high HR V is rather small , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the fo@@ ond a lot of space , it does not work closely . &quot;
&quot; the materials of the interior are well processed and work pleasantly , only the cock@@ pit @-@ upper page falls slightly . &quot;
versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V during storage box .
&quot; there is not only a k@@ ill@@ ings of 453 l at high @-@ up and 10@@ 26 l with ren@@ amed back @-@ til@@ ted back , but there is the &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is less mag@@ ically , when it sounds : the seat surfaces of the back bank can be coat @-@ coat and thus offer storage space , which is high from floor to blankets 1,@@ 24 m high . &quot;
&quot; the luggage space can be well ventil@@ ated , however the flow height with 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peu@@ ge@@ ot 2008 . &quot;

there is still another motorcycle : a 1.5 @-@ l pet@@ rol with 96 kW / 130 HP .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the chassis is balanced to a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
but the steering is likely to be a bit more direct .

&quot; the full connectivity is only available for top features : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , Nav@@ i , App integration and more . &quot;
two US@@ B@@ - and an HDMI socket are under the arm@@ rest and therefore are somewhat aw@@ k@@ ward .
the approximately 29@@ 000 Euro for the well @-@ equipped top Diesel are fine .
&quot; who does not want to invest so much , the pet@@ rol will receive from 200@@ 00 Euro , the Diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros . &quot;

although the frac@@ ture was in fact def@@ ective .
&quot; however , the organis@@ er was charged just before departure of the clause . &quot;
he had to assume that the sea water was in order .

better traffic flow on the motorway br@@ inger
it looks regularly on the road @-@ road - here is a picture of November .
&quot; however , this should change : the legal bending of the law is to be extended . &quot;
&quot; this is good news for any car , drivers who stand in the traffic @-@ traffic on the ambient road every evening in St@@ au , when they go over the highway of the Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) . &quot;
&quot; the road building road is extended next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between the hammer Street and the departure Wes@@ eler Street , at 700 meters . &quot;
Auto@@ drivers can then direct directly from the hammer street on the right .
the great advantage : the traffic shares early on which the overall performance can be improved on the widely seen section of the federal road 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U Group in the District of Münster @-@ West .
the timet@@ ables on the Zu@@ br@@ inger sp@@ t the drivers above all between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
week@@ days there is enough back to the bridge over the Alber@@ ob@@ her path and sometimes also beyond .
reason is the needle on the B 51 shortly before the departure Wes@@ eler Straße .
from here the traffic only takes on the motorway bridge over the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be returned to a three @-@ quarter years ago .
the reason : static calculations had to surrender that the bridge is no longer the required carrying capacity above all to include the heavy load @-@ related traffic .
&quot; as long as these Eng@@ pass , and the connected St@@ au will continue , the responsible country can not say . &quot;
&quot; however , with years to reck@@ on : for the bridge has an official remainder of time until the year 2034 . &quot;
&quot; for the extension of the legal action , the provincial operation has chosen the traffic @-@ weak@@ est period in the school holidays because with disabilities to count . &quot;
traffic will be guided on Tuesday and Wednesday at the construction site .

rain instead of stars : hope for weather improvement
the weather has made the star @-@ bu@@ ck@@ les in the southwest of Germany in the night to Friday a stroke through the bill - but there is hope .
&quot; the night was suitable for clouds and rain bad for it to observe the spect@@ acle , said the chair of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning . &quot;
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
&quot; the weather should be good , then we see many star@@ ters in the sky . &quot;
&quot; at the stars of the stars , it is about Pers@@ ei@@ den , who belong with 216@@ 000 kilometers per hour to the fastest star tables . &quot;
&quot; they have made your name , because they seem@@ ingly come from the constell@@ ation of Per@@ se@@ us , which goes on the northeast . &quot;
relaxing night : tips against sleep disorders
&quot; in the evenings one gets around etern@@ ally , in the evening one is around for hours in night , in the morning it is far ahead of the awakening cl@@ add@@ les not to think of sleep . &quot;
that is anything but relaxing .
&quot; after all , one has been in good company with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , approximately one quarter of adults , and more than ten per cent increase their sleep often or permanently . &quot;
how do sleep problems or sleep disorders ?
&quot; there are several forms of ins@@ om@@ nia , and there can be many causes , empha@@ sizes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eding , Board member of the German Society for Sle@@ eping Research and Sle@@ eves . &quot;
&quot; what one understands below , but the In@@ som@@ nie , so is an in@@ ox and a sle@@ eper . &quot;
&quot; just the sleep sound@@ ly find many people as uns@@ atis@@ factory or insufficient , says Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , Board member of the German house@@ keeping association with practice in low @-@ Sax@@ on Var@@ el . &quot;
what is behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of ins@@ om@@ nia are complex .
&quot; behind it is organic , psych@@ ic or durable factors , but also medication . &quot;
not rare is the sle@@ ep@@ ic expression of another illness .
&quot; very early w@@ aking is especially at a depression frequently , &quot; says We@@ ise . &quot;
and it can be that different factors exc@@ eeding each other .
&quot; who has for example a band@@ man fall , can poor@@ ly lie , w@@ acht are all two to three hours on and starts wom@@ b to greet all day problems and make sure , gives We@@ ise an example . &quot;
this leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible .
when should one treat with sleep disorders ?
&quot; who is not working well over a month of a month at least three nights per week , should not sleep well and the day should go to a physician , coun@@ cils . &quot;
&quot; the imp@@ air@@ ment can look totally different : you are tired , tired , un@@ exhausted , has difficulties with the attention and concentration , is slightly irrit@@ able , has gri@@ pping fluctu@@ ations or bodi@@ ly discomfort such as Mag@@ - or head@@ ache . &quot;
&quot; to alle@@ vi@@ ate the sleep dis@@ ruption , it is important to find their causes . &quot;
&quot; as a treatment options , among other things , behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cog@@ nitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or also medications - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ question . &quot;
&quot; low @-@ approved dormit@@ ories there are hardly stressed Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary medical center of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin . &quot;
&quot; therefore , one should consult with sleeping problems initially to the medical specialist , coun@@ cils . &quot;
this can be clari@@ fied with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause .
&quot; who should take into the sleeping laboratory , and what happens there ? &quot;
&quot; for examining in the sleeping laboratory , medical example , for example in snor@@ ing with resp@@ ir@@ atory waste , with sle@@ eves or if one does not find the cause of a b@@ ump @-@ sle@@ eper , declar@@ es fe@@ etze . &quot;
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; only please do not take a n@@ ap , &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot;
&quot; after the c@@ abling , one goes into the bed at his normal time . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the electro@@ des on the body , one carries a nose @-@ l@@ asses , a chest strap and a sh@@ üh@@ l on the finger . &quot;
also features a camera on the ceiling to sleep .
how can the affected problems get in the handle ?
there are quite a lot of parking spaces where you can set for a better sleep .
&quot; We@@ eding counts on : regular sleeping and advent season , not too long in bed are not sleeping , on the day do not sleep , not be seen to sleep , alcohol and at night it begins to be reck@@ oned immediately , and that is absolutely not conduc@@ ive . &quot;
what the jungle camp with missing med@@ als in swimming has
the former German swimm@@ ers Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has expressed himself through Facebook to dis@@ appoint the D@@ SV team at the Olympic Games .
in December 2014 he met Gold Championships for the first time in December 2014 and presented his first world premiere at the same time .
now the former D@@ SV @-@ Ath@@ let Markus D@@ ei@@ bler is put forward by Facebook in the criticism of the Ex team @-@ team .
&quot; in a country where an Olympi@@ asi@@ an 20,000 € pre@@ y gets and a jungle kö@@ nig 15@@ 0,000 € should be no wonder about missing med@@ als , he wrote 26 @-@ year @-@ old during the night on Friday on his Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; the conveyor system in the swimming pool is bad , the d@@ op@@ ing@@ controls are very good . &quot;
&quot; with this , we cannot compete with countries that promote much much and do not operate so closely in the subject . &quot;
&quot; I am not saying that the controls are to be adjusted here , &quot; stated . &quot;
&quot; he wanted to start a com@@ eback , D@@ ei@@ bler would have been reported for nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ Doping Agency Germany ( N@@ ada ) . &quot;
this is exactly how you should keep it with countries too .
&quot; those who cannot be controlled a certain amount of time before World Cup / OS of independent cont@@ ours of the WA@@ DA / fin@@ a , must not take part , calling the choice of Hamburg , who now operates a ice cream . &quot;
airport : ban@@ ces by baggage
professional di@@ vest@@ ing at Düsseldorf Airport
&quot; the Düssel@@ dorf@@ fer police managed on Thursday the arrest of two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 years . &quot;
the Tatra @-@ ups had committed as a ban@@ ces and luggage ste@@ els .
&quot; against 21.@@ 30 p.m. , civilian officials in the area of the airport Düsseldorf is a ban@@ ces again known to the police officers from the past theft . &quot;
the two women and two men had committed several Del@@ ic@@ ans since the middle of July this year and were mainly professional .
&quot; the specialists of the crime no@@ o@@ ats 34 can have reached the diver@@ t , which came to Germany by off@@ ences to Germany , four acts . &quot;
they had a total of more than 15@@ ,000 euros exploited .
&quot; renov@@ ations , a few Lind@@ bu@@ bble bath , inter@@ c@@ lown away : the Riga &apos;s street in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain does not work in the first sight , but the police count them to the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; one passes the road from east to west , one passes on play@@ grounds , a refreshing nursery and a bi@@ ol@@ ades . &quot;
to the facade of a gray house someone was ug@@ ly ! &quot; spra@@ yed ! &quot;
&quot; opposite of a Li@@ dl , which should be demol@@ ished soon , is already built : until 2017 there is a house with high windows and 133 new rentals . &quot;
&quot; article on this &quot; tr@@ en@@ ous district &quot; , &quot; as the competent property company Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain is called in the last weeks , but preferred by burning cars . &quot;
&quot; reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents of rental contracts , on the ground floor are still open spaces and are used for events . &quot;
especially the Berlin interior at the beginning of the year has been widely used for a hard action of police against the project as a &quot; no @-@ go zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence .
&quot; after the 22nd June the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schm@@ ie@@ de had been vac@@ ated with 300 police officers and three teams on site , bul@@ lock parts of the street and held visitors of it , the house with the number 94 to enter . &quot;
meanwhile renovated building workers on behalf of un@@ familiar home@@ owners the rooms .
&quot; on 13 July a Berlin administrative court decided that the clearance was illegal , and one day later the police and construction workers under the ju@@ bel of sympath@@ is@@ ers and residents . &quot;
&quot; in this summer morning the road affects peaceful : parents walk with children , people sitting on the side@@ walk before the houses in the sun , others are talking about pre@@ y sp@@ ell@@ i . &quot;
in the immediate vicinity of the household projects are a primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens .
&quot; left violence is not the main or@@ acle of many residents : Ker@@ sti@@ n Neu@@ geb@@ auer who lives since 1999 at Kie@@ z , and Jana * , which attracts three children here mainly by the police presence . &quot;
with the inhabitants of the house @-@ projects they share the concern of rising rental and g@@ entri@@ fication .
it does not sound like a p@@ ect who wish to make a multi@@ plic@@ ity of polic@@ emen in front of v@@ andal@@ ous left .
&quot; the dit@@ ch , one of the Berlin interior and the police between the domestic and their neighbors , does not exist so . &quot;
&quot; Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working class , which also has a low average score of the city today and has a high level of poverty . &quot;
&quot; also domestic projects and the bor@@ ns living projects belong to the pine trees : 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former G@@ DR , including nearly the entire Main@@ zer Street very close to Riga . &quot;
&quot; while the Main@@ zer has been vac@@ ated under large police officers , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in Riga and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied before 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the quarter of the last few years has become increasingly becoming a magnet for tourists and elect@@ oral liner from all over the world : with them are now residents of the G@@ DR @-@ times and former home etz@@ etz@@ er their p@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; this is also noticeable in the renting , which has increased by nearly 60 percent since 2009 . &quot;
many of the re@@ builds in the ri@@ gs are attacked as symbols for this development : one recognizes it on advertis@@ ed discs or fresh gest@@ ed fac@@ ades that have been planted with color exploited .
&quot; no other street was mentioned as often together with the words &quot; &quot; lin@@ ks@@ aut@@ on@@ ome violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a reason for that not all neighbors can see this as a problem , be that they are not necessarily affected by crimin@@ ality , such as bodi@@ ly injury , statistics reveal almost exclusively against polic@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; the largest part of criminal off@@ ences make facts , the rising more buildings and newly renovated houses are met . &quot;
&quot; for Ker@@ sti@@ n Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a rental house next to the contro@@ versi@@ al 94 years , may be no talk of uncertainty . &quot;
&quot; what is concerned , it is a more important : the people in the 94 are their neighbors , which do not have been that . &quot;
also the famous burning cars give it directly in Riga for no longer .
&quot; for the studied architects , their street is not a crime point , on the contrary : &quot; here it helps each other , lives together on the street and gets more with each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is deliber@@ ately drawn into the Riga street - and remained .
&quot; therefore , it was also so important that the inhabitants will return to their street : from the police , politics and the media that in July all suddenly find the interpretation of the district . &quot;
&quot; but in the eyes of the residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road will continue to take away : through secured new buildings in former building , which supp@@ ress the old inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; these are ultimately con@@ dom@@ ini@@ ums that are not interesting for many here - here are rather people who are not so well toler@@ ated , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; violence and destruction can I absolutely not be healing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what should one do if you never stop someone ?
&quot; on all sides fru@@ stration , even at the police and the inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; for conc@@ e@@ zo@@ gen@@ ic , who liked through color bom@@ bs , Ker@@ sti@@ n &apos;s little understanding : the home projects and the left scene belonged to the pine . &quot;
who cares that should be aware of it - just like anyone who can complain in a tavern where bad can complain about noise .
all persons with pre @-@ names mentioned persons have asked to be called by their correct name
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is new refugees
Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is the contact persons in terms of integration and organisation .
&quot; moreover , it is social @-@ workers on the spot . &quot;
since July Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is the refuge@@ e sponsor for Ur@@ bach .
the social @-@ ped@@ agog@@ y in supports the team of the administration of Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
&quot; she sees itself as a contact partner for all players : refugees , labour movement , administr@@ ations , authorities and who else has yet mit@@ es . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine Client from the labour price indicates that the volunteer is more than thankful that D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le now is , the ei@@ er@@ leg@@ ality Woll@@ mil@@ ch@@ sau , which has primarily a problem . &quot;
&quot; so , some - less go@@ dless than rather on the variety of tasks are targeted - meant as the administration wanted to write the place . &quot;
&quot; looked for a administrative force with a talent for languages and people , associated with a long experience in the field of social work , just an ei@@ er@@ leg@@ ary Woll@@ mil@@ ch@@ sau . &quot;
&quot; but administrative work is not their central area , Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it is about organization , work with the local people on the spot and also behind the scenes as well as power supply . &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ ol@@ ds has been there for around six weeks .
it has a 50 percent position on three years of satisfying .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Client that Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le honest@@ y and general actors are supported . &quot;
&quot; there are large and small problems , organisational , human and understanding problems . &quot;
soon new containers are in the W@@ as@@ en@@ straße
&quot; a serious problem has been to be found for some time , apartments for the lack of connection that have been acknowledged . &quot;
the municipalities are responsible for the connection of connection .
you must accom@@ o@@ date the refugees in own or logged residential premises .
&quot; the costs for the construction , the rent or renovation of these accommodations must bear the municipalities themselves . &quot;
the responsibility changes from the Land@@ rat@@ as with a commune and job center .
&quot; problem : there are free objects , but not every owner wants to offer his apartment . &quot;
the search designed for some time as very difficult .
de facto the administration does not find private apartments .
&quot; so far , it does not work yet to rely on private apartments , so d@@ eu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the common apartments have to be found , as it is so beautiful . &quot;
so soon new containers are placed in the W@@ as@@ en@@ straße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
&quot; perspective is the keyword , are Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; besides a fixed stay , there are intern@@ ships , training courses , training courses , one @-@ euro jobs and instruc@@ tive activities for refugees and migrants who must be filmed or furnished . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine Client . &quot;
&quot; many work in the building yard or help household master , perform non @-@ profit work - and motivated and very neat , as Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le reports . &quot;
she hopes that the work for the common action leads to a positive impact .
&quot; that is &quot; &quot; no workers &quot; therapy . &quot; &quot;
but activity does not mean only work .
&quot; the day do need a fixed structure , say D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le and customer . &quot;
people would have to develop a good feeling .
&quot; so , there are offers like sport , contacts with local people and above all language courses . &quot;
professional courses are r@@ ar .
&quot; so , you also jump to manage and honest@@ y . &quot;
&quot; it is central that the refugees get the feeling , they are welcome in Germany and welcome . &quot;
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; they must explain the refugees that it will take it , and they can be able to over@@ bridges the time , for example with language courses . &quot;
&quot; who will develop the feeling , he could not help in Ur@@ bach anybody , should not work and be un@@ n@@ üt@@ z , who will never integrate themselves . &quot;
the distinct majority is motivated .
&quot; however , there are also , says customer honest , &quot; people , where nothing works . &quot; the work of D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le and customer are therefore always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot;
that is all a &quot; amm@@ amm@@ able task . &quot;
&quot; a difficult question : do the two have been afraid of radic@@ alisation , even in a small church like Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; no , &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine Client quite clearly , &quot; what man@@ cher nai@@ ve call &quot; . a Rest@@ ri@@ iko can and do not want to exclude it . &quot;
&quot; sensitive , the hel@@ per is already . &quot;
these inci@@ dents are also subject to refugees .
they would have fear that the attacks bring them complete in call .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Client . &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
&quot; so , the main and ambition of volunteers on the spot and in the region will hold off activities . &quot;
they always have in the background that soon a new sto@@ cking to refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a ceiling ?
this question is clear to answer the politics .
&quot; actually , it is totally free to place it hel@@ pers on site . &quot;
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we are not yet arrived , where we want to go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; no new refugees , that would relax . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine Client also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bacher is also already capable of integrating the previous man properly . &quot;
&quot; this is currently about 100 persons , mostly young men . &quot;
&quot; but when people are in need , they are helping them both women agree . &quot;
&quot; the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers . &quot;
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : sear@@ ched with helic@@ opter
the police hu@@ b@@ helic@@ opter fle@@ w about an hour for different areas - un@@ successful .
two unknown men are penet@@ rated on Friday morning at 8.@@ 50 o &apos;clock in an apartment in an apartment house in the Lind@@ en@@ weg .
the inhabitants tasted the two and suggested the in@@ hol@@ dings in the escape .
&quot; the two men were about 1,@@ 65 to 1.@@ 70 meters large , probably mascul@@ ine , both Blue@@ je@@ ans and black cap@@ u@@ zen@@ lis . &quot;
you flee from the city center .
the police gave the police several stri@@ ps and a police helic@@ opter .
the ins@@ anity was carried out without success .
&quot; eventually , the unknown before the apartment was near the apartment or at their escape . &quot;
