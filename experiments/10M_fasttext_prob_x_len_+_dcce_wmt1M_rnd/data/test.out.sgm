<seg id="1">Clintons and Trumps economic policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and trade agreement TTP - that would like both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">"however, the two U.S. presidential elections are however at the control and energy policy as well as in a fundamental demand."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a basic, rather philosophical difference."</seg>
<seg id="5">The role of the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep the doubts rather small and warned how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Clinton wants to punish the economy to death and regulate death, he says."</seg>
<seg id="8">"he himself would be quite different, the Trump itself would be."</seg>
<seg id="9">"he will take Regulatory regulations, and he makes for a far-reaching tax reform with lower controls, strong - for private residents and for businesses."</seg>
<seg id="10">"in contrast, Clinton says: the State has specific tasks to fulfil, he has disadvantaged opportunities and needs money for it."</seg>
<seg id="11">"therefore, the taxes would increase for the rich, says it."</seg>
<seg id="12">"interestingly, both very close to the subject of infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="13">"invests in the committees, say Trump and Clinton almost wortalike."</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic applicant is the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in the infrastructure are classical democratic policy and are strictly rejected by the state-state-wing-wing of the republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">"so, on Trump we could communicate with internal discussions."</seg>
<seg id="17">Clearly the differences in the energy and climate policies are more evident.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal power stations and regain the coal mining in the US again.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil promotion should also be possible in so far-protected areas to cancel the Paris climate protection agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">"on the other hand, Clinton wants to strengthen and calls for the renewable energies with its investment program:" a country will create the clean energies and create millions of jobs. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"however, not only in the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other."</seg>
<seg id="23">"TPP, the transpazific Trade Agreement, do both do not want to sign."</seg>
<seg id="24">"at the same time, the US does not want to isolate the US from international trade - but simply American jobs better."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the should also be paid better, calls for about Clinton."</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7,25 US dollar is a hungry.</seg>
<seg id="27">She wants to increase them to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"what Trump is to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must be, then he does not seem to be changed."</seg>
<seg id="29">But the great discussion of the coming months is likely to become more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the one hand is Trump, who wants to escape the economy and the citizens to boost growth."</seg>
<seg id="31">"his critics hold him before, so that the budget was only bigger."</seg>
<seg id="32">"on the other hand, Clinton, who want to demand at least from the rich, that they pay more taxes and their critics are saying: more taxes are not the solution."</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: a "Alliance of foreign meetings"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended up a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce their hands and to proclaim an official end of the eight months long-term war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">"but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counter in the goldplated hall of St. Petersburg Palastes, I cannot deny me of the intrusion that Ankara wants to do this reconciliation."</seg>
<seg id="5">"there was the towing, yes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but Putins smiles crafted and he pointed hardly warmth, even for its back conditions."</seg>
<seg id="7">Recep Tayyip Erdogan on the other hand spoke repeatedly by his "dear friend" Putin - according to a report all five times.</seg>
<seg id="8">I could no longer count it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also spoke that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis but even better.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day described a newspaper that Erdogan would have fun as if it would never happen to happen.</seg>
<seg id="11">I seemed to give me enthusiasm rather the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin radiant, sustainable coolness showed that the state of Russia had forgotten nothing."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rather, the cause of the crisis was the first what he mentioned in his introduction: the shot of a Russian struggle from the Syrian border through Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow from reaction to time was wutentbrannt.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin shared and accused Ankara to have fallen back in the back.</seg>
<seg id="16">The abandonment was even bigger since it was committed by a alleged friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Vetrust rebuild is difficult to rebuild if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"for months long, the state-controlled media led a fierce, unrestricted attack on Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at one time it seemed, as if the Turks bear all the blame."</seg>
<seg id="21">"at the trial, the accusations of conducive officers, that Erdogan had benefited from their own family from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria, which could be controlled by the so-called Islamist state."</seg>
<seg id="22">He made this vehement.</seg>
<seg id="23">"but in St.Petersburg, the official message was that it is time to look forward."</seg>
<seg id="24">"after all, this meeting took place only because Putin received by the President Erdogan apologies that he wanted to hear."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a way of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are obvious."</seg>
<seg id="27">"Erdogan is first in first line all friends who can get, after he was given last month at a failed coup d almost of his ministry."</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey also have shaken him too.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit hard Turkey - especially the prohibition of charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number is reduced by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in Russia, travel agency and charter companies will be easier when the flights are taken back."</seg>
<seg id="33">You count on a late crash at the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this week forecast the state television, cheap fruits and vegetables, as soon as the Turkish agonic imports will be allowed again."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a report in Vedemosti formulating the following:" tourists there long, tomatoes here long. "</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an extra political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry on the West as it was the reaction to the tried and tried a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">"in addition to this, the continued Groll pass on the snail of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pike to draw from the cool atmosphere and to reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in Ankara, the Russian state of State has won a bonus for ensuring that he sought after attempted state-rich support for the elected state organs."</seg>
<seg id="40">This is well-making for Moscow a matter of course which has changed a profound fear of rain rain.</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit meeting in this splendid palace by the sea made possible Russia and Turkey, one, as it was an analyst once described," alliance of outside "" alliance: two countries that are violated and poorly treated in the West. "</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, despite of public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two still."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave the role as peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing pages."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it could be signatched that after almost three hours of initial talk, both President at the press conference said that they had not even stripped the issue."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the President of Turkey vermied it intentionally to answer a question about their differences, while Putin decided to stress this."</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator to Syria can be found.</seg>
<seg id="47">"but after months of open hostilities - and given the potential for a perfect disruption, as the NATO member Turkey absent the Russian martial arts - it is certainly better that the two heads of state at least once again talk to each other."</seg>

<seg id="21">Refugees who are targeted to the country should let their own smartphones and leave social media account for a safety check-check.</seg>

<seg id="23">Some of them is political and legally delicate.</seg>
<seg id="24">Manches also works unbalanced and leaves questions open.</seg>
<seg id="25">"and with some points - in the imbalance of thought, for example - the question arises: what does this actually have to do with security and terror?"</seg>
<seg id="26">"yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the topics of refugees and terror."</seg>
<seg id="27">"but it cannot be seen in speech, that the attacks of Ansbach and Würzburg were displaced."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in addition, many people in the face of high refugees pay attention to safety."</seg>
<seg id="29">"and things which people deeply stirred, left now also in electoral periods."</seg>
<seg id="30">The inner security is enormous in the focus.</seg>

<seg id="33">The fuse is great.</seg>
<seg id="34">"and yes, there are electoral contests."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Union and the SPD can therefore become increasingly important in the subject of internal security.</seg>
<seg id="36">In the past few days there was high up between the two parties.</seg>
<seg id="37">"only a garment dispute over the equities of the federal police, then over a security policy collection of some Unions Minister, in which the Ressorts has also calling a Burka ban and a deconversion of the double citizenship."</seg>

<seg id="3">"before you come to the commentail, in order to overload it under the pseudonym non-empowerment of age, this statement leads to current data."</seg>
<seg id="4">"according to YouGov, the multiplication of sound plates don't want to welcome a boom in millennials that would like to welcome realism of physical objects, but at Midlife-nostalgia."</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have recently bought a record are all predictions after the age of 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most probable pot group."</seg>
<seg id="7">"there is also no hordes by hobbycollectors - it has an emotional meaning: older plate tists retain their feelings rather for itself (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it, alone time to spend (69% vs. 66%)."</seg>
<seg id="8">But do not agree the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">"if this blog would be a news report on TV, I would follow the camera while in the midst of a busy road in Soho, a humble way to keep my hands and confess as:" so, let's take a closer look at it. "</seg>
<seg id="10">"so, let's take a look at it."</seg>
<seg id="11">"even if the heart sole is slowly moving to its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent sellers were located - there are still a handful of fantastic record stores."</seg>
<seg id="12">"I would probably ask the cameraman, to turn the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and vegetable through observation."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Stuart from Glasgow, 55, which I found by Sister Ray (data number: eight men middle age) into the Reckless Records (data number: eight men middle age), a woman, probably around the 20), is a day long because of a meeting in London and passes through the shops in order to fill the few hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">"is he a Collectors, ask me?"</seg>
<seg id="15">"I already value", "he says."</seg>
<seg id="16">"I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates."</seg>
<seg id="17">"this sounded boards, above shown (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I am not followed him home), dress the walls of his living room."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles, the result of its available income: he is now able to buy plates, which he could not afford, when they appeared and once again buy objects which he has sold, when he was young and pledge."</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy, are out of the late 60s, early 70s, which appeared, when I was 11 or 12. things I was probably too young to buy it," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"he agrees that those who want to buy the plates, rather introverted and gladly spend alone time, and adds:" I don't and I don't drink too much. "</seg>
<seg id="21">That is my laster.</seg>
<seg id="22">"WEZ, 25, who works at Sister Ray also believes that many customers, which he meets to the YouGov-profile."</seg>
<seg id="23">"he also has noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the medienhpe, people who have heard about the comeback, and let us see their old records again."</seg>
<seg id="24">"by the discussions I have led, people usually have been entrusted by 1998 or 1999 of their collection."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers that once sold their plates, to buy CDs, sell their CDs to buy their records back again."</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom to followers of the turntable of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional significance of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">"it takes only a few seconds in a shop like Phonica, to recognize that record is a soothing community of equality."</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to WEZ, some of the older customers attended the contact-free payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">"some record-fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world, and would like to withdraw to the stability of familiar sound clips, of objects, the happiable cheers."</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes, sometimes it can be filling a void or poseful ownership as a sort of consolation," says WEZ. "</seg>
<seg id="32">This is with me as collectors so and I think it is with many people so.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal with mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"we are like their social workers!" flkills a staff of a record pile. "</seg>
<seg id="35">"a survey of ICM in April assumed that nearly 50% of the people, who bought a record last month, they have not yet heard."</seg>
<seg id="36">"the survey also found out that 41% have a record player that they never use, while 7% of those who have a record, no turntable."</seg>
<seg id="37">"at this time of news, I would probably be very concerned, while running through a pile of Bossa Nova compilations."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Jonny, 42, who works with Sounds of the Universe (data number: three men middle aged), has noticed a" Trophy "of Revivals."</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone came only recently here and said," "I have no record player, but I would like to buy a radiohead sound plate, so that I can put them into the shelf", "he says."</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is not a great percentage, but it definitely happens."</seg>
<seg id="41">"more product-lasered, less musically."</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I have no turntable."</seg>
<seg id="43">"these are younger people, not older that are only slowly coming."</seg>
<seg id="44">"fopp that has dedicated the vinyl, almost a whole floor, has a blower audience, when I rewr."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenagejungs and women middle ages."</seg>
<seg id="46">"even if the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above-standing shops - Wild Beasts, synthesizer and sexter pop instead of experimental jazz dryers from the speakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers."</seg>
<seg id="47">"none of them looks strange, but nagging psychmata are hard to be imaginable if one stands next to someone over 30 seconds."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Elanora, 27, runs for several minutes in the shop and considers the variation of the available plates for sale."</seg>
<seg id="49">It is more likely to make a window mannea than a big purchase.</seg>
<seg id="50">"it does not deserve much, so the collecting of plates is not a real option, says it."</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs much.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it's easy to listen to music from a computer or to other way, but the beauty of plates is... it drives with a lovable seuzer."</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it really is unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">"my last stop is a shop, by which said that a new generation of turnaround were said: urban outfitters."</seg>
<seg id="55">"while I give the impression that Jeans-Hotpants to patterns, I observed a group of young teenager, before a father and his daughter to think about a crosley turntable."</seg>
<seg id="56">"on the left is a staircase, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"no one sees himself - maybe because they are only pure decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to grasp them."</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">"but considering that any attraction for these objects mean more money for the industry, and to send some customers to the depths Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain."</seg>
<seg id="60">"there is no surprise that a population group, which has more time and money than others, also the one that is most for luxury, like plates."</seg>
<seg id="61">"even if my neighbor agree that the results of YouGov vote, let them be, at least in record business in Soho, the large number of female collectors, who exist in reality, turnaround and Onlineforen exist."</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are probably working hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">"they spend their Thursday morning with certainty not with the buming through the turnaround of Berwick Street and the leaves by plates, while they avoid the starving view of an unfold, 30-year false moderator suppress that over the shoulders are nothing wrong with middle aged men."</seg>

<seg id="1">"in the middle of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline"</seg>
<seg id="2">"wherever you are, how late it is, it is the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro feel resistant and unevasively to a rapid run between competition and quest.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is, as if the olympic torch itself is a burning stab, which will protect from wristy to a swimming pool for the waiter."</seg>
<seg id="5">"you can not switch the television, read a paper or listen to the conversation of your neighbors in the queue in the queues, without over Simone Biles, Katie Leuny or the dispute between Michael Phelps and chad le Clos."</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Dooley, who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women's warm with dimples, could quite well be sent under this familiar name that are being sent to Prime Time, thanks to sponsors and well-being TV advertising if he would be a swimmers, turner, or even foul."</seg>
<seg id="8">"but Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights in the olympic trampoline of gold."</seg>
<seg id="9">The olympic flame is not illuminated every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">"further from the center, partly in the shadow are the sports, which are not widely recognized: airbrush shooting, archery, Badminton, Taekwondo."</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast swimming and let it rule for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but if I might be humble as arguments for my particular love, then let me draw attention to the discreet charme of the trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="13">"although the trampolines have already been an olympic event since 2000, when it had been in Sydney, it was the last 16 years so much that many people I asked, did not know that there is a Olympiasportart at all."</seg>
<seg id="14">This might be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">"although the US athletes sent to the competition, it has never won a Medal in the trampolines and had made a athletes, who has managed to end up to the end of 2012."</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians who share for women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the trampoline of the trampoline has a certain outconductor charme, partly because it sounds for the unenlightened ear suitable for a clown school than that sounds for the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in this place I should admit that I am not an expert, but only an inherited enthusiast."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it has humoristic potential - the cartoonest trembling of his never ends - but also the Grazie of the gym and diving, the two sports, which is essentially united."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the word" trampoline "dates from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means so much means as" springboard. "</seg>
<seg id="22">"emerging winner jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements (rotating, hreal and saltos) before they land on the feet."</seg>
<seg id="23">"they are evaluated according to official Olympiaprogram according to execution, difficulty and" flight time. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"two-day athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common olympic vector is straight.</seg>
<seg id="26">"hopeful need to go on in their quest for gold, faster, upwards and dron, sometimes up to finish, sometimes back and back, upwards and down on the playground."</seg>
<seg id="27">"they have not only the Ziellinie or the output wall, but in the TV transmission also another height goal: that of the world or the Olympiarekords."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the purposeful quest is nobel, admired, even fanatic - and it's enough to even stir up a viewer to tears."</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I think even when entering these games as a bit tireless.</seg>
<seg id="30">Of which the trampoline offers a breathing.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward-forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">"he or she preallt from, seemingly heavy elos like an astronaut, goes up, then after down, then effortlessly back up."</seg>
<seg id="34">"also here is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves into the distance, only the trendy, elegant lifting of time and gravitation."</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen like the competition at the Olympic Games can be only.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the qualification and extension of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming around 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00."</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will cut off the ends as part of an afternoblocks of both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">"in the midst of Olympia manie they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that will probably be overlooked after the general tumult."</seg>
<seg id="39">"when the Consciousness can be achieved only through the anxiety and the objectification of male athletes, as it has recently pushed the male US turner according to The Wall Street Journal recently - then Mr. Dooley awaits its after the air of rining, new fanatic."</seg>

<seg id="3">Demonstrators calling for political changes in Ethiopia on violent resistance of the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that many proteins have killed during the clashes with the police with the police have been killed.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia exactly together to break up?</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the last ten years, it was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid branch of the West with a fast growing economy."</seg>
<seg id="7">"but in recent months, protests against the government of the country and spread themselves more and more."</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people on the streets and slowed fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The response of the government was uncharitable according to human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses gave him that policemen were shot at zig-armed demonstrators and killing.</seg>
<seg id="11">"in the run-being videos about the protests, which are probably from the last or beginning of this year, show how security are young people with blocs, while these were forced to make a hand stand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The boss of the UN Authority of Human Rights is now demanding an incoming investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it was always difficult to meet this country and will even become harder," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group. "</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorist attacks on the region, especially in Somalia. only few countries in Africa, if at all, receive so much western help."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopian economy was expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new pendant in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are usually quiet, safe and clean. "</seg>
<seg id="19">"even if Ethiopia have anything other than an example of democracy - human rights organisations have continuously led the oppression of the government - the opposition in the country became restricted, whereby dissidents are effective to silence."</seg>
<seg id="20">"many were sent into exile, or sent into prison, or driven into the breadth of the desert."</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you press people and they have no other options apart from protesters, it breaks out," said Nyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopian. "</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from the ground utilization to the litters with respect to the power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a far-end election last year the ruling party and its allies received the final seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time, tensions descends along the border to Eritrea; a fight for this delicate, controversial line called for hundreds of life."</seg>
<seg id="28">"analyst fear that separatists such as the Oromo-liberating front, or the nationale liberating front of the Ogaden that were more or less imposed in recent years, the turmoil can benefit more or less."</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness after years of absence is now explode under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only in recent years, many Ethiopians were able to communicate with social media, as cheap smartphones are becoming more common and improved the Internet services."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government reserves the access to Facebook and Twitter, whatever it does in regular intervals, especially during protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxies which hide where they are."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young artists gave them to be gathered together.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Cimos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"since offices, the Amharas, who come from aedics, predominantly Christian, in politics and economy, while they are the Oromos exploited, of which many Muslims are living and in flat-areas."</seg>
<seg id="37">But even this is changing straight.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are here to coordinate under one screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos. "</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests found in areas of Amhara and Cimos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many Amharas and Cimos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of tigray, which constitute approximately 6 percent of the population and which are dominant in the military services, trade and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr. Meles, a former vine leader, was until his death in an unattended disease in 2012 17 years of Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was seen as tactical genius, a man who could think of corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly embarrassed in it to take early signs of dissatisfaction and use special commissioner to process opponents and make it unharmful.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the current regime is lacking in this fundamental skill," Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst. "</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ethiopians of new prime minister, Hailemariat Desalegn, was chosen from relatively undill reasons to assume the position of Mr. Meles."</seg>
<seg id="47">"unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of NordäEthiopian, Mr. Hailemariam coming from the south."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analyst say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the tigray controlled security services.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time that Ethiopia was one such an turmoil lived in 2005, after thousands of elections protested by the government and subsequently stolen from the government and subsequently were stolen."</seg>
<seg id="51">"during the following raid were killed many proteins, even if there were less than in the past few months and this time the unrest went relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"development experts praised Ethiopian leaders for their visioning infrastructure, such as the new pendure, as well as for their measurable progress in poverty reduction."</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this did not prevent the intensification of the internal mismisst of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And she takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"last month of attacks in Gondar, an amharic town, from Tigray guided shops and the hatred towards the Tigray is becoming increasingly popular in social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analyst say that the protests will bring the USA and other Western allies into an independent position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American government used Ethiopia as a basis for Dronenary flights over the neighboured Somalia, even if they recently listened to this base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"while the West does not want to support democracy during the West, he does not want his allies merge into an already volatite area."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," said Mr. Abdi, "is a very thin atrocities."</seg>

<seg id="2">Programmer from Erpressungs-malware is currently targeted companies - and are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">"according to a current survey of malware protection specialists Malwarebytes, among 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies have been at least once, partly several victims of an attack using Erpresser software."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in Germany, almost 20 percent of companies have already been the goal of a ransomware pre-extortion."</seg>
<seg id="5">"40 percent of the victims are paid by the perpetrators, to use the challenged systems and data to be used again."</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize their extorser software according to the observations of Malwarebytes to attacks on attacks in corporate networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">"they have been there successfully, the potentially potentially solvent in exchange is clearly higher than with private users."</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a terrifying fast evolution of harm software," explains Malwarebytes-Chef Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world." "</seg>
<seg id="9">"in 2008, most of the MalwarePrograms were still designed to send advertising."</seg>
<seg id="10">Then discovered the perpetratory software for itself.</seg>
<seg id="11">"only if private users were the target, but the change to the company was shot quickly over the past few months."</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware is working according to a simple sample: once active on the computer of an Opfer searches for unlong changed files such as Word-, excel- or database files as well as to archives of pictures and videos. "</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the Ransomware and deletes the originals in a sustainable way.</seg>
<seg id="14">"subsequently, the software presents the demands of the extinction."</seg>
<seg id="15">"to get the final turnkey code to get the files, the victims need money - mostly in the form of Crypad Bitcoin."</seg>
<seg id="16">"however, where by private users the personal photo database is at stake, it is possible to provide sensitive customer data or project databases without which the production is breasted."</seg>
<seg id="17">"accordingly, the damage falls when a ransomware suggests."</seg>
<seg id="18">"22 percent of the German companies affected by Ransomware, 13 percent even had to break the business operations completely, with a case people were killed in life."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Germany, several hospitals were already threatened by attack, whose patients may be threatened by the loss of sickakakage."</seg>
<seg id="20">"we say the victims always: paying not, you thereby promotes only the problem, explains Kleczynski."</seg>
<seg id="21">"however, 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay, their data will be returned."</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know this and try to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">"in a recent study, the security researchers of F-Secure has examined and get in contact with the presumers and come to the result: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they explain their victims by chat, as they can pay with Bitcoin, direct access support websites a or unlock for free example."</seg>
<seg id="26">"and we will redeem private people after payments of just a few hundred Euros, companies have to pay hard to negotiate and five-digit totals to get back their data unturnkey."</seg>
<seg id="27">"given the potentially high and relatively risk-resistant profits from the Ransomware-extortion, the hacker is becoming professional and sharing the work, explains security experte Chester Wisniewski from Antivirus provider Sophos:" a single person can write a ransomware approx within one week. "</seg>
<seg id="28">"more probable, it is that it is about three or four people."</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their harm software then in the form of a software construction.</seg>
<seg id="30">"the malware kits have emerged from the malware itself, advice and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the package includes a adaptability, so smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski. "</seg>
<seg id="32">The presumers are then looking for further hackers to spread the fresh-bought software under the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">"so you log in one of the forums in the bottom of the bottom, buying the set of a crime and commissioned another one to install the software on as many PCs as possible."</seg>
<seg id="35">The payment is made per ininfected computer.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually, the criminals then carry spammers with the spread, explains Wisniewski."</seg>
<seg id="37">Ransomware's risk is now known by many companies who ensure their data better.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of companies in the Malwarebytes-survey trust in order to repel Ransomware through file-back-ups and scanners software.</seg>
<seg id="39">"accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if the encryption of data is not sufficient threat to successful growth, the perpetrators instead of sensitive data such as customer list or pricing," explains Malwarebytes-Chef Marcin Kleczynski. "</seg>

<seg id="2">"in the evenings one gets around eternally, in the evening one is around for hours in night, in the morning it is far ahead of the awakening claddles not to think of sleep."</seg>
<seg id="3">That is anything but relaxing.</seg>

<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of insomnia are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">"behind it is organic, psychic or durable factors, but also medication."</seg>
<seg id="12">Not rare is the sleepic expression of another illness.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early waking is especially at a depression frequently," says Weise. "</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors exceeding each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">"who has for example a bandman fall, can poorly lie, wacht are all two to three hours on and starts womb to greet all day problems and make sure, gives Weise an example."</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should one treat with sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="18">"who is not working well over a month of a month at least three nights per week, should not sleep well and the day should go to a physician, councils."</seg>
<seg id="19">"the impairment can look totally different: you are tired, tired, unexhausted, has difficulties with the attention and concentration, is slightly irritable, has gripping fluctuations or bodily discomfort such as Mag- or headache."</seg>
<seg id="20">"to alleviate the sleep disruption, it is important to find their causes."</seg>

<seg id="25">"who should take into the sleeping laboratory, and what happens there?"</seg>
<seg id="26">"for examining in the sleeping laboratory, medical example, for example in snoring with respiratory waste, with sleeves or if one does not find the cause of a bump-sleeper, declares feetze."</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only please do not take a nap," says Fietze. "</seg>
<seg id="30">"after the cabling, one goes into the bed at his normal time."</seg>
<seg id="31">"in addition to the electrodes on the body, one carries a nose-lasses, a chest strap and a shühl on the finger."</seg>

<seg id="7">Especially the Berlin interior at the beginning of the year has been widely used for a hard action of police against the project as a "no-go zone" for policemen and 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>

<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the household projects are a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">"left violence is not the main oracle of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer who lives since 1999 at Kiez, and Jana *, which attracts three children here mainly by the police presence."</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the house-projects they share the concern of rising rental and gentrification.</seg>

<seg id="16">"the ditch, one of the Berlin interior and the police between the domestic and their neighbors, does not exist so."</seg>

<seg id="18">"also domestic projects and the borns living projects belong to the pine trees: 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including nearly the entire Mainzer Street very close to Riga."</seg>
<seg id="19">"while the Mainzer has been vacated under large police officers, many of the projects were legalized in Riga and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied before 26 years ago."</seg>

<seg id="21">"this is also noticeable in the renting, which has increased by nearly 60 percent since 2009."</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the rebuilds in the rigs are attacked as symbols for this development: one recognizes it on advertised discs or fresh gested facades that have been planted with color exploited.</seg>
<seg id="23">"no other street was mentioned as often together with the words" "linksautonome violence." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"a reason for that not all neighbors can see this as a problem, be that they are not necessarily affected by criminality, such as bodily injury, statistics reveal almost exclusively against policemen."</seg>

<seg id="22">"problem: there are free objects, but not every owner wants to offer his apartment."</seg>
<seg id="23">The search designed for some time as very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto the administration does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">"so far, it does not work yet to rely on private apartments, so deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="26">"therefore, the common apartments have to be found, as it is so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers are placed in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">"perspective is the keyword, are Regine customer and Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="30">"besides a fixed stay, there are internships, training courses, training courses, one-euro jobs and instructive activities for refugees and migrants who must be filmed or furnished."</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports Regine Client. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"many work in the building yard or help household master, perform non-profit work - and motivated and very neat, as Annika Deuschle reports."</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the common action leads to a positive impact.</seg>
<seg id="34">"that is" "no workers" therapy. ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not mean only work.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the day do need a fixed structure, say Deuschle and customer."</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a good feeling.</seg>
<seg id="38">"so, there are offers like sport, contacts with local people and above all language courses."</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rar.</seg>
<seg id="40">"so, you also jump to manage and honesty."</seg>
<seg id="41">"it is central that the refugees get the feeling, they are welcome in Germany and welcome."</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"they must explain the refugees that it will take it, and they can be able to overbridges the time, for example with language courses."</seg>
<seg id="44">"who will develop the feeling, he could not help in Urbach anybody, should not work and be unnütz, who will never integrate themselves."</seg>
<seg id="45">The distinct majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"however, there are also, says customer honest," people, where nothing works. "the work of Deuschle and customer are therefore always to motivate others."</seg>
<seg id="47">That is all a "ammammable task."</seg>
<seg id="48">"a difficult question: do the two have been afraid of radicalisation, even in a small church like Urbach?"</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," "says Regine Client quite clearly," what mancher naive call ". a Restriiko can and do not want to exclude it."</seg>
<seg id="50">"sensitive, the helper is already."</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have fear that the attacks bring them complete in call.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine Client. "</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">"so, the main and ambition of volunteers on the spot and in the region will hold off activities."</seg>
<seg id="56">They always have in the background that soon a new stocking to refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a ceiling?</seg>
<seg id="58">This question is clear to answer the politics.</seg>
<seg id="59">"actually, it is totally free to place it helpers on site."</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we are not yet arrived, where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle. "</seg>
<seg id="61">"no new refugees, that would relax."</seg>
<seg id="62">"Regine Client also makes it clear that the Urbacher is also already capable of integrating the previous man properly."</seg>
<seg id="63">"this is currently about 100 persons, mostly young men."</seg>
<seg id="64">"but when people are in need, they are helping them both women agree."</seg>
<seg id="65">"the political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers."</seg>
