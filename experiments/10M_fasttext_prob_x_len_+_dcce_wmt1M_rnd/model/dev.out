the two wanted to discuss the implementation of the international agreement as well as Teh@@ eran in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , in meeting the conflict there is to be a conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ speaking two @-@ state solution . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been stra@@ ined for many years .
Washington critic@@ ises the long @-@ term sett@@ ler of Israel and casts Net@@ any@@ ahu def@@ ating their will in the peace process .
by the Obama &apos;s deal the deal with Iran &apos;s nuclear programme has deteri@@ or@@ ated the relationship between the two .
&quot; in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu had kept a contro@@ versi@@ al attack prior to the US Congress held a contro@@ versi@@ al attack against Obama that had been classified as an aff@@ ront to Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech had not been dism@@ is@@ sed by Obama , a meeting had rejected this with regard to the election of the election in Israel . &quot;
in a emergency call @-@ b@@ lowing Professor to have shot his girlfriend
&quot; in a emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on &apos;s represented with a somewhat tre@@ ad voice of the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials would have to come to his home . &quot;
&quot; he &apos;s represented it important to emphas@@ ise that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; but still alive and probably excited , and he said , the family re@@ acts of dead woman could be found on mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; within the house , the officials of A@@ my Pr@@ inde@@ s@@ s and a hand @-@ written note that was done on a white block , I wanted to undo , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was represented by it . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that he &apos;s represented in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ veland , Mississi@@ ppi , who has already travelled 300 miles on the school grounds , E@@ than Schmidt , shot and killed on the door to his office . &quot;
Delta State University Poli@@ ti@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that universal staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that he &apos;s made a pending call for the end of that day .
until the end of the day there was another death : lam@@ b took the life as the police made him boiler .
&quot; a day after the shooting at the university , the students and lec@@ tur@@ ers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get an idea of what &apos;s motivated . &quot;
&quot; the details published by the transm@@ issions on both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees , who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teachers . &quot;
students said they were happy about their lessons .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ s@@ s died , he did not have any story of violence or a criminal history . &quot;
&quot; he mentioned a written book in one of his books in which he mentioned the &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; , &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both debates in the Department of Social Scien@@ ces@@ ages and History , whose teachers , 17 members comprises , and many students visited courses of both . &quot;
at the same time there were some incl@@ inations to problematic behavi@@ ors .
&quot; a student , Bran@@ don Be@@ avers , he &apos;s represented , he also seemed a little excited and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that Lamb had told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
he &apos;s previously the Delta State University to be asked for health reasons for health reasons and said that it may have any health problem .
this year he established only two online courses .
recent changes in the employment policy of the university meant that the Promotion for which he &apos;s hard work hard for him would represent no guarantee of an automatic route to a reference as an Assistant Professor .
&quot; Universal President William La@@ For@@ ge said , he wis@@ s nothing about a conflict between he &apos;s and Schmidt but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs performance . &quot;
these are questions that he &apos;s best did not answer any more .
after the flight from campus took the police later Lam@@ bs Le@@ ave when he returns to the Mississi@@ ppi of Ark@@ ans@@ as .
&quot; before he could be arrested , he slept with a .@@ 38 pot@@ ent pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house approximately a mile south of his parent house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ on@@ meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car was still going on .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why Lamb about this house was , but Johnson said that he knew that he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
he &apos;s represented in the area .
&quot; he represented his work at the University of which , with 3,@@ 500 students in a city with approximately 12.@@ 000 inhabitants , and he established Ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y . &quot;
he gradu@@ ated in spring in ped@@ agog@@ y .
&quot; one of the many years of friends from Lam@@ bs filed him as intelligent , char@@ ism@@ atic and funny . &quot;
Carla H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lam@@ b was 20 when they met through joint friends .
&quot; and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool older guy who tried a couple of years to teach them the guitar lu@@ de . &quot;
he was at that time the women &apos;s warm .
&quot; all girls mel@@ ted then when he was there , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson city center of Bran@@ don . &quot;
he &apos;s represented and Pr@@ enti@@ s@@ s were obviously some time together .
&quot; in the call &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; I have killed my wife , but there was no idea of a marriage . &quot;
they had a dog called Light@@ ning who lived with them in the brick @-@ house that is adjacent to a ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; former husband of Pr@@ enti@@ s@@ s , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said , they were fifteen years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who now was 19 years old . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed at the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely the best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , he never met he , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that he &apos;s interested in music and playing blues . &quot;
he &apos;s represented by Pr@@ enti@@ s@@ s when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail started three years ago both on a summer market .
later they played together one way or another .
o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said to write his daughter and sing her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ s@@ s was a nur@@ se that worked for various companies online .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a Bar@@ ke@@ eper and sometimes Cap@@ es Co@@ ordin@@ ator at The Jul@@ ep Room , a weak lighted bar near Gau@@ tier , said he he &apos;s represented gu@@ itar@@ ist and m@@ outh@@ ful M@@ ood in the night before a fun audience . &quot;
there was no sign that something was not voted .
&quot; simply just a lucky pair , &quot; he said . &quot;
we were on cleaning and j@@ oked with another .
&quot; I mean , they both had a good sense of j@@ okes . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt , the dead post , managed the first semester seminar and specialised in American citizens and colonial history , said Don All@@ an Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at school . &quot;

Michael J. Fox scher@@ ses about his &quot; date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a big moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we were in the theater waiting for the Roy@@ als , and I mer@@ ke that the seat beside me is empty , and it will gradually become clear that Princess Diana is next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
&quot; the film opens , and it comes to me in mind that I am a sim@@ ulated m@@ owing and an arm length of it , to be with the prin@@ c@@ ess of Wales at a date . &quot;

UN boss says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; Secretary General B@@ an K@@ i @-@ Moon says to its response to Russia &apos;s reinforced military support for Syria : &quot; &quot; there is no military solution &quot; &quot; almost five years of continuous conflict , and more weapons will wor@@ sen violence and mis@@ ery for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN boss once again calls all parties , including the shared UN Security Council to unite , combine and integr@@ ative negotiations on finding a political solution . &quot;
&quot; B@@ an said a press conference held on Wednesday that he plans , the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - United States , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the edge of the Ministers Meeting of the General Assembly , to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
he depl@@ or@@ ated that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the Regional Government can make this situation un@@ solv@@ able .
&quot; B@@ an ur@@ ged the five standing members to show solidarity and unity in addressing the crisis in Syria , which have proved to be proved with Iran &apos;s success . &quot;
8 Re@@ fl@@ age@@ able that demonstrate that Donald Tru@@ mp is serious .
some have tried to make him as a flop to fire brands .
others have taken him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
&quot; however , as some re@@ public@@ ans try to drag Donald Tru@@ mp from the top R@@ ays to surveys , it has ( yet ) does not work . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys presented Donald Tru@@ mp in a two @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of the real estate asset . &quot;
of course it is too early in the election period .
none claims that Tru@@ mp will probably gain the re@@ publi@@ can nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts emphas@@ ise that at this time in 2011 R@@ ick Per@@ r@@ ys leadership has been given to the rising Herman C@@ ain , by which nobody has won only one state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he could fight in a general election .
&quot; but outside groups , such as j@@ eb Bush &apos;s Super P@@ AC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognise Tru@@ m@@ ps Flow assets and begin to let their dollars flow , in order to plunge it . &quot;
here are some of the current trends that suggest that the Real @-@ Mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
Tru@@ m@@ ps Bel@@ i@@ eb@@ th@@ nesses have turned around 180 degrees .
&quot; shortly before Donald Tru@@ mp its can@@ did@@ acy middle June announced , a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University showed that only two of ten Republi@@ can viewed the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l positive . &quot;
by the middle of July it was 40 percent .
in the beginning of August there were 52 percent .
&quot; now , six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tru@@ mp . &quot;
about three of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these numbers are in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa claimed last week that 60 percent of the re@@ public@@ ans have a good opinion of Tru@@ mp .
two @-@ thirds of the GO@@ P @-@ voters GO@@ P would be happy with Tru@@ mp &apos;s candidates .
&quot; in a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the re@@ public@@ ans , they would be either &quot; thrilled &quot; or &quot; satisfied , &quot; if Tru@@ mp was nominated . &quot;
only two of 10 say they would be &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if he would be the candidate .
&quot; only Ben Car@@ son will say about the same enthusiasm as Tru@@ mp ( 43 percent said , they would be &quot; enth@@ r@@ alled &quot; &quot; about 40 percent , who say the same over Tru@@ mp ) . &quot;
the next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand 47 percent of the Republi@@ can voters want it &quot; dis@@ satisfied or &quot; dis@@ pleased &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favour@@ ites of the Est@@ abl@@ ishment , the candidate . &quot;
a majority of re@@ public@@ ans sees Tru@@ m@@ ps temper@@ ament not as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tru@@ mp is widely cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed for his bom@@ bas@@ tic and animated statements , 52 percent of the Irish can@@ did Irish voters want the real temper@@ ament for a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number is considered in the first state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the re@@ public@@ ans think that he has the personality for a Ober@@ be@@ inf@@ ant , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac &apos;s last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , 44 percent think he did not have the personality to effectively perform his office , and almost six out of 10 Independent Democracy , that his temper@@ ament did not pas@@ se to the White House , ABC / Post . &quot;
re@@ publi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
&quot; when they put their funds , keep re@@ publi@@ can voters Tru@@ mp for real . &quot;
&quot; if they are asked , who is most likely to win the GO@@ P @-@ nom@@ ination , say according to a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C the last week four out of ten that Tru@@ mp is the best bet . &quot;
this is a change since time when four out of ten had been translated their money to J@@ eb Bush .
complete publication : GO@@ P @-@ voters had not the clear cryst@@ all@@ ball in the past .
&quot; at this time in the last cycle , four out of ten re@@ public@@ ans that R@@ ick Perry would win nom@@ ination with only 28 % for the final candidates Rom@@ ney . &quot;
nevertheless that a large number of GO@@ P @-@ voters will see a pl@@ au@@ sible campaign as a pl@@ au@@ sible .
&quot; even if the re@@ public@@ ans hit another candidates , Tru@@ mp is about everybody . &quot;
&quot; some experts suggest that the sh@@ atter@@ ing field probably contribute to Tru@@ m@@ ps leadership , while the anti @-@ Tru@@ mp support is distributed on more than a dozen other candidate diff@@ use . &quot;
&quot; but a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ in @-@ head race between Tru@@ mp and most other re@@ publi@@ can candidates , Tru@@ mp &apos;s support . &quot;
&quot; he brought before Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , recently Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before edge Paul , John Ka@@ Himself and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it is a head @-@ an @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only cont@@ est@@ ant who proposes it ?
Ben Car@@ son would transfer the entrepreneurs with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tru@@ mp &apos;s fans says that they have made their minds .
&quot; a new survey of CB@@ S / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters , the Tru@@ mp can support , say they have awarded their voices . &quot;
&quot; of course , a lot of things can happen to change this , and no one can truly say the opinion . &quot;
&quot; 46 percent said they leave the door open , in order to switch to other candidates . &quot;
&quot; yet , Tru@@ m@@ ps is strongest competitors at the moment of the other out@@ si@@ der , the neuro@@ sur@@ geon Ben Car@@ son , but voters , they say that they have formed their minds are twice as often for Tru@@ mp . &quot;
six of 10 Republi@@ can say that it coinci@@ de with Tru@@ mp at immigration .
&quot; since Donald Tru@@ mp in its election campaign was called after two months immigrants from Mexico &quot; &quot; rap@@ ed &quot; , &quot; was Em@@ ig@@ ration and fishing trip in public discour@@ se . &quot;
some are worried that the bom@@ bas@@ tic ext@@ ents of Tru@@ mp crucial H@@ isp@@ ano Americans will keep away from the Republi@@ can Party and damage the re@@ lie@@ ve efforts .
&quot; but following the new ABC / Post @-@ survey from Monday say six of 10 Republi@@ cans , that they must coinci@@ de with Tru@@ mp in questions of immigration . &quot;
&quot; so long as the immigration in the spot@@ light remains , it will do the Donald Tru@@ mp . &quot;
the fru@@ stration over the government clim@@ bed on new high@@ ways .
&quot; at Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son , now around half of the support of re@@ publi@@ can constitu@@ ents , especially by their out@@ si@@ der status . &quot;
&quot; six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political boom than someone with drive experience . &quot;
and they are also angry on Washington .
&quot; a survey of D@@ es Mo@@ ines Register / Bloom@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa re@@ public@@ ans about the re@@ public@@ ans in Congress are frustr@@ ated , with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 per cent . &quot;
&quot; Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co. : the five most exclusive residential homes in Germany &quot;
here in the Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg there is the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the North@@ lake .
&quot; in the street , a square meters of a roof@@ ed house in the cut is 7@@ 3.@@ 300 euros . &quot;
&quot; in Sy@@ lt the range of objects is limited , so it is in the study - therefore the high price . &quot;
a new study reveals where special layers is one square meter most cost .
&quot; of course , 18.@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student booking in Munich are not really short . &quot;
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top location there is one of the price however as Pe@@ o@@ ts .

Champions League : Bavaria dream start thanks to Müller and G@@ ötz@@ e
two @-@ professional sc@@ orer in Pir@@ ro : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller took a course .
a lucky hand by Thomas Müller paved the FC Bayern on the way to a deser@@ ved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ak@@ os Pir@@ ro - then it ran .
a sover@@ eign opening of the Champions League @-@ season .
the World Champion Thomas Müller and Mario G@@ ötz@@ e have taken a dream start to the FC Bayern in Hex@@ enk@@ ke of Piraeus to a dream start into the &quot; mission Milan . &quot;
the team of Trainer PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola won her post@@ lu@@ de in the Champions League for the Greek record player thanks to Müll@@ ers double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and G@@ ötz@@ es hits ( 8@@ 9 ) earned with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ f@@ th start of start success in series will be the first step towards the finale on 28 May 2016 in Italy where guar@@ ola can finally take the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t after Munich .
Müller took his gig in the Champions League for Bavaria &apos;s management for the help of the Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto who made one as a f@@ lange of the world &apos;s bu@@ gg@@ ers .
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , Bavaria had promised Bav@@ arian captain Philipp l@@ ah@@ m before the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ ak@@ ak@@ is stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 blessed fans - and the Mün@@ ch@@ ner kept the word . &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated performance without a sh@@ iny .
&quot; Pir@@ ro had won his most recent six home @-@ games in the royal class , including fighting club clubs like Manchester United , At@@ lé@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
2011 I stum@@ bled here also Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
&quot; but Bavaria , in seven Europe @-@ up @-@ du@@ els had un@@ defe@@ ated with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim . &quot;
&quot; they went mu@@ stered , with their off@@ ending efforts but often to be einf@@ all about works . &quot;
the attacks are used too often by sc@@ rolling on left @-@ sau@@ ces Dou@@ glas Costa afterwards which rarely came through against the former Br@@ itt@@ oral Om@@ ar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
&quot; Müller had no more luck , when his F@@ lange struck back from the right half @-@ board in the upper left eye . &quot;
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
&quot; first , at first , at the ol@@ act @-@ stor@@ ms ide@@ ye Brown the head sc@@ ball of Poland , proposed by the line ( 26 . ) . &quot;
&quot; then by direct delivery , the go@@ alie were Roberto with the k@@ nee par@@ ated ( 35@@ . ) . &quot;
&quot; although the Bavaria was used to domin@@ ating the game , Piraeus could place Piraeus . &quot;
on Tor@@ ist@@ ers Manuel new@@ er was Lost .
so about when he found a shot of Ide@@ ye by the lat@@ te l@@ enk@@ te ( 5@@ 6. ) .
&quot; before he had guar@@ dians of a quarter to defend with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who made it well . &quot;
Mario G@@ ötz@@ e , after mus@@ cular problems back in the c@@ ader , was sitting outside . &quot;
&quot; the World Cup hero have only given green light after the final dining light , said Sport@@ pres@@ et Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; who wants to do something else , this is still good . &quot;
&quot; at the first change , Guardi@@ ola against him was decided against him as he K@@ ings@@ ley Com@@ an for the prevailing Lew@@ and@@ owski . ( 5@@ 9th ) . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ötz@@ en came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( 7@@ Six@@ th ) and made 13 minutes later everything clear , by El@@ f@@ meter put Müller still a dr@@ on . &quot;
before the game it was in the stadium to Kra@@ w@@ als .
&quot; after a smaller group of spar@@ ed Bavaria fans in their audience block evi@@ dently the supporters of hosts pir@@ ate with words and gest@@ ures had prov@@ oked , handles the security forces and went with stroke against the coin @-@ trailers . &quot;
at least a Bavaria fan was wo@@ unded from the stadium .
&quot; who harsh , has a higher risk of losing teeth &quot;
&quot; who ro@@ g@@ out , give it not only the l@@ ungs , but also the teeth - this places a Potsdam long @-@ term study . &quot;
the good news : the risk is reducing the risk rapidly .
smo@@ kers have a significantly higher risk to lose their teeth early .
&quot; this is out of the long@@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Food Science ( DI@@ F@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; compared to non @-@ smo@@ ker , smo@@ kers was the risk to losing their teeth early in order to with@@ stand the 2.5 - 3,@@ 6 @-@ fold higher . &quot;
the scientists had observed more than 23@@ 300 participants .
&quot; causes for tooth loss are car@@ ies and infl@@ amm@@ ation of the tooth , stresses the DI@@ E . &quot;
for this par@@ od@@ on@@ ti@@ tis smoking a risk factor , stress the authors . &quot;
the connection between smoking and tooth loss therefore go to frequent g@@ um infl@@ amm@@ ation of smo@@ kers .
&quot; not be clari@@ fied , to wi@@ ew@@ age smoking also increases the risk for tooth decay . &quot;
&quot; people who quit smoking , however , could reduce their risk but within a short time , the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
&quot; it can however be over ten years until the endanger@@ ment will be back to the level of non @-@ smo@@ kers , &quot; author @-@ author Thomas Diet@@ rich from the English University Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; you must convince people that are non @-@ smoking , the teacher leader &apos; Le@@ an Boeing from the DI@@ E : &quot; smoking short@@ ens the life time . &quot;
not smoking is good for l@@ ungs and vessels and according to our findings also leads to good dental health to high age .
&quot; in Germany over 20 per cent of the population aged 65 to 74 were affected by dental car@@ el@@ ess@@ ness , I shared the DI@@ E . &quot;
previous studies have already pointed out that smoking is the risk of early dental failure .
the new long @-@ term study support the findings .

European Commission proposes a new court on TTIP
&quot; to the shar@@ pen@@ ing of the dispute regarding the planned Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Free Trade Agreement TTIP , the EU Commission has proposed an extensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot;
the contro@@ versi@@ al private arbit@@ ration institutions of disputes between corporations and states should therefore be eliminated through a transparent system that performs significantly more traditional dishes in the mode of operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that the citizens d@@ ull , &quot; said the relevant EU Commissioner Cec@@ ilia Malm@@ strö@@ m during the performance . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ wed@@ di states adopted the proposal as a European negotiating positions in the free trade agreement with the US . &quot;
the German Government announced support .
TTIP aims to create the largest free @-@ trade area in the world with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for reform of the current shift comm@@ issions take place in particular , that the EU states and the US have jointly select independent judges for a new Federal Court of Investment . &quot;
&quot; they should come to equal parts from the EU , the U.S. and third countries . &quot;

&quot; it would allow , to stand up against jud@@ g@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; so far , the procedures involved themselves meet with each other to arbit@@ rat@@ ors , an obj@@ ection to their jud@@ g@@ ments did not exist . &quot;
&quot; in the discussion of the past months , it has become clear that citizens of the Old IS@@ DS system in terms of fairness and justice does not trust , commented Malm@@ strö@@ m . &quot;
&quot; in the long term , it wants to work on an international Investment Court in the long run . &quot;
&quot; there , for example , if any dispute between Chinese companies and EU states might be clari@@ fied . &quot;
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration mainly required by large corporations ( IS@@ DS ) are considered one of the main reasons for the big resistance in Europe against the TTIP .

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns Deb@@ ut at the Ques@@ tions of the Prime Minister
since his election Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Deb@@ ut is expected at the questionn@@ aire of the Prime Minister with tension
the new Labour Party Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n is supposed to give his debut at the Prime Minister of the Prime Minister for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to put the first and foremost questions shortly after noon when his performance is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour Party .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more figures &quot; at this weekly event .
he has also said that he would skip a few sessions to give her colleagues .
&quot; the encounter will be the first parliamentary scrut@@ iny for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns , as she goes after his appointment as a member of the Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ in@@ etts and after his speech at the TU@@ C @-@ Annual Meeting on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the decision of the Labour Chairman , on Tuesday during the singing of the national anth@@ ems at a memorial to the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , is at the center of several ti@@ ory stories in the newspapers . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns decision to sing not the national hy@@ m@@ ne has drawn attention to itself
a spokes@@ person by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he could have stood in a respect@@ ful silence and he accepted the &quot; hero@@ ic battle of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of the British Battle of England .
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two new@@ night programme , he turned out to the Labour Presidency , to sing the national anth@@ ems , &quot; regardless &quot; by his faith that the mon@@ archy was abol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; nearly a dozen of shadows @-@ ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns top leadership , and they are called to differences in the economy , defense and foreign policy , while less than a six @-@ party of the Par@@ li@@ ament@@ ary party had originally supported him as a leader . &quot;
the police correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin bran@@ t says that political differences can also be implemented within the Labour Party and in the Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Committee to the European Union and the limitation on winnings .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C Conference that Labour made a change to remove the whole idea of a limitation altogether .
&quot; hours later Mr Smith , the shadow of labour and pensions , that the party is &quot; very clear &quot; &quot; that they can only be reduced to the government plans to reduce the limit of 26.@@ 000 £ to 23@@ ,000 £ . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour chairman that David Cameron since he is T@@ ory &apos;s chief of the last decade over the D@@ isp@@ atch card in parliament in the last decade .
&quot; the Labour Party , which promised a socialist stand@@ point , says that he has given &quot; &quot; crow@@ d @-@ s@@ our@@ ced &quot; &quot; ideas for questions to Mr. Cameron and gave him more than 30.000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; Isl@@ ington North MP has said that the questionn@@ aire of the Prime Minister is to be con@@ stituted ; and that he will be under@@ lined by &quot; &quot; percussion &quot; &quot; and the dispute with the h@@ ooks to focus on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and challenges for young people . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said Mr Cor@@ by@@ n that Angela Eagle stands for him who does not share it - for example when Mr. Cameron is travelling abroad .
&quot; he has also brought the idea to talking to other colleagues occasionally said the word , and that he said John Ber@@ isha , the speakers of the sub@@ structure , to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; as he has been leader in 2005 he said Mr Cameron that he w@@ ool himself from politics in the style of &quot; &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le Theater &quot; , &quot; which is often linked to the questionn@@ aire of the Prime Minister . but a few years later he cle@@ ared some years later he failed . &quot;
&quot; since they have been sent to television first in 1990 , the inquiry was presented with the Prime Minister as the most important bar@@ ometer of the state of a leader and his leadership in the Lower House and his position under his parliament@@ arians , although critics were argu@@ ed , they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and thanks to far @-@ reaching reforms . &quot;

percentage increases by accelerated pay@@ growth in the United Kingdom
&quot; the pound stepp@@ ed up @-@ off according to the data , which show an increase in the UK &apos;s pay@@ roll . parallel to this , the F@@ T@@ SE 100 was increased by the cer@@ ot of SA@@ BM@@ iller . &quot;
between May and July the result grew by no bonuses in the United Kingdom by 2.8 % compared to the same previous year period .
this percent@@ ages had been the quick@@ est since 2009 and raised the revenue of an interest increase upon the time of an interest .
&quot; the pound rose by more than 1 % compared to the dollar to $ 1,@@ 55@@ 05 and was climb up to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the euro to 1,@@ 37@@ 30 € climb . &quot;
the F@@ T@@ SE 100 Index closed with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % on 6.@@ 2@@ 29,@@ 21 .
&quot; SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share on the market and made a leap from 20 % , after the acquisition of the Riv@@ alen AB In@@ Be@@ v . &quot;
&quot; one transaction would combine the two largest brewer@@ ies of the world and brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch . &quot;
Bur@@ berry shares were based on encouraging messages from the competition Group for luxury and Rich@@ em@@ ont 0.@@ 9 % higher .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts recent sales figure suggest all expectations and also demonstrated that the turnover in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - continued growth .
&quot; shares of Glen@@ core rose by 5 % , after the stron@@ gh@@ old that he has been reduced by a share of 2.5 billion by a share bu@@ y@@ ale as part of its strategy for debt cancellation . &quot;
&quot; the stocks of the packaging and paper jew@@ ns Mon@@ di were the largest los@@ ers in the index , and indeed with a decrease in 4.8 % , after gold the Sach@@ s have put his estimate for the rating of &quot; &quot; rating &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; J@@ D Sports rose by 3,@@ 1 % , after the sport holding company had reported for the first half a pre @-@ tax result of 46@@ ,@@ 6 million . &quot;
the boss of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed the expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK employees &quot; would mean more buying in the po@@ ckets of the potential customers .
&quot; but it is unlikely that this merch@@ ant will counter@@ balance the higher labour costs in his company , he says . &quot;
&quot; the costs might meet the expansion of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean there are fewer additional jobs . &quot;

Met@@ cash starts clearance campaign for operation by Al@@ di@@ - W@@ aste
Met@@ cash tries to protect the Ig@@ A @-@ Fili@@ alen in front of a Al@@ di @-@ Att@@ mar@@ sch in South Australia and Western Australia .
food @-@ wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has started a ground @-@ duty campaign to defend the market share of Ig@@ A @-@ retail@@ er in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of some 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; during Al@@ di the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia was prepared early next year , met@@ cash and Ig@@ A @-@ Super@@ markets strengthen their relations with local food suppliers and build the brand Ig@@ A through Ma@@ instream @-@ Marketing and Marketing about Social Media on , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show . &quot;
&quot; Ig@@ A @-@ merchants and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice @-@ manufacturers S@@ immo from D@@ uns@@ borough , who distri@@ butes in Ig@@ A @-@ shops samples and shop owners , the affiliated tickets for the South Australian soccer league of loyal customers . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Met@@ cash released further details of his defence strategy on 29 September , if the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and devices leads to its annual investors &quot; strategy . &quot;
&quot; it stands a lot on the game , since South Australia and Western Australia almost 30 percent of Met@@ cas@@ hs Ig@@ A @-@ store commercial , and higher profits as a met@@ cas@@ hs Ig@@ A @-@ network in the Eastern states . &quot;
&quot; Le@@ ad in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ or@@ ic provincial and Ig@@ A @-@ retail@@ er provide a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia , compared to about 14 percent in Western countries . &quot;
&quot; however , analy@@ st like Morgan Stan@@ ley , that Al@@ di twelve months after opening its first markets around five percent of the food market will cut away from these two states and will take all available players , but mainly independent retail@@ er sales . &quot;
&quot; according to a report published in this week , the Analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley , that Ig@@ A @-@ retail@@ er 360 $ million annual sales per year and Met@@ cash 250 million will lose the end of 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this progn@@ osis rests upon the assumption that Al@@ di opened to 25 branches in SA and 30 in W@@ A , and generates sales of 500 million US $ and 600 million in each market . &quot;
loss in food and grocery store and at the amounts to Met@@ cas@@ hs high fixed base could cost CHF 13 million $ profit before interest and taxes , said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Met@@ cash market shares in the Eastern states , mainly on al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan found that Ig@@ A @-@ shop@@ pers are the most established . &quot;
Morgan Stan@@ ley adop@@ ts that Met@@ ah@@ hs sales in food and grocery store by 3.7 percent in 2017 and 2.@@ 1 percent in 2018 continues to reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.1 percent in 2015 .
&quot; last week told the leading fund managers Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , at a business dinner in Melbourne , that Met@@ cash probably will disappear inside a decade . &quot;
Met@@ cash up@@ ted to respond publicly to the comments by Mr Dou@@ glass .
&quot; however , it is assumed that a member of Met@@ cash has received Mr Dou@@ glass last week . &quot;
&quot; IG@@ As market share has declined from 18 percent to 14 percent , and income from Met@@ ah@@ hs food and food trading , the approximately 1.@@ 200 Ig@@ A @-@ retail@@ er since 2012 has fallen by 43 percent , resulting from operative debt relief with simultaneous pressure on revenues and mar@@ gins . &quot;
&quot; however , the wholes@@ aler wants and inv@@ ests more than 150 million euros to provide sales prices with col@@ es and week@@ days at hundreds of products every week and Ig@@ A @-@ retailers in improving their stores by faster growing food@@ stuff , and to deliver a better choice of private @-@ label foods . &quot;
&quot; Met@@ cas@@ hs &apos;s main business leader Ian Mor@@ rice says that the prizes will be set up and rechar@@ ging programs to Elan , and hopes that the big retailers in 2017 will return for the first time in four years to swe@@ ep growth . &quot;
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian tennis association Steve Heal@@ y
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves more praise than criticism for its behaviour .
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the recent collabor@@ ators around his friend N@@ ick K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os and deserves as a review of the president of the Australian tennis association Steve Heal@@ y rather praise a criticism for its own behaviour .
&quot; co@@ kin@@ ach@@ is , the younger of the talented du@@ os , which is always referred to as a Special K@@ s , came to the spot@@ ted discussion of K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters in the spot@@ light . &quot;
&quot; in a fier@@ y qualification game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon after , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent to be separated twice by the arbit@@ rat@@ ors : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have to beat K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os , and I should strike the child . &quot;
&quot; while he was last seen how he sm@@ ote a tennis r@@ acqu@@ et , after a cr@@ amp@@ ed had an potential US Open @-@ victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , co@@ co was defended by Heal@@ y stand . &quot;
&quot; the Teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , in competition with Sam Gr@@ oth around the second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup of the United Kingdom . &quot;
&quot; one thing about which I have noticed quite funny , is the fact that after my view Than@@ asi has drawn little in the dispute , &quot; said Heal@@ y . &quot;
&quot; he has broken a bat , as he lost because of a fight against the US Open , but he is not the first player who broke its pl@@ edge from Fr@@ ust with himself , and I know Than@@ i good enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he beha@@ ves in the US Open extremely well , even among the pretty pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he earned a lot of recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I believe that he was treated a little too strictly . &quot;
&quot; he is a very ripe 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he never fits into the team and so on , he has never been a problem with the other players , he is well trained in the dressing area , he is well kept in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; Heal@@ y also supported the decision , K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os which did not take into account the most important decisions that starts on Friday and he describes the &quot; common decision , &quot; as the right one for all , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term solid element into the team . &quot;
&quot; first we wish the team is fully focused on competition and not all the contro@@ vers@@ aries around &#91; K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os &#93; , &quot; said Heal@@ y . &quot;
&quot; and I think that N@@ ick has done very fast to Ascension , what he has made him in the eyes of the public , and he deserves all the criticism that he can get in . some time outside the spot@@ light , in which he can only think about what I think is appropriate , and it is best for the team and it &apos;s best for him . &quot;
&quot; European refuge@@ e crisis : Hungary explains emergency , closes the border , stops refugees back &quot;
&quot; Hungary explains the emergency , and turned the border with Serbia on Tuesday and lasted all who attemp@@ ted to come illeg@@ ally into the country . everything with the goal to stop the influ@@ x of migrants . &quot;
&quot; chaos followed on the border , as hundreds of migrants found themselves in a ni@@ land of Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and Serbian officials with rebel@@ lion . &quot;
&quot; people who have flow@@ n before violence , hidden for an un@@ familiar time in a land stri@@ pes on the road between the two audit@@ points of the countries and established tents , and settled them down there . &quot;
but frustr@@ ations !
&quot; as a police helic@@ opter above them moved , &quot; &quot; the migrants &quot; &quot; open the border ! &quot; and sm@@ elled rewards against the Hungarian government police . &quot;
some meadows from protest foods and water returned .
&quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister explained that there would be &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be back , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not to harm any coll@@ ater@@ al damage .
&quot; in the coming days talks with Brussels and other countries , I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic said in Prague . &quot;
&quot; the tur@@ mo@@ il in the hung@@ arian @-@ Serbian border came a day after the 28 @-@ Nations meeting at a strict meeting in Brussels , no joint immigration policy . &quot;
&quot; the ministers agreed , however , to share responsibility for 4@@ 0,000 people who were scrut@@ in@@ ated in the out@@ law@@ ed Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that after last month or until the end of the year - an agreement would be further 120@@ .000 refugees , including some from Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on Tuesday a special summit in the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; Hungary , however , was not expecting his hopes for an extended action from Brussels or his neighbours . &quot;
&quot; the Not@@ ice on Tuesday said in two southern regions , authorities gave more powers to get out of the crisis , so they could st@@ un@@ locking the streets and asylum procedures . &quot;
&quot; the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said , that his country plane has to stop the construction of an ech@@ ino@@ wi@@ rel@@ essly at its border to Romania , to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after it has ended a fence at the Serbian border . &quot;
CB@@ S News @-@ Cor@@ dent Charlie d &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even pris@@ ons in the race against the thor@@ n @-@ wire fence between Hungary and Serbia were installed .
&quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a significant Turkish immigrants from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and became an important bott@@ len@@ eck for the European Union . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban had insi@@ sted that most of the people who are looking for a better life are looking for a better life , and not a war bre@@ eds , who are eligible for protection - a view that is strongly contrary to other EU states , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws created by midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the dam@@ aging of 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high Za@@ uns having built the government along the southern border with Serbia , to a crime . these laws also place higher pen@@ alties for the condemned human vend@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation that has been created by the mass immigration , the Hungarian government explains the state of state , &quot; said governmental voice Z@@ olt@@ an K@@ ov@@ acs re@@ porters in the southern town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must coordinate with the use of the military yet , which is expected for next week , but Re@@ porter of Associ@@ ated Press have seen at the border hard by armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs already on day . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ org@@ y Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advisor to Or@@ ban , said that public authorities 45 people trying to cross the border to cross the border , 15 others were already deeply into the country . &quot;
&quot; they come down by damaged the fence , they are now in police force , and will acc@@ used the desire of criminal off@@ ences under the new laws . &quot;
authorities are to repair the fence quickly .
&quot; Hungarian be@@ ati@@ te opened on Tuesday morning also two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia , after a draw@@ bar with ech@@ ino@@ der@@ wire , to close the borders . &quot;
&quot; chaos re@@ en@@ forced the most important crossing @-@ crossing close to Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians joined a small office in a metal container to manipul@@ ate the data of people and op@@ ed a crowd to get into it . &quot;
&quot; some 20 managed to enter , but thousands remained outside . &quot;
another group of migrants blocked the most important motorway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they are traveling to Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clin@@ tons &apos;s head start before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in a national survey
&quot; the former Secretary of State Hill@@ ary Clinton still maintains a two @-@ digit lead in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at the national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders will win her opposite the ground . &quot;
&quot; Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of democratic voters with the elections ( 58 per cent previously ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( rise by 17 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; Vice President D@@ Bi@@ den , who has not yet proclaimed whether he is not responsible for the presidential office , receives support of 15 percent of democratic voters . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the start of the elections , most democratic voters are saying that it is too early to tell that their opinion is firm what candidates will support . &quot;
but Clin@@ tons supporters are in their choice more consistent than that of the other candidates .
&quot; since the CB@@ S @-@ News @-@ survey , Clinton had lost in a series of demo@@ graphic groups while S@@ anders put some profits . &quot;
&quot; Clinton keeps a big advantage for both women and moder@@ ates , but these proj@@ ections have dimin@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; their support in the men is clearly lower , and so it is only possible with 5 points here . &quot;
&quot; Clin@@ tons &apos;s advantage with democratic constitu@@ ents of the 50 years has pushed forward , and they are now at the same level . &quot;
but Clinton had a big advantage with the older voters .
&quot; last month Clinton had been at the Liber@@ als last month , but now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group . &quot;
&quot; about half of the democratic voters of the elections , they say that they would support Clinton , if she would be nominated by the Party . &quot;
a quarter would support them with some precaution and another 15 percent would just assist them because they are the candidate .
six percent would not support them .
maybe not surprising that Clin@@ &apos;s latest supporters are of everything inspired from it .
the views are stronger by those who currently don &apos;t support Clinton - just about a quarter it would love to support them .
&quot; while 48 percent of democratic voters have said , they must support Clinton with enthusiasm , say less re@@ publi@@ can voters do it about their ox@@ enk@@ andi@@ daten . Donald Tru@@ mp ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; when Clin@@ tons supporters in an open question are asked , why they want it is the most common response that she has the correct experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman president is president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
from Clin@@ tons &apos;s supporters this connection to Bill Clinton is also mentioned in their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
consent to dealing with the problems and the constitu@@ bility are being cited .
&quot; since the vice @-@ president e@@ jects an potential for the presidential office , 57 percent of the democratic voters of the elections see him in the race - although one third believes that he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if the democratic voters of the elections were asked , who would be their second choice for the party , is Bi@@ king at the top . &quot;
&quot; from Clin@@ tons followers , more than half that bending would be their second choice far ahead of s@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; decide to vali@@ date the bending , not for the nom@@ ination of the democr@@ ats , the Hill@@ ary Clin@@ tons starts against S@@ anders , of 20 points with bending to 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election , but this figure has dropped from 78 percent last month . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second part of this measurement , but the percentage that sees him as the &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; has risen . &quot;
&quot; however , on the question of what is more important for a candidate , the vot@@ er voters have questions about the voting . &quot;
&quot; similarly as in the last month , no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters of the elections are considered unacceptable . &quot;
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates make good results with some important characteristics of the elections of a presidential elections .
&quot; maj@@ orities are looking to Clinton , S@@ anders and Bible as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership . &quot;
&quot; bikers in the three candidates are best suited for honest@@ y , while Clin@@ tons &apos;s strength is the leadership . &quot;
&quot; thirty per cent of democratic voters believe not that Clinton is honest and trusted , twice as many say that over S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not have the idea of him . &quot;
&quot; democratic voters of the presidential elections in general , Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ ec@@ ologi@@ c in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; with all these measurements , approximately one quarter of the democratic voters gave no opinion of s@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; as questions regarding Hill@@ ary Clin@@ tons use a personal email address and a server during the term as a Foreign Minister , most of the Democratic voters are pleased with their explanation of the matter and say that there has not been affected by their opinion . &quot;
but it is a different story in the American public .
half of the Americans are dis@@ satisfied with their declaration while only one third is satisfied .
&quot; so public opinion was in March , shortly after the problem came to light , split . &quot;
&quot; most Americans spoke that the e @-@ mail contro@@ vers@@ y had no effect on their overall opinion of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their minds had deteri@@ or@@ ated from her even worse . &quot;
&quot; they are mainly re@@ public@@ ans , more than six of 10 which are saying that their views of Clinton have become worse . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is considered to be honest and trust@@ worthy , this continues to be a problem for them under registered constitu@@ ents : just 32 percent do they look as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May . &quot;
62 % of those eligible voters do not consider a honest and trusted person .
at the same time 55 percent of voting rights have seen as far as tru@@ mp and not trust@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tru@@ mp get good notes on the leadership .
&quot; of the six tested candidates , tri@@ via , Car@@ son and Bush at the best in honest@@ y . &quot;
&quot; a majority look rather than honestly , but as at Car@@ son do not have any opinion about him . &quot;
the fault rate for the sample of the head@@ gear of the upper elections with the elections is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves at land@@ a survey close to Donald Tru@@ mp
Ben Car@@ son is situated in the latest pol@@ l of CB@@ S News / New York Times close behind Donald Tru@@ mp
&quot; in the meantime , half of the voters of voters in the new survey runs dramatically and another dramatic increase in grip . &quot;
&quot; re@@ publi@@ can voters support nationwide Tru@@ mp in large numbers . the support grows by 23 % in the last CB@@ S survey , which was done before Fox News debate over the past month , around 27 % in the survey conducted by Tuesday . &quot;
but car@@ son has a total length of 6 % to 23 % .
the survey was conducted with demo@@ graphic groups well arrives and Tru@@ mp among re@@ publi@@ can voting with higher education .
&quot; the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio Govern@@ or John Ka@@ vers@@ neur Scott Walker , which is the deep@@ est , and from 10 % support last month to date 2 % . &quot;
the former Florida @-@ Govern@@ or J@@ eb Bush , the former Govern@@ or of Ark@@ ans@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida @-@ Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio are located at 6 % on the third place . &quot;
the error rate in the sample @-@ sample of 3@@ 76 individuals from Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or minus 6 % and was conducted in September .
&quot; the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , which was published last week shows that Car@@ son increase in surveys - he ends at 19 % support among the Republi@@ cans , behind the Tru@@ mp with 32 % support . &quot;
the latest survey from ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tru@@ mp clear before Car@@ son .
&quot; with a view of one in the last week rising Car@@ son found Tru@@ mp some aspect points for the former neuro@@ sur@@ geon , even after Car@@ son , blame , Tru@@ m@@ ps faith in question . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tru@@ mp the last Saturday during a campaign show in I@@ owa . &quot;

five members of the Br@@ other@@ hood with the death of a Bar@@ uch College @-@ Neul@@ ing de@@ ed
&quot; almost two years , after a student is dying during a student statement in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , de@@ pu@@ n for up to five persons . &quot;
&quot; members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ PS@@ I @-@ Br@@ other@@ hood Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduction ritual , in September 2013 brutal and consumed his transfer to hospital , which has contributed to his death , distributed the police with it . &quot;
&quot; officials told , he was posted with connected eyes with a 30 pounds back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly had been attacked , while he tried to approach a frozen field onto a destination . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Den@@ g finally said about head@@ aches , then he fell un@@ conscious . &quot;
&quot; the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ PS@@ I Br@@ other@@ hood was not the emergency number 911 , after den@@ g power@@ less and wa@@ ited an hour before they brought him into a hospital , thus the police . &quot;
&quot; however , they had time to switch to D@@ eng@@ s clothes , to contact her symptoms and Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Br@@ other@@ hood , to get advice , said Poli@@ sig@@ ef Chris Wagner on a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point , the members of the U@@ ten@@ si@@ ls began to hide and put the well @-@ being of the Br@@ other@@ hood basically over the von Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ sig@@ ef Wagner . &quot;
he could not re@@ vit@@ alized himself and he died the next morning on his wo@@ unds .

&quot; too many families were destroyed by the ban@@ anas of the Br@@ other@@ hood . at least one student dies since 1970 every year on the ban@@ anas , &quot; said Dou@@ glas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ s family , in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; brother and their members must be held to account , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended an indic@@ t@@ ment because of the third gradient of the first five members .
&quot; two @-@ thirty members of the Br@@ other@@ hood , including Mr Men@@ g , are indic@@ ted also because of the religious attacks and the formation of a criminal organization . &quot;
&quot; we not only want to take the involved persons responsible , but if there is an organization that - officially or in@@ officially - this kind , we will also call them accountable &quot; , &quot; said Wagner on a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;

we know what we know .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will take and how long it will hold .
&quot; in particular , the history for the economy offers little instructions on the procedure . &quot;
a recession came within just 11 months after the first rate of interest rate and lasted 86 months .
&quot; the ag@@ gres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when lifting the interest rates is often , if not always , one factor in it , such as the economy and the financial systems react . &quot;
&quot; hence , representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have so fier@@ ce emphasized that investors should not concentrate on when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather on the period that is required for norm@@ alisation . &quot;
in fact several variables play a role .
&quot; at the end , market participants could discover that the whole excitement was probably exagger@@ ated because of a period of inser@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the &quot; endor@@ sed money , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Chief Executive Officer at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at the lowest level to se@@ ism@@ ic shock , which seem to fear many . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that there will be no effect . &quot;
&quot; here , an overview of historical trends based on how some areas of the economy might react : &quot;
&quot; as the market seen in the last month , the anticip@@ ation of the inser@@ tion strikes can make things for a while vol@@ ati@@ le . &quot;
&quot; once the increase is , the influence is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there is apparently a tendency that savings amoun@@ ted to 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which is perhaps re@@ refl@@ ecting the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said German @-@ Bank an@@ alysts in a recent study on what to do as inser@@ tion into the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; more specifically , the market in the past 35 years is mostly in the up@@ lift@@ ment - about 14 percent - on the path to tax evasion , pretty flat in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 per cent , according to a current analysis , the Bob D@@ oll , Chief Operation of Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s published . &quot;
&quot; Deutsche Bank said that the effect on the shares are tended to rise later in the In@@ cre@@ tion cycle , and the return on them will begin to decrease . &quot;
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic activity but as inser@@ ting them often promote it .
in the current case the F@@ ed is confronted with several conditions which did not exist before and which could help a recession .
extremely remarkable is that the gross domestic product is near its lowest score at a inser@@ tion of the F@@ ed .
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , in the 118 bank deposits since 1950 was only twice the nominal GDP under 4.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; although the second quarter of 2015 was at 3,@@ 6 percent , only a few that it will last and expect the third quarter according to specification of the Atlanta F@@ ed just 1.5 percent . &quot;

&quot; the participants have taken the entire year on a cem@@ ented heights of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in this week , which ended on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many str@@ ata and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC could raise an increase in this session , the Fut@@ ures trade is only a chance of 25 percent . &quot;
&quot; in our study all the cre@@ ases of 1950 to the present day in a super cycle with increasing age in GDP has taken place and on @-@ Rec@@ essi@@ on@@ ans were rapidly subjected to the beginning of recovery in the shadows &quot; , &quot; said the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what the worst recession in the observed phase was . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest , which the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this is up to 74 months . &quot;
&quot; the solid income was also vol@@ ati@@ le , since the market is taking a inser@@ tion procedure , and the pattern is quite similar as in the capital market . &quot;
&quot; the main difference is that the action is faster than with shares , if its strategic course changes . &quot;
&quot; at bonds , loans seem to switch the direction as soon as the first increase in the cycle is carried out . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the In@@ cre@@ tion cycle the attacks are immediately abandoned , said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; the Str@@ at@@ egen of Charles Schw@@ ab believe , that the increase in the interest rates will result in the return to move more closer and closer ties , and lead to a lower@@ ing of the curve . &quot;
&quot; consecutive bonds often bring better revenue even in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher y@@ ields , &quot; said K@@ athy Jones , Fix@@ ed @-@ In@@ come @-@ Analy@@ st@@ n in Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; interesting is , &quot; Jones , that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed @-@ Strategy expectations . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations , there are a few signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of more stringent monetary policy . &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the income curve is flat@@ ter , more cl@@ amping have increased and the vol@@ ati@@ lity has risen - all characteristics of the market , when the F@@ ed has intensified its strategy . &quot;
&quot; throughout the whole , companies will un@@ cover the larger part of their operations in the United States , benef@@ iting from it when interest rates are growing and local products are more attractive . &quot;
&quot; multinational companies with high debt will be worse , since an ending of dollars is more expensive on the global market and also financing their debts . &quot;
&quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; quality - &quot; shares ten@@ ds to respond very positively , three months after an initial tick @-@ inser@@ tion , &quot; said Gold &apos;s an@@ alysts in a report to the customers . &quot;
&quot; companies with strong balance sheet have exceeded market balance sheet after each of the grades in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 at the average by 5 percentage points . &quot;
companies with high capital R@@ end@@ its as well as low vol@@ ati@@ lity in its shares also met their counter@@ parts with low quality at an average rate of 4 ( percent@@ ages ) and 3 ( percent@@ ages ) .
debts will become a big problem .
companies with a high proportion of flexible interest will most likely be seen as the Gold man said .
outside of its pure stock market consumers will also profit from the rising dollars .
&quot; austerity could see profits by higher profits , even if experts of different opinion are , how quickly that will take place . &quot;
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM @-@ member tells Par@@ a member of Andrew B@@ ingham
the Conserv@@ ative Member of the Parliament cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed the sender because of his &quot; cover &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly discri@@ min@@ able from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also zi@@ pped at the BBC Music Awards and said she only The Br@@ its im@@ it@@ ted
EP colleague K@@ ien Collin@@ s accessed the show The Voice and said that this was not very original .
&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; conver@@ ts &quot; to Classic FM , maintains a leading parliamentary delay and increases new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does not do anything that the private persons do not do . &quot;
&quot; the Conserv@@ atives of Andrew B@@ ingham also said to the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen , that the publicly legal radio stations &quot; and is increasingly no longer distinguished by its commercial competitors . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I use the word &quot; &quot; stup@@ id &quot; &quot; - but it seems to be turned into Classic FM &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot;
he also refers to the BBC Music Awards that launched in December last year .
&quot; the BBC Music Awards , which started in the past year , The Br@@ its seems to be just under another name . &quot;
&quot; so if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneous examples , where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham . &quot;
&quot; BBC @-@ General Director passed the pre @-@ General and argu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 is way ahead of his commercial competition , when it comes to live music and enlightenment for the public . &quot;
&quot; what I learn from Radio 3 , I will not learn about classical music anywhere . &quot;
and there is a commitment to live music and music@@ als that really is uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; and to give the engagement of Radio 3 to find new music and to give new works in order , I also really think , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey that needs to work harder to get involved when it &apos;s in the past because the British are less informed of classical music . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production , which came under fire during the hearing in the committee for the selection of culture , media and sports under fire , to enter the commercial ri@@ vals on the feet . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ ory S members , Dam@@ ien Collin@@ s took The Voice on - the musical talent show of the BBC , which was purchased by the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa media for the estimated cost of 22 million € . &quot;
&quot; see why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not very distinctive ? &quot;
&quot; Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 @-@ Show - with Pal@@ oma Fa@@ ith and Boy George as a judge , was produced in particular the BBC way . &quot;
&quot; he added , he wishes the company &quot; take a hit from our own w@@ shed , if it star@@ red the next time an entertainment partition . &quot;
&quot; however , they refuse to exclude the order from The Voice of The Voice in the Future or to spend money in Geb@@ en@@ ame for other sub @-@ compatible formats . &quot;
cross @-@ turnover in August on the s@@ sam@@ pled and black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month there was the lowest result since the beginning of the records in 2000 .
online sales increased themselves three years ago by using mobile phones to shop
experts believe that Black Friday in November has stopped its expenses
&quot; for over a decade the virtual shopping basket has b@@ aked , and many of the main shopping streets of Great Britain have turned into Spirit . &quot;
experts say that there are now signs that the online transaction will be stagn@@ ating after new numbers only showed seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
&quot; the total expenditure for August had presented the lowest growth rate in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 , with only five percent increase compared to the previous year . &quot;
experts say that there are signs that online sales are stagn@@ ating after new numbers only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you go back to the growth rates for previous years and go back up to 2000 , then that over time has been developed , &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ RG @-@ sales decline to the Guardian . &quot;
he explained that online sales began three years ago as a buyer starting with their hand purchases .
&quot; it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa . &quot;
&quot; but now it comm@@ utes that , and we may experience that growth is reduced . &quot;
&quot; the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon , which has imported from America is cited as one reason for the po@@ dium turnover . &quot;
experts believe that buyers have their purchases in front of this event which will hold on the last Friday in November .
&quot; last year , five times the average number of buyers for their computers to make their bar@@ gain , and some dealers . &quot;
experts believe that Black Friday where the buyers may be cl@@ ashed around due to bar@@ gain and buyers of it .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium took out that 5 £ expenditure slightly more than 1 buy @-@ online .
some products such as TV and washing machines are now being carried out more than one third of the purchases now on Web @-@ shops .
at the same time more than one quarter of men bu@@ ys clothes and shoes online rather than in the fashion chains in the domestic cities .

&quot; in the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man praised and reveal what caused the overthrow of the crane , which falls into a courtyard of the large mosque , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , that takes place later this month . &quot;

B &amp; Q Bos@@ s says that the time of the cheap European cra@@ ftsmen of Eastern Europe is over
&quot; British increasingly employ arti@@ sans , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry &quot;
the number of skilled crafts in Eastern Europe has rise behind you

&quot; it is claimed that British owners and Br@@ ush in favour of the use of qualified Eastern European cra@@ ftsmen who carry out their works in their home , &quot;
&quot; if you are sent to a hammer or a brush for the increasing number of walls , you belong today to a minority today . &quot;
&quot; British increasingly employ arti@@ sans in order to carry out for do @-@ your@@ sel@@ jobs in their homes , thus the boss of the company behind B &amp; Q . &quot;

Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q @-@ shops because eight out of ten purchase decisions in the store are met by women .
at the moment it outw@@ ei@@ gh the men .
&quot; she said that it is necessary to face the growing demo@@ graphic trends , the more feminine single households will exhibit the more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches .
we need to move this stronger to a balance .
&quot; basically , half of our clients consists of women with 80 percent of decisions regarding the purchase of articles by women . &quot;
women play a big role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry who is one of only five women at the top of a British in the F@@ T@@ SE@@ 100 index listed as well as their top team in order to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions .

Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here .
&quot; it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board , too . &quot;
&quot; King@@ fis@@ her recorded a decrease in the mid @-@ year gain and the turn , after the Group included the cost of the closing of the shops . &quot;

functional functionalities of A@@ ich / DO@@ B because of the In@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in Court
at the National Court Kl@@ agen@@ furt on Wednesday two functions of the Austrian volleyball @-@ Viz@@ em@@ master A@@ ich / DO@@ B has to answer for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and disp@@ ens@@ ations .
the acc@@ used are not guilty .
one of them was also indic@@ ted for am@@ t@@ sm@@ pers .
in May this acc@@ us@@ ation he was acqu@@ itted defini@@ tively in May .
the present process has been ad@@ jour@@ ned .
&quot; according to the prosec@@ ut@@ or Robert Ri@@ der , one had cryst@@ all@@ ised out in the pre @-@ investigations that the Acc@@ used in the years 2006 until 2011 schol@@ ar of associations , which in their features disp@@ ose , for private purposes used . &quot;
&quot; the damage is cum@@ ber@@ ed with approximately 400@@ .000 Euros . &quot;
the sports are also charged for financial out@@ ings .
&quot; this fact divided the chairman of the chat@@ es@@ on , Rich@@ ard@@ Mich@@ a@@ ela San@@ in , out of it . &quot;
it should be negotiated at a later date .
&quot; to the pro@@ ach of the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the Defence presented the association at no time created a wealth of asset . &quot;
&quot; the sports events would only have turned out expenses and the sports club to have been active from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they have invested a lot of time and money out of debt - the pas@@ se moved in 2001 around 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ illing ( rd . 44.@@ 000 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; back then we were facing the situation : do we continue our Club to or block ourselves ? &quot; , &quot; told one of the def@@ endants , in the Br@@ ot@@ ting Grand ownership of the financial instrument . &quot;
then he decided to take this task into making this task .
with all the risks .
&quot; we have pur@@ ged money for our life insurance as a safety at the bank , &quot; he said at the arrest . &quot;
&quot; be agreed with the club : you can manage the money , there must be no debts . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , - in the proportionate financial - success the payout of the expenses are retro@@ active until 1991 . &quot;
&quot; therefore , one became part of the expenses not only years later , namely the year 2003 , when a plus has been on the account . &quot;
&quot; therefore , we therefore ra@@ ils - and not detailed rings on , explain the former Ob@@ mann the processes . &quot;
&quot; the accounts and spar@@ k@@ not@@ aries managed the two acc@@ used together , said the second acc@@ used . &quot;
why the pay@@ outs were not revealed to the association explicitly , asked the judge . &quot;
&quot; the association has not been interested in detail for financial investment , important not only the press freedom , so the answer . &quot;
&quot; as in 2011 , against the one functional assessment of Am@@ t@@ sm@@ iss@@ al began , an amount of 120@@ .000 Euro was transferred to the club @-@ account . &quot;
&quot; these were @-@ were , said the acc@@ used . &quot;
&quot; this paper account was not based on the name of the second def@@ endants , and was not known according to the statement of the association . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; , &quot; wanted to know the judges . &quot;
but the respon@@ dent does not know about that for a long time .
&quot; then he said he , he believed that this is the best for the club . &quot;
&quot; if something had happened to him , nobody knew anything about that money , the prosec@@ ut@@ or placed in the room . &quot;
&quot; the ten@@ def@@ endant was informed , right forward to the functioning . &quot;
these funds was formulated as a &quot; claims &quot; claim .
why harm ? , would like to judge judge and prosec@@ ut@@ or . &quot;
&quot; on this statement , the first acc@@ used he declared , he had not agreed with this wording because the club never had a damage occurred . &quot;
&quot; but what should I do if the couns@@ el says : &quot; &quot; with whom you are all from the hook . &quot;
&quot; am I a judicial agent ? &quot; , &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the functional he never referred to a cent salary , he only calcul@@ ates only o@@ dom@@ es and di@@ eting . &quot;
&quot; in di@@ eting , he placed an invoice at the Club 1,000 euros per month , but the actual effort was however much higher , he added . &quot;
precise documents for the early years could not prove the def@@ endants .
&quot; these have been judged according to a farm , where everything was judged correctly , no longer kept , they explained . &quot;
o@@ dom@@ es had also acquired the second acc@@ used .
&quot; all influences are being done in cash , for this he must have to drive from his place of geno@@ cides to the bank to B@@ lei@@ burg , &quot; stated in his statement . &quot;
the main hearing is continued on 23 September with the consultation of witnesses .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Set more 30.000 jobs
&quot; in addition to three years ongoing Personnel Develop@@ ing , the computer strap is setting up further jobs to the creation of the company . &quot;
the job comm@@ issions at the US Computer Quanti@@ ty H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) is not an end .
&quot; the US technology leader is planning to reduce the dismant@@ ling of 25@@ ,000 to 30.000 positions in his company &apos;s customer requirements . &quot;
&quot; this will save costs of EUR 2.7 billion dollars ( 2,@@ 4 billion euros ) , distributed the company on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the step will lead to a special load of around 2.8 billion dollars , which will fall into account from the fourth quarter . &quot;
&quot; the running reduction of 5@@ 5,000 jobs has not been completed . &quot;
&quot; HP employed at the end of the fiscal year 2013 / 14 still approximately 30@@ 2,000 employees . &quot;

HP answers with a split and massive job entries on the shift in the industry .
&quot; the 76 @-@ year old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man re@@ acted late to the fact that customers are increasingly using smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers , and more and more shops are doing just the same . &quot;

time of decision on interest rates for the U.S. Emer@@ al@@ bank
&quot; the world is watching the world not@@ ary bank on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , together in order to make the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade is raised interest rates or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey conducted among 80 econom@@ ists who were asked by Reu@@ ters , found that a little more than half , which will do this , now the F@@ ed will do this , now think that F@@ ed will do a little longer and keep interest rates on the current level from 0 - 0.@@ 25 per cent . &quot;
&quot; it is a historic event , because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest rates on NU@@ LL . &quot;
&quot; for the first time we approach a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero @-@ area and starts a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bi@@ des , leading staff at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. economy is on a relatively good performance level , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate just a small inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less local perspective to global circumstances . &quot;
&quot; it war@@ ns the markets to stop on an increase , but the signs suggest that the chances of such a step are good . &quot;
the decision is expected to be announced at 20.00 CET on Thursday
death support to the Delta State University left dism@@ iss@@ al dism@@ iss@@ al of debt
&quot; after the shoot and killing of his girlfriend in Mississi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he wrote his colleagues on the day his colleagues , Sh@@ ann@@ on represented a note to say that &quot; &quot; sorry , &quot; &quot; he had been doing it &quot; , &quot; gave authorities on Tuesday known . &quot;
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , Mississi@@ ppi , said that he &apos;s supporters for Ge@@ ography and socio @-@ scientific education at the Delta State University , calling the emergency number against 10 : 00 am Monday morning . &quot;
&quot; and said , he shot on someone and somebody was killed . &quot;
he &apos;s represented by the staff of the emergency center that police polic@@ emen sent to his home .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I created my wife yesterday evening &quot; and he mentioned also that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; in the house , who will not distur@@ b it , but probably will be excited . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the calling for his name , but he did not have him . &quot;
he &apos;s represented no explanation for his shots .
&quot; as police , the scene were praying , she found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ s@@ s , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from represented , 45 , the said : &quot; I wanted it so I guess I could undo it . &quot;
&quot; I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
&quot; after writing the note he &apos;s 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor for history , killed before he eventually took his own life on Monday evening as polic@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; Universal President William La@@ For@@ ge said , he wis@@ s nothing about a conflict between he &apos;s and Schmidt but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs performance . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday , which he &apos;s alleg@@ edly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ s@@ s had also had a relationship , told authorities on Tuesday , there is no information , no evidence of &quot; a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ s@@ s was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said she was about seven years married as a &quot; good man . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were eliminated 15 years ago , but remained friends . &quot;
&quot; o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , he and Pr@@ enti@@ s@@ s would have been a daughter who is 19 and they were destroyed . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ s@@ s her daughter were &quot; absolutely Best friends . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ s@@ s worked online from home , after statement by L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , which was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a narrow friend of Pr@@ enti@@ s@@ s . &quot;
&quot; Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ s@@ s , who had a dog called Light@@ ning had it himself since about three years with he &apos;s represented . &quot;
&quot; she wanted to help other people &quot; , &quot; said Know@@ les &quot;
&quot; the police , he &apos;s represented at a particular time on Monday to tell them , &quot; he did not go into prison . &quot;
&quot; as police officers went to the highway 1 nearby Green@@ ville , later in that night , he spent his car to the side , fled to foot , ran into the woods and killed himself with a shot . &quot;
he &apos;s represented a doctoral title in the spring of 2015 by the Delta State University such as his E@@ ger &apos;s life at the University &apos;s website .
stars that have lost their happiness
&quot; the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stress@@ ful years . &quot;
&quot; in 2001 he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia and in 2009 he lost his long @-@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , because of cancer . &quot;
&quot; the actor was supp@@ osedly being condemned to drugs by drugs , and he was sentenced in 2008 because of drugs . &quot;
all this certainly calls for its toll .

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can not play twice due to double ch@@ ok@@ ing
Luke Sha@@ w er@@ itt in the Champions League defeat from Manchester at PS@@ V Eind@@ hoven won a double frac@@ ture of his right leg .
&quot; while this led the left hu@@ ts to cr@@ ying , and exclude him for at least six months from playing , Louis van G@@ aal holds the hope not that Sha@@ w can play back in this season . &quot;
the injury was caused by a rel@@ ent@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w was built in the PS@@ V area .
&quot; he was treated as early as nine minutes on the field of playing , and oxygen , before he was put into hospital . &quot;
&quot; van G@@ aal said , &quot; he has a double co@@ w@@ driving force and lies in the hospital . &quot;
&quot; he will have moved tomorrow or maybe a day later , and then operated in Manchester . &quot;
&quot; it is terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it is very difficult and then played fantastic , and then happens . &quot;
in the locker room he had a oxygen mask .
he we@@ pt .
&quot; I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture then it takes six months , and it will not be in the group phase . &quot;
I hope that he can play this season again .
Moreno seemed happy to escape a Red map and the suspension of a meter meter .
Nic@@ ola R@@ iz@@ z@@ oli , the arbit@@ er , has not pun@@ ished the Mex@@ ic@@ ans . &quot;
van G@@ aal assumed that the Italian arbit@@ rat@@ ors have not mist@@ aken .
&quot; you can judge for yourself , if I say that a mis@@ m and a red card were due . &quot;
it was a very worse attack with both legs .
&quot; a T@@ we@@ et referred to at Sha@@ w@@ h &apos;s account : &quot; &quot; thank you all for your news . words can not describe how broken I am , my path to recovery starts now , I am getting stronger again . &quot;
related to : Manchester United saw the loss of Luke Sha@@ w with the defeat at the PS@@ V
&quot; the England def@@ enders has an additional incentive to recover with the European Cup in France , until the coming of June . &quot;
&quot; Philli@@ p C@@ oc@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ coach , said : &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot;
&quot; when a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , they are all very sad . &quot;
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an enemy .
Moreno suffered a b@@ ump when Mexico did play against Van Ga@@ a@@ Holland team at the 2014 World Cup 2014 .
&quot; he is very hard because it was not his intention to viol@@ ate the opponent , and if you then listen that it is a really bad injury , this is not good , &quot; &quot; C@@ oc@@ u . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball , which was in a different direction , so it looked as if he had touched him , but I could not see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with SB@@ S@@ 6 said Moreno : &quot; &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be . &quot;
I feel very ill while doing so . I am very sorry .
the PS@@ V @-@ Player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to hospital - after a f@@ oul@@ der from Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron doesn &apos;t know The Lor@@ ax better ?
&quot; it is one thing that will learn all parents soon : if your child loves a book , it will not last long before you get to know it almost . &quot;
&quot; unless it may , you are perhaps David Cameron . &quot;
&quot; when he was asked by a supplier of child care systems , his favorite Ch@@ ild@@ hood was to call his favorite Minister for The Lor@@ ax , the 1971 @-@ ien@@ ene eco @-@ label of Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice when Cameron is writing in a message on the website of the company Super@@ camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and having a powerful message , it is a book that I like to read my children , because it seems always to have a picture or a message that we have missed . &quot;
&quot; everything nice and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron said the action of the book , instead , presents an abstract of the movie version of 2012 , the new characters and details added to expand the fairly short original text . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled city Th@@ eme @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity like Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , he read their desire to see a real tree , whose rich@@ ly name Theod@@ or Se@@ uss Spirit was s@@ lu@@ de and the 1991 died , but completely unknown . &quot;
&quot; as if this still not di@@ gest@@ ed enough : the text presented by Cameron is presented partially like the summary of the Lor@@ ax Film , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , hoping a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he has to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely to un@@ familiar with the action of the book as little . here ends an un@@ named boy , like the local environment through the cro@@ iss@@ ant Lor@@ ace , a ho@@ ck@@ ling , car@@ ving , be@@ zz@@ ling natural being , &quot; which is called in the name of the trees &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; most likely such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a volunteer , who has not read the Lord for 20 times in a child . &quot;
a Down@@ ing @-@ Street @-@ Spe@@ aker said that the text was probably come from Cam@@ er@@ ons &apos;s election office .
&quot; Super@@ camp@@ s confirmed that the text by Cam@@ er@@ ons has been delivered , but gave no further immediate comments . &quot;
&quot; Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exp@@ ulsion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult &quot;
&quot; to face Pakistan in the United Arab Emir@@ ates is a difficult task , but if you chose the K@@ ader , the England for the tour , stands for a re@@ petition of the 3 @-@ 0 test @-@ series defe@@ ats not on my card . &quot;
I would not exclude a down@@ war@@ dly .
&quot; Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ looks page may be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in the Batt@@ ing list , and the community spirit is strong ; they are not sc@@ ars of 2012 only a y@@ outh@@ ful positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball Mo@@ ons Ali is developed as a spin @-@ Bow@@ l and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hi@@ d , even if he is an unknown size at the test stage , is an option for the attack . &quot;
herein the message : Adam Ly@@ th ex@@ iled from the England @-@ Test @-@ K@@ ader and is replaced by Alex Hal@@ es .
&quot; the decision of allowing Adam Ly@@ th , is of course for me than its head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , difficult to analyze . &quot;
&quot; at his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that crime players are focused on results . &quot;
&quot; there was no question mark on Joe R@@ oot , for example , and this led to nom@@ ination , since - and I said this - players their own top choices . &quot;
&quot; after a long time , one would have extended the run of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own destiny . &quot;
if he will hopefully find further push for Yor@@ k@@ shire comes another chance .
&quot; the England Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his attitude , even if he didn &apos;t put so good performances , and that takes me not ; he is above all a team man . &quot;
&quot; the question , how much time a test stroke will receive to put his mark is difficult . &quot;
Ly@@ th was awarded seven odds - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while N@@ ick Comp@@ ton nine got .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and down@@ wards .
the only acc@@ us@@ ation that one can lift up was that England was at first Jonathan Tr@@ ott in the Caribbean at first - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex Hal@@ es comes in and he is a tra@@ p that I cher@@ ish high .
&quot; he is an X @-@ factor @-@ critical player that we saw in Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season , when he sh@@ ored 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge . &quot;
&quot; he must at least the same chances as those obtained before him , but this course depends on the team setting in the United Arab Emir@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; the idea , Mo@@ schen next to C@@ ook will beat what an extra @-@ spin @-@ Bow@@ ler would offer and four Qu@@ icks would get , do@@ ve on , and I have nothing against it . &quot;
&quot; I do not see why a stroke will not beat there , and this le@@ f@@ ty has already shown that he is a Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ er@@ l of cri@@ cket . &quot;
&quot; Mo@@ aker may not get his job out for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference . &quot;
my previous colleague Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests on the first drop before he joined in 2001 as Open@@ er .
he did not abol@@ ished three hundred R@@ uns and did not look back .
Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes to the K@@ ader as Back @-@ up sp@@ inner and in my limited usage with it he was very impressed me as a young man .
&quot; people may see their statistics - on average 31 , with the r@@ ack@@ ets and 35 with the ball - and think it is a p@@ unt , but there is no large number of backup colleagues who collect their hands and the trainers have chosen themselves for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the team , England has done a few small additions to the Train@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ ding , the Bat@@ sman in Sri Lanka , as consultant for the test games could be a master@@ piece . &quot;
&quot; it is one of the nicest guys of the game , which will bring an abundance of experiences , since it has played amongst all conditions and against all attacks . &quot;
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful usage into the setup .
&quot; I have always been feeling that he is created for the international Cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and as Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices can bring fresh air in the locker room , even if the news is in line with the def@@ endants . &quot;
&quot; parties &apos;s team coll@@ agen with Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes is not installed at the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot is not having a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with this . &quot;
&quot; some will not agree , but co@@ aches and team@@ players determine not the timetable . &quot;
and you must think that winning their jobs will depend on the results .
such decisions will not be made easy .
the Bre@@ x@@ it Stock ( Bre@@ x@@ it = exit of Britain from the EU ) could compete in allowance if the economy is in a built @-@ in machine for 2017
&quot; David Cam@@ er@@ ons un@@ equ@@ ated new@@ com@@ ding strategy to hold Britain in the EU will be deeper into trouble with every day , even without the choice of the geni@@ y Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it yes or no ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n for the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , which was fier@@ ce for Europe on Tuesday . &quot;
foreigners have also their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Nig@@ el Far@@ an .
&quot; a European diplom@@ ats fre@@ ed and told that some member states , so deeply ent@@ angl@@ ed in different crises , such as the EU is now and not always from their own gu@@ ilt , Great Britain himself set the agenda with a split conc@@ essions and failure changes , which they usually do not want to be filled . &quot;
&quot; in Bright@@ on , TU@@ C decided on their annual meeting to compromise the social protection at risk . &quot;
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie agenda .
&quot; Prime Minister and Finance Minister Cli@@ mb@@ ing meeting or bilateral sessions in foreign capitals , make a picture of itself from a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say they allies gain allies for reforms . &quot;
it is always about me .
&quot; my European friend who wishes an exciting UK inside the EU @-@ Zel@@ tes - &quot; &quot; Let us not leave us alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets go through , that more and more short@@ sight@@ ed ministers and officials to come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter if we stay or go . &quot;
&quot; Germany cau@@ tious ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel is an allies , but she has left power for 10 years before it looks bad for her as it looks for the exagger@@ ated long run like Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 16 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
French François Hollande can look back on his re @-@ election or his replacement for 2017 .
it is also an f@@ aded force .
Poland soon has a nation@@ alist &apos;s right government ; Spain has a left @-@ wing landscape .
&quot; it is difficult to imagine , imagine that they should be a b@@ ump@@ y to assist the Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ British to prevent their energy from the UK - something that they don &apos;t want , because most of the similar se@@ ati@@ st tendencies did . &quot;
&quot; therefore , some such ministers may even do not inten@@ tionally helpful comments , entirely in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s refer@@ en@@ dum@@ sc@@ amp@@ agne 2017 to accelerate the Bre@@ x@@ it process , susp@@ ects my friend . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bank@@ rupt &quot; and &quot; Great Britain has won nothing from the value of the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; Europeans know how r@@ ally the Fle@@ et Street can be at their costs and what EU Sk@@ ep@@ tic is the oligar@@ chy of the Press seb@@ ar@@ one , as they were not supported by Tony Ben@@ n insi@@ sted refer@@ en@@ du@@ ms 1975 but did not were that supported our entrance 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 . &quot;
&quot; you can recall weak to Bor@@ is Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ euro Opport@@ uni@@ on@@ ists who has made a name as a &quot; EU Ger@@ ade @-@ ban@@ anas &quot; in the early 90 @-@ s . &quot;
in all his promises about Ed Mili@@ band who were his enemies .
&quot; it belonged to the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing sh@@ ackl@@ es , telephone @-@ h@@ ack@@ et @-@ countries and the p@@ seudo @-@ countries that have most of our great newspapers . &quot;
&quot; actually Tony Blair similar about it , but stated that when one sits in a c@@ age with a hot Gor@@ illa , one gets better ban@@ anas in order to di@@ stract him instead of having lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bl@@ ai@@ ri@@ ans than Blair himself , when he was faced by Cam@@ er@@ ons Spe@@ en@@ du@@ ms@@ wir@@ bel , as Blair had rejected the principle of the non @-@ passed Constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch constitu@@ ents in 2005 . &quot;
the press has never failed to him .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n which gave me on Monday at Westminster a friendly fl@@ aps on the back - I told him that he is no longer time for me to settle in danger - N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cot@@ t strategy of the 80 @-@ er years repe@@ ating a mistake then and now .
&quot; it can last but he must develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ tap has left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ ns official position for Europe - I &apos;d like to be friendly - in the develop@@ ement .
he says that we should remain in a reform@@ ist EU .
&quot; well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps traditional leaf @-@ pul@@ ling tendency and the wild ti@@ zes of Tor@@ es Klein @-@ Engl@@ change@@ ism may well say everyone for that yes . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Ben@@ n@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on TV this week said , called the boy sc@@ outs in him , not admit that Cor@@ an ns said the pro@@ vo@@ z@@ ative John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell as a Sch@@ att@@ acking ker was a bad idea . &quot;
&quot; it reminded me of the 70 @-@ er years , when his old father died in television about willing to go well @-@ loyal to its Labour cabinet @-@ group , without losing too far and losing its cabinet job . &quot;
Hil@@ ar@@ ys fight was still more attractive .
&quot; but to fight for &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Ben@@ no expression - was not what is Mc@@ Donn@@ ell , nor what J@@ C told his colleagues and members according to all reports on their clarification at the Monday evening . &quot;
whatever comes the tou@@ ching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n - remember that he even touched me - News @-@ discipline remains important for me in the Age of TV around the clock and above all in the ti@@ ff of Social Media , a nest@@ ling of par@@ ano@@ ia and bet@@ ray@@ al . &quot;
&quot; it is right , Cameron doesn &apos;t give Cameron any free ticket to Europe that allows him to hold Lab@@ ours assi@@ sting in the referendum for a matter of course , such as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell it . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins think safely so .
&quot; but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell , and Cor@@ an ns fundamental @-@ deu@@ ces on EU membership - in accordance with its Ben@@ n@@ ite Belgian Economy , its anti @-@ capit@@ ulation , is no longer just a question of es@@ oter@@ ic discussion under the left dis@@ sid@@ ents , for which there is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes . &quot;
&quot; as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities , N@@ ato joined N@@ ato - Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C will not start any campaign for res@@ ign@@ ation - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find a sense of their super@@ vis@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; why should Paris or Berlin address political capital , they also have sus@@ pic@@ ious voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British if this can be sen@@ sel@@ ess ? &quot;
&quot; the US is already quite disappointed by the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory authorities in power when I was rec@@ alled on Monday , what was the British In@@ flu@@ ence security forum . &quot;
experts critic@@ ise the public Health UK about e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
&quot; alleg@@ ations of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking , made from a meeting of 12 people , partly with ties to tobacco industry , told researchers . &quot;
experts who are writing in British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) The Lanc@@ et appe@@ aled to cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ ze the critic@@ ised by Public Health England ( PH@@ E ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes used .
PH@@ E published the &quot; fundamental Report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers have placed their occupation force and transferred to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
&quot; a editorial written in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month took the &quot; &quot; hu@@ gely wind@@ y foundation &quot; &quot; on PH@@ E his most important conclusion . &quot;
two further researchers are written in BM@@ J and asked whether the claims can be based on stone or sand .
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tro@@ pical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ itan , Professor of Clinical Ep@@ ide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the detection of the effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; they said that the public expect the statement by PH@@ E that &quot; the present best estim@@ ation is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are roughly 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; on a detailed review of evidence and mod@@ elling . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were called to develop a model for a multi @-@ government assessment decision ( multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria Decision Analysis - M@@ C@@ DA ) to carry out their opinions about the damages of different ni@@ cot@@ ine products ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ized in a research report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ ern@@ am said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose general manager had previously received by British American Tob@@ acco means ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study . &quot;
&quot; he also wrote the references from BA@@ T to public health in a Sustainability Report , said they . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants stated at the meeting agreed to receive funding from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer , but not financing which he received after reports previously from the tobacco company Philip Morris International to add them . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for selecting the members of the Gre@@ mi@@ um are not supplied , but they include several famous e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champion , some of which also indicate a sector financing in the paper . &quot;
some other participants at this session are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the session also participated the tobacco management of PH@@ E .
&quot; the research work of the group &quot; b@@ lows &quot; &quot; indicates that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence of the damages of most products among most criteria &quot; , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ itan . &quot;
however no such connections or limitations are discussed in the PH@@ E report .
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ ern@@ am said that there is no evidence of PH@@ E that &quot; there is so far no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are used as a way of smoking for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers . &quot;
&quot; prof Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , Director of health and well being at PH@@ E , said that has been respon@@ sive to the alleg@@ ations of BM@@ J . &quot;
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long rob@@ ber@@ y dies at his ad@@ diction .
&quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to it , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term impact . &quot;
&quot; PH@@ E has the unique obligation to inform the public about what is evidence of evidence , and what is not , especially if there are so much public confusion over relative threats in comparison to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; almost 8@@ 0,000 people are dying every year on a disease with regards to smoking , smoking and smoking costs two billion € per year . &quot;
&quot; due to the clear proof of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the harm , which is caused by smoking , we comply with our national responsibility . &quot;
&quot; BBC should give to the East@@ ends , says former Chief of Channel 4 &quot;
&quot; the former president of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said the BBC ought to send programs like East@@ ends and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give her right arm &quot; for hit @-@ Shows as the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said that the broad@@ casting fee should be used only to do the type of programs that are not sent by other UK transm@@ itters .
&quot; he cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed the BBC ever that they will be considered public @-@ legal programs , which probably will probably be seen by a smaller audience , in hard contro@@ versi@@ al time being against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and sen@@ ders such as BB@@ C4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC @-@ General Director , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations , Johnson said he has tried six years in his time with Channel 4 without success to get in touch with the BBC . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programmes were commissioned or sends , which would also be clearly shown by not sub@@ ordin@@ ated Riv@@ als , &quot; said Johnson &apos;s chief main communication committee in his investigation into the future of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the radio tax on the medium or a long @-@ term not for a good idea , one should at least give its production a least on programs that others do not do or give a mandate . &quot;
they want The Voice in a prime time window because they want to achieve the wid@@ est possible support for their future as possible .
&quot; the idea that otherwise no one would show this , is a joke , it is ridicul@@ ous , it is of course non@@ sense . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said : &quot; &quot; I do not see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax programmes are financed , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot;
the Voice is such a program , the East@@ ends is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly , both own productions . &quot;
&quot; honestly speaking , other channels , would give her right arm for it . &quot;
I would like to see how this should be public on public .
I don &apos;t believe this would reduce the BBC ever .
&quot; Johnson , a entrepren@@ eur for Series , Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 led , said that the BBC blame was on the hunt for reviews regardless of the ambitions of the people who work there and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on the most popular shows on the BBC announce that which was the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ g@@ art conference in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows how to sell the BBC &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the rather public @-@ law nec@@ essi@@ onal @-@ programs won &apos;t measure to BB@@ C4 , but they know their tasks , and they can ar@@ gue if they have prepared for their made sacred missions to justify of 4 billion € mobile radio control , &quot; Nu@@ n , of course , we have created all these ob@@ scure programs which no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window where no one would ever see them ever .
&quot; on the radio book , Johnson said the Committee : &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system with respect to terms of who can get the best value . &quot;
&quot; of course , you think all that one gets a great value for 150 £ per year here , but for people who is for the 150 £ a lot of money , ask me whether this is true , because they consume no much from the BBC . &quot;
&quot; the former Sky@@ liner and Channel 5 @-@ chief David El@@ stein , who also said in front of the committee on Tuesday , asking the BBC to check their matur@@ ation mission to form and entertain . &quot;
&quot; he said , only little of the BBC &apos;s production would now officially classified as education - he said that it is 1 % of their TV Production and 0.@@ 1 % on the radio , and it should take a look at the public @-@ law television channels in Australia and Canada . &quot;
&quot; on the question of partnerships we said El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like the pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television are shown , and with the commercial transm@@ itters of alli@@ ances , to make everything available online . &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ ogen@@ etics &apos; can control brain cells through noise @-@ waves
&quot; the video shows how the Nem@@ ato@@ den the direction in the moment change , in which they will be be@@ amed with sound quality . &quot;
scientists have bre@@ ast@@ ed wor@@ ms with gene@@ tically modified nervous systems which are controlled by er@@ up@@ tions of sound @-@ waves .
&quot; the tiny Nem@@ ato@@ den change the direction in the moment they have with sound demonstrations , which have heard for the human ear to high frequencies in order to be listened to . &quot;
&quot; the stim@@ uli work through switching between Mot@@ ion@@ eur@@ on cells , which are gene@@ tically modified to wear the membran@@ e channels , which respond to ultr@@ asonic devices . &quot;
further to this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; the researchers did , the wor@@ ms showed the power of a new procedure , called son@@ ogen@@ etics , used by ultr@@ as@@ o@@ und , in order to activate a number of brain , cardi@@ ac and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; S@@ re@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researchers at Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said to the Guardian , that the procedure of one day could replace the depths of brain , an invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses to the brain of people for treating the symptoms of Park@@ inson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; failure are usually not responding to ultr@@ as@@ o@@ und , but Chal@@ as@@ ani set out that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic air bu@@ b@@ bles . &quot;
&quot; bu@@ b@@ bles , he found out , strengthen the ultr@@ as@@ o@@ und , which penet@@ rate into the wor@@ ms . &quot;
the increased ultr@@ as@@ o@@ ic effects on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and can be found in the membran@@ es by some of the wor@@ e cells .
&quot; the reson@@ ates effect the opening of these icons , and activate the cells that are assigned to them , such a report Nature Communications . &quot;
&quot; to create ultr@@ as@@ o@@ und Nem@@ at@@ den , changed Chal@@ as@@ ani gene@@ tically the wor@@ ms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels . &quot;
&quot; when he uses ultr@@ as@@ o@@ und applied to the altered creatures , the sound @-@ waves are enhanced through the micro bu@@ b@@ bing , and to turn into the wor@@ ms where they turn the changed Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ genetic tics , a tra@@ il@@ bl@@ az@@ ing tool that allows scientists to integrate neur@@ ons with impulses of light and switch off . &quot;
Th@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ ogen@@ etics could have some advantages compared with this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light , which must be sent to the desired position in the brain , the low @-@ speed ultr@@ as@@ o@@ und tissues can happen and thus can be sent to the brain from above on the sk@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with G@@ enth@@ er@@ ap@@ y and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporary for the ultr@@ as@@ o@@ und signal in a clinical approach to certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and ins@@ ulin producing cells , he added . &quot;

eight golden rules for living in student Residen@@ ces
&quot; eleven years ago I moved as self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old in a student dormitory , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile , which I have anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , long @-@ voice complaints about others . &quot;
most of what I &apos;ve learned can be distill@@ ed in eight simple rules .
the delay in student residences are ranges from slightly ner@@ ve wre@@ cking up to absolutely fri@@ ght@@ ening .
&quot; it is temp@@ ting to sh@@ v@@ ented : people tell , where you come , where and where you are Sab@@ bath year neither love yet hate or hate , because in the Ernst , guys , it is just a fe@@ ver extra@@ kt h@@ ah@@ aha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - job vac@@ ancies and show interest .
&quot; it acts up the conversation and helps you to find out the people that you may not speak in opposition to those who would not speak , even if your lashes in fire were gr@@ ated and this fire extingu@@ ishers would be . &quot;
let people .
&quot; the rooms of people are often transformed into drinks @-@ form@@ ulas , film night event locations and municipal meeting places , but they are also places where people get themselves and their ling@@ erie . &quot;
&quot; related to this , don &apos;t remember to start the university with a relationship . &quot;
introduction gets a rough treatment at the university .
&quot; your room should be a refu@@ ge , but many student Residen@@ ces form a room @-@ to @-@ room B@@ um@@ mel culture , which can be friendly and socially as well and to li@@ fel@@ ong friendship . &quot;
&quot; this can be hell for someone , who tried to recover . &quot;
&quot; nothing in culture allows you to say , &quot; &quot; I like you , and I want to go forward to our friendship , but you have to go away so that I get the energy back I used for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a comm@@ it@@ one is exhausted by con@@ vivi@@ ality - and send him an SMS instead .
speaking about anch@@ oring : do it .
a guy in my student dor@@ ms had the notion that a not locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship conclude with b@@ aking .
&quot; since you start the university at the height of Back @-@ Man@@ ie , the clo@@ aca is at the doors of people , to introduce yourself with a dish full of brow@@ nies , less strange than the welcome of the 1950 @-@ er years &quot; welcome in the neighbourhood , I have b@@ aked anything . so , and now please smile if I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
home le@@ aks can offer is a good way to make friend@@ ships .
your roomm@@ ates feel obliged to entertain yourself and will end up maybe your face with a delicious surprise .
&quot; of course , this depends on whether you are a decent bakery . &quot;
&quot; bad cl@@ umps of fl@@ our , sugar and fat lead to make people fall asleep when you anchor . &quot;
ste@@ al food is an essential crime in student homes .
&quot; of course , the clut@@ ches of ch@@ ick@@ ens is a theft , but is it the Take of a drop of military for your tea as well ? &quot;
check it with the milk owner .
&quot; chances are good that they say to serve themselves , even when they cook inside the interior . &quot;
&quot; when someone ste@@ als your stuff , is the annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it as my roomm@@ ate , who added their milk to pun@@ ish pur@@ se . &quot;
it is now in prison .
they should not make noise from the people from sleep or from work .
&quot; it is not just about being a decent man , but that in the true sense of the right to man , they are sitting in the glass building . &quot;
&quot; a girl in my corridor was asking her neighbors , whether they do something to make the drum &amp; bass little qui@@ eter , because there was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a trial in the morning . &quot;
you responded to this with even lu@@ k@@ er music .
&quot; after all , they eventually got started around 5 o &apos;clock , they were kindly allowed to sleep two hours before they set their own music , shut their door down , and prepare themselves to their thir@@ st test . &quot;
would it not be romantic if your future spouse would acci@@ dentally draw in the same student dormitory ?

the real estate of property Markus G@@ ild@@ ner is built in the Middle fran@@ con@@ ian corner@@ stone of Ro@@ wh@@ ouses for people who do not have much money .
&quot; therefore , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; not only refugees need residential space , but also the mother and Ger@@ ing@@ ra@@ iment . &quot;
&quot; I show how one can still look at it today and well , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in the interview &quot;
thousands of refugees will be pushing for the apartment market .
&quot; the entrepren@@ eur Mark G@@ ild@@ ner believes in knowing how quickly a lower living room can be created , building Rei@@ h@@ enh@@ ouses for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot;
&quot; Mr. G@@ ild@@ ner , many refugees will be pushing for the Italian market . &quot;
which solution do you offer ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : the mass accommodation in containers or gymn@@ as@@ als has no sustainability .
for people remain a large part here .
in the coming decades we will have plenty of living space in the coming decades .
a quite bank@@ note about the three @-@ day self @-@ detached house is the solution .
G@@ ild@@ ner : a self @-@ detached house needs the least place .
it makes integration easier .
&quot; this is different , when one brings people into sitting b@@ loc@@ s . &quot;
&quot; each of the six houses , which are built precisely in the pilot project , consists of three housing units for each four asylum seekers . &quot;
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , one bathroom , a kitchen and a common room . &quot;
&quot; it can be that many refugees will say , it is again peace , I go back . &quot;
then the houses can be converted easily to the respective needs .
how much are the costs ?
&quot; G@@ ild@@ ner : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house is equivalent to 184 000 Euro , without property . &quot;
that is man@@ age@@ able .
six months the construction took us .
that is reasonable .
do the building prescri@@ ptions have their plans complicated ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : building legally have carried out my project correctly .
particularly complicated makes it always the dro@@ pping D@@ amo@@ kl@@ ist custom construction and the place for the place Regulations .
cre@@ ep@@ y .
&quot; it is still under@@ lined , who creates three apartments in a studio house , needs at least three pitches . &quot;
only in cities are missing for that space .
and refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
how did the inhabitants react to their self @-@ service project ?
&quot; G@@ ild@@ ner : there were those who have thrown me , treas@@ ury for asylum seekers . &quot;
what is definitely not true .
but did you not shar@@ ply the competi@@ tor at affordable housing ?
&quot; G@@ ild@@ ner : true , however : in the last five years we have been a construction boom in Germany , but two brand new apartments , which can barely afford a lot . &quot;
&quot; my project has the message , also the ordinary people need space . &quot;
&quot; not only refugees , but also the mother alone or the wor@@ sen@@ er ear@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; I show , how you can still build and build good at this time . &quot;
that is why it is about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone OS if Apple update will be released
&quot; the new operating system can be requested by using the setup app , type on &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; Software Update . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install it . &quot;
&quot; some have stum@@ bled after installation to problems since they get an error , the release that the &quot; software update fails . &quot;
&quot; to handle the problem , users is recommended to either wait until the rush is back or trying to update through iTunes . &quot;
the phone itself takes you through the rest of the process .
&quot; this may mean the deletion of apps in order to create space - but Apple has made it more likely to do so , if you have a special tool to work apps and then install it again as soon as the process is finished . &quot;
&quot; it is worth not@@ ing that your mobile phone is loaded during the update , or located near a charger , so that the battery is loaded . &quot;
&quot; when the load is too low , Apple is not able that the update will continue , as the phone might start to down@@ ward way and this could lead to a break@@ down of the update . &quot;

&quot; witness the Police is for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday night , at 23@@ 45 p.m. , three young men were on foot from Bad So@@ den in the direction of Sal@@ em@@ be@@ es . &quot;
&quot; one of the group , a 17 year old Afgh@@ an , followed according to the indications of the police his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called to them that one could wait for him . &quot;
&quot; at this time , the group was at the height of the b@@ ft gas station . &quot;
there are also three persons on the grounds of the gas station .
one of these men sh@@ out@@ ed the youngsters and made this with the right face .
the sacrifice brings down a nose @-@ like her@@ nia and ble@@ eding very strong from the nose .
&quot; when his two friends made ha@@ ired and conf@@ is@@ sive to the bats , this was initially ordered by his sacrifice . &quot;
among his friends the last young man was brought home .
the perpet@@ rat@@ ors followed the group with a passenger up to their home and did get demonstrations there several times .
&quot; when one no longer saw the vehicle , the last before the building went to smoke a cigar@@ ette . &quot;
there he was again attacked by the bats and another male person again .
under a rule of a stroke you check on the face and th@@ ig@@ h of the O@@ pole .
the last had to be taken to medical care in a hospital .
&quot; so far , there is only a v@@ ague of work description . &quot;
one of the men was about 1.@@ 80 metres in size .
the second r@@ ack@@ et should have been approximately 1,@@ 65 meters tall and was dres@@ sed with an je@@ ans and a brown @-@ white dress . &quot;

Dr. Frank Müller took over the practice of Fel@@ el@@ ausen and invested € 3@@ 10000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from the left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ el@@ ausen .
he also looks forward to Sam@@ t@@ bi@@ peti@@ tioner Bernd Bor@@ mann , economic pick@@ up by Uta Sei@@ m @-@ Sch@@ wart@@ z and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ m Mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert . &quot;
&quot; in many places in the country , doctors are missing - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , Dr. Frank Müller took over the practice field . &quot;
&quot; during the Ur@@ sel Fel@@ el@@ ausen on retirement , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich his successor is waiting for the next few months to come with a half place . &quot;
&quot; after a re@@ building phase , Müller opened the practice on 12 October , until then he invested € 3@@ 10000 Euro in the premises at the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 . &quot;
&quot; it was sympathy among the first sight , when Frank Müller and his wife meet Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ ated , who currently studied their specialist education in the Car@@ den@@ er hospital and will also go into practice . &quot;
&quot; we always had in mind that the gar@@ b@@ age would fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ce@@ ausen and laugh@@ s . &quot;
&quot; when I was , I was simply called to it . &quot;
the couple of Müller took the idea to pursue their own practice in future in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot;
we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years .
&quot; as an advantage he can also be , soon his own boss . &quot;
&quot; and so one thing agreed , the gar@@ b@@ age bought the house with the practice . &quot;
people will still stay at breaking @-@ Vil@@ sen .
&quot; there is the two @-@ fold Family father Frank Müller also up in Hannover , his medical study in Hanover followed stations in several medical practice , as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , N@@ ien@@ burg and Rot@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; currently he is active as a captain in Sul@@ ingen , in 2009 he was appointed to the senior emergency in the Di@@ ep@@ holz and is committed to volunteer in DR@@ C @-@ readiness &apos; hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; as of 19 September , the practice for the new boss is prepared . &quot;
&quot; during the sur@@ geon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ el@@ ausen as a veterin@@ arian , his spouse has specialized on the gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology . &quot;
the rub@@ bers , both interactions , are wishing to settle as pet . &quot;
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy is therefore out of it , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll . &quot;
&quot; after conversion , the rooms of modern look will look like . &quot;
we will offer more ultr@@ as@@ o@@ und examinations as well as long @-@ term and stress @-@ EK@@ GS and need a microphone stations more .
&quot; furthermore , the ED@@ V is completely renewed . &quot;
&quot; a grant from a total of 50@@ 000 Euro , the gar@@ b@@ age of the county seat ( 25@@ ,000 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euro ) . &quot;
&quot; this shows how proud and glad we are , that the practice will be run forward , &quot; says Sam@@ ur@@ municipal council Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; about 2000 patients , according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll each quarter go into the practice Fel@@ el@@ ausen , in the North German average practice , there are some 500 . &quot;
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there are still another dental surgery .
a positive side effect of the practical return by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains in the Ur@@ sel Fel@@ el@@ ausen in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
&quot; if no successor would have found , it would also be gone . &quot;
&quot; who &apos;s Müll@@ ers are visited , on the way also continues to look primarily in familiar faces : assumes the seven medical specialists and the cleaning force of the field of the field . &quot;
&quot; with their far@@ ewell ends in A@@ sen@@ dorf , a era , after all , the medical equipment have been practiced there for 30 years . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; &quot; reminds me of the story . &quot;
a little mel@@ anch@@ ol@@ y sp@@ ice it after the long time already .
&quot; but we &apos;re still living in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will surely see many patients very often , &quot; &quot; says the intern@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; your husband completes : &quot; &quot; we have a 6000 square meter property . &quot;
&quot; so far , I always pushed through garden work , now this could be otherwise . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the pair has two grand@@ children and travels . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees through &quot;
&quot; now the border controls also passed on to our South border , &quot; said the secretary of Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
the inspections in the Hungarian border stay in parallel to this .
&quot; be clear that everyone who wants to make an asylum application , can also make it &quot; natural &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the supply and safety of the people stand at the forefront .
&quot; but also clear , &quot; &quot; that clear signals needed &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; people need to know that we cannot accept bound@@ less migration flows , also not beyond the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot;
it takes a controlled approach .
Croatia awak@@ ens &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia
&quot; the Croatian Government had previously told , also Slovenia wants to travel further refugees in direction of Austria and Germany and may also establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees . &quot;
&quot; quite , this was not what was the inner of Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Stav@@ anger . &quot;
&quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors was &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; , &quot; Slovenia will rather intensify the monitoring of the border - mainly towards Hungary . &quot;
&quot; however , the border with Croatia is already controlled as a non @-@ border of the Schengen Area . &quot;
&quot; he said , he wants Sloven@@ ian people in so that his borders for refugees but not abri@@ d@@ ged . &quot;
&quot; any EU member must render its commitments , otherwise the system cannot function &quot; , &quot; Mr Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; like the Croatian Government , the first refugees were already trying to pass on Tuesday in the night hours on Tuesday , in Eastern Croatia , along the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d , to escape the registration . &quot;
the Croatian police could take them up in the nearby fields of corn .
according to local media since the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik ever meet police vehicles with new refugees .
&quot; it is mainly wor@@ ship@@ pers and Afgh@@ ans , among them many women and children . &quot;
even rescue services and the Red Cross are already being used .
&quot; in the days ahead of his country with around 4000 refugees , interior ministers Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; moreover , b@@ usses from pres@@ aches to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Ser@@ b Border , which had been brought to the Hungarian border to far , reported Croatia and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; however , the government in Belgrade demonstrate that it is to suggest people to say certain routes : &quot; &quot; neither let us do , nor do we want to do it , &quot; it says . &quot;
&quot; according to the media report , at least in the morning there was a first bus with around 50 refugees in the Serbian border town of Si@@ d , in the course of the day there would be further buses . &quot;
&quot; Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
the in@@ mates were traveling around 500 kilometers away from the ma@@ z@@ ed@@ onian border with Serbia around 500 kilometres .
&quot; we have heard that Hungary made us , so the police have said that we ought to go there , &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; we wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria . &quot;
&quot; with this , it could actually now become a predic@@ ted shift in the previous Balkan route in Turkey @-@ Macedonia @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia and a slightly further West route . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive opportunities for border control &quot;
Croatia &apos;s interior ministers of O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country has prepared corresponding plans for possible exceptional circumstances of refugees for possible exceptional situations .
&quot; in the case he didn &apos;t mention it , but he pointed out that Croatia as non @-@ Schengen Member &quot; have extensive possibilities for border control . &quot;
you perform strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; Slovenia has been a member of the EU @-@ Partner , since 2007 , the EU partners have a good witness to that which concerns the standard of the border controls . &quot;
&quot; on ser@@ b@@ ular side , behind the Hungarian border line , continue for about 300 refugees . &quot;
&quot; according to Bel@@ gra@@ der media , they would have spent the past night at the border crossing of Hor@@ g@@ os , who leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; according to indications of the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings , Hor@@ g@@ os and back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely locked . &quot;
whether the remaining refugees want to travel further to the Croatian border is still un@@ clear .
Serbian Finance Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ se Stef@@ ano@@ vic tried to calm night at a local eye @-@ eye at Hor@@ g@@ os : he has now concluded the debates about alternative routes from refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed .
it would not currently take a very high volume of refugees .
&quot; you can &apos;t say whether they would like to continue their journey over Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot;
hel@@ pers from migrants to - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; however , private Hungarian refuge@@ e shel@@ ters have already started to distribute the refugees maps that are cli@@ cked on alternative routes through Croatia . &quot;
&quot; however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not harm@@ less : in parts of the border , there are still not more spacious min@@ e@@ fields after the end of the empire . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of min@@ e@@ pers was sent in the border region . &quot;
market @-@ h@@ ackers : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars
Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok should have heard a ring of cy@@ ber crime who has been pre @-@ thrown since 2010 again and again un@@ released financial statements and press releases published on sites such as Business Wire via wi@@ red and PR News@@ wire .
with the exploited information the insi@@ der trading had been made on the financial markets .
thus the investig@@ ators were fed to excess of 100 million dollars in this manner .
&quot; the current comparison shows that even those outside of our national borders are ultimately to be tr@@ apped , &quot; it says in the S@@ EC communication . &quot;
the processes against 32 other blame was performed in the case performed .
the majority of the def@@ endants came from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpet@@ rat@@ ors should have acts both in the U.S. and Eastern Europe .
ec@@ umen@@ ical hosp@@ ed@@ aid Mannheim has been in existence for more than 20 years
around the Mann@@ heimer par@@ ade@@ court re@@ igns operation .
&quot; the people get their concerns , partly fast pac@@ ed , partly cosy b@@ um@@ bling . &quot;

&quot; best , pr@@ one life with stunning autumn sunshine and round four large tables each with the head@@ line &quot; Be@@ fore I want I want to .... &quot;
the ec@@ umen@@ ical hosp@@ iz@@ aid was attentive with this action on its 20 @-@ year anniversary and is indeed faced with mixed reactions .
&quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went with action in the middle of the city and among men , &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot;
the head @-@ trainer of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hosp@@ iz@@ era stands for ped@@ est@@ rains as well as questions and talks such as volunteers .
&quot; while some acc@@ using a Pass@@ ant spont@@ aneously , acc@@ esses the chal@@ k and set the sentence for &quot; &quot; my life &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; to stop &quot; &quot; with the camper through the USA &quot; &quot; to stop &quot; &quot; the war &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; no long suffer &quot; , &quot; other phrases as far as I am not yet , and then go on . &quot;
&quot; again and again , they develop on the ver@@ ge of little discussions about the action itself , on life , de@@ al@@ ings with the dying . &quot;
also Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is just on site .
&quot; only when I am clear to me that sometime the end of the world comes , I can live responsible , &quot; says the Director of the di@@ ac@@ onal workshop of Mannheim , which is jointly with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband Bear@@ er of E@@ cum@@ en@@ ium . &quot;
&quot; therefore , this general effective action to 20 @-@ year @-@ old is good . &quot;
&quot; however , that everyone does not want to inform each of the tables publicly , be understandable , but at least it handle a very personal thing . &quot;
&quot; the subject of death and dying are still afflic@@ ted with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , even though the hosp@@ ice movement in recent years have contributed much to the people . &quot;

Fed@@ Ex @-@ result mixed with financial outlook for 2016 lower@@ ed
Fed@@ Ex reports betra@@ yed results for the last quarter and the Li@@ ef@@ er gig@@ ant gave its profit to a whole year due to the weak@@ est demand for freight service and increased costs in his body service .
&quot; the company also said that it is planning to start approximately 5@@ 5,000 seasonal workers for their holiday . &quot;
&quot; at this point in the last year , Fed@@ Ex an , that the company wants to adapt 5@@ 0,000 workers for vacation time . &quot;
this share fell by 2,5 percent in the after@@ market @-@ trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
&quot; Fed@@ Ex Corp. said , earned a profit between 10,@@ 40 and 10,@@ 90 $ in the financial year , which ends in the next month , 20 c@@ ents less than with earlier forecasts . &quot;
analy@@ st were expected according to a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10.@@ 84 $ .
&quot; the lower view comes in spite of the price increased , which will be an average of 4.8 percent and may be effective on 4 January , and despite higher ass@@ aul@@ ts for body@@ work sho@@ oters of heavy and large packages , which will be raised from November . &quot;
&quot; the company said that it is expecting the result from the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenue and due to growth in online retail . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company gets &quot; solid &quot; sound &quot; &quot; when one draws the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
&quot; the plans for the holidays are announced a day later than those of the Riv@@ al U@@ PS , who plans to set 9@@ 0,000 and 9@@ 5.000 additional labor force , some of the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the quarter that ended on 31 August , Fed@@ Ex 6@@ 92 million $ , 6 percent more than last year . &quot;
&quot; the result per share amoun@@ ted to 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just behind the 2,@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of Z@@ acks Investment Research asked analy@@ st . &quot;
sales increased by 5 percent to EUR 12.@@ 3 billion .
6 of Z@@ acks were asked wa@@ ited for 12.@@ 23 billion $ .
Fed@@ Ex has reported a decline in the international ranking shipping that took place sales in his unit express shipping .
but the boom in online shopping has raised the results of the Fed@@ Ex Ground .
&quot; in the final quarter of turnover increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for greater packages and self @-@ insurance . &quot;
the Express @-@ unit flow@@ ed higher revenue due to higher prices while the result decreased for higher labour costs in the freight business .
&quot; in the after@@ market , about an hour before the opening , the Fed@@ Ex @-@ shares by 3.@@ 85 billion , or 2,5 percent , to 15@@ 0.@@ 15 $ . &quot;
on Tuesday they included 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent under a record high on June 11th .
&quot; on their most expected meeting in the year , Federal Reserve Str@@ at@@ egen &apos;s spent two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot @-@ dru@@ g@@ any table sitting to decide whether it &apos;s time for the first time since almost a decade to lift the lad@@ ders . &quot;
dr@@ one on them at the end of the two @-@ story sitting gar@@ ment is a wall picture of the United States .
&quot; the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed @-@ chair Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen , and her colleagues want to put the country &apos;s economic interests before all other things . &quot;
the central bank has a second order from Congress : maxim@@ izing the U.S. Employment and Prices staying stable .
&quot; but since the large recession , the F@@ ed leaders have recognised that there is an un@@ created third @-@ scale mandate : financial stability . &quot;
&quot; and this third mandate could be the X @-@ factor in a decision which is too tight in order to predic@@ t them . it will be announced on Thursday , whether the US economy is ready to compens@@ ate from the unprecedented short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 . &quot;
&quot; although most of the data of the economy show that it grows strongly , the most recent tur@@ mo@@ il in the global financial markets ensure that these vol@@ ati@@ lity in increasing interest for federal states - and be it only around a quarter of percentage . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation will be the most important thing to observe what they observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , Chief econom@@ ists during the Mak@@ ler@@ firm Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to increase the interest rate , the increased uncertainty about the global market is enough justification , continues to wait . &quot;
&quot; there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , what in itself the financial market sec@@ ures itself . &quot;
about half of the econom@@ ists who were recently asked from Bloom@@ berg have predic@@ ted this week .
&quot; however , the financial markets expect a failure of the F@@ ed , with a key indi@@ gn@@ ator that points only a 30 % chance of an increase . &quot;
&quot; this indicates a drop in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the set , it is because that the str@@ ata will be mi@@ tig@@ ated the blow by pressing that another increase is far away . &quot;
on Tuesday sp@@ ills of the D@@ ow Jones Industrial average worth 2@@ 28.@@ 89 points or around 1,@@ 4 % on 16.@@ 5@@ 99@@ ,@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy is continuing the sentence in this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Princip@@ al Con@@ om near M@@ oody &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would lift the propositions at this time , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if they do it , it would have to go far in their explanation to calm the financial markets , so that they do not get into panic . &quot;
&quot; other experts argu@@ ed that a tax evasion the financial markets would calm , because it would remove the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed will act . &quot;
&quot; a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed to raise on a good way to increase the sentence by 0,@@ 25 percentage points in this month , the first little step in a slow tight@@ ening of the mon@@ ial conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the United States . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ elles had said in the spring and in spring , that in this year they would be necessary in spite of the complaints of liber@@ als that would expect more economic progress would expect an increase in the sentence . &quot;
&quot; although the creation of jobs in August slow@@ ed , the improvement in the labour market was solid in this year . &quot;
&quot; the unemployed ratio on 5.4 % last month , the lowest for over seven years and close to the levels that sees the F@@ ed as full employment . &quot;
wage levels have shown signs of a recovery .
&quot; and although inflation led constantly under the annual goal of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives took that the main reason had the temporary effect of much lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can overcome higher interest rates and needs it on the tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d@@ son , Chef@@ ö@@ kon@@ om at Pantheon Macro@@ economics . &quot;
&quot; but the financial markets around the world brought together over the end of last month , after China had de@@ valued its currency . &quot;
&quot; the D@@ ow Jones Industrial Rule value fell in May by more than 16 % under its peak , as investors fear@@ ed , making a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy the global growth of th@@ rot@@ tles . &quot;
&quot; the market has recovered something this month , whereby the D@@ ow is now around 10 % under the High of May . &quot;
&quot; for the F@@ ed representatives , the market turbul@@ ence influence the complex calculation of calculation when to increase interest . &quot;
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news on the weakness of the Chinese economy in the past couple of weeks would not occur , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at the U@@ C@@ LA C@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the U.S. Emer@@ al@@ bank . &quot;
&quot; now , he says that they will wait at least a month to get the impact better on the handle . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on US economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot;
&quot; the health of the world economy is one of the main areas of the F@@ ed , so it should not be involved in their decision @-@ making . &quot;
but in the end the F@@ ed Monetary Authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank has been enormous over the past years .
&quot; the mere reference of the then &quot; &quot; Ben S. Bern@@ an@@ ke then in 2013 , that the F@@ ed finds its mon@@ et@@ ty expansion &quot; &quot; narrow &quot; , &quot; turbul@@ ence around the globe . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ connected , from the F@@ ed representatives , they can not only monitor the developments in another place , but also consult with other central banks and experts to maintain a better understanding of the global economy . &quot;
&quot; their decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for the asset management of the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeff@@ rey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month , that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of over@@ reactions on financial market movements , which seem to be associated with the economic fundament@@ alists . &quot;
&quot; l@@ acker , unanim@@ ous member of the Federal Open Market Committee , advoc@@ ated for a period of inser@@ ting decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to lower its head @-@ ins by 0,@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions , despite a limited impact on growth in the US &quot; , &quot; said Cr@@ acker . &quot;
a year later the F@@ ed representatives continued these cuts .
&quot; F@@ ed should put certain aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis such as market @-@ re@@ union 2008 to the first place , said Adam S. poses , former member of the committee for the interest rates of the Bank of England . &quot;
&quot; the latest turbul@@ ence are not coming near this level , he said . &quot;
&quot; she certainly wants to get into the situation in which she is afraid of an inser@@ tion because the markets are up , &quot; said Poznań , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still contains double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until it is altered , I don &apos;t believe it should be ahead of time . &quot;

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small living @-@ aid for refugees
&quot; more and more refugees arrive at this day in Germany , more and more . &quot;
prepare a warm welcome and not without the dedication of inn@@ umer@@ able volunteers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a whole lot of people who are un@@ sel@@ fish@@ ly asylum seekers in the city .
they belong to them Petra and Klaus Heine .
Petra Heinrich is with body and soul apprentic@@ eship .
even with their 74 run@@ ners they are still taught .
every Thursday she is doing it in the asylum seeker at the D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
&quot; she helps refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German language . &quot;
&quot; of course , the most different teaching is to be on the right school . &quot;
Brazilian society Rio Grande promotes diet for healthy bre@@ ast@@ feeding
&quot; the Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ atric organization SP@@ RS attempts to clarify how important good nutrition during lact@@ ation . she does this with the presentation of images of babies , who are su@@ ction on br@@ aces that are painted with representations of un@@ healthy food . &quot;
&quot; mother &apos;s milk is made of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that provide babies all nutrients they need to create a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers get rid of their daily cal@@ orie intake to increase about 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research results point out that a higher cal@@ orie intake did not lead the only di@@ tic adaptation to the mothers . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted under the management of Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ ine College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet sh@@ ed@@ ged women actually protect the gen@@ es of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ors . &quot;
unfortunately a healthy diet of the child can affect the immune system negative .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ pe of the Spor@@ thalle
the council of Bern@@ ried appro@@ ves the construction cost for the 2.@@ 3 million euros expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof may be sh@@ allow@@ er for solar system .
the plan@@ ations for the long ers@@ ed trainers also at the am@@ rie@@ der Sport@@ s@@ grounds are pro@@ gres@@ sing step by step : in the recent Christian meeting the construction has been approved without large discussions .
&quot; in addition , the panel also decided to deliber@@ ate an application for the extension , &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; of the valid building plan . &quot;
&quot; for &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; it was the permission for a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , a &quot; pan@@ el@@ d@@ ach was said to be built with non @-@ mit@@ re First and Dach@@ stein . &quot;
&quot; the background of the planning is the intended use of the roof surface for solar systems : &quot; &quot; by doing so , we get a wonderfully large southern day &quot; , &quot; said Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the session . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; was again around the roof @-@ incl@@ ination that should be imposed from energetic reasons - unlike in the building plan - under ten degrees . &quot;
the volume of the hall is reduced significantly by it .
&quot; a &quot; liberation &quot; was therefore necessary because the building plan with respect to the roof @-@ turn does not permit &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; - whereby the am@@ pl@@ ist of the comm@@ is@@ at is usually rather cum@@ ber@@ restric@@ tive . &quot;
&quot; but at the gym , it is not a recur@@ ring project : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the gym at the sports centre is a joint project of the community and the SV Bern@@ ried .
these expenses are calculated for approximately 2.2 million euros .
subsidies are expected from school and Bre@@ ast promotion .
&quot; in the next process of proceeding , the construction fee for the 18 x 36 meters is now presented in the hall by the shore bure@@ au for the examination . &quot;
hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg goes to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg should be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016 .
at the same time Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is appointed new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au hospital .
the station and the majority of the employees drawn from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg with Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; this is confirmed by the surprising plans of hospital GmbH in the county , the coun@@ ten@@ se Andrea Jo@@ ch@@ ner @-@ Weiss . &quot;
&quot; however , a decision on these rules were the Supervisory Board , and the meeting conven@@ ed to be held on Wednesday , 23 September . &quot;
should the plans be implemented then all of the barely 50 employees will continue at hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the vast majority can take place with fishermen and the further existing inside station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the spaces are available .
&quot; employees who cannot be offered to Sch@@ ong@@ au , should be offered in W@@ eil@@ heim a workplace , so Jo@@ ch@@ ner @-@ white . &quot;
the employees were informed about the plans .
&quot; she has triggered a change of withdrawal by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has been the medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic and now changes to a private practice close to the hospital . &quot;
&quot; in the question , who is to take the follow @-@ up came according to Jo@@ ch@@ ner @-@ White , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; into the game , who said to take the lead and change it with his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot;
&quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au be@@ dev this in every case a &quot; &quot; re@@ valuation &quot; &quot; and a wi@@ dening of the offer in the field of &quot; internal medicine &quot; , &quot; said Jo@@ ch@@ ner @-@ white . &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for heart@@ land and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialised on the inside station on gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ologi@@ c diseases .
&quot; for the next two years , Fischer with his team , if the Supervisory Board intends to agree with both houses , until then over 35 beds next year , the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ el has finally been closed for almost 140 years . &quot;
&quot; until now , the circuit has been planned for 2018 in 2018 , as the current work was completed at the hospital of W@@ eil@@ heim . &quot;
&quot; coun@@ ten@@ se Jo@@ ch@@ ner @-@ white , which is also chair of the supervisory board , became rum@@ ours , after which the house , which is owned by the federal state , in future as an accommodation for asylum @-@ wat@@ ered . &quot;
&quot; I close it . as it goes on with the real estate , Jo@@ ch@@ ner @-@ White not say , there are several refl@@ ections . &quot;
currently there are a spa care of the Car@@ itas and a daily psychi@@ at@@ orial .
&quot; what has never happened to us , such an opportunity does not come back , &quot; says Fischer of the qu@@ asi @-@ move to the Le@@ ch , who has been received positive and very understanding . &quot;
&quot; a true perspective for the house , in which fishermen have been working as an executive office for over 30 years , did not exist . &quot;
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the position of medical director .
&quot; the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( formerly 100 beds ) was repeatedly threatened by closure , departments were closed , for example the surgery and the birth@@ days . &quot;
the Hand@@ b@@ aller of the Rhine @-@ Neck@@ ar Lion are requested today evening ( 20.@@ 15 PM ) at the Berg@@ isches HC .
&quot; the table leader of the Bundes@@ liga is in Wuppertal , the clear favourite with an occasion however does not exist . &quot;

refugees need accommodation : study war@@ ns about residential bra@@ king
the location on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
even more and more refugees are looking for affordable prices .
pressure on the market market is growing .
social housing is facing a challenge .
the distribution fighters in the German housing market have begun long ago .
&quot; with incoming refugees and seeking jobs from the EU push more and more people on a market , which is now over@@ loaded in many big cities . &quot;
they compete with a income of weak citizens around the last affordable housing .
&quot; to cover the demand for affordable housing , would have to build up to 400,000 new units by 2020 . &quot;
this outcome comes a study on the contract of the association &quot; social housing . &quot;
&quot; to compare : in this year , in Germany 26@@ 0,000 units are finished . &quot;
&quot; thus , 14@@ 0,000 apartments are missing . &quot;
refugees are no longer pl@@ ed@@ ged after the first three months of their stay than asylum @-@ seekers in an original home accommodation .
so many come up in the apartment market and rows up in the long queu@@ es before the apartment apartments .
&quot; according to statistical offices , in the last year less than half of all the asylum seekers have been made for rent . &quot;
the negative development of the apartment market is not just the rising number of refugees .
the study also makes significant failures in residential construction over the past years .
&quot; Germany has a housing deficit one , which will be larger from year to year . &quot;
&quot; elected in the metro@@ politan areas already around 77@@ 0,000 flats , su@@ ed Matthias Günther , author of the study . &quot;
many professional cities were therefore listed in large cities and mir@@ r@@ ored in WG rooms .
young adults stayed because of the built @-@ in apartment un@@ tarily turns to the Hotel Mama .
in the large cities the number of square meter per head declined in the past years for the first time .
&quot; to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; &quot; social housing &quot; &quot; suggests a rest@@ art . &quot;
and there should be new incentives to boost social housing .
this could be disp@@ ens@@ ed on the under@@ line tax and the property tax for funded apartments will be exposed .
&quot; in addition , it is necessary to make attractive tax @-@ friction options . &quot;
the subsi@@ dy programme for refugees of the state bank Kf@@ W is now well connected with towns and municipalities .
&quot; a good week after starting with 184 million euro , more than half of the amount had been estimated at EUR 300 million . &quot;
now the project could even be extended .
refugees have a free terrain : Croatia and Slovenia are organizing a corridor
&quot; Hungary is virtually no longer through Hungary , since getting more and more refugees select the way over Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb announces that its passage across Slovenia to go down without hur@@ dles .
&quot; Dan@@ ger@@ ous , the route is however dangerous . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia wants to communicate with neighbouring country Slovenia on the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees . &quot;
&quot; I talked to the Sloven@@ ian secretary and when it is necessary , we will organize a corridor , &quot; said the Croatian interior station Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already one of the Schengen zone .
the EU @-@ country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
&quot; after the deport@@ ation of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds refugees left for Croatia to go from there to Western Europe . &quot;
500 people have come across the border to T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian TV station R@@ TL . &quot;
Hungary had to flour@@ ish its border for refugees on the day of day .
&quot; new laws , which entered into force on the same day , make virtually flu@@ ous asylum procedures in Hungary virtually obsol@@ ete . &quot;
Croatia wants to let refugees happen .
Croatian minister Z@@ or@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic declared : &quot; you can go through and we are preparing for this possibility .
&quot; these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something . &quot;
but people who not want to live in Croatia
Croatian police took up the first refugees on border Serbia in Turkey in the morning .
&quot; most of the alli@@ ed media reported according to Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they came both by bus and taxi to the Serbian border town of Si@@ d .
immediately after their arrival she would have tried to arrive on foot across the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border the refugees cannot come across borders .
&quot; that is , the limit of other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the n@@ ine@@ ties . &quot;
Min@@ en@@ du@@ er should quickly create a safe passage way .
&quot; after Hungary , after the closing of the border no more refugees arrive . &quot;
on Tuesday the police went up to the police of 3@@ 66 .
just before the doors on Monday were there even 93@@ 80 .
the new Hungarian laws make tran@@ sc@@ ending and corruption to the border line as a criminal off@@ ense .
in the southwest of the village of Sz@@ eg@@ ed there were therefore 35 pen@@ alties .
the condemned decre@@ es of up to five years and deport@@ ations from the country .
&quot; according to indications of the immigration officer you have taken on Tuesday in the newly built &quot; &quot; Tran@@ se@@ ons &quot; &quot; total of 94 asylum y@@ ields , of which nearly all - 93 - at the most important transition R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
among the applicants are 13 families with small children and two elderly people .
at the Wednesday night there were 40 refugees from there .
&quot; however , no one does not have a view to get asylum in Hungary for asylum . &quot;
&quot; in Ot@@ toman , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; safe third country &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the red asylum seekers can be moved there .
&quot; in front of the &quot; &quot; transit @-@ zone &quot; &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke gathered themselves only a few hundred refugees . &quot;
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke begun workers to tidy up with them .
you gathered the rub@@ b@@ ish one to leave the t@@ enth of thousands of people in the past weeks on the road@@ side .
barrier must be dismant@@ led and one of the en@@ rol@@ ley in the border town was rebuilt .
to the goal of this re@@ building nobody wanted to express itself .
Austria after the closing of the border between Serbia and Hungary there are only a few refugees .
the country also has its border controls .
around the 20,000 migrants recorded themselves down to government areas but still in the country .
over 1400 people are waiting for the continuation of Germany over 1400 people .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning on the instruction of German authorities .
in clut@@ ches regularly met small groups of refugees on foot .
Mayor boo@@ sted &quot; Gest@@ ure &quot; across the border
&quot; we were after the bridge @-@ firm on Sunday with the clean up , when suddenly ten people were standing with rice off@@ ers at the entrance of the tent , &quot; says Wer@@ n@@ st@@ eins Mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; tourists , they wanted to move to Pass@@ au with the train . &quot;
&quot; because Germany was surprisingly surprising for the rail traffic with Austria on Sunday , but for them in Wer@@ n@@ stein concluded , the town@@ ships which immediately helped his assistance and took the cars together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars on the border into close trade Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; before we have visited the un@@ hop@@ ed guests only once , with j@@ ause and drinks . &quot;
&quot; we have said the same , we bring them to Pass@@ au by car . &quot;
&quot; that was for us a matter of course , &quot; as town@@ ships in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview . &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man did not take it to pass a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire@@ bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; this was very glad , so the town@@ ship . &quot;
&quot; the star@@ ring @-@ passengers were registered at the Sunday evening in Wels from an ICE to a regional train towards Pass@@ au , in order to re@@ assure that the rail traffic to Germany was rec@@ alled , but still try to try the border . &quot;
the local train was shut down at the Inn in front of the border in Wer@@ n@@ stein at the Inn .
in Wer@@ n@@ stein is the cross @-@ border generally high in the course .
the bridge @-@ firm linked to the b@@ av@@ arian neighbours on Sunday documented as a two @-@ br@@ en@@ ish sporty - organized by the Union Wer@@ n@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
&quot; that Victor Or@@ b@@ án now sent further points to us , is a log@@ is@@ tical result of a seem@@ ing sacred policy : &quot;
&quot; instead of helping in the camp of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , in order to help the establishment of structures , our Chancellor continued to be officially raised and publicly the position of the Hungarian government in the eastern nation@@ alism of the National Soci@@ alism . &quot;
suffering from these policies are not only those Austri@@ ans who are confronted now in the border areas with cha@@ otic conditions .
&quot; the refugees also have to find that the &quot; &quot; praised country &quot; &quot; which she invited and welcomed , nothing but another refuge@@ e camp . &quot;
&quot; it will become a major challenge , in the face of the continuing refuge@@ e currents and the close winter , in our decent conditions for seeking seekers . &quot;
and there will be even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;
Kon@@ rad in search of € 3@@ 5.000 inhabit@@ ant quar@@ rel
Kon@@ rad has full to do with the refuge@@ e kick .
Christian Kon@@ rad is as usual for his word weight .
the government has inserted the former palaces of Rai@@ ff@@ eisen Bank to initiate lod@@ g@@ ings for the thousand refugees .
the chaos in the first school of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already got a grip on .
&quot; we have no homeless more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported from his first success . &quot;
&quot; also the accommodation of 20,000 refugees came on Monday to Austria , be without great vor@@ tex , said Kon@@ rad and praised the organisational &quot; master@@ piece . &quot;
the Interior Ministry said about a &quot; crisis @-@ free situation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; overall , Kon@@ rad is expecting growth with a demand of 8@@ 5,000 quart@@ z in the current year . &quot;
&quot; to fulfill the number , you need to come up to 3@@ 5.000 accommodations in the next few weeks - 20,000 shall deliver the countries , 15@@ ,000 of the federal government . &quot;
&quot; should it be more refugees , we can do it . &quot;
&quot; but it is not a bot@@ tom@@ less pit , &quot; said Kon@@ rad . &quot;
with the state merchants he has already led talks .
&quot; these would have secured him , even for the upcoming refugees Qu@@ arti@@ ere . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Austria it works well , &quot; Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier &quot; said . &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Kon@@ rad .
&quot; tomorrow , there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born in this respect that the church will help . &quot;
&quot; great expectations made the asylum @-@ ordin@@ ator , also in the ORF action &quot; H@@ ops like we . &quot;
on the platform individuals can supply their accommodations .
&quot; furthermore , it is hop@@ ed for hotels that are empty during winter . &quot;
Kon@@ rad and Ma@@ ier critic@@ ised the standards for accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot;
&quot; in times of emergency , it could not be that Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ lat@@ ors must respect a certain amount of the hand @-@ holder or size of the fran@@ kness . &quot;
for a temporary time &quot; notation &quot; applies .
&quot; as opposed to the Interior Ministry is successful when placing is successful , con@@ forming with his experience . &quot;
&quot; I am an older gentl@@ eman , which you cannot say without any further face the un@@ truth . &quot;
persu@@ asion is his most important weapon .
&quot; Kon@@ rad and Ma@@ ier cause the Republic no cost , as they themselves . &quot;
your employees want to increase them between three and four .
the own Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ age has not been successful so far .
Kon@@ rad wanted to put a container on the Steph@@ ans@@ platz as an office .
&quot; however , there are no problems with the approval . &quot;
Linz calls for better sharing
&quot; first , no opening urban sports halls and other buildings like tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for keeping refugees will plan the city of Linz . &quot;
&quot; this is not necessary at the moment , since those affected are currently able to place without these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot;
&quot; however , for emergency purposes , further locations will be checked for their compatibility . &quot;
criticism shall be exercis@@ ed by the chief representative on the allocation of the refugees within the state .
other areas need to do their input here .
Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer : &quot; boundaries are not sealed &quot;
in a longer telephone call with the Bav@@ arian Prime Minister Horst Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer ( C@@ SU ) has state shareholder Josef P@@ enders ( VP ) on Monday the further steps of the refuge@@ e question .
Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer assured me that the German border cannot be sealed .
the continuation of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany remain unaffected .
&quot; however , there should be even the corresponding border controls . &quot;
special points with refugees in Germany will no longer exist .
the protective attempts would however be brought to Germany with regular intervals .
&quot; by the other EU Member States , P@@ enders once more reinforced solidarity in the refuge@@ e question . &quot;
&quot; that now Austria leads to controls in its borders , it is a logical consequence of the approach of the Germans for ag@@ itation . &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a question of time
the gener@@ alization of the &quot; New ship@@ yard &quot; in the lin@@ zer industrial foot@@ er is officially completed .
&quot; in four of the six floors of office and production buildings , the listed IT Group is assigned to the listed IT Group S &amp; T , the rest ( 2700 square meters ) is supposed to be rented to young , innovative businesses from the field of technology . &quot;
&quot; in IT , the clin@@ ician heads of our raw materials - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
he can imagine to invest in starting @-@ up companies in the New ship@@ yard and later also acquire what was qui@@ ver .
&quot; already from the start , S &amp; T with the new neighbors will now co @-@ operate a lot : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; 1.7 million euros were invested by S &amp; T in location , 3,@@ 3 million Euros from the Tech@@ Center , which is one third of the city of Linz , the country of Upper Austria and the federal government ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building is considered by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ centre .
30 percent of the 2700 square meter space in the building are already rented out for further 40 percent give requests .
lia @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ duc@@ ks opened a second business in the Arctic

&quot; this project had to shor@@ ten the 49 @-@ year @-@ year of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ gas market arcade , and eventually she has now evolved into the form of a further business local . &quot;
&quot; in the Fur@@ la @-@ shop opposite the shop , where they sold among other po@@ ckets , suitcases , shoes and fabrics as different manufacturers , now all about deriv@@ ates of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are now available from 75 euros . &quot;
greater bags and accessories cost up to 500 Euros .
since yesterday the new shop is in operation .
previously a couple of weeks ago was rebuilt .
&quot; but I have survived a long time , if I want to open one shop , &quot; says broad . &quot;
&quot; decisive for the decision was among others , that also the Fur@@ la @-@ producers who are in Bologna from the idea of a dedicated location , where only their manual bags were sold . &quot;
&quot; we are the only ones in the Gre@@ ater of Linz , which sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who has even Italian roots . &quot;
her fashion concern has been bro@@ adly given by her mother to the cradle .
most suitable for me when something develops and I can show new trends at high @-@ performance prices .
why so some woman can look at the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in decoration , the specialists can &apos;t answer with the last security . &quot;
perhaps it is because a nice bag has been upgraded of every out@@ fit .
the Br@@ ull@@ jes@@ macher from K@@ all@@ city
&quot; the Pf@@ al@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tru@@ mp came out of a place , whose inhabitants could be called for . &quot;
this property un@@ ra@@ ver also with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become the U.S. president .
Donald Tru@@ mp ( 69 ) is always good for law .
&quot; whether he is expressed in foreign affairs , journalists writing or scientific papers in the international crisis policy - the candidate for the U.S. presidential election gives you strongly against the election campaign . &quot;
and cuts well on it .
this is also registered in the P@@ äl@@ z@@ ic K@@ all@@ stadt where the grand@@ parents of the real estate has come up .
the New Yorker with the Fi@@ @-@ Ter@@ ur is a term for many in the Win@@ zer@@ dorf next to the Win@@ zer@@ dorf .
&quot; some in the 1200 @-@ habit@@ ual place , is related to -@@ y corners with it , &quot;
&quot; his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Palatinate : Donald Tru@@ mp , here in the election mode . &quot;
the K@@ all@@ municipal Simone Wen@@ del turned to a film about Tru@@ mp .
and what are vill@@ agers concerning the goal of becoming the more powers of the world ?
&quot; I think that is somehow exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in their terrible nature , &quot; &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; the native writer has a am@@ using documentary on the place and its famous ski@@ ppers , among which besides Tru@@ mp is also the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up @-@ family Heinz counts . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp , which is not known for compl@@ ement@@ arity , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
&quot; to the king of the heart , he did not put it there . &quot;
&quot; although it give respect for the performance of the family , but also tended to think that Tru@@ mp is already a bit of a big Moor@@ ish , &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; inci@@ dently the nickname , the K@@ all@@ ot@@ stadt in the radius , &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ jes@@ macher &quot; - about High German : the offer , says it . &quot;
Tru@@ mp is coming out of the village of Inn@@ es .
the Tru@@ mp &apos; Big story began to 1885 as the later grandfather and opened in the USA a local restaurant for gold gr@@ ac@@ ion .
main stone of the real estate portfolio were first real estate purchases in New York .
&quot; but the life of the grand@@ parents were not free from Trag@@ ic : your desire to return to home in his home , failed to the Bav@@ arian State , to which the Pfalz it belonged . &quot;
&quot; he did not record the Tru@@ mp because he was once held without a permit , the director of the Institute for the äl@@ z@@ ic story and folk festival , Roland Paul , said to the film start . &quot;
Tru@@ mp is the grand@@ son of a &quot; illegal out@@ flow . &quot;
that is contrast to the sometimes @-@ based statements of the desc@@ endants .
&quot; he had repeatedly been repeatedly called on import of Mexican immigrants in the United States , and called for the construction of a border wall to fight against illegal immigrants . &quot;
&quot; just as the polar , that is not so sympath@@ etic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant Tru@@ mp ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a born tru@@ mp , the op@@ a was born @-@ &quot; Heinz &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the win@@ eg@@ row@@ er in retirement sees the Americans more detached , &quot; he is always so out @-@ out . &quot;
does he believe that Tru@@ mp is about ?
&quot; this can I not imagine , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year old . &quot;
&quot; he never takes care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
&quot; pension Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ram@@ m mentioned as man@@ cher K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter , that a desc@@ endant of the family Heinz on a visit is something for the church wor@@ e , which generally did well . &quot;
&quot; this can I not imagine it from the Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; they f@@ aint it better if he does not v@@ owed the choice , for &quot; he has such a radical views , I do not know if that is good . &quot;
&quot; those who had been going to the age of his grandfather in the US had been as he would , &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are many more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ eder Sarah &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; my president is not it , &quot; says it . &quot;
and : &quot; the grapes are also ripe without the president of Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; bet movie , for the Tru@@ mp &apos;s news , have seen 12 000 Kin@@ og@@ ams , also in the USA are awakening . &quot;
the crown of Ram@@ sau in Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden is the first &quot; mountain clim@@ at village . &quot;

&quot; the final three voices are the same : Bachelor Sam - is the perfect man - but who will he choose ? &quot;
secret reveals ? ...
&quot; Lana Je@@ av@@ on @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki probably have apparently clearly revealed who wins The Bachelor wins . &quot;
&quot; the woman , at the Sam Wood after completing The Bachelor , was wrapped in the biggest secrecy . &quot;
and none of the three left bare girls will certainly not be inexpensive if she is the one that has received the last rose .
&quot; but when we with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and Lana Je@@ av@@ el Fel@@ lows on the day before coming into three two , you may have mist@@ ak@@ enly notice a reference to who the winner will be . &quot;
Sam Wood keeps its lips until the finale at the Thursday Festival
&quot; all three women ignored himself in ly@@ rical way why wood is the perfect man and therefore appeal his sense of humor , ambition , family values , and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; If not you , who should be W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; , &quot; could their answers to the game bo@@ ber who won the heart of the Bachelor &apos;s life . &quot;
Je@@ av@@ el @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki ob@@ sc@@ us both quickly - except yourself - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had an easy relationship with one another from day one .
&quot; from the moment when I went into the house and noticed , Sam@@ s energies , there I noticed that they were pretty compatible , and I have thought it throughout the course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah is standing on the ground with both feet on earth ; it &apos;s so much fun to be with it together , &quot; &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki &quot; . &quot; &quot;
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable together .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple .
&quot; from their view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the home to last week she made it clear that wood can be &quot; the One &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; once I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now subject to it &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and as she was asked , who wood choose to breed , when not them , there it was r@@ b . &quot;
&quot; I do not know if I can say it , &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the remaining girls in tune - it &apos;s a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and Lana .
&quot; the Bachelor will be broadcast on Wednesday , 19 : 30 p.m. , on Ten . &quot;

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
&quot; Detroit and Seattle showed great interest in his move to the United States - and there were many other teams who sent requests , after his impressive formal training day at the end of last year . &quot;
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and Trainer J@@ im Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a smart choice .
&quot; some trainers would have turned Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bank , when he lost a lack of lack , like the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by league League in his first P@@ unt Return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota . &quot;
but Tom@@ s@@ ula entru@@ sted his husband and gave them the next chance to return to a m@@ unt return and also to the current game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula still showed his true face in the locker room after the game .
&quot; instead of reve@@ aling his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team , he encouraged them . &quot;
Tom@@ s@@ ula thr@@ ust Hay@@ ne also public in his press conference after the game .
&quot; the 49@@ ers Sport@@ re@@ porter Cam In@@ man told that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special crew coordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who was asked to sit down his ver@@ p@@ atz@@ ed catch , and to take care of the next game . &quot;
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a p@@ unt which was restored in the first quarter of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
&quot; it was certainly not the start , the Hay@@ ne and its massive Australian Ge@@ ology had hop@@ ed for its N@@ FL Deb@@ ut . &quot;
Hay@@ ne left the playing field and excit@@ edly told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he couldn &apos;t imagine a bad start into its N@@ FL career
&quot; that was a thing that now comes before , one just takes care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot;
Hay@@ ne auth@@ ored the cuts with his Orig@@ in Deb@@ ut at that time in 2007 when a pass at his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a Tr@@ y for Queens@@ land .

&quot; of course , the subject of asylum will be super@@ vised the camera . &quot;
Ai@@ w@@ ana called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria and as it did during the war wars in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
&quot; thus it does not go any further , we have to speak of the causes , &quot; said the Free voters boss . &quot;
de@@ ed asylum seekers do not want to post@@ p@@ one the Free voters as soon as possible .
&quot; therefore , Ai@@ w@@ anger also required more staff for the administrative dishes that are responsible for asylum classes : &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum judges , &quot; said Ai@@ v@@ anger . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ W Chef cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed that several states do not be consistently consistent , &quot; we applied nation@@ ally uniform standards of federal states . &quot;

4 people killed after polic@@ emen rubber mig@@ rant on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal shoot
&quot; four people , including a four year old boy , were killed in Southern Nepal when the police rubber mig@@ rant into a crowd , that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , said an official on Wednesday . &quot;

&quot; 20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were wo@@ unded , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the used rubber bul@@ lets , known by which they can kill , but that they are traditionally used as a de@@ adly alternative , evi@@ dently a good death rate . &quot;
&quot; the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nep@@ al@@ ous@@ als , where members of the ethnic group of M@@ adh@@ esi say that new provinces come to decrease in the context of the proposed new constitution . &quot;

Google has an un@@ usually personal approach for the disclosure of the don@@ key on his blog .
&quot; instead of making a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee , who had escap@@ ed with their family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old , about their personal experiences . &quot;
&quot; at our journey there were many dark train and bus trips , as hunger , Dur@@ st , cold and fear , &quot; wrote them . &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; but since the refugees and migrants crisis grew in Europe , many people are searching for des@@ per@@ ately by aid . &quot;
&quot; donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations offering help to refugees and migrants , doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot;
Google said that the funds will amount to $ 5,@@ 5 million to G@@ oogle@@ .com / a total of $ 11 million .

for easily overweight dia@@ be@@ tic can be helpful in weight loss .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for easily overweight people with type 2 diabetes may last for a new study at least five years .
&quot; it is still too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes to live longer with diabetes after weight loss surgery longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments . &quot;
&quot; the mort@@ ality data require a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of losing weight surgery , which has a guideline for the new study in J@@ ama Surgery . &quot;
weight loss or Adi@@ pos@@ as surgery use different methods to scale the size of the stomach .
you reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s own capacity to absor@@ b food .
Adi@@ pos@@ is has proven to be efficient operations for the treatment of type 2 diabetes but most studies have been carried out with people who are mor@@ bid cas@@ ket with a body @-@ measure index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
&quot; BM@@ I , a basic level of weight in terms of size , is regarded as normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24,@@ 9 . &quot;
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered to be obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ gov / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study the researchers from Tai@@ wan@@ ans ( Sh@@ eng General Hospital Data , which they have collected since 2007 in a study and compare two types of Adi@@ pos@@ as @-@ Surgery - to medical treatments for type @-@ 2 diabetes in people , which were easily overweight . &quot;
&quot; the average BM@@ I among those who undergo this operation , sank from 31 to 24,@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the BM@@ I stayed with those who do not receive surgical diabetes treatments approximately just at 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those who undergo a surgical procedure , it appears at 36 % the diabetes disease totally and at 28 % partial . &quot;
diabetes is fully consolidated in the medical @-@ treated group as a result of diabetes completely only by one percent and in part in only two percent .
&quot; in addition , the results obtained with controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de cholester@@ ol and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholester@@ ol &quot; generally better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; found the authors out . &quot;
the researchers also watched the patient @-@ blood flow of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c which is reflected the blood sugar levels over time .
Hem@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c is best held under 7 percent to write the researchers .
&quot; after surgery , the average hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c level decreased by around 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , in the medical treatment group it remained stable at about 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as you are reflected in the improved ha@@ vo@@ ise A@@ 1@@ c level - decreased not the mort@@ ality in five years , such as conduc@@ tive researchers Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also negoti@@ ates average results for the two kinds of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ yp@@ ass @-@ surgery Group had lost more weight ( 18,@@ 7 vs. 14.2 ) and hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c ( 3,@@ 1 % vs. 2.@@ 1 % ) and has@@ n more a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 46@@ ,@@ 9 % vs. 16,@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study reveals no survival of the surgery after five years , there is evidence from a study of heavy people in Sweden that performs to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study , it was in obes@@ e people who undergo a Adi@@ pos@@ as surgery to die approximately 29 percent less probably in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried to conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study did not prove beneficial for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone , it is so@@ othing for people with an BM@@ I under 35 , which are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation is lower in this low BM@@ I Group is , without having higher risk of death or kid@@ ney disease , she said . &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start to take weight seriously once the patient focused with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we wait too long before we get people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think once they have accumulated these genetic changes , which have linked their bodies with obesity and diabetes , is a revers@@ al really hard . &quot;
Lov@@ ing plays in H@@ uns@@ r@@ ück
&quot; it is an issue that is more evident in fiction : a young woman , too school and un@@ sight@@ ly , meets after years the warm warm of their youth again and this fall in love with them . &quot;
&quot; thus also in the recently created novel &quot; &quot; often we are not so &quot; by Luisa &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; beyond the love story , the novel might be interesting for H@@ uns@@ r@@ er readers , for he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages . &quot;

it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot take place all the refugees , told the Dalai Lama and he added that the real solution of refuge@@ e crisis in the Middle East . &quot;
the Tibetan @-@ Buddh@@ ist leader demanded to end violence in the home countries of refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of continuing refuge@@ e crisis at the beginning of his ten day visit in the United Kingdom in his speech to the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford which dedicated to ethics studies .
&quot; it demanded that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be put before the interests of the individual nations , or even continents . &quot;
he also emphasized that the reaction of the West European countries is ad@@ dic@@ tive to the refuge@@ e crisis but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; despite the Dalai Lama of Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts in addressing the crisis , he indicated that there is only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long term solutions like a real peace and genuine development , mainly by education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , we must think of how the killing is reduced in their countries . &quot;
we need to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the application of force has never solved these problems , he added . &quot;
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of violence and commented also George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack of September 11 and turned out that the non@@ violent response of the US became a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
&quot; after September 11 , I expressed my compassion in a letter of President Bush , and I told him , the way to solve this problem lies in non @-@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he put violence one , and that has been declared unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
four @-@ floor increase of intake of hand@@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants by children in the last 4 years
&quot; plastic control centers in the U.S. report on an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children below twelve years , which swal@@ low alco@@ ho@@ lic and inf@@ ect@@ ants such as Georgia Po@@ ison Center . &quot;

&quot; children come more and more frequently to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in the emergency , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot;
&quot; he said that some children dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants drink , while some do it to impress their friends or for a mut@@ ation on social media . &quot;

younger children can be worn by attractive dis@@ inf@@ ants of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the most attractive ( hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those who are perf@@ umed .
&quot; there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with stra@@ w@@ berry , vi@@ tic@@ ul@@ - and orange scent , which are very appealing for children . &quot;
suspension dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
particularly in small children can already cause a few sprit@@ es to alcohol det@@ ox@@ i@@ fication .
&quot; it is most focused alcohol , &quot; told Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the Gi@@ ft@@ not@@ ebook , medical director of the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Sender Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you would not let si@@ p wh@@ is@@ key around , but people leave these hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in reach of children , and when children come there , then it &apos;s a quick way to consume lots of alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ year girl , recently taken four spra@@ ying of looking after stra@@ w@@ berry th@@ rot@@ ting bul@@ lets at school , was taken into a emergency treatment . &quot;
&quot; her blood @-@ alco@@ ho@@ g@@ ation was 179 , twice higher than the threshold that is applicable to an adult under law , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency medical practitioner , who treated it in the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah , their words and was not able to go when they arrived at the emergency . &quot;
&quot; doctors survived them overnight in a separate nursery at signs of brain trau@@ ma , since the girl had fallen by the alcohol and got the head increased , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey . &quot;
&quot; this was very fri@@ ght@@ ening , &quot; &quot; Or@@ tor@@ ia Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ ahu , mother , CN@@ N . &quot;
there could be fat@@ al to my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ free products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and to store heat dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants out of the reach of the child .

why I am going to be an Ex@@ ec@@ ution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
&quot; a little later today , except with a late legal intervention , I will watch how a man is brought to death . &quot;
&quot; when it happens , and I hope that it isn &apos;t done , I will sit in a crowd @-@ gallery at the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , when Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is ex@@ iled by the po@@ ison@@ ing . &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
&quot; the invitation was already carried out in January by its best friend , and although I was sho@@ cked , I agreed . &quot;
than the day closer I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
&quot; I agreed , because I thought it would be a good opportunity to tell the whole story about the death penalty . &quot;
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists should see execu@@ tions in the USA , and as often more applications are available as seats available , an impeccable lot@@ tery will be held to decide who is chosen . &quot;
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
&quot; who is selected , who will be watching it emotion@@ ally . &quot;
I cannot do that .
&quot; I will sit with Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps close to the bottom line , with whom I developed my own relationship over the months with teleph@@ ones and a two and a half hours visiting . &quot;
I like the guy .
&quot; we lau@@ gh many times when we speak .
&quot; the prison authorities say that I can not be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remember all details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma appe@@ als to Twitter to give up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prison@@ er like he wants it and you get access .
I lay with her .
&quot; they cle@@ ared that they could have form@@ ulate more better , but it still thinks it is wrong what I do . &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had problem with some of the things I said and written .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I would not do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can always remove me from his list of witnesses .
&quot; but he wants that an international re@@ porter is present , to write there . &quot;
if he dies , he thinks that public relations work in the movement against the death penalty . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ ware , a Re@@ porter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will be sitting next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the case , please hear the series of pod@@ casts . &quot;
I will not go here again for all details .
I cannot say with security that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is inno@@ cent .
his acts after the ass@@ ass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ esis would make him guilty to be a benefici@@ ary of the act .
&quot; but I believe that a strong probability exists , that he is not guilty of murder . &quot;
I feel certain that there is no enough evidence to justify a fat@@ ality .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from that perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be truly objective .
there will be other re@@ porters which you can consult for this .
&quot; what you will get from me is , what it means to see a man dying an unnecessary death . &quot;
man after the hum@@ id police @-@ hunt @-@ hunt from the C@@ anning River to come
the C@@ anning V@@ ale polic@@ eman remained dry when he sp@@ ake the man from the C@@ anning River .
&quot; a trial of a man by Per@@ th who hang the police was in@@ effective , when he was found in the shallow and sum@@ p@@ ice water , only a few meters from a police officers , who tried to catch him gently to return to the bank . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was launched on Tuesday to a household her@@ nia in pel@@ ag@@ ro .
&quot; when they discovered the susp@@ ects , tried to escape them toward C@@ anning River . &quot;
but he did not come too far .
&quot; he stood in the water and said &apos; I do not come out , kom@@ m and f me &quot; , &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too excited to make his unique thing , therefore he turned into a reliable tactics . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
master@@ alist @-@ foot@@ player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
&quot; in 2006 , C@@ ous@@ ins deployed its car into the dit@@ ch to escape a alcohol control and then tried to swim over the Swan River . &quot;

Peter M@@ oody claims that st@@ ew@@ ards tried to escal@@ ate him and threatened to end racing sport
Peter M@@ oody claims that st@@ ew@@ ards from racing Victoria tried to install a sp@@ y in his st@@ ables in the past year and thre@@ aten the race right away .
&quot; he quoted to the st@@ ew@@ ards and the integrity of racing Victoria and claimed that they made a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai due to a race course treatment , the last stra@@ w @-@ hal@@ m on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; M@@ oody said Fair@@ fax media , that he always tries to do what best for the racing sport and he found himself in difficult conditions , when it was about the positive co@@ b@@ alt test in Li@@ dar@@ is that he cannot explain . &quot;
&quot; he had returned to 18 months because of the pi@@ on@@ age demonstrations , and did not want it to see it , like too high suspension of grapes . &quot;
&quot; I had before nothing to say about it , and I have wa@@ ited a long time to eat , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything at once comes out , &quot; said M@@ oody . &quot;
you know that it continues .
&quot; sometimes you have to re@@ acts , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said . &quot;
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; I want to go data about it , and I want my owners think that I try my best for her . &quot;
&quot; if they start thinking , I do not do that , then I should not be more trainers . &quot;
I don &apos;t have to think about what I do with my license .
had M@@ oody the bom@@ b in an interview with rac@@ ing.com let go in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the integration process had tried to balance his barn .
&quot; before eight@@ een months of Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stew@@ art in a room with a man - that I will be asking if I asked - and for him doing a job in my st@@ ables , to deliver information about what I do in my st@@ alls , &quot; said M@@ oody at rac@@ ing.com . &quot;
they believe obviously I am a che@@ at .
&quot; if that is the case , they should certainly be touched on their har@@ es , because they attempt to grip down with me . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , Eh@@ inger . Chairman of the RV@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , current president of the RV@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ und@@ ry , current CEO of RV@@ L , were aware of its time and are still today . &quot;
should I bring me to the opinion that it is personally ?
&quot; he may behave the RV@@ L , and perhaps does people outside trainers who are responsible for what is going on in the industry ? &quot;
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
perhaps people out there that I am .
&quot; maybe they must take my license and kick me up , and I have no doubt that what I say , she now wants to think about it . &quot;
&quot; but I have now arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and this makes me sad . &quot;
this really makes me sad .
I will put pressure on them and push it to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the Fru@@ its @-@ levels of trainer have built up with the long term co@@ b@@ alt examination at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching led to that he can throw his license above the table . &quot;
&quot; m@@ oody , best known by his preparation of the incomplete master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , the race day @-@ day treatment rule &quot; ridicul@@ ous &quot; &quot; after a pack of mud or sound had been applied to the horse as opposed to the rules out@@ stretched . &quot;
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; I must take full responsibility for it , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one of my employees has mist@@ ak@@ enly mud on the leg .
it could have been like this last night .
it could have been the whole day yesterday and so was .
but it was also like the night before .
m@@ oody could be faced with a three int@@ eger disp@@ quali@@ fication for the treatment with the pack of the race day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who do these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; we all see one that we need rules , but here one has gone too far , &quot; said M@@ oody . &quot;
man after the refu@@ ge
in the weekend the police arrested a man after a cl@@ ash with a cycl@@ ist and subsequent refu@@ ge in Cob@@ ram .
the cycl@@ ist was delivered with helic@@ opter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after it was taken by a car on the Sam@@ ray Valley highway .
&quot; the police said , the driver continued to drive without stopping in order to help the last driver . &quot;
&quot; on Monday , a 50 year old man from N@@ ath@@ alia , turned to the police in Sh@@ ep@@ part@@ on . &quot;
it is expected to be charged due to cur@@ ses and abandoned help and acc@@ used because of other traffic .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ am@@ y proposes against ri@@ vals on claims due to er@@ ect
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ am@@ y has critic@@ ised criticism of the Tac@@ tic as an &quot; agenda Set@@ ting &quot; from two Premier League favorites of the NR@@ L .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the arbit@@ rat@@ ors will have allowed the Storm @-@ players &quot; E@@ war &quot; with his team during the high storm of victory in Sydney on Friday night .
&quot; Bris@@ bane Bron@@ cos Trainer Wayne Ben@@ nett made a little disgu@@ ised note to the Storm team , after his crew had made the final victory of North Queens@@ land w@@ boys on Saturday evening . he called the game a &quot; model &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two of Queens@@ land did not &apos; good &quot; in R@@ ingen . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ am@@ y defended the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his crew and said that she is concentrated on her &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; in Tac@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ am@@ y added that the criticism of two leading trainers in his crew tac@@ kl@@ ed him confident , since it rep@@ ented that she was worried , taken by the Storm team . &quot;
&quot; that always appears on - I did not hear that Tr@@ ent Robinson talked about Ring@@ gles , when they gave us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ am@@ y on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; I can guarantee that we have changed none of our def@@ ective system or techniques in the whole year . but in the last six weeks we have provided our contact with Tac@@ kl@@ es , and this trend has provided for us the trend revers@@ al . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and has obviously a great team to train . he is therefore most likely to get used to losing , so it was a bit &apos; shock for him . &quot;
it &apos;s strange as this always appears at this time of year .
&quot; Bell@@ am@@ y has attacked the &quot; &quot; exciting soccer &quot; &quot; and its ment@@ or reminds on that ben@@ net@@ ts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dragons the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; &quot; boring &quot; &quot; football . &quot;
Wayne speaks of thrilling football .
&quot; he was compared his playing on Saturday night with our Friday night , and how advent@@ urous her play was , &quot; said Bell@@ am@@ y . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was a boring team cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed , and the Wayne said that he will take care of a sh@@ it tri@@ ck . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team who can play , and that we look as exciting , especially his young players with their speed . &quot;
&quot; this is the Ball@@ game , which you would like to play , when you have this kind of players . &quot;
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt , so that they can play like them . &quot;
&quot; I strengthened confidence because they say these things , because they are a bit worried that they have to play against us . &quot;
six weeks ago they were not thinking about it when the Big Games was about .
Bell@@ am@@ y also pointed out that the game Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters a higher result achieved than the game Bron@@ cos against Cow@@ boys .
&quot; the game of Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I have not seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts in our game , but this is an exciting game ? &quot;
or are you doing a break and do not have any points to take ?
for me it is the game plans .
&quot; in case of mention , it means that in a phase we will be able to meet them . &quot;
the Storm team enjoyed this weekend as they have won the right to receive either North Queens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks on the next Saturday night in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next day morning .
Ser@@ bier with 200@@ .000 US damage to drug size
&quot; a man who could thre@@ aten to be a lifetime sentence due to his failure , in possession of 40 kil@@ ograms Kok@@ ain , which became to be considered to be Queens@@ land , was released against a deposit of 200,000 . &quot;
&quot; Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vi@@ ć , 29 , was one of the five men , the last month were arrested , after the Federal Police boats were found 100 kg of the dru@@ ff on the Yacht Sol@@ ay from South America over V@@ anu@@ at@@ u and in August in Co@@ om@@ era . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vi@@ ć was observed , as he found his fellow def@@ endants at the marina in the course of noon and later at Café Co@@ om@@ era A@@ house where the police took 40 kil@@ ograms of the drug in a Toyota echo . &quot;
&quot; despite a possibly lifetime punishment for trying to possess a commercial set of co@@ ca@@ ine , argu@@ ing the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole lot and that in the café could have been a harm@@ less reason . &quot;
&quot; the judge at the Supreme Court of Justice , Peter F@@ agan , was worried about the escape from Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he is often back to Serbia , &quot; said the Court on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in case of a case of law , he lied the police about his place of stay . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic@@ s mother and step@@ father had a security deposit of 200,000 dollars as security in common to achieve its release . &quot;
&quot; after reading the ei@@ di@@ ous explanations of the two people it is clear that the edition of a security of 200,000 dollars constitutes a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; said judges F@@ agan . &quot;
&quot; but that alone will not suff@@ ice , to stop him from it , not to appear , war@@ ned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vi@@ ć was released against security deposit , under the conditions that he announces his Australian and his Ser@@ b Pass , lying down at the police and de@@ ceased to a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;

St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used by phone from girl to lo@@ op@@ ile to send pictures
&quot; a pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es used the phone of a 11 year old girl , to request pictures of child abuse . &quot;
&quot; St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the phone of the girl , when this was asleep , log@@ ed into an online mess@@ aging @-@ service , by which he received a series of un@@ stable pictures of children that were sent to him by another user . &quot;
the girl was wo@@ ke later on and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping H@@ og@@ g .
she saw it through ; found the conf@@ using messages and al@@ arms immediately her mother .
&quot; the police took care of and saw the five images analysed , analysed computers , which were found under the address and discovered &quot; &quot; Web research &quot; &quot; concepts for the search for un@@ decent pictures of children . &quot;
&quot; H@@ og@@ g said then to the officials that he did it , as it would lead to &quot; p@@ est op@@ ile in the internet &quot; and he then gave , a polic@@ eman to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are her . &quot;
&quot; the government of E@@ ili@@ dh Rober@@ ts@@ on said the Dun@@ de@@ e Sher@@ i@@ ff Court : &quot; he said , it would be a diction - that he is ad@@ dic@@ tive to fri@@ gh@@ ten people . &quot;
&quot; he admitted that the search on the computer were done by him , but said that he would be to be , a polic@@ eman to be a polic@@ eman to fri@@ ede . &quot;
&quot; he was asked about his di@@ version with the unknown person , who sent him the pictures and he asked to send even more photos . &quot;
he said that he did so to praise them .
&quot; he said he was sick in my head , when he d@@ row@@ ns , and said , he w@@ ool to see images of r@@ ape and murder . &quot;
&quot; MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was in the tre@@ m@@ bling and on the wines . &quot;
it then saw the un@@ decent pictures on the phone and con@@ front the acc@@ used there@@ with .
&quot; the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the acc@@ used computer and Play@@ station used to speak with girl , which saw a lot of younger . &quot;

&quot; def@@ endant Gregor S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g does not appear in the Register of sexual perpet@@ rat@@ ors , since one can ar@@ gue that &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; in his going to be found . &quot;

connecting cells differ from small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees will be picked up with the major control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many t@@ ess@@ ays made out of fear of discovery and removal of the people increasingly at smaller border cross@@ ings
&quot; on the Austrian side , he said a spokes@@ person for the Federal Police . &quot;
along the Border Me@@ au Inn and Rot@@ ary @-@ Inn have been up more than 1000 refugees in the districts of Pass@@ au and Rot@@ ary @-@ Inn .
you were walking on bridges and shr@@ inks to the German site .
they are taken from the Federal Police and passed on to the registration .
&quot; at the Munich Main Railway Station , on Wednesday again there were a mark@@ edly more refugees to the German police at the beginning of the weekend at the beginning of the week . &quot;
&quot; up to 8@@ pm , around 700 people have arrived in the state capital , said a speaker in the morning . &quot;
after the re@@ introduction of controls at the German @-@ Austrian border had reached the town on Tuesday of 17@@ 59 .
Stuttgart : fo@@ oth@@ ills of Tro@@ pen@@ gu@@ m &quot; Henry &quot; in the southwest expected
mete@@ or@@ ologists in front of pet@@ rels in the south @-@ west of Wednesday night afternoon .
&quot; because of a low pressure area over Western Europe currents currently warm sea air , the German weather service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart . &quot;
&quot; the powerful insi@@ der was the fo@@ oth@@ ills of the &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; , &quot; which was pulled over the Atlantic in recent days from the B@@ ermu@@ da Islands . &quot;
fier@@ ce stor@@ ms and th@@ under@@ storm are expected especially in Baden .
&quot; according to DW@@ D is still until Thursday , also in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ia Al@@ b and in the Lake Sea coast with gu@@ sts of 60 to 90 kilometers per hour . &quot;
on Friday accordingly more the sun can be looked after .
the mass does it : every two years show off the high@@ ways at the I@@ AA their novel@@ ties .
&quot; 2015 , most of all the movement at the compact dimensions , which is currently especially well used . &quot;
cars from the compact class are currently particularly asked : around 28.@@ 1 per cent of new appro@@ vals dropped out according to the fuel segment ( KBA ) alone in August on this segment .
this is reflected on the I@@ AA ( public exhibition 17th to 27th of September ) .
&quot; between all the fut@@ uris@@ tic concept vehicles and new upper class , and luxury cars will be presented to many new compact models this year . &quot;
&quot; one of the biggest pre@@ mat@@ ing for the German auto industry is Opel Astra , who will be at the dealer in the autumn . &quot;
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model , &quot; &quot; said Opel @-@ Thomas Neum@@ ann at the fair . &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; that the volume model was also well sold , the new Astra is not too much more expensive too . &quot;
&quot; Opel is getting a start below the largest competition of the VW Golf , which starts at 17 650 euros . &quot;
the current Astra is starting at 16 990 Euros .
&quot; at the Astra comes with a new 1,@@ 4 liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the H@@ esse and Pet@@ rol engines come from 70 kW / 95 PS to 147 kW / / 200 PS to which also for the first time also three @-@ cylinder gas@@ oline engines . &quot;
unlike the main competi@@ tor VW Golf and Ford Focus there was the Opel Astra initially only as fifth .
&quot; the second variant will follow in the spring of the Com@@ bi , which is also already visible on the I@@ AA . &quot;
and what is there to be new compact cars next to the Astra at the I@@ AA ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault is the fourth generation of his Astra match Mé@@ gan@@ e into the race .
at the fair the Mé@@ gan@@ e is only seen as a five @-@ fifth back in a conventional and a stresses sporting GT @-@ version .
&quot; in the trade he comes in the beginning of next year , then also as a comb@@ i . &quot;
Infin@@ iti : entirely new in the segment is Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nis@@ san W@@ inner will find its position in the strong growing segment with the new model .
&quot; in doing so , the compact Infin@@ iti is fit with its curved lines fully into the design line of the brand . &quot;
the base model will get a pet@@ rol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
&quot; the price is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 PS or 125 kW / 170 hp . &quot;
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno which celeb@@ rates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
&quot; the model with gas@@ oline engines , including a newly developed 1,@@ 0 @-@ Liter @-@ Tur@@ ot@@ or and an output of 82 kW / 111 HP . &quot;
the maximum torque is 170 New@@ ton meters ( Nm )
sales start of the bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
&quot; 4 : not completely new , but overall the compact @-@ class dell DS 4 , which is seen on the I@@ AA . &quot;
outside the designer of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n Abl@@ er was first hand on the front part : here the cooler is drawn again and the modified head@@ light with LED technology was equipped .
&quot; in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system was moderni@@ zed above all the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system , reduces the number of buttons made by a touch screen and the first Ap@@ ples Car@@ Play integrated . &quot;
add on the I@@ AA in the compact class a series of transform@@ ations and new variants like the refresh@@ ed Mercedes A @-@ class or the Peu@@ ge@@ ot 308 G@@ TI .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ T@@ egel : five square meters in cell are un@@ worthy
&quot; the Federal Constitutional Court has given an ex @-@ prison@@ er of Justice T@@ egel , who was accommodated in a small cell in a small cell . &quot;
&quot; because of the injury of their lives , prisoners always pay attention to financial compensation , if they are accommodated in small cells . &quot;
this has decided the Federal Constitutional Court in an end on Wednesday .
the suffer@@ ers may even then hope for money if only a few days were locked in the too narrow rooms ( A@@ Z . : 1 BvR 112@@ 7 / 14 ) .
&quot; thus , a Ex @-@ f@@ ain@@ ling was successful in Karlsruhe with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe : he was lod@@ ged into a single plot with some five square metres of floor space ; the toil@@ ette was not separate . &quot;
&quot; after that , the man , who according to the information of his palace is now back on free feet , inside a bigger cell . &quot;
his conc@@ e@@ dic@@ tation owing to the un@@ worthy liability conditions against the land of Berlin ad@@ mitt@@ edly .
&quot; but the constitutional judges ho@@ ve the judgment of the Chamber of Kam@@ mer@@ ich Berlin , and returning the case of renewed testing to it . &quot;
they see the human dignity of the man .
Kam@@ mer@@ gericht now decides on the amount of compensation
&quot; even if for legal reasons , from the un@@ ques@@ tion@@ able period only a few days of arrest for the compensation is a matter of compensation , it was said . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , &quot; a decre@@ e of the legal protection of the personality would fear . &quot;
the Chamber of Kam@@ mer@@ gericht must now clarify the amount of money @-@ compensation .
the constitutional judges have often been strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past .
&quot; they mentioned only in April a prison@@ er , because he was naked in a cell . &quot;
&quot; human un@@ worthy is a decision of 2011 , according to the multiple use of a cell without separate toilet . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday also the Berlin Constitutional Court also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had filed an un@@ worthy opponent in a parallel case in November 2009 . &quot;
&quot; the former Kl@@ äger was made over three months open every day between 15 @-@ 21 hours in a similar cell , as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case . &quot;
the Berlin pris@@ ons have also come into the head@@ lines over the past few weeks .
&quot; prisoners are therefore always gone by 23 hours , the ag@@ gres@@ si@@ veness will rise , even to be ten@@ se because of the ten@@ se situation . &quot;
&quot; according to information on the judicial service point 21 places in T@@ egel , because of young lack of lack , 19 should be cancelled . &quot;
Angela Merkel and the refuge@@ e policy : &quot; we create the &quot;
immigration of refugees is a tremendous challenge - the German Chancellor is decided to accept it .
what comes to Germany ?
&quot; some 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany according to forecasts of the Federal Ministry of Defence this year to Germany , according to statement by Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to accommodate a million refugees . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated vig@@ il@@ ant in view of the unusual challenge : &quot; I say again and again : we can create this and we create it .
&quot; in addition to Germany , the following overview is given . &quot;
&quot; other forecasts between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the German Federal Ministry of Defence ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el @-@ Institute ) apartments annually - and for the next five years . &quot;
&quot; that is almost twice as much , as has been built ( 250@@ 000 houses ) . &quot;
&quot; dramatically is the lack of living space but above all in paid rental units : annually from 60@@ 000 to 80@@ 000 social housing from the rental price , and about these particularly cheap apartments will also apply for refugees . &quot;
employee Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) therefore would like to double the promotion of currently 350 million to one billion euros .
&quot; much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing annually , and this agreement should have to invest a total of 6.4 billion euros per year . &quot;
scientists and the Austrian ministers agreed that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in housing construction .
&quot; according to estimates obtained by the Institute for Employment Research and occupational health , 55 percent of the refugees in Germany can be wor@@ ded over the long term . &quot;
&quot; however , the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualifications to help them with getting started , Claudia Walter , project management for integration and education into the Ber@@ tel@@ smann foundation . &quot;
but for the integration of refugees is decisive whether they find work in Germany .
&quot; work is the key for social contacts , for the esteem in the participation company , but also for the self @-@ esteem of the immigration , says Mig@@ r@@ inter @-@ Diet@@ rich Thr@@ us@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , it has been a political shift according to the Thr@@ es@@ hardt , the labour offered for refugees about the recognition of work . &quot;
&quot; while there was an auction offered for asylum seekers from up to five years , this in November 2014 was reduced to three months as well as the Residen@@ cial light , the asylum seekers . &quot;
&quot; in the society - also because of the lack of skilled labour , it is being en@@ forced the view that refugees should be able to access the labour market . &quot;
a large hur@@ dle for access to the labour market are missing German skills .
&quot; until now , there is no sufficient range of general and calm @-@ related language courses . &quot;
studies also show that jobs are most often taught by personal contacts .
the build @-@ up of networks is therefore corresponding to the thr@@ ust of the kingdoms of the work@@ flows .
&quot; the Berlin school administration knew that only a few refugees parents spend their children to the Kit@@ as , estimated it ten to 15 percent : &quot; &quot; for the root of parents , it is only once very important to group together the family , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ is@@ bar , speaker for youth and family in the Berlin Sen@@ ats@@ verwaltung . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , to convince the family of the advantages of the Cas@@ ita , the management of hand@@ outs in different languages . &quot;
&quot; should the need for educ@@ ators increase strongly through the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity - by enabling more technical schools . &quot;
in the countries students are prepared without the German language classes in welcome classes on teaching classes .
&quot; however , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no lack , says Be@@ ate St@@ eger from the Berlin school administration . &quot;
the student &apos;s student estimates that around 20 percent of refugees wish to study in Germany .
&quot; in principle not a state asylum seekers or thr@@ ashed the study - the only exception was so far Berlin , Interior Frank H@@ ank ( CD@@ U ) has now placed his attitude now . &quot;
studies of study refugees could become reli@@ eved of access to the higher education institution .
&quot; for refugees with a residence permit or D@@ ul@@ ing will not receive services after the asylum seeker , if they start a study . &quot;
&quot; the latter are generally not a BA@@ Fö@@ G , because they are not under the circle of the eligible persons . &quot;
&quot; refugees have had to live in Germany for four years , to advance the BA@@ Fö@@ G of the search term , of January 1st , 2016 , this co@@ il@@ ot is shortened to 15 months . &quot;
&quot; these financial markets must also be closed , invite Steff@@ en Kra@@ ch , Berlin secretary for science , and the German Studenten@@ werk . &quot;
the students should immediately receive BA@@ Fö@@ G .
&quot; Islam will continue to play a more important role in future , as many refugees are Muslims and for many , religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should gradually conclude the same rights as they have the churches , and the existing state @-@ churches right to develop a new state religions . &quot;
&quot; important would be the foundation of an Islamic welfare state , which takes care of the new arri@@ vals . &quot;
the rights also belong to duties .
&quot; in this way , the representatives of Islam must agree to clear person and be willing to work with the state in many areas and acc@@ esses some control possibilities . &quot;
this also includes willingness to work against religious fundament@@ alism .
&quot; the President of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ e@@ ye@@ k , expressed the concern about the concern of religious conflicts may also be entered into Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted to handle such conflicts in Germany immediately , have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ rische Rund@@ funk . &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
integration will continue to be a topic of the whole society in future .
&quot; this will also change the majority of the majority , the reduction of discrimination and racism . &quot;
Germany has - as a result of European decisions - since the decades of a decade ago we had a anti @-@ discrimination and a general gender equality law .
&quot; but it is slowly learning how the N@@ SU @-@ the @-@ series showed , in the police and the authorities the r@@ acial motive . &quot;
&quot; equal opportunities for all : what mig@@ rant organisations and stakeholders have to commit long to international agreements like the anti @-@ rac@@ ist Convention Deutschland , must be in the coming years if the country remains peaceful and its new citizens want to use their new opportunities - for the benefit of all . &quot;
&quot; in general , Germany , in general , the previously expected refugees provide healthcare , he says vice @-@ president Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; what affects Man@@ - Power and capacities , we create it , &quot; &quot; said the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
&quot; however , there must be more money flowing in into the system . &quot;
&quot; to avoid cor@@ rug@@ passes , calls for Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery , to avoid all com@@ ers equal to registration health tickets . &quot;
some services could later be counted later with the federal states .
&quot; in the long term , it is highly ques@@ tion@@ able , as many people see in the limited power catalogue , which see the asylum @-@ rated law . &quot;
otherwise the doctors can create mainly the language barriers .
&quot; already so far , the Berlin Health scholars The@@ a Bor@@ de proved to be communic@@ able by mig@@ rant drugs about their diseases as other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in clinics , also in medical practice , interpre@@ ter would have to be over , demands them . &quot;
&quot; also helped many refugees , but even with more general medical contact in the emergency @-@ patient . &quot;
and with another diagnostic look .
under refuge@@ e camps around there are significantly more un@@ qualified disabilities ; and for the young people go about HIV education .
&quot; with the partial other disease pictures , German physicians reported from their training , but clear , mean Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation , or tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis are not so hard to recognize . &quot; and as for the cause of trouble , be perhaps id@@ l@@ est even reli@@ ev@@ ing in sight . &quot;
the Syrian Army had a highly developed educational system ; several refugees were even doctors .
&quot; however , to do practic@@ ing them , however , they must show their qualification and ref@@ uted further tests . &quot;
&quot; at least half the refugees in Germany in the coming refugees ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) is wor@@ ically ill , most suffering from a post traum@@ atic stress @-@ resistance or depression . &quot;
&quot; particularly fragile be refugees , Diet@@ rich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot;
a recent published study of the TU München shows that each fifth Syrian refuge@@ e refuge@@ e have been trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
&quot; who is suffering from the post traum@@ atic stress and stress @-@ resistance , among other things suffer from so @-@ called Fl@@ ash@@ backs with resp@@ ir@@ atory , ver@@ tig@@ o , heart ras@@ en and death . &quot;
further symptoms are sleeping and centr@@ ation disorders , strong fri@@ ght@@ fulness and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; to prevent that the symptoms would be chronic , be an early treatment necessary , declared Mun@@ z . &quot;
&quot; so far , only four percent of psych@@ ic sick refugees get a psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; although psychological disease , asylum seekers in the social duty apply a proposal for psych@@ otherapy , but it usually takes several months to work . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in the toil@@ ers mostly kind workers or doctors who are not trained for the mental illness , decide whether a therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this lead frequently to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z . &quot;

Sim@@ bab@@ y@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe keeps the wrong address in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe ( Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa El@@ t@@ ester &apos;s guide , fell down by a po@@ dium at the start of the year . &quot;
&quot; he remained un@@ released , but the video of the case quickly became popular upon social media . &quot;
&quot; the opening of the Parliament was also tested by claims from members of the opposition , that they have received anonymous death threats , and they have been war@@ ned to accompany the address by Mr Mu@@ gabe ( publisher ) . &quot;
&quot; last month they spread him , and interrupted him during his speech to the situation of the nation in parliament - this is the speech which he repeated in Tuesday . &quot;
the spokes@@ man of the movement for democratic change ( movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent gon@@ ese said that seven op@@ positions politicians have received SMS messages on their phones that they war@@ ned that he war@@ ned Mr. Mu@@ gab@@ es An@@ unci@@ ation .
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &quot; &quot; death &apos; , &quot; he said journalists according to Mu@@ g@@ ist &apos;s speech . &quot;
&quot; it war@@ ns the members concerned that imm@@ unity in parliament will end , and as soon as they leave the parliament , their parliamentary imm@@ unity are no longer effective . &quot;

H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will reduce up to 30.000 jobs
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to establish more than 25@@ ,000 to 30.000 jobs in the frame of restructuring and income efforts in the services of the company .
HP will go to two listed companies later this year and separate the computer and printer business from its fast growing company @-@ hardware and its service activities .
&quot; the expected job expansion leads to a burden of more than 2,@@ 7 billion dollars in the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; this restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chairman and Chief Executive who shall be guided the unity of separation . &quot;
H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise becomes more small and stronger than it is HP today and we have a wide and deep@@ est portfolio of stores that support businesses in transition to a new style of business .
as a stand@@ alone company we are better prepared than ever to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than 50 billion $ annual turnover and is focused on providing previously un@@ attain@@ ment , integrated technology solutions for companies , such as an explanation of the company . &quot;
it was divided into a company that in the 1930@@ s by graduates of the Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard was called the birth@@ place of the Si@@ licon Valley .
HP has run a massive restructuring to cope with the conversion of traditional PCs towards mobile devices .
&quot; the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the most recent in this field , based on the conviction that tight companies focused a better performance . &quot;
FC Arsen@@ al @-@ captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates just before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb have to stand behind the last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; Wen@@ ger stressed Mr Wil@@ sh@@ ere , that it is only September and if his rehabilitation proceeds according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play before Christmas again before Christmas . &quot;
&quot; this optim@@ istic scenario means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will surely be missed at least the next four games for England , and in view of its history its participation in the next summer is certainly uncertain . &quot;
&quot; the great dis@@ grace of this present problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate an@@ kl@@ et@@ le , and then had returned to his old swing during the season . &quot;
&quot; this kind of injury is not threat@@ ening the career , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; it is one bone , which is not good healing . &quot;
it is not a major matter .
that was just an accident .
&quot; it was not in connection with his an@@ kl@@ es , or with the injuries that he had previously had . &quot;
&quot; this may be true of a medical point of view , but like Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the related danger of further injury , always when a player is trying to return to the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops a uncomfortable pattern .
the study of Prime Minister In@@ ju@@ ries Ltd is distinguished by 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in just 65 out of ar@@ sen@@ als 157 Lig@@ asp@@ bles in the past five seasons .
&quot; the wid@@ est picture of ar@@ sen@@ al is that they have been in six out of eight game times since 2007 / 08 of one of the two Premier League clubs , who have to record the most vulner@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but ar@@ sen@@ al believes that an improvement in the injury rate is going to last during the last season . &quot;
&quot; sometimes if you come back from an injury , you have a sus@@ cep@@ tible time period , a time when you must win your body and win combat power , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome .
&quot; I hope His body will stabil@@ ised , I am confident that he will do it and he will run a career from the way he deserves . &quot;
ar@@ sen@@ al starts his Champions League in the Wednesday night against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham @ rut on next Wednesday and Wen@@ ger presents itself a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not travelled to Croatia which means that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta have to start .
Wen@@ ger also can start with K@@ ier@@ an Gi@@ b@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Th@@ eo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and to the players who need it , a little break , said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; although ar@@ sen@@ al are clear favour@@ ites , through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is one of the ranks with the biggest in@@ tim@@ id@@ ation in Europe . &quot;
Dynam@@ o is also un@@ be@@ aten after 41 games after the &quot; un@@ defe@@ ated &quot; campaign in the last season was started .
&quot; the stadium was sh@@ aken by an earthquake on Tuesday , where the Rich@@ ter@@ sk@@ ala 3,@@ 2 were measured . &quot;
this year was the 10th anniversary in Zagreb .
&quot; Wen@@ ger is the opinion that ar@@ sen@@ al has drawn up the teaching of the past season with the Champions League structure , and has been driven away from the distant hope with his management to his career for his first w@@ ok@@ al triumph . &quot;
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it has never worked at ar@@ sen@@ al .
&quot; we were very close to it , but on the other side I am long enough in business to be realistic . &quot;
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ amer . &quot;
Friend@@ s@@ fest : the com@@ edy @-@ show that gave us serious lessons about men &apos;s friend@@ ships
&quot; the lack of similar performers in shows is evident , especially in terms of how the need for men to open themselves , now even more des@@ perate than ever before , such as su@@ ic@@ ide in young men on a 15 @-@ year @-@ high . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important matter of death for men at the age of 20 to 45 in Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to tackle the problem , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Ag@@ ainst The Mis@@ er@@ ign Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ r ( calm - campaign against a her@@ edit@@ ary life ) 2015 as the year of the man , with the aim of asking the culture in question , trying to seek help if they need them . &quot;
friendship is the heart of the struggle to master this challenge .
&quot; a recent study with more than 2,000 high school students with de@@ press@@ ants represented firm that if the suff@@ erer had enough high percentage of friends with a healthy mood , doubled its chances on recovery . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , hal@@ ves a circle of spiritual healthy friends the risks of mental problems . &quot;
but of course you have to have also made friends so that a friendship can work .
&quot; in the age of dealing with social media , with its emphasis on substance , the in@@ compatibility of the response is often more important than an important contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital life have the need of strong , viable and successful to appear , doubled , even if in reality the isolation . &quot;
&quot; super@@ ficial success is dominated by the domin@@ ating psych@@ ologists ex@@ tr@@ ic values ; money , image , social status , all at the cost of intr@@ insi@@ c values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper . &quot;
&quot; and like a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire , recently said , money can really do not buy . &quot;
the Beautiful at Friends was that these focus was placed on the head .
&quot; each character was not defined by his work , but by his personality , which sh@@ iny by the interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the humor of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler frequent hu@@ gs , moments when shooting in cozy Ses@@ to and the longing for R@@ oss of Rachel - all that came out of the knowledge that men can relate to each other , even if they often go back to explore completely their feelings . &quot;
&quot; like a staff of phone care , I explained : ... &quot; my audience &apos;s role for people who feel de@@ pressed and self @-@ reli@@ ant , has really shown me how to make the smallest interactions between friends make a difference . &quot;
&quot; the men who contact us , feel often not able to speak with friends . &quot;
&quot; I deal with the old &quot; &quot; I &quot; &quot; by doing &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect as the feeling that it is perceived as weakness if you talk about problems . &quot;
&quot; friends is one of the shows that occurs to me in my mind , when I try , long @-@ long forests and mechanisms . &quot;
it presents clearly the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
&quot; so very my objective outw@@ ard status over the telephone can help people in moments of des@@ pat@@ ation , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
&quot; and so , if you decide on this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ fest alongside the celebration of the day completely rest@@ ruc@@ tured scen@@ ary , why do not take your friends to drink in Central Per@@ k with you . &quot;
&quot; or , even better if you are sitting around in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and say hello to him . &quot;
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent on com@@ edy Central from beginning to end - the total 236 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to z@@ m@@ ower
angel Di Maria celeb@@ rates celeb@@ rates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson &apos;s Cav@@ ani according to his hit against Hun@@ edo@@ ara .
di Maria meets his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to put in Malmö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson &apos;s Cav@@ ani thought the course as Paris Saint @-@ Germain its Champions League Season with a very comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malmö in the Prin@@ ce@@ bro@@ stadi@@ on on Tuesday started .
&quot; di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G players , who brought the French master to the way , but afterwards she missed a number of occasions even before they finally achieved its advantage than Cav@@ ani in the 6@@ 1st minute a head . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k , in the group A , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish master , as they didn &apos;t only seek the qualification for the N.@@ B rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter @-@ finals in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they got the points , it was not a pl@@ ass@@ ay of Laurent Blan@@ cs , with Zlat@@ ni I@@ bra@@ him@@ o@@ vic@@ s left before the gate . he was later started in play against his home town team and against the association by which he started his illustr@@ ative career in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or up@@ ward in the Champions League . therefore , it is a good start to win 2 : 0 to create our enemy problems and look back relaxed even though there are certain things that we have to perf@@ ecting in the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot;
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we have not yet achieved one or two additional gates . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic returned after its violation in one of three changes in the Paris team , which could hold on the weekend of 2 : 2 Un@@ decided on its own place against Bordeaux in the First League . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ inian wing has been referred to as the man , the PS@@ G was introduced to the next stage in Europe , when he ran over the last month of Manchester United , and he pointed out why , when he entered in Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Malmö defence , before going to Johan Wil@@ and pass beautiful in the long corner of the net . &quot;
&quot; however , someone believed that PS@@ G would win a great win , that was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malmö , the Cel@@ tic in a play @-@ off hit to reach this level , entered into An@@ u@@ ff with nine nationalities in the field and was opened with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in Central @-@ area . &quot;
&quot; but besides a shot of Nik@@ ola Dj@@ ur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who goes far in Kevin Tr@@ apps P@@ fo@@ sten during the 3@@ 4th minute , they used a little bit in the attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G itself sometimes arose , with some mis@@ sibility and bad ab@@ uses , not least from I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic , who was not least by I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic , who was not less than five trials alone in the first half and then abandoned , after Cav@@ ani had put him after the re@@ boot . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless he pointed a lot more skill , when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic , whom William Maria was turned into a turning record , which was driven by Wil@@ de@@ e in the 5@@ 2nd minute ... &quot;
&quot; the second gate finally fell short after the hours brand thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ er had achieved its sixth seed , after I@@ bra@@ him@@ al@@ ovic had f@@ aded out a left f@@ lange of Max@@ well . &quot;
&quot; this ended all the thoughts that Malmö to go back to the game , and only a great intervention of Wil@@ and from a short distance to stop David Lu@@ iz to stop David Lu@@ iz , able to stop the final result before the replacement player eg@@ z@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi became a gate in the end . &quot;
&quot; the trainer of Malmö , age Har@@ inen , announced later that PS@@ G played a class on his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December . &quot;
since then we have played only in the Swedish league which did not have the same level .
the qualification @-@ games are not enough . &quot;
hut from Paris !
it was a great game of them !

&quot; professional clim@@ bers and guidance of Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero was the first Ath@@ l@@ ete , who won the American Nin@@ ja Warrior on Monday evening and took home the Grand Prix of 1 million $ . &quot;
&quot; the competition show , which ended straight forward their 7th season , had never experienced a contest participants who could get all stages of his obstacle course . &quot;
&quot; during the season @-@ round , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off B@@ ritten , until the finale . &quot;
the final problem belonged to climbing on a 75 feet long vel@@ cr@@ o in 30 seconds .
B@@ ritten by completing the task within time which he was the first Ath@@ let ended the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja Warrior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero ended this challenge full three seconds quicker , which made him the winner . &quot;
Cal@@ di@@ ero said with E ! messages still after a hard drive victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of 1 million $ . &quot;
&quot; I mean , it is amazing to think about it , I have never earned over 10,000 $ or life , &quot; said Isaac ! about his p@@ ile money . &quot;
so suddenly .. how I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the leader producer K@@ ent We@@ ed continued with The Hollywood Re@@ porter , to discuss the finale and why B@@ ritten , although he was the first part of the course , not just any prize money . &quot;
according to the rules the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; if there are more than one fin@@ alists , he receives the one with the quick@@ est time , &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; how much money is a wonderful price and life changed , he gets the great gr@@ ati@@ fication . &quot;

he is just as happy to have done what he did .
masses of awards received from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; If I should be be@@ aten by someone , then I am glad that it is Isaac . &quot;

Detroit Tig@@ ers s@@ anders in Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ A@@ PO@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly fun for the Detroit tiger .
&quot; once again , they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the tiger is on the last place in the American League Central . &quot;
the Tig@@ ers reduced to their role as a sp@@ o@@ iler and played this part in Tuesday perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in Tar@@ get Field .
the T@@ wins turned up a chance to climb up within a game half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League game .
&quot; for Detroit , if only for one night , it was a return of the three letter F Word that has been so hard to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all vic@@ tories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers managers from Brad . &quot;
tiger Bo@@ ek@@ do Simon inv@@ ok@@ ing his early offensive support in Detroit three times in the first two inn@@ ings once again in the sixth and then again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) proposed 6 times in one 1 / 3 inn@@ ings and allowed three rats .
it was only his first successful start to his last nine games .
&quot; I want to end this year off , &quot; said Simon . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to throw each game in bul@@ l@@ ull , and therefore I will concentrate entirely in the game . &quot;
the K@@ ig@@ ni@@ red Tiger @-@ Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns with his first R@@ BI@@ s since the middle of August .
it was the first Tri@@ er @-@ hit game of Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against the Seattle was held on 6 July .
&quot; he has made my te@@ ak good s@@ ay@@ ings , &quot; &quot; said algorithm . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at the ( cream training ) , saw clearly better in the bul@@ locks , and he put it directly into the game . &quot;
&quot; with three ro@@ us at the end of the seventh interior , T@@ wins had their best chance to get back into the game . &quot;
the Center F@@ iel@@ der Byr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton was closed the inning @-@ line with a double on the left field line .
right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks reached a pl@@ unt and Simon brought his second bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the Link@@ sh@@ anders Bla@@ ine Hard@@ y .
&quot; hard@@ y over@@ ran the only man , with whom he was confronted , in front of the des@@ ig@@ ni@@ ed R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ Schlag@@ mann Miguel S@@ ano , who drew a two @-@ run @-@ run @-@ run @-@ run . &quot;
with a pair of run@@ ners and the end @-@ run the second bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor launched the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor to a Double Play .
it was that in the major League leading 27 times in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ters made a double play
&quot; after Detroit was added at the end of the ninth inn@@ ings a Insurance Run , the wall made a R@@ BI @-@ double against the C@@ loose the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the level of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; however , the right handed out , however S@@ ano at three pit@@ ches for its fifth function . &quot;
Detroit benef@@ itted to the pre@@ lu@@ de of the game from one or not moving P@@ hil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the Tig@@ ers obtained three ro@@ us in the first two inn@@ ings against the law@@ ful veter@@ an that had been st@@ amp@@ ed before the game of the viol@@ ated list after having been missing for more than a month .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I have liked &quot; , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt better than I put it and noticed that I would create some pretty good pitch as in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; after they received in the first the Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ bat@@ ter , H@@ opp@@ y gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler . &quot;
&quot; a two @-@ out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z , who made a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game . &quot;
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z won his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the Run@@ ners in the Scor@@ ing position .
&quot; the third Bas@@ eman N@@ ick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right side , made a further run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was cast out of the game , when he tried to get to the third , which the threat ended . &quot;
the Tig@@ ers presented in the second part achieved a One @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a two @-@ out single from Center @-@ F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose to 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; that was a great blow , &quot; &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot;
he did not take very well but he got the right place .
&quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch @-@ Coun@@ t , achieved no points in the third inning before it was replaced by the Rel@@ ie@@ ver @-@ handed A.@@ C. Ach@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; at Hu@@ gh@@ es , there were three of us at six hits and a walk with four stri@@ ke@@ outs . &quot;

Ischgl : German military measures in Syria an option
&quot; the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ gl@@ inger , has military measures with German participation in Syria for a possibility . &quot;
&quot; I think the more deci@@ de@@ dly thinking about military action options should not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; he threw the European States &quot; &quot; collective imagination &quot; . &quot; &quot;
four years ago that the Kel@@ so had gone to a military stake in Germany .
&quot; now the conflict is wearing to our front door , &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot;

Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann present a special summit in cooperation with several other EU leaders for next week .
Germany had begun with temporary border controls on Sunday .
the EU states have not yet to agree on a common approach to the crisis .
the EU &apos;s interior ministers want to take on a special launch of another 120 000 refugees at a special summit on the coming Tuesday ( 22 September ) .
&quot; in view of the strong refuge@@ e set in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the first input and distribution of the people . &quot;
&quot; the federal government , in cooperation with the countries , announced Merkel in the late afternoon of almost four @-@ hour consultations with the Prime Minister in the ch@@ anc@@ ellor &apos;s office in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; Merkel under@@ lined , those people , the prot@@ ection@@ ate , would like this also . &quot;
&quot; yet , who do not have a job @-@ spec@@ tive , can also not be in Germany . &quot;
this conception was divided into the round .
&quot; the ch@@ anc@@ ellor stressed the state as a whole , now to cope with &quot; huge force &quot; . &quot; &quot;
for thousands of distr@@ au@@ ght refugees have now stuck on the Bal@@ ans route .

almost 500 years after the Reformation there is now a Martin Lu@@ ther Square in Rome .
&quot; in the presence of the President Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino , on Wednesday the name of the park on the Opp@@ io hill was bap@@ tised in the name of the German reform@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; he is now honored as &quot; &quot; German The@@ ologi@@ ans &quot; . &quot; &quot;

Ham@@ mer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gol@@ d@@ plated ) Dor@@ nen@@ kr@@ one is one of the principal drives to be called Ot@@ mar Old for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bi@@ bel@@ lied .
in the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which is now released with splendid pictures . &quot;
at the beginning the picture was formulated for Ot@@ mar Alt who was formulated in 150 motives about their very personal inter@@ pret@@ ations of bibli@@ cal stories on paper and canvas .
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative shapes have received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
&quot; on the contrary , it is adapted to the respective topics , it can be quite dark . &quot;
&quot; about three years Ot@@ mar Old wrote to his Bible project , for which he made a subjective artistic selection from the many theme areas of the &quot; book of all books . &quot; &quot;
&quot; originated are cycles , which devote themselves topics such as cru@@ ises , pl@@ agues , bi@@ ds or pat@@ ernity . &quot;
&quot; there@@ with , he immediately fascinated several partners : that applies to the Lu@@ ther publishing house with his the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler publishing house with its main focus on art books . &quot;
and especially the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost who is on the basis of the painting with the respective Bible passages .
&quot; he was interpreted by Ot@@ mar Alt O@@ bel@@ gi@@ ers , and so into the lo@@ ot , into current connections . &quot;
these texts are as ob@@ struc@@ ted mirror of painting .
&quot; they are nestled between the original Bible county of Martin Lu@@ ther , and a sentence of the artist , which were formulated his very personal thoughts on the specific situation here . &quot;
the gem@@ stone @-@ band has Golden Let@@ ters .
&quot; so , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old equals twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high level of intimacy .
&quot; emotions were ultimately to trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Old , 1940 in Wer@@ nig@@ ero@@ de in 1940 , born in Wer@@ nig@@ ero@@ de in Berlin , comes from a family who belong to the strict prot@@ est@@ an@@ tic rulers . &quot;
&quot; so the up@@ bringing happened already with the rod , &quot; remember Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot;
I tried to work out this to be able to carry me back with the Lord &apos;s Father again .
&quot; his second concern is to help art in a fast pac@@ ed time : &quot; the perception of imag@@ ery is characterized by re@@ cl@@ ame , and that is loud . &quot;
symbol@@ ism is now executed .
artists have a different pleasure and pleasure to show things .
pictures have always something my@@ s@@ tical and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ os@@ aur . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Old wants to let the viewer back into the pictures &quot; &quot; rh@@ einf@@ all &quot; &quot; to let them work , discover and feel the force they have : &quot; the image looks for its counter@@ part . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost and on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , has always been &quot; an lovers of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts art : &quot; I like , as he compreh@@ ends with his images . &quot;
&quot; I have carefully chosen to compreh@@ end the Bible completely , but that is selected for him , also mysterious themes . &quot;
&quot; this was no work on eye level , &quot; said Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text explains just &quot; . &quot; emerged in the Bible . &quot;
&quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from Lu@@ ther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to strengthen his life and to find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( bibli@@ cal ) language of love and responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - hard copy and can@@ v@@ ases - is presented for the first time in an exhibition that will be opened on November 15th at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung .
construction starts for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn
&quot; plans made , place found , company commissioned to model the world @-@ hill for a round trip : one year later everything was completed - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X train was finally finished . &quot;
&quot; failures in politics and administration provided for Ver@@ dr@@ uss , especially among the residents who did not toler@@ ate the train . &quot;
&quot; so , hill de@@ ported , new place - now with formal planning and application for building permission . &quot;
&quot; the permit will be made in October , the first community of the Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck will now share in the child and youth affairs committee . &quot;
&quot; I hope this year has never happened , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it can then be started without &quot; &quot; another memorial &quot; &quot; with the work at the former indoor pool . &quot;
DF@@ B intensified commitment to refugees
&quot; the DF@@ B expands its commitment to refugees from 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga focuses on the weekend a clear sign . &quot;
the football re@@ acts to the sur@@ faced situation in Germany and sec@@ ures its policies in tackling the upcoming problems .
&quot; I think this is the greatest challenge of our country since the re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there can no one say in principle , that goes without saying , I have nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; that must be of interest in every single particular topic , this subject has been to get a handle , &quot; said DF@@ B @-@ Chef Wolfgang N@@ ier@@ s@@ bach . &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September he was keen to discuss the refuge@@ e situation in Germany .
&quot; I am next Wednesday at the ch@@ anc@@ ellor and tre@@ ach@@ ted there the state Minister , Mrs Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the ch@@ anc@@ ellor . &quot;
&quot; so the topic will certainly play a central role , &quot; announced &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the football would be able to win and w@@ ool .
&quot; however , the key turn@@ out must put politics . &quot;
the German Soccer League has therefore extended its invent@@ ories &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &apos; to extend four years .
&quot; about the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us Braun series we ensured that this programme will continue until 2019 , &quot; stated N@@ ier@@ s@@ bach at the edge of the U@@ EF@@ A conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
also some of the Bundes@@ li@@ gi@@ sts support this program .
&quot; already this weekend , the 36 Pro@@ fi@@ ver@@ a will set a clear signal when they run on the left side of the stamp instead of the usual Ma@@ en@@ logos ( Herm@@ es ) the print &quot; &quot; We help &quot; &quot; # &quot; &quot; welcome &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we also want to make it clear that everyone should help , where and how they can only , &quot; said Lever@@ kus@@ en &apos;s Sport@@ sman Rud@@ i Vö@@ ller of the &quot; &quot; Photo &quot; &quot; ( Tuesday ) and drew his project as a matter of course . &quot;
&quot; the refuge@@ e @-@ drama is each one , nobody seems to take away . &quot;
&quot; we can kick @-@ Bundes@@ li@@ gi@@ sts , no , we have to use our appeal , our influence and use our possibilities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
&quot; H@@ offen@@ hei@@ ms , Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent character of the League . &quot;
for the EM @-@ qualification game against Hungary on this Friday the national team of the women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
N@@ ier@@ s@@ bach describes the support of refugees as &quot; a large joint work of German football . &quot;
that all 36 licens@@ ors have had their own projects in their own locations would be great .
&quot; just as great is that small and smallest members are , there , too . &quot;
&quot; the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome , which we spent , is lived in football . &quot;
&quot; this is of immense importance , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; this year , the association , together with the DF@@ B , and the German Federal Government will receive 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees . &quot;
&quot; the verses have been retri@@ eved the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; N@@ ier@@ s@@ bach &quot; . &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP @-@ pres@@ st@@ ef loses an eye
&quot; the flag@@ ship of Europe &apos;s greatest software , Bill Mc@@ Derm@@ at@@ ter , has subsequently lost sight of several reports by storm the beginning of July . &quot;
&quot; with the accident of his brother in the house of his brother in the USA , he would like to have fallen into a water fro@@ sted in his left hand , reports the &quot; &quot; economic week &quot; &quot; on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; he is almost dist@@ ressed , was impot@@ ent , has then come out to the street - this he told us so last week , quoted the &quot; Wi@@ fe &quot; SAP @-@ co @-@ founder H@@ asso Platt@@ ner . &quot;
Mc@@ Derm@@ at@@ ly would like to work out of her job .
&quot; beginning of October we meet before the Supervisory Board in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot;
the 54 yrs old managers are at work and are fully operational .
&quot; Mc@@ Derm@@ at@@ el announced in an interview with the &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; ( Thursday nights ) , he will come back to Germany again and will continue to the software Group . &quot;
&quot; I am full for SAP , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course , I was in a regular contact with the Supervisory Board and his leader H@@ asso Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Derm@@ at@@ ly of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Derm@@ at@@ tr@@ ench between Germany and the US , since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP office in Wall@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; whether it is important to go to the public with such a personal history , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; : &quot; everybody can happen something like that . &quot;
&quot; important is to stand up again , when you have fallen . &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ ars @-@ Sp@@ pilot Mag@@ n@@ erhof except Ge@@ fe@@ cht ...

football : Bv@@ B without re@@ us against Kras@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in gate
in Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund we loved all hopes on a com@@ eback by Marco Re@@ us in the first group &apos;s game of Europa League .
the National player will also be missing the table leader of the Bundes@@ liga as well in the du@@ el with the F@@ K Kras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7 pm / Sky ) .
&quot; we cannot rely on him unfortunately , &quot; Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; whether Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ f at Lever@@ kus@@ en , the BV@@ B @-@ coach was open : &quot; we expect a return from it to training on Friday . &quot;
&quot; in view of the high burden of his pros , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change on the Re@@ us position . &quot;
so he announced a change on the door@@ step position .
why does Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller got the seat of Chief ke@@ eper Roman C@@ ki .
&quot; he exercis@@ ed on a absolute top level , &quot; praised the football teacher the World Champion . &quot;
&quot; whether Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller has been used for use in all Europa League games , however , Tu@@ ch@@ el left openly . &quot;
&quot; with a high probability , it will also be the second game . &quot;
&quot; the for@@ ged statement by co @-@ player Re@@ us , that the final @-@ fight for the BV@@ B in the Europa League will be the goal of understandable : &quot; &quot; fur @-@ player Julian W@@ eig@@ l &quot; &quot; is not that wrong . &quot;
I think we have a good chance to get the title .
Rob@@ oter@@ au@@ tos : the government wants the leadership to Germany
Germany ought to be fron@@ tr@@ un@@ ner after the will of the German government when changing the car with technological innovation .
&quot; Bundes@@ liga was decided on Wednesday a Strategic Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( C@@ SU ) , which includes investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure . &quot;
Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the Autom@@ esse I@@ AA from a &quot; new mobility era . &quot;
automated and connected driving will increase road safety and ensure less stress - Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said .
&quot; he also wants to discuss the topic with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states , together with representatives of the industry on the I@@ AA . &quot;
the strategic comm@@ issions of the traffic Ministry is stres@@ sing the importance of the mobile broad@@ band structure and a long @-@ standing envel@@ ope on digital radio .
an testing of new technology is currently a test circuit on the 9 motorway in Bavaria .
&quot; in order to give the driver &quot; &quot; no additional det@@ ention risks &quot; , &quot; the federal government wants to examine the legal framework conditions and where necessary to adapt to the new developments . &quot;
&quot; in this way , Germany is designed around for example internationally to use the maximum peak speed for self @-@ driving cars from 10 to 130 km passenger kilometers above . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Federal Government will also apply to a change in the Vienna Convention which has so far only sees the people as a driver . &quot;
&quot; when automated driving , the car takes over the guide , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger . &quot;
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
&quot; according to one of the Member of the Economic Department , the study will be highly automated driving on motor@@ ways up to 2020 . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , driving vehicles on public roads can only be expected far after 2020 . &quot;
&quot; added value in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions in Germany , the authors of the study for 2025 to around $ 8.5 billion . &quot;
&quot; the digital networking of the P@@ k@@ ws can lead to greater security and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said the SPD @-@ Congress S@@ ören Bart@@ ol . &quot;
&quot; however , the question of liability in accidents and the security of the personal data of the drivers must be clari@@ fied but clari@@ fied . &quot;
still the Germans are skep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
&quot; one on Wednesday at the AA unit survey of the For@@ se Institute on behalf of the Test System DE@@ K@@ RA will result in the result that only eight percent of the Germans believe that autonomous cars are expected to take over the next ten years , 32 percent do not expect it at all , 31 percent do not believe in this . &quot;
&quot; in France , 21 per cent of the inter@@ vie@@ we@@ es from 2025 to 2025 with aut@@ on@@ om driving cars , in the USA 33 percent . &quot;
&quot; anyway , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to leave itself completely on a self @-@ driving vehicle . &quot;
&quot; after the acquisition of the digital network BI@@ T@@ KO@@ M , only seven percent would agree to cut down control over the entire trip on all roads . &quot;
&quot; on the highway , that could at least 15 percent in flowing traffic , in the St@@ au 45 per cent . &quot;
almost every Fourth would then leave the control under no circumstances .
B@@ oll says team@@ - and double @-@ start with table tennis @-@ op
the Düsseldorf trade fair does not want to fight with the title of September 25th up to October 4 only in the single .
the final decision should be handed down at the latest on September 22 .
&quot; that is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the boys have experienced it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; but we are strong enough , even without Timo the title , &quot; &quot; bund@@ led trainers Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ head during the EM @-@ training in Düsseldorf . &quot;
B@@ oll was at this time the flight agreed on for a long @-@ term sponsorship at the same time in China .
the 34 year old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; without Timo is the disadvantage , we are now no longer a clear favourite &quot; , &quot; stated single @-@ Europ@@ em@@ eister Dim@@ it@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot;
&quot; Ham@@ el@@ ner , who carries the S@@ etz@@ als in J@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , but also rec@@ alled to the EM 2013 in Sch@@ ang@@ at . &quot;
&quot; back then , Timo also lack@@ ed , and we become European masters . &quot;
&quot; this is what we should ori@@ ent ourselves , &quot; explained the world @-@ tran@@ e @-@ fifth . &quot;
the English Football @-@ National player Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United has had a serious injury on the right leg .
at the Champions League game at the PS@@ V Eind@@ hoven was met the def@@ enders at a Tac@@ tic von H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Moreno .
the first diagnosis was spent at the 20 year old fellow women from Bas@@ tian &apos;s clim@@ bers on a rail b@@ ok@@ ing .
Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for a delight .
it is a mixture of a great fashion show and a w@@ ax@@ an@@ figur@@ en ridge : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich .
&quot; the Highlights : window man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins , which look like thanks to video proj@@ ections , humane . &quot;
&quot; they bear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who was built among other things with Mad@@ onn@@ as stag@@ out@@ fits to the great star of the Mo@@ des@@ ene - and hence he put men in Roman hi@@ des . &quot;
&quot; I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant of the Haute Cou@@ ture , because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; earlier it was very light , now it &apos;s real &quot; , &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk ) , which is seen from 18 September at the Kuns@@ thalle of the HY@@ PO Cultural Foundation , it is a fortune that the fashion concert has changed its beginning to a show about His person . &quot;
&quot; actually he was opposed to it , because &quot; &quot; for me a show sound@@ ed a bit after death , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; when you die , one gets to the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection had previously done in the Canadian Montreal and in Paris station .
&quot; it is about so much more than just beautiful gar@@ ments , &quot; said the director of the Kuns@@ thalle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ en . &quot;
&quot; it is about tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society . &quot;
&quot; the exhibits offer an insight into the barely at the age of the man , the fashion story , without ever having completed an education . &quot;
&quot; chron@@ ological , the show is not built , but it is an excellent chore@@ ographic art work performed for which much effort was carried out : to leave the dolls , for example it &apos;s a sty@@ list committed . &quot;
14 tons of material have driven the movers according to indications of the Cur@@ ators Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich .
&quot; shortly before the start of the October Revolution , there was still another special be@@ eke@@ eper : a lea@@ ther@@ less out@@ fit with cor@@ set . &quot;
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; he always interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; women are sm@@ arter than men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ ti@@ ers alter Ted@@ dy is shown in the exhibition .
he stands for the first but z@@ ag@@ asy ch@@ ool of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he attracted his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and dresses , said Gau@@ l@@ pet . &quot;
&quot; to play with a pupp@@ et , his parents would not have allowed to him . &quot;
the t@@ throw from fashion then he brought himself to himself .
he sto@@ cked the fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers like Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich .
later I bought it but of course .
for his first own fashion show he couldn &apos;t pay the models .
they had got nothing but the clothes had kept clothes .
jewelry instead of Gar@@ dine - Pl@@ au@@ ener tip as a fashion niche
&quot; previously , it was going on the long ice machines in and around pl@@ aner &apos; to make meters . &quot;
&quot; the embro@@ i@@ dered fabric and points were created in great quantity for customers , for example when it has processed blankets and she@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the Sp@@ ell@@ ings Pl@@ ather . &quot;
instead the fashion is important again .
in the early times of the pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze played fashion a greater role then was pushed through the home textiles industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
&quot; Rein@@ hardt said some examples : top in jewelry , accessories such as hel@@ ds and with regional trails . &quot;
&quot; ever bil@@ de the so @-@ called V@@ intage @-@ Mode , which is reflected on past stit@@ ches , an increasing customer &apos;s potential . &quot;
those who are not serving in the textile industry in Germany is no longer served on the market .
&quot; in case of us , they are already taking half of all orders . &quot;
mo@@ ck@@ iness Pl@@ ast is together with nine other companies member of the industry association Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze and embro@@ ider@@ ies .
only they must bear the protected label .
&quot; in the past 15 years , approximately 80 percent of sales have gone off . &quot;
private dealers and also wholesale business are almost no longer available .
we hardly reach our products in this way .
the mass application is made today in the Asian region much cheaper and almost exclusively distributed by chains .
&quot; atten@@ uation of export , current to Russia and the US . &quot;
enough reasons for new paths .
&quot; the industry association will also try to score with environmental awareness , such as Cord@@ ula Bauer was created by the nit@@ rogen in Fal@@ ken@@ stein : &quot; this year we introduce a quality seal , which shows that we produce ecological and socially acceptable . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also refers to the used materials .
diploma Design teaches at the Schne@@ eber@@ ger &apos;s out@@ si@@ can Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and is specialized in embro@@ ider@@ y and connectors .
to counter@@ pose the competition from the Asian region is necessary to find quality and innovative products .
that needs time and courage .
&quot; it is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designer and the factories , which must in particular feel economically . &quot;
&quot; therefore , an existing design is often only slightly mod@@ ulated in order to hold a customer base . &quot;
some years ago full textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter the historic snow @-@ point new .
here the machine rose at some places small kitchen .
the Pl@@ au@@ ener Gold@@ smi@@ ths in Bianca was inspired by : &quot; previously I could not do anything with traditional Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze .
now they use the snow @-@ fl@@ ap for their jewelry .
in an elaborate process they character@@ ize the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people of the region identify with the subject of pl@@ au@@ ener tip - young and old , &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot;
&quot; it also supplies to the USA , to Australia and to Finland - above all , to customers whose ancestors have lived in tile and surroundings and that would like to have a reminder . &quot;
&quot; with that , I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze ® . &quot;

&quot; but the &apos; Entertainment Week@@ ly is not about re @-@ fil@@ ming , but a sort of continuation that plays 20 years after the first film with the magical n@@ anny . &quot;
this is about the experience of N@@ anny with the Banks family in times of world economic crisis in England .

XI p@@ us@@ ur@@ ges the economy to be wider for the world
&quot; the economy itself needs to be wider and further , to foster growth , President Xi J@@ in@@ ping at the Tuesday of a group that was appointed with the steering of the reform . &quot;
&quot; China should campa@@ ign@@ ing to improve foreign investments and know @-@ how and improve strategies for business leaders , &quot; he said in a language at the 16th session of the Central Leadership Team for deepening a comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; to promote new start @-@ ups and strengthen reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth , &quot; Xi &apos;an . &quot;
&quot; the management group has adopted a number of guidelines , including a neg@@ ativity that leads to the regulation of market access , relaxation of the state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , promoting national enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , and over@@ hau@@ l of the resident of milking . &quot;
&quot; after statement , a negative list will be created , the sectors and companies identified , which will not be in question for investments . &quot;
the system is gradually tested and improved by test programs .
&quot; the initiative is of importance because it demonstrates the market a greater role in the allocation of resources , an un@@ law@@ ful business environment and designed the market , &quot; the statement . &quot;
the government will also ease checks about the powers transferred to companies and ensure that companies decide how they manage their business .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the statement also said that China summit will permit to explore new models in cross @-@ border economic co @-@ operation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth . &quot;
&quot; in the context of an offer , public controlled sectors , further sectors are opened for private investments . &quot;
&quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will safeguard the right@@ ful interests of foreign finance and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it will be easier for foreigners to request a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card , &quot; by facilitating the requirements and the application process easier . &quot;
&quot; the right of lawyers to guarantee their activity , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting . &quot;
&quot; at the meeting , also Premier Li Ke@@ qi@@ ang and major leaders like Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli , as stated in a declaration published after the meeting . &quot;
EU wants to double Mer@@ cur@@ y border in smoke @-@ fish
the European Commission wants double @-@ fishing the threshold values for mer@@ cur@@ y in large rob@@ ber@@ y and the consumers therefore a clearly higher dose of ner@@ ves .
&quot; consumer organization Food@@ watch , which lies a true working paper of the EU , cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed the plans sharp : &quot; risks and side @-@ effects on industrial and environmental policy are passed with full force in pregnant and inf@@ ants , &quot; said Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of Food@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; Wolf@@ sch@@ midt accordingly , the limits of ner@@ ve can be raised for large fish at the end of the food chain as shar@@ k or sword @-@ fish for &quot; economic @-@ economic reasons &quot; from one to two milli@@ grams of mer@@ cur@@ y per kil@@ ograms of fish . &quot;
&quot; however , big pre@@ y @-@ fish have already stressed so strongly with mer@@ cur@@ y that it is not permitted to sell the existing limit values of approximately 50 per cent of the length . &quot;
after dou@@ bling of the limit values would only be compens@@ ated 14.@@ 5 percent irre@@ ver@@ sible .
&quot; in return for this l@@ ump , the EU wants to shar@@ pen the limits for other fishing from currently 0,5 milli@@ grams on 0.1 milli@@ grams on 0.1 milli@@ grams of mer@@ cur@@ y per kil@@ ograms . &quot;
&quot; food@@ watch was produced this as &quot; tri@@ ck &quot; because small cem@@ eter@@ ies , such as car@@ p are mostly so low loaded , that they already keep the high@@ scores already today . &quot;
&quot; cancellation with Kl@@ ag@@ ic is therefore &quot; an per@@ fi@@ di@@ ver @-@ man@@ eu@@ ver , which helps the economy just by &quot; &quot; Wolf@@ sch@@ midt &quot; . &quot; &quot;
Mer@@ cur@@ y is a high @-@ toxic heavy metal that strongly impact on the food chain especially in pre@@ dat@@ fish .
&quot; the Federal Government therefore war@@ ned that &quot; &quot; due to low volumes especially in the inf@@ ants of the nervous system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs explains in regard to its homepage with regard to applicable high@@ s but that a &quot; health haz@@ ard of the general population does not expect .
Mer@@ cur@@ y comes especially through the coal ver@@ ting waste to the environment .
&quot; according to a written information about the German coal fi@@ red power plants , according to a written information from the Federal Ministry of Defence , Ann@@ alena Ba@@ er@@ bock has written more than six tons of Mer@@ cur@@ y in the year , two thirds of the total population in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of mer@@ cur@@ y in F@@ ischen stuff like in river Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; permanent and comprehensive &quot; , &quot; had quoted the &quot; mirror &quot; in March out of paper . &quot;
last year saw Europ@@ aw@@ ls noti@@ fic@@ ity before Mer@@ cur@@ y in fish already among the most common health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ SF@@ F .
