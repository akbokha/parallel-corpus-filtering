C ) The visits and activities of the insp@@ ectors of the organization are so furnished that i ) the possible har@@ ass@@ ment and distur@@ b@@ ance for the community and the states and for the inspection of the peaceful nuclear activities are as low as possible ;
II ) the protection of industrial providers and other insp@@ ectors of the Organisation to be aware of the confidential information .
&quot; every state applies to the organization , including its assets , resources and assets , as well as compared to its insp@@ ectors and other officials , the tasks of the agreement on the prer@@ og@@ atives and liber@@ ations of the International Renewable Energy Organisation . &quot;
&quot; the backup measures after this Convention will be termin@@ ated in relation to nuclear material , when the community and the organization prove that the material is consumed or in a way dil@@ uted that it is used for a nuclear activity , which is used under the point of use of backup measures , which is no longer usable or practical . &quot;
&quot; the Community declares the organisation according to the provision of the Convention on the transfer of nuclear material from the states , which is subject to the backup measures after this Convention . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the backup measures after this Convention will be termin@@ ated in relation to nuclear material , as soon as the recipient state , as stated in this agreement , the responsibility has taken over . &quot;
&quot; the organization leads documents , from which any transfer , and if necessary , the re@@ application of the backup measures on the continued core material . &quot;
&quot; should core material to be used in accordance with non @-@ nuclear activities , such as the production of allo@@ ys or ceramics , so agreed the community with the organisation of such use of material , under which circumstances the backup measures will be termin@@ ated according to this agreement with regard to this material . &quot;
II ) that the Ker@@ material may not be used during the duration of non @-@ application of securing measures after this Convention on the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear compounds .
B ) The organisation and community meet a regulation that the backup measures will not be used as long as the core material used in such activity .
&quot; in the scheme , as far as possible , such as long and under what circumstances these backup measures will not be applied . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the backup measures will once again be applied once the core material will be attributed to a peaceful nuclear activity . &quot;
the organization will be kept on the total amount and composition of this material in the relevant country or the states concerned and over any disclosure of such material from this state or these states .
&quot; this explains its consent as quickly as possible ; it extends only on matters such as among other periods and proced@@ ural provisions and agreements for reporting , but does not include a endor@@ sement or any of the knowledge of the military activity , nor does it refer to the following use of the core material . &quot;
&quot; the organization , the community and the states bear the cost , which each of them are committed to implementing their obligations under the Convention . &quot;
&quot; arise by the community , the states or persons who are subject to their territory , however , non @-@ annual costs as a result of a special refund of the organization , so re@@ funded the organization of these costs , provided that they declared themselves in advance . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the organisation contributes to the cost of all additional measurements and sampling possible by the insp@@ ectors of the organization . &quot;
&quot; the community and the States make sure that the liability protection for nu@@ kl@@ e@@ are damage , including insurance or other financial security , can be used in accordance with their laws and other regulations , to the organisation and their officials for the purposes of carrying out this Convention in the same way as on the nation@@ als of the states . &quot;
&quot; any claim to the community or state towards the organization or the organization compared to the organization or the organisation against damages - with the exception of damage resulting from a nuclear incident , which are governed by implementing the backup measures after this Convention , is regulated in accordance with international law . &quot;
&quot; if the Council asks for testing by the Direc@@ tor@@ ate @-@ direc@@ tional information , that the organization has not been able to im@@ itate , for nuclear weapons or other nuclear ca@@ vern@@ osa , he can refund the reports set up in Article XII paragraph C of the Stat@@ utes , and if necessary also take the other measures there . &quot;
&quot; these steps are taken into account the Council , in which mass caused by applied backup measures , and offers the community or the state - as far as each of the two parties is concerned - every reasonable opportunity to give the advice the necessary security . &quot;
&quot; on request of the organization , the community or a state will be held consultations on issues that arise from the interpretation or application of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; the community and the States are entitled to seek , therefore , that any questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention will be examined , by the Council . &quot;
the Council invites the community and the affected state to participate in recognition of such questions by the Council .

&quot; the purpose of this part of the Convention is , which is necessary in carrying out the provisions of the part I regarding backup measures as necessary . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the backup measures specified in this Agreement is the timely discovery of the ambig@@ uous quantities of core @-@ nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear practices for non @-@ known purposes , as well as the deter@@ rent of such wast@@ age through the risk of early discovery . &quot;
&quot; at the opening of the in Article 28 fixed target target , the material reservations are made as a securing of fundamental importance , inter@@ ruption with spatial integration and observation as an important suppl@@ em@@ ental measures . &quot;
the technical conclusion of the review by the organization is carried out by a declaration in which for any material balance area that is specified for a specified period not under indication of the degree of accuracy for the given seas .
&quot; when carrying out their insp@@ ections , the organisation makes for articles 3 full use of the securing system . &quot;
the accounting system and control system of the community for core material according to this Convention is based on a break@@ down in material areas .
&quot; when applying their backup measures , the community of de procedures and measures will make use of the following way of use , as far as necessary , as they are determined in the compl@@ em@@ ental ab@@ uses and purpose @-@ purpose : &quot;
&quot; a ) a meth@@ ane to determine the quantities of preser@@ v@@ atives , mer@@ ed , acci@@ dentally , wast@@ ed or in other ways from the stock of remote material and the components . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; the backup measures after this Convention are not related to the material in the mining industry or the preparation process . &quot;
&quot; B ) will be Ur@@ an - or Thai material that has not yet reached under ( letter c ) phase of the nuclear fuel cycle has not yet reached , into the states , the community of the organization shares the quantity and composition of the material , provided that it does not be introduced to specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ; &quot;
&quot; it leaves nuclear material , which is suitable for composition and purity of fuel production or is@@ ot@@ op@@ ort@@ ality , in which it is produced , or is this core material or other , at a later stage of the nuclear fer@@ mentation cycle into the states , so it is subject to the others in this Agreement mentioned . &quot;
&quot; a ) The backup measures will be made available in this Agreement under the conditions mentioned in Article 11 , the Community however , is subject to withdrawal of core material , the securing measures after this Convention may not be possible or solic@@ ited , so consult the organization and the community for each other on the application of appropriate security measures . &quot;
&quot; B ) The backup measures provided in this Agreement shall be termin@@ ated for core material , provided that the organization and the community should be addressed , that this core material is practically not trac@@ eable . &quot;
&quot; in search of the community , the organization fre@@ es the core material from the backup measures after this Convention : &quot;
a ) special sp@@ lic@@ able material when it is used in grams or smaller amounts as sensor in instruments ;
&quot; B ) Kern@@ al , if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities after article 13 , if such a core material is backward , and &quot;
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with a Is@@ ot@@ open@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 238 that is over 80 % .
&quot; in the search of the community fre@@ es the organization of core material , which otherwise backup measures would be subject to this Convention , provided that the whole , due to this article in the states liber@@ ated nuclear material amount at no time is more than &quot;
a ) a total of a kilo@@ grams of special p@@ ile material that can consist of one or more of the following materials :
&quot; II ) Ur@@ als with an enrich@@ ment of 0,@@ 2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by Multi@@ p@@ li@@ ction of its weight with the enrich@@ ment , &quot;
&quot; III ) Ur@@ als with an enrich@@ ment that lies under 0,@@ 2 ( 20 % ) and over the conservation of nature , calculated by multi@@ pl@@ ating his weight with the fif@@ teenth square of enrich@@ ment ; &quot;
B ) a total of ten met@@ ric tons of natur@@ uran and de@@ ported urine with an enrich@@ ment of more than 0.@@ 005 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty met@@ ric tons de@@ ported urine with an enrich@@ ment of 0.@@ 005 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
&quot; should liber@@ ated core material along with nuclear material , which is subject to the backup measures after this Convention , processed or stored , so shall the precau@@ tions taken on the material will be taken on the material . &quot;
&quot; the community meets the organization supplements which is necessary in the scope of determining the successful and effective recognition of the tasks of the organisation according to this Convention , in particular , as the procedures specified in the Convention are applicable . &quot;

&quot; compl@@ ementary dis@@ agreements simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention into force . the organization , the community and the States take up all efforts to enter this convention ; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the organization , the community and the states . &quot;
&quot; the organization is based on the basis of the report on Article 62 of the initial survey of the entire , the backup measures of this Convention on the states , regardless of its origin , and results of this issue due to the subsequent reports and the results of their offspring . &quot;
&quot; between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organization ( Organisation ) &quot;
&quot; in ER@@ WA@@ PO@@ ING NA@@ CH@@ STE@@ H@@ EN@@ DER GR@@ Ã@@ N@@ DE - a ) The EEC has decided to help on the Conference on International Economic Cooperation Organization to help the direct need of individual countries with low income , whose development is disabled by general Res@@ sour@@ ced issues . &quot;
&quot; C ) It is the goal of the EEC and Member States , that the whole of the Member States shall be bound by the agreement within six months , and as far as possible within two years of force , and the organization will do their aim to achieve this goal . &quot;
D ) The EEC and the Organisation have cons@@ ulted each other on the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the mid @-@ bin@@ aries to ensure a wide and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
&quot; to this end , the Organisation of the EEC has presented a table which is clearly visible in which way they intended to apply the criteria in this agreement - &quot;
&quot; the organisation introduces a special account under the term &quot; &quot; special account &quot; &quot; which has led the Member States under this agreement ; this account is referred to by the Organisation as a for@@ ter fi@@ du@@ ciary and used ( in this property , the organization is defined in the following as &quot; &quot; car@@ et@@ ter &quot; &quot; ) , and only for the purpose specified in this agreement , and according to the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
the special account will be separate and separated by all other accounts and activ@@ ism of the organization .
&quot; the contributions are as follows : a ) The payment is made in the form of cash or un@@ mistak@@ ably deb@@ un@@ ces of the Member State , which are to pay on request in the currency of the relevant state to order the organization as a car@@ et@@ aker of the special transaction account and in case of the protection of the organisation in the country concerned . &quot;
&quot; B ) The payment is made in two install@@ ments , namely i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . H . contribution to entry into force of this agreement or another between the EEC and the administrator agreed at the time ; &quot;
&quot; II ) the second in the amount of the contribution to 1 . January 1979 or at a different time that agreed between the EEC and the administrator , taking into account the dates required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget . &quot;
C ) Every@@ one Member State can provide payments before the above @-@ mentioned appointments .
&quot; according to the usual processes of the organisation , the car@@ et@@ aker takes about dis@@ proportionate effect on the cash or the school , to cover the expenses for the special response and the special account in a reasonable way . &quot;
&quot; in the gran@@ ting of this loan , the administrator can lead to the terms of the EEC of the following factors : &quot;
&quot; III ) to the extent , in which international economic factors have contributed to the current and detri@@ mental economic problems of the country ; &quot;
VI ) the composition and the tendency of the debt service of the country and its further credit @-@ capacity to Dar@@ leh@@ ouse ; and
VII . ) to the extent that the problems of the countries concerned are governed by contributions from other sources .
&quot; any special ac@@ cred@@ itation serves the financing of a clearly defined and rapidly expanding development programme , regardless of whether it is intended for the loan programme of the organization , or not , approved , approved and administr@@ ated , whereby the aim is to consider under a letter b ) of the Pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement to consider the objective of honesty . &quot;
&quot; the funds from the Annual Report should not be used instead of the International Bank for Recon@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or organisation , which have been approved for a program or project , which has been approved by the directors of the bank or organisation . &quot;
&quot; apart from section 4 are subject to special respon@@ sive , the same revers@@ al conditions that apply to the organization provided a develop@@ mental in general ; they are refundable at ten years of age in 50 years . &quot;
special ac@@ cred@@ itation will be granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are refundable in these currencies .
&quot; amounts to the payment of this box are immediately to the organization , which they reserve . &quot;
&quot; any special loan agreement is defined by a separate loan agreement between the recipient and the car@@ et@@ aker , in particular the origin of the funds is specified . &quot;
&quot; the revenues from each special response can be used for edi@@ tions in the currency of the recipient or for goods or services , which are manufactured b@@ z@@ w . plac@@ ements are specified in developing countries ; the members of the organization are specified and the delivery of what the car@@ et@@ akers must be determined at the time of the loan granted to the recipient of a special transaction . &quot;
&quot; capital deposits of special respon@@ dents are paid to the special account , and the amount paid back in the currency of a member state will be back as soon as possible by the car@@ et@@ aker to the concerned member state . &quot;
the car@@ et@@ aker teaches up to the complete anni@@ hil@@ ation of all special response to the EEC relating to the directors in preparation and by the directors of the directors of the directors and programs .
&quot; during the period of the payout of the special response , the EEC has taught the EEC as a year on the development of the special ac@@ tion@@ ality and the expenditure for it . &quot;
the EEC as soon as possible after the closing of the business year the Organisation received a detailed accounting of the special transaction with an opinion of the external release of the organization to this account .
&quot; after full payout of the special response , the EEC as soon as possible has provided a detailed report on the funded projects and programmes . &quot;
&quot; the car@@ et@@ aker created and leads suitable records and b@@ illing , from which the contributions submitted to the special account , which received from the account received and the account paid out of the account , and the withdrawal of payments to the Member States are visible . &quot;
the EEC and the car@@ et@@ aker work closely together to achieve the aims of this agreement .
&quot; for this reason , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the car@@ et@@ aker until the complete issue of the Special Data Exchange from time to time a thought exchange of information on the state of the special action @-@ funded programmes or projects and on all other questions related to the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; this agreement took place on 31 December 1978 or at a later date , which the EEC and the Organization may be agreed upon , not into force , so the agreement and all of them are charged with immediate effect . &quot;

&quot; to ensure a fl@@ aw@@ less functioning of the agreement , Argentina , is obliged to ensure that the annual amount did not exc@@ eeds the arranged amount , and executed in accordance with conventional supply forms ( frozen or cooled ) . &quot;
&quot; if a change of the quot@@ ation form would be possible as a result of changes in technology and trade , so consult the two parties this agreement before introduction of such a change in the number 10 mentioned committee to find an adequate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the community takes the protective clause in its claim , it is obliged to carry out for concern that this agreement reached in this agreement led to the community market from which it is not touched . &quot;

&quot; following this agreement , New Zealand for Ham@@ mel - , lam@@ b and goat meat of access to the market of the Community in the treaty established . &quot;
new Zealand receives the assurance that the normal paragraph of its Ham@@ mel - and fl@@ amm@@ able cannot be drawn through the application of the regulation .
&quot; to ensure a fl@@ aw@@ less functioning of the agreement , committed to New Zealand , by suitable method to ensure that the actual volume did not exc@@ eeds the fixed amount . &quot;
the pre @-@ standing amounts are executed in conventional supply forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
&quot; the community ass@@ ures that New Zealand will not be prevented from this agreement to make new technological developments , or to maintain its competitive position on the market of the community . &quot;
&quot; if a change of the quot@@ ation form would be possible as a result of changes in technology and trade , so consult the two parties to find each other before introducing a change in clause 10 mentioned committee to find an adequate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the community is entitled to protect the protective clause , to protect themselves from this agreement of New Zealand &apos;s interests . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the initi@@ ates from New Zealand exceed the agreed quantities , the community reserves the right to enforce the inv@@ aders from this country . &quot;
