C ) The visits and activities of the insp@@ ectors of the organization are so furnished that i ) the possible har@@ ass@@ ment and distur@@ b@@ ance for the community and the states and for the inspection of the peaceful nuclear activities are as low as possible ;
II ) the protection of industrial providers and other insp@@ ectors of the Organisation to be aware of the confidential information .
&quot; every state applies to the organization , including its assets , resources and assets , as well as compared to its insp@@ ectors and other officials , the tasks of the agreement on the prer@@ og@@ atives and liber@@ ations of the International Renewable Energy Organisation . &quot;
&quot; the backup measures after this Convention will be termin@@ ated in relation to nuclear material , when the community and the organization prove that the material is consumed or in a way dil@@ uted that it is used for a nuclear activity , which is used under the point of use of backup measures , which is no longer usable or practical . &quot;
&quot; the Community declares the organisation according to the provision of the Convention on the transfer of nuclear material from the states , which is subject to the backup measures after this Convention . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the backup measures after this Convention will be termin@@ ated in relation to nuclear material , as soon as the recipient state , as stated in this agreement , the responsibility has taken over . &quot;
&quot; the organization leads documents , from which any transfer , and if necessary , the re@@ application of the backup measures on the continued core material . &quot;
&quot; should core material to be used in accordance with non @-@ nuclear activities , such as the production of allo@@ ys or ceramics , so agreed the community with the organisation of such use of material , under which circumstances the backup measures will be termin@@ ated according to this agreement with regard to this material . &quot;
II ) that the Ker@@ material may not be used during the duration of non @-@ application of securing measures after this Convention on the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear compounds .
B ) The organisation and community meet a regulation that the backup measures will not be used as long as the core material used in such activity .
&quot; in the scheme , as far as possible , such as long and under what circumstances these backup measures will not be applied . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the backup measures will once again be applied once the core material will be attributed to a peaceful nuclear activity . &quot;
the organization will be kept on the total amount and composition of this material in the relevant country or the states concerned and over any disclosure of such material from this state or these states .
&quot; this explains its consent as quickly as possible ; it extends only on matters such as among other periods and proced@@ ural provisions and agreements for reporting , but does not include a endor@@ sement or any of the knowledge of the military activity , nor does it refer to the following use of the core material . &quot;
&quot; the organization , the community and the states bear the cost , which each of them are committed to implementing their obligations under the Convention . &quot;
&quot; arise by the community , the states or persons who are subject to their territory , however , non @-@ annual costs as a result of a special refund of the organization , so re@@ funded the organization of these costs , provided that they declared themselves in advance . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the organisation contributes to the cost of all additional measurements and sampling possible by the insp@@ ectors of the organization . &quot;
&quot; the community and the States make sure that the liability protection for nu@@ kl@@ e@@ are damage , including insurance or other financial security , can be used in accordance with their laws and other regulations , to the organisation and their officials for the purposes of carrying out this Convention in the same way as on the nation@@ als of the states . &quot;
&quot; any claim to the community or state towards the organization or the organization compared to the organization or the organisation against damages - with the exception of damage resulting from a nuclear incident , which are governed by implementing the backup measures after this Convention , is regulated in accordance with international law . &quot;
&quot; if the Council asks for testing by the Direc@@ tor@@ ate @-@ direc@@ tional information , that the organization has not been able to im@@ itate , for nuclear weapons or other nuclear ca@@ vern@@ osa , he can refund the reports set up in Article XII paragraph C of the Stat@@ utes , and if necessary also take the other measures there . &quot;
&quot; these steps are taken into account the Council , in which mass caused by applied backup measures , and offers the community or the state - as far as each of the two parties is concerned - every reasonable opportunity to give the advice the necessary security . &quot;
&quot; on request of the organization , the community or a state will be held consultations on issues that arise from the interpretation or application of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; the community and the States are entitled to seek , therefore , that any questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention will be examined , by the Council . &quot;
the Council invites the community and the affected state to participate in recognition of such questions by the Council .

&quot; the purpose of this part of the Convention is , which is necessary in carrying out the provisions of the part I regarding backup measures as necessary . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the backup measures specified in this Agreement is the timely discovery of the ambig@@ uous quantities of core @-@ nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear practices for non @-@ known purposes , as well as the deter@@ rent of such wast@@ age through the risk of early discovery . &quot;
&quot; at the opening of the in Article 28 fixed target target , the material reservations are made as a securing of fundamental importance , inter@@ ruption with spatial integration and observation as an important suppl@@ em@@ ental measures . &quot;
the technical conclusion of the review by the organization is carried out by a declaration in which for any material balance area that is specified for a specified period not under indication of the degree of accuracy for the given seas .
&quot; when carrying out their insp@@ ections , the organisation makes for articles 3 full use of the securing system . &quot;
the accounting system and control system of the community for core material according to this Convention is based on a break@@ down in material areas .
&quot; when applying their backup measures , the community of de procedures and measures will make use of the following way of use , as far as necessary , as they are determined in the compl@@ em@@ ental ab@@ uses and purpose @-@ purpose : &quot;
&quot; a ) a meth@@ ane to determine the quantities of preser@@ v@@ atives , mer@@ ed , acci@@ dentally , wast@@ ed or in other ways from the stock of remote material and the components . &quot;
B ) the evaluation of the re@@ produ@@ ci@@ bility and the accuracy of the measurements and the estim@@ ation of the measurement of measurement :

&quot; B ) will be Ur@@ an - or Thai material that has not yet reached under ( letter c ) phase of the nuclear fuel cycle has not yet reached , into the states , the community of the organization shares the quantity and composition of the material , provided that it does not be introduced to specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ; &quot;
&quot; it leaves nuclear material , which is suitable for composition and purity of fuel production or is@@ ot@@ op@@ ort@@ ality , in which it is produced , or is this core material or other , at a later stage of the nuclear fer@@ mentation cycle into the states , so it is subject to the others in this Agreement mentioned . &quot;
&quot; a ) The backup measures will be made available in this Agreement under the conditions mentioned in Article 11 , the Community however , is subject to withdrawal of core material , the securing measures after this Convention may not be possible or solic@@ ited , so consult the organization and the community for each other on the application of appropriate security measures . &quot;
&quot; B ) The backup measures provided in this Agreement shall be termin@@ ated for core material , provided that the organization and the community should be addressed , that this core material is practically not trac@@ eable . &quot;
&quot; in search of the community , the organization fre@@ es the core material from the backup measures after this Convention : &quot;
a ) special sp@@ lic@@ able material when it is used in grams or smaller amounts as sensor in instruments ;
&quot; B ) Kern@@ al , if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities after article 13 , if such a core material is backward , and &quot;
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with a Is@@ ot@@ open@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 238 that is over 80 % .
&quot; in the search of the community fre@@ es the organization of core material , which otherwise backup measures would be subject to this Convention , provided that the whole , due to this article in the states liber@@ ated nuclear material amount at no time is more than &quot;
a ) a total of a kilo@@ grams of special p@@ ile material that can consist of one or more of the following materials :
&quot; II ) Ur@@ als with an enrich@@ ment of 0,@@ 2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by Multi@@ p@@ li@@ ction of its weight with the enrich@@ ment , &quot;
&quot; III ) Ur@@ als with an enrich@@ ment that lies under 0,@@ 2 ( 20 % ) and over the conservation of nature , calculated by multi@@ pl@@ ating his weight with the fif@@ teenth square of enrich@@ ment ; &quot;
B ) a total of ten met@@ ric tons of natur@@ uran and de@@ ported urine with an enrich@@ ment of more than 0.@@ 005 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty met@@ ric tons de@@ ported urine with an enrich@@ ment of 0.@@ 005 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
&quot; should liber@@ ated core material along with nuclear material , which is subject to the backup measures after this Convention , processed or stored , so shall the precau@@ tions taken on the material will be taken on the material . &quot;
&quot; the community meets the organization supplements which is necessary in the scope of determining the successful and effective recognition of the tasks of the organisation according to this Convention , in particular , as the procedures specified in the Convention are applicable . &quot;

&quot; compl@@ ementary dis@@ agreements simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention into force . the organization , the community and the States take up all efforts to enter this convention ; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the organization , the community and the states . &quot;
&quot; the organization is based on the basis of the report on Article 62 of the initial survey of the entire , the backup measures of this Convention on the states , regardless of its origin , and results of this issue due to the subsequent reports and the results of their offspring . &quot;
&quot; between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organization ( Organisation ) &quot;
&quot; in ER@@ WA@@ PO@@ ING NA@@ CH@@ STE@@ H@@ EN@@ DER GR@@ Ü@@ N@@ DE - a ) The EEC has decided to help on the Conference on International Economic Cooperation Organization to help the direct need of individual countries with low income , whose development is disabled by general Res@@ sour@@ ced issues . &quot;
&quot; C ) It is the goal of the EEC and Member States , that the whole of the Member States shall be bound by the agreement within six months , and as far as possible within two years of force , and the organization will do their aim to achieve this goal . &quot;
D ) The EEC and the Organisation have cons@@ ulted each other on the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the mid @-@ bin@@ aries to ensure a wide and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
&quot; to this end , the Organisation of the EEC has presented a table which is clearly visible in which way they intended to apply the criteria in this agreement - &quot;
&quot; the organisation introduces a special account under the term &quot; &quot; special account &quot; &quot; which has led the Member States under this agreement ; this account is referred to by the Organisation as a for@@ ter fi@@ du@@ ciary and used ( in this property , the organization is defined in the following as &quot; &quot; car@@ et@@ ter &quot; &quot; ) , and only for the purpose specified in this agreement , and according to the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
the special account will be separate and separated by all other accounts and activ@@ ism of the organization .
&quot; the contributions are as follows : a ) The payment is made in the form of cash or un@@ mistak@@ ably deb@@ un@@ ces of the Member State , which are to pay on request in the currency of the relevant state to order the organization as a car@@ et@@ aker of the special transaction account and in case of the protection of the organisation in the country concerned . &quot;
&quot; B ) The payment is made in two install@@ ments , namely i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . H . contribution to entry into force of this agreement or another between the EEC and the administrator agreed at the time ; &quot;
&quot; II ) the second in the amount of the contribution to 1 . January 1979 or at a different time that agreed between the EEC and the administrator , taking into account the dates required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget . &quot;
C ) Every@@ one Member State can provide payments before the above @-@ mentioned appointments .
&quot; according to the usual processes of the organisation , the car@@ et@@ aker takes about dis@@ proportionate effect on the cash or the school , to cover the expenses for the special response and the special account in a reasonable way . &quot;
&quot; in the gran@@ ting of this loan , the administrator can lead to the terms of the EEC of the following factors : &quot;
&quot; III ) to the extent , in which international economic factors have contributed to the current and detri@@ mental economic problems of the country ; &quot;
VI ) the composition and the tendency of the debt service of the country and its further credit @-@ capacity to Dar@@ leh@@ ouse ; and
VII . ) to the extent that the problems of the countries concerned are governed by contributions from other sources .
&quot; any special ac@@ cred@@ itation serves the financing of a clearly defined and rapidly expanding development programme , regardless of whether it is intended for the loan programme of the organization , or not , approved , approved and administr@@ ated , whereby the aim is to consider under a letter b ) of the Pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement to consider the objective of honesty . &quot;
&quot; the funds from the Annual Report should not be used instead of the International Bank for Recon@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or organisation , which have been approved for a program or project , which has been approved by the directors of the bank or organisation . &quot;
&quot; apart from section 4 are subject to special respon@@ sive , the same revers@@ al conditions that apply to the organization provided a develop@@ mental in general ; they are refundable at ten years of age in 50 years . &quot;
special ac@@ cred@@ itation will be granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are refundable in these currencies .
&quot; amounts to the payment of this box are immediately to the organization , which they reserve . &quot;
&quot; any special loan agreement is defined by a separate loan agreement between the recipient and the car@@ et@@ aker , in particular the origin of the funds is specified . &quot;
&quot; the revenues from each special response can be used for edi@@ tions in the currency of the recipient or for goods or services , which are manufactured b@@ z@@ w . plac@@ ements are specified in developing countries ; the members of the organization are specified and the delivery of what the car@@ et@@ akers must be determined at the time of the loan granted to the recipient of a special transaction . &quot;
&quot; capital deposits of special respon@@ dents are paid to the special account , and the amount paid back in the currency of a member state will be back as soon as possible by the car@@ et@@ aker to the concerned member state . &quot;
the car@@ et@@ aker teaches up to the complete anni@@ hil@@ ation of all special response to the EEC relating to the directors in preparation and by the directors of the directors of the directors and programs .
&quot; during the period of the payout of the special response , the EEC has taught the EEC as a year on the development of the special ac@@ tion@@ ality and the expenditure for it . &quot;
the EEC as soon as possible after the closing of the business year the Organisation received a detailed accounting of the special transaction with an opinion of the external release of the organization to this account .
&quot; after full payout of the special response , the EEC as soon as possible has provided a detailed report on the funded projects and programmes . &quot;
&quot; the car@@ et@@ aker created and leads suitable records and b@@ illing , from which the contributions submitted to the special account , which received from the account received and the account paid out of the account , and the withdrawal of payments to the Member States are visible . &quot;
the EEC and the car@@ et@@ aker work closely together to achieve the aims of this agreement .
&quot; for this reason , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the car@@ et@@ aker until the complete issue of the Special Data Exchange from time to time a thought exchange of information on the state of the special action @-@ funded programmes or projects and on all other questions related to the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; this agreement took place on 31 December 1978 or at a later date , which the EEC and the Organization may be agreed upon , not into force , so the agreement and all of them are charged with immediate effect . &quot;

&quot; I hon@@ orable me to the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations to establish provisions on the import of Ham@@ mel - , lam@@ b and goat meat from Argentina into the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the Common Market Organisation for She@@ ep - and goat &apos;s presence through the community . in the course of these negotiations are the two parties as follows : &quot;
&quot; - fresh or cooled Ham@@ mel - , lam@@ b - and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ; &quot;
&quot; as part of this agreement , the export opportunities for Ham@@ mel - , lam@@ b and goat meat from Argentina after the community set upon the following annual amount : 20 000 tonnes , expressed in array @-@ body weight ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; to ensure a fl@@ aw@@ less functioning of the agreement , Argentina , is obliged to ensure that the annual amount did not exc@@ eeds the arranged amount , and executed in accordance with conventional supply forms ( frozen or cooled ) . &quot;
&quot; if a change of the quot@@ ation form would be possible as a result of changes in technology and trade , so consult the two parties this agreement before introduction of such a change in the number 10 mentioned committee to find an adequate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the community takes the protective clause in its claim , it is obliged to carry out for concern that this agreement reached in this agreement led to the community market from which it is not touched . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the income from Argentina can exceed the agreed quantities , the community reserves the right to enforce one of Argentina for the rest of the year . &quot;
the community is committed to restrict the exhaus@@ tion of exhaus@@ tion of this agreement reached by this agreement of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em to limit .
&quot; when entering new Member States , the community in consultation with Argentina changes the amount of number 2 fixed quantity according to the scope of Argent@@ ine trade with each new Member State . &quot;

the total number of total amount will be set with the day of Greek accession to the Community to 23 000 tonnes of batt@@ body weight .
&quot; the community takes everything to avoid a market development , which could imp@@ air the marketing of Argent@@ ine Ham@@ mel - and ret@@ ard@@ ant on the common market within the agreed quantities . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the community will meet precau@@ tions , so that the paragraph of interven@@ tion@@ ists in frozen meats due to the implementation of the Regulation of Argentin@@ ean Ham@@ mel - and lam@@ b . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the community agre@@ es that any actual application of refund or other funding measures for the extinction of Ham@@ mel and lam@@ bs are only at prices and conditions that are consistent with existing international obligations and to consider the traditional share of the community at the world trade with these products . &quot;
&quot; these terms are compatible in a way that is compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and in particular article 10 ( 2 letter c ) of the Convention on the interpretation and application of Article VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General inch and trade agreement . &quot;
&quot; in particular , Argentina ensures compliance with this agreement , in particular that it will be granted in this agreement specified in this agreement for the number of products specified in this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the community is committed to meet all necessary precau@@ tions , so that the issu@@ ance of initiation for the above @-@ mentioned products is subject to its origin in Argentina from the submission of a export licence . &quot;
the details for the application of this system will be fixed that on the position of a deposit for issu@@ ance of the import @-@ licence for the question@@ able products may be disp@@ ens@@ ed .
&quot; in terms of implementation , the responsible Argentin@@ ean Authority of the competent authorities of the competent authorities have been granted in regular intervals ; these statements are necessary according to identification country . &quot;
the committee contributes to this concern that the agreement is properly applied and smoothly .
&quot; he regularly checks the tendency on the Ham@@ mel - , lam@@ b and goat market of the two parties and on the world market as well as sales conditions on these markets including the conditions that are of importance to the number 7 mentioned goal . &quot;
&quot; the committee shall be concerned that the proper application of this agreement will not be affected by this agreement , that products from Ham@@ mel - , lam@@ b , and goat meat under the agreement will not be executed according to the community . &quot;
the committee has been discussed all questions concerning the implementation of this agreement and recommends the competent authorities suitable solutions .
the provisions of this agreement shall be in@@ descri@@ b@@ able the rights and obligations of the parties in the framework of G@@ AT@@ T .
the minimum number for the year is valid for the period from 1 January to 31 .
the entry into force of this agreement will set up until 1 . January of the following year set out in relation to the total @-@ year period and contributes to the seasonal character of trade .
&quot; this agreement applies to the areas where the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied , and according to the measures of the Treaty on the one hand , and for the territory of the Republic of Argentina . &quot;
&quot; it is valid until 31 . March 1984 ; after that time , she remains in force , subject to the right of each party to announce it with a period of one year in writing . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the provisions of this agreement will be examined by the two parties before 1 . April 1984 with regard to changes that are necessary to understand them . &quot;
