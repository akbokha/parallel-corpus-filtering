this document is a summary of the European Public Transportation ( EP@@ AR ) in which explains how the Committee on Human@@ arz@@ t@@ ants ( CH@@ MP ) has been assessed to get recommendations concerning the application of the drug .
&quot; if you need more information about your illness or treatment , please read the Pack@@ ages ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; if you would like more information regarding the foundation of the CH@@ MP opinion , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of mel@@ ting tablets ( tablets that can dis@@ solve in the mouth ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; B. wir@@ res thinking and Spe@@ ak , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or vision of things that are not present ) , distr@@ ust and del@@ usions ; • Bi@@ polar disorder , in which the patients man@@ ic episodes have altern@@ ately with periods of normal mood . &quot;
&quot; bili@@ fy is used for the treatment of severe to severe mani@@ fold episodes , and to the prevention of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have addressed in the past in the past . &quot;
injection @-@ solution is applied for quick control of increased un@@ rest or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders when the or@@ ale intake of the medication is not possible .
&quot; in both diseases , the solution can be applied or applied for patients with patients who are having the s@@ acks of tablets difficulties . &quot;
&quot; in patients , at the same time other medicines are taking , the same as as@@ bili@@ fy , should be adjusted the dose of bili@@ fy fy . &quot;
&quot; this affects the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; ne@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that allow communication between nerve cells each other . &quot;
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l probably acts mainly as &quot; parti@@ eller Ag@@ onist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( also called ser@@ otonin ) .
&quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine and dop@@ amine , but in low extent than neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters works to activate the recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; since D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine can play a role , bears Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , causing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and it will be prevented . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of bili@@ fy , the repe@@ ating the symptoms , was examined in three studies of up to a year . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared to 8@@ 05 patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia or similar disorders , compared to increased un@@ rest , compared to a period of two hours with a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in another study A@@ bili@@ fy was carried out over twelve weeks to 3@@ 47 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , in another study the effectiveness of bili@@ fy and plac@@ ebo , which had been stabili@@ zed to some 160 patients , in which the man@@ ic symptoms have already been stabili@@ zed with A@@ bili@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of bili@@ fy injection solution was compared to 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , which compared to increased un@@ rest , with which by Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours compared . &quot;
&quot; for all studies , the change in the symptoms of patients in the basis of standard sc@@ ala for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients being examined to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; the company also conducted studies in order to examine , how the body takes the mel@@ ting tablets and the solution to taking res@@ or@@ bit ( takes up ) . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies with an injection solution showed patients , the o@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5,25 mg , 75 mg or 15 mg received a significant increase in the symptoms increased un@@ rest than the patients who received a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
in the application for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder A@@ bili@@ fy decreased in four of the five short @-@ term studies man@@ ic symptoms more effective than plac@@ ebo .
&quot; o@@ bili@@ fy , also prevented up to 74 weeks more effective than plac@@ ebo the rein@@ deer infections in previously treated patients and if it was additionally administ@@ ered to an existing treatment . &quot;
&quot; bili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses decreased , also more effective than plac@@ ebo the symptoms increased un@@ rest and were similar effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extrac@@ ur@@ red ( optional ) , head pain , bl@@ ur@@ red ( optional ) , fatigue , nau@@ tical ( increased storage ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , in@@ som@@ nia , in@@ som@@ nia , in@@ som@@ nia ) and anxiety . &quot;
&quot; the Committee on Human@@ arz@@ t@@ ants ( CH@@ MP ) was to conclude that the benefits of bili@@ fy episode in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients , who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes , and in which the man@@ ic episodes had over@@ cast the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , compared to the risks . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Committee came to the outcome that the benefits of injection solution in the rapid control of increased un@@ rest and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia or in patients with man@@ ic@@ op@@ hr@@ enia or in patients with man@@ ic@@ op@@ hr@@ enia , if a or@@ tal therapy is not suitable compared to the risks . &quot;
&quot; June 2004 , the European Commission shared by the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . a licence for the transport of A@@ bili@@ fy in the entire European Union . &quot;
AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y is shown for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episode of the Bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes had and their man@@ ic episodes have shown on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . ( see section 5.1 ) .
recommended dose for AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day each day regardless of meals .
an increased effectiveness in d@@ osing of 15 mg has not been proven although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
&quot; the recommended dose for AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as a mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y &apos;s effectiveness in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients &gt; 65 years has not been proven .
&quot; having regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initi@@ als should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is set out of the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l dosage should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the appearance of su@@ ic@@ idal behavior belongs to a psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ lic@@ ant disorders , and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changing a anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder , no increased addi@@ ct risk with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in comparison to other anti@@ psych@@ otic . &quot;
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be applied with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( M@@ yo@@ car@@ din@@ ous or isch@@ a@@ otic cardi@@ ac disease , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esien : in clinical trials , which was one year or less persistent , there were occasion@@ al reports of treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ho@@ unds dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia . &quot;
&quot; if with a AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y treated patients signs and symptoms of a Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment . &quot;
&quot; when a patient signs and symptoms developed , that suggest a m@@ ns , or un@@ clear fever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti @-@ psych@@ otic , including AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be used in patients with c@@ amp@@ fan@@ cases in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese or at states that are applied with caution . &quot;
&quot; 56 - 99 years old ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in patients with psych@@ osis patients treated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , an increased mort@@ g@@ ko compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; however , there was one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the appeal for unwanted events with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treated patients . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with K@@ eto@@ azi@@ de or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , has been treated with patients who were treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti @-@ psych@@ otic agents , including AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y . &quot;
&quot; there are no precise risk estimates for hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia @-@ related unwanted events with AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y and other at@@ yp@@ ical agents , treated patients , the direct compar@@ isons . &quot;
&quot; Poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , Poly@@ ur@@ ie , Poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in terms of deterioration of gl@@ uc@@ ose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ ined patients and in patients with bi@@ polar Man@@ ie due to comb@@ us@@ efulness , the application of anti @-@ psych@@ otic agents , which is well @-@ known as side @-@ effect , or a healthy lifestyle and could lead to severe complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary effects of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l on the central nervous system , caution is advisable when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective medicines such as Se@@ eing ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 Ant@@ agonist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ ine , a Mag@@ ens@@ äure blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , with this effect it is not relevant as a clin@@ ically not relevant . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study with healthy promot@@ ers , a highly effective CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( Chin@@ id@@ in ) the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l to 107 % , while the C@@ max remained unchanged . &quot;
&quot; it is expected to expect other high @-@ effective indu@@ bit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , similar effects and therefore should be made similar dos@@ ages . &quot;
with CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) Met@@ abol@@ isi@@ ans can result the common application with high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plas@@ mak@@ et centr@@ ations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l as compared to CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sive met@@ abol@@ isi@@ ans .
if you consider the common gift of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol or other highly effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y should be considered potential benefits for the patient .
other highly effective in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ol and HIV @-@ Prot@@ eas@@ ein@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dos@@ ages . &quot;
after draf@@ ting the CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ ors should be raised the dosage of AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y to the dosage height before the start of the companion therapy .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 can be administ@@ ered with AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y can be calculated with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentr@@ ations .
in clinical studies cans of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l per day does not have significant effect on the met@@ abol@@ ism of the sub@@ str@@ ates of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ yl@@ in@@ an @-@ rati@@ o ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( Om@@ ep@@ ra@@ zo@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ ane ) . &quot;
patients should be able to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or planning a pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
&quot; due to the insufficient data base for the safety of people and on the basis of the reproduction studies , this medicine should not be applied in pregnancy , unless the potential benefits are justi@@ fiable clearly the potential risk for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; however , as well as other anti@@ psych@@ otic patients should be war@@ ned to patients , dangerous machines , including power vehicles , to use , until they are sure that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l has no negative influence on them . &quot;
the following side effects occurred more common ( &gt; 1 / 100 ) on than under plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
&quot; the frequency of the side effects is defined after the following criteria : frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia - In a controlled @-@ term study , which were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , a total of lower incidence ( 25,@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Par@@ kin@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ ony and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esth@@ esia , compared to patients , which were treated with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.2 % ) . &quot;
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients suffering from plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in another controlled @-@ term study , the incidence of EPS rose from EPS 14.8 % in patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , and 15,@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ zap@@ in therapy . &quot;
man@@ ic Ep@@ is@@ ations at Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder - In a controlled study of 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 2@@ 3.5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients under Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol treatment .
in another study of 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26,@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under li@@ thium treatment .
in the long @-@ term development phase over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study was the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients among Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for plac@@ ebo patients .
&quot; a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and plac@@ ebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters , y@@ iel@@ ded no medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; increases the CP@@ K ( Kre@@ atin @-@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporarily and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of the patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l patients compared to 2,@@ 0 % of the patients treated with plac@@ ebo patients . &quot;
&quot; to the side effects related to the side effects associated with a anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , and over their appearance even in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , the mal@@ ig@@ ne neur@@ sk@@ in@@ esth@@ esia and var@@ ic@@ ality with older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies and since the market launch were uns@@ acci@@ dentally or inten@@ tional acute over@@ dose , with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death . &quot;
&quot; although there is no information about the effectiveness of a glob@@ al@@ ysts with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ; however , it is unlikely that hem@@ at@@ aly@@ se is in the treatment of an over@@ dose of benefit since Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l has a high plas@@ map@@ le connection . &quot;
it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar I disorder on the combination of a particip@@ atory effect on D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ - recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recept@@ ors will be convey@@ ed .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed in vit@@ ro a high affin@@ ity to D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and D@@ 3 recept@@ or , and a moderate affin@@ ity to D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - , to the ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - to alpha @-@ 1 ep@@ in@@ ep@@ ine and to the hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ recept@@ or . &quot;
&quot; at the property of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in d@@ osing of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily about 2 weeks , the Pos@@ it@@ tier tom@@ ography showed a dos@@ is@@ dependence of the Bin@@ z @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D@@ 3 recept@@ or Lig@@ uria , at the Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and at the coup . &quot;
in three plac@@ ebo short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) at 1.@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ ined patients with positive or negative symptoms showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to plac@@ ebo a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of the psych@@ otic symptoms .
&quot; in a Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 % share of the Resp@@ ect @-@ patients who have cons@@ ulted in both groups similar ( Ari@@ pi@@ ed@@ zo@@ l 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values of Mess@@ als , which were defined as secondary studies , including PAN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery As@@ berg@@ - anti @-@ proof rates , showed a significant increase than in Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia showed a significant higher reduction of back rate that lay at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ ed@@ zo@@ l group and at 57 % under plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in a O@@ lan@@ zap@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study at schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia , over 26 weeks , the 314 patients embr@@ aced and in which the primary study of weight &apos; weight &apos; was worth less than 18 % compared to the output value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.5 kg at an average weight of approx . &quot;
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled Mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar I disorder showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l one opposite plac@@ ebo over@@ leg@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled Mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar I disorder showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to plac@@ ebo no over@@ leg@@ eous effectiveness .
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo@@ at and active @-@ controlled Mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode , with or without a psych@@ otic characteristics , showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , marked opposite to plac@@ ebo , which was comparable to that of li@@ thium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol in week 12 . &quot;
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l also pointed out a comparable share of patients with symptom@@ atic Rem@@ is@@ sion of the Man@@ ie , such as li@@ thium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar disorder , with or without a psych@@ otic features , which in some two weeks do not reflect on Li@@ thi@@ eving or Val@@ pro@@ at therapeu@@ tical , a superior effectiveness in reducing defic@@ ien@@ cies compared to the mon@@ otherapy with li@@ thium or Val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; 10 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term expansion phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic phase , which had reached with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l during a stabil@@ isation phase against plac@@ ebo , primarily at the prevention of a bi@@ polar return , primarily on prevention of a back in the Man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; based on in vit@@ ro @-@ studies , the enzy@@ me CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 responsible for the Deh@@ y@@ dri@@ al and hydro@@ xy@@ modelling of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is responsible for the N @-@ De@@ al@@ ky@@ ation through CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 . &quot;
the middle of Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ alb@@ im time is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in exten@@ sive met@@ abol@@ isions via CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and with approxim@@ ate 146 hours in &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) met@@ abol@@ isi@@ ans over CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
&quot; at Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l there are no differences in pharmaceutical in@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy proportions , as well as shown on a pharmac@@ ological investigation of patients no gender @-@ dependent effects . &quot;
a full @-@ specific evaluation of pharmaceutical ine@@ tics y@@ iel@@ ded no reference to clin@@ ically significant differences with regard to ethnic origin or the impact of smoking on the pharmaceutical ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
the pharmac@@ ological characteristics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and el@@ de@@ hydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l were similar in patients with severe kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency compared to young healthy proportions .
&quot; a single dose study at Pro@@ b@@ anden study with different liver cir@@ rh@@ osis ( Child @-@ P@@ ugh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the impair@@ ment of the liver cir@@ rh@@ osis of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and el@@ de@@ hydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , but the study conducted only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis of class C , which is not enough to pull to its metabo@@ lic capacity . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety sp@@ harm@@ ac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repeti@@ tive fer@@ enc@@ ism , genocide , com@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and for can@@ arian potential the pre@@ clinical data left no special dangers for humans . &quot;
&quot; tox@@ ic@@ ological significant effects have only been observed in doses or ex@@ positions that have clearly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans , so that they have only limited or no meaning for clinical use . &quot;
the effects of fas@@ cists have a dos@@ is@@ dependent adren@@ al tox@@ ic@@ ism and / or Par@@ ench@@ y@@ cin @-@ Pig@@ ments / car@@ cin@@ oma during female rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( the 10@@ fold of the middle Ste@@ ady @-@ State @-@ exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maxim@@ al@@ d@@ osis in the human being ) .
&quot; in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis has been established as a result of the dis@@ rup@@ ting of sul@@ ph@@ ate @-@ jug@@ ation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in the G@@ alle by monkeys for repeti@@ tive fer@@ mentation case ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ times the recommended maxim@@ al@@ dose when people based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , the concentr@@ ations of the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg found concentr@@ ations of hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l not more than 6 % of the concentr@@ ations which were found in the study over 39 weeks in the G@@ alle by monkeys , and are far below the border values ( 6 % ) of the sol@@ vit@@ ro sol@@ v@@ ility . &quot;

AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y inj@@ ecting solution is used for quick control of Agi@@ ten@@ derness and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia or in patients with man@@ ic@@ op@@ hr@@ enia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of the Bi@@ polar I disorder when a oral therapy is not attached .
&quot; once it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment should be termin@@ ated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l inj@@ ecting solution and started with the or@@ tal application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
to increase the res@@ or@@ ption and minimize the vari@@ ability will be an injection in the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep within the glut@@ eus @-@ Maxim@@ us muscle which is recommended by adi@@ p@@ ate regions .
a lower dose of 5,25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) may be dependent on the individual clinical status taking into account the medicines used already for maintenance or acute treatment ( see Section 4.5 ) .

there are no investigations on the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l inj@@ ecting solution in patients with Agi@@ dness and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders which were different from schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and man@@ ic episodes .
&quot; if a par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines in addition to Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l inj@@ ecting solution is necessary as necessary , patients should be observed with an extreme Se@@ aling or a blood pressure ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
studies on safety and effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l inj@@ ecting solution are available for patients with alcohol or pharmaceutical in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation ( by ver@@ sible or illegal drugs ) .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be applied with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( M@@ yo@@ car@@ din@@ ous or isch@@ a@@ otic cardi@@ ac disease , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) . &quot;

&quot; clinical manifestations of a m@@ ns are high fever , muscle sti@@ ff@@ ness , changing consciousness and signs of autonomous instability ( irregular puls@@ ations or blood pressure , t@@ wit@@ ches and cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) . &quot;
&quot; Poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , Poly@@ ur@@ ie , Poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in terms of deterioration of gl@@ uc@@ ose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ ined patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to comb@@ us@@ efulness , the application of anti @-@ psych@@ otic agents , which is well @-@ known as side @-@ effect , and could lead to severe lifestyle . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the intensity of the Sed@@ ation was greater compared to that after all the property of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , in a study , in the healthy Pro@@ b@@ anden Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( 15 mg dose ) was used as an inser@@ ting in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular ( 2 mg dose ) in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular . &quot;

&quot; in analysis of sub @-@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe Agi@@ edness , a similar effectiveness has been observed with regard to the overall population , but a statisti@@ c signature could be determined due to a decreased patient number . &quot;
in three plac@@ ebo short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) at 1.@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ ined patients with positive or negative symptoms showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) compared to plac@@ ebo a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of the psych@@ otic symptoms .

&quot; the effectiveness of Abra@@ x@@ ane was examined in a main study , participated in the 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , some of which had previously obtained a anth@@ rac@@ ycl@@ ine . &quot;
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in a number of gift or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared to a conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( given in combination with other drugs to reduce side effects ) .
&quot; in total , in the main study , 72 ( 31 % ) of the 229 patients with Abra@@ x@@ ane treated patients to treatment in contrast to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patient who received a conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el new medicine . &quot;
&quot; consider only the patient who were treated for the first time for metastatic breast cancer , there were no difference between medicines and wor@@ sen@@ ing of disease and survival . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , patients had received different treatments for their metastatic breast cancer in terms of these indicators that Abra@@ x@@ ane is more effective than conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medication . &quot;
&quot; it may also not be applied to patients , breast@@ feeding , or before the start of the treatment of low Ne@@ ut@@ roph@@ il@@ en@@ ers in the blood . &quot;
&quot; the Committee on Human@@ arz@@ t@@ ants ( CH@@ MP ) set out that the first treatment was no longer an@@ gling , more effective than conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medicines and that it must not be given as opposed to other P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el pharmac@@ euticals , to reduce side effects . &quot;
January 2008 shared the European Commission to the Company Certi@@ xis Bios@@ cience Limited a permit for the transport of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the whole of the European Union .
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ mon@@ otherapy is inde@@ xed for the treatment of metastatic Mam@@ mak@@ ar@@ cin@@ oma in patients where the first @-@ line therapy for metastatic disease is not shown , and for which a default anth@@ rac@@ ycl@@ ine therapy is not shown ( see also section 4.4 ) . &quot;
in case of patients with severe Ne@@ ut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie ( Ne@@ ut@@ roph@@ il@@ en@@ ches &lt; 0,50 x 109 / l over a period of a week or longer ) or heavy sensory N@@ europ@@ athy throughout the succ@@ eeding series to 220 mg / m2 can be reduced .
&quot; for sensory N@@ europ@@ athy Grade 3 is the treatment to under@@ break up to level 1 or 2 , and at all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced . &quot;
there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dos@@ is@@ customiz@@ ations in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4 and 5.2 ) .
there were no studies conducted with patients with imp@@ aired kidney function and there are currently no adequate data on recommended dosage adjustment in patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to non @-@ irrit@@ ation , and effectiveness . &quot;

&quot; if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be de@@ duc@@ ted immediately and be treated with symptom@@ atic treatment , and the patient is not allowed to be treated with P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; in patients should not be re@@ activated , x@@ ane Treat@@ ments are re@@ directed at &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the thy@@ ro@@ id number is increased back to &gt; 100 x 109 / l . &quot;
patients with severe liver dys@@ functions ( B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x U@@ LN or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x U@@ LN ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; while a clearly imp@@ x@@ ane has not been proven in the related cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity , car@@ di@@ ale inci@@ dents were not unusual , especially in patients with former anth@@ rac@@ ycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart disease or lung disease . &quot;
&quot; if in case of patients after the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting and diar@@ rhe@@ a , you can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ e@@ dic@@ s and con@@ gres@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; abra@@ x@@ ane should not be applied to pregnant or women in child@@ bearing age , which are not used for effective receptions , except for the treatment of the mother with P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is un@@ avoidable . &quot;
women of child@@ bearing age should apply during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane a reliable verification method .
&quot; male patients , treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane will be treated , during and up to six months after the treatment is not a child . &quot;
male patients should be advised before treatment via a sperm agreement since the therapy with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible in@@ fertility .
abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as fatigue ( very frequently ) and di@@ z@@ zin@@ ess ( often ) which can affect the traffic and the ability to serve machines .
&quot; below are the most common and most important inci@@ dents of side effects listed in 229 patients with metastatic Mam@@ mak@@ ar@@ cin@@ oma , which were treated in the pi@@ vot@@ al clinical phase III study once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 / x@@ ane . &quot;
Ne@@ ut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie was the striking important hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ( at 79 % of patients ) and was quickly rever@@ sible and dos@@ is@@ dependent ; Leu@@ cop@@ enia was reported at 71 % of the patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ B &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed at 46 % of the patients with Abra@@ x@@ ane treated patients and was severe in three cases ( H@@ B &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
in table 1 are the side effects listed in conjunction with the Gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane as Mon@@ otherapy during each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
&quot; very common ( &gt; 1 / 10 ) ; common ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) . &quot;

P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti@@ mi@@ kr@@ ot@@ ub@@ uli ingredient that promotes the cl@@ utter of micro@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules and stabili@@ zes the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules through the in@@ hibition of their deportation .
&quot; this stabili@@ zation leads to a inhi@@ bited of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of mi@@ kr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions . &quot;
it is known that Alb@@ um@@ in the Trans@@ cy@@ t@@ osis was convey@@ ed in the end@@ ot@@ hel@@ per cells and in the frame of in @-@ vit@@ ro studies have been proven that the presence of Alb@@ ums is promoted to the transportation of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el by the end@@ ot@@ hel@@ m cells .
it is believed that this improved trans@@ end@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ ale transport through the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ Alb@@ umin@@ re@@ recept@@ or is convey@@ ed and due to the alb@@ umin@@ bin@@ ds Prot@@ eins SP@@ ARC ( on@@ ted protein cor@@ rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) is a P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation in the area of the tumor .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic Mam@@ mak@@ ar@@ cin@@ oma is supported by data from 106 patients in two ein@@ ar@@ dy un@@ blin@@ ded studies and by 4@@ 54 patients who were treated in a random@@ ised phase III compar@@ ative study .
in a study 43 patients were treated with metastatic Mam@@ mak@@ ar@@ cin@@ oma with Abra@@ x@@ ane which was given in the form of an inf@@ usion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as inf@@ usion via 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic Mam@@ mak@@ ar@@ cin@@ oma .
&quot; this multi @-@ cent@@ ric study was conducted in patients with metastatic Mam@@ mak@@ ar@@ cin@@ oma , either in the form of sol@@ vent @-@ quality P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as 3 @-@ hour inf@@ usion for prevention of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as 30 @-@ minute inf@@ usion ( N = 229 ) . &quot;
&quot; when recording entered the study 64 % of patients had an imp@@ aired overall condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al Met@@ ast@@ es and 76 % had more than 3 met@@ ast@@ eries . &quot;
&quot; 14 % of patients had not received any chemotherapy previously , 27 % only had a adjuv@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of met@@ ast@@ asia and 19 % due to met@@ ast@@ asia and the adjuv@@ ant treatment . &quot;
&quot; 9 The results for the general response rate and time up to progression of disease as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients , which received &gt; First @-@ Line therapy , are shown below . &quot;
ne@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity compared to P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by the improvement by a degree of patients who lived a periph@@ eral N@@ europ@@ athy Grade 3 .
the natural course of periph@@ eral N@@ europ@@ athy to sound on Bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative tox@@ icity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and is still unknown .
the pharmaceutical in@@ ine@@ tics of the total @-@ P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el to 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute inf@@ usions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was established in clinical trials .

the medium distribution volume amo@@ unted to 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume points to a wide @-@ ranging ex@@ trav@@ ular distribution and / or sof@@ ten@@ ance of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study involving patients with advanced tum@@ ors the pharmac@@ oc@@ ine@@ tic properties were compared to intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute inf@@ usion of 260 mg / m2 and x@@ ane with the values after a 3 @-@ hour inj@@ ections of 175 mg / m2 .
the clear@@ ance of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher ( 43 % ) than after a sol@@ uble P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el inj@@ ections , and also the distribution volume was higher than x@@ ane higher ( 53 % ) . &quot;
published in the published literature about in @-@ vit@@ ro studies of human micro@@ micro@@ micro@@ some and tissue stories will be reported that P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el will be primarily attributed to 6@@ α @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
&quot; after a 30 @-@ minute inf@@ usion of 260 mg / m2 , the average value for cum@@ ulative ur@@ inary tract was reduced by less than 1 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the Met@@ abol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ Hydro@@ xy@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which refers to a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clear@@ ance . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; member states must ensure that the approval of the approval for the transport network in Di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail stores with the following information and materials are supplied : &quot;
• School of training brochure • a summary of the characteristics of the drug by means ( specialist information ) , lab@@ eling and packaging material . • With unique representation of the correct use of the product available cooling boxes for the transport through the patient . &quot;
&quot; this means that the se@@ amed of a biological medicine is similar , that has already been approved in the European Union ( EU ) and has the same ingredient ( also &quot; Reference phar@@ ma &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in patients with normal blood systems , in which in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion complications may occur in case a blood circulation is not possible and in which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml can be expected . &quot;
&quot; the treatment with se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a doctor , experience in the treatment of patients with diseases , for which the medicine is shown . &quot;
&quot; in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make their own blood @-@ blood , is se@@ amed to inj@@ amed into a V@@ ene . &quot;
injection can also be made by the patient or its super@@ visor if they received adequate instructions .
&quot; in case of patients with chronic kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency or in patients suffering , the hem@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin@@ s should always be in recommended area ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ ites at adults or between 9,@@ 5 and 11 g / dl in children ) . &quot;
&quot; the iron values of all patients are in front of the treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency exists , and iron supplements should be administ@@ ered during the entire treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients who receive chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems a an@@ emia can be caused by an ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ in@@ man@@ gel or thus , that the body does not sufficiently on the body &apos;s own ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also applied before operations to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of a blood @-@ loss .
&quot; it is produced by a cell , into which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced to the formation of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
&quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared with administration as an injection , as part of a main study with 4@@ 79 patients caused by kidney problems caused by kidney disease . &quot;
&quot; all participating patients participating in this study was at least eight weeks of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o , before they were either transferred to se@@ amed or continue E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
main indic@@ t@@ ator for the effectiveness was the change of the hem@@ ost@@ al values between the beginning of the study and the trial period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
&quot; the company also put the results of a study before , in which the effects of the skin sc@@ anned ab@@ st@@ amed with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o were examined at 114 cancer patients who received an chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; in the study with patients suffering caused by kidney problems caused by kidney issues , the hem@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin@@ s of patients were provided on se@@ amed , in the same size as for those patients who continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; compared to these patients , patients who continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o , a rise of 0.@@ 0@@ 63 g / dl of the output of 12,@@ 0 g / dl . &quot;
the most common @-@ effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is a rise of blood pressure from occasionally to symptom of an envel@@ ope ( brain problems ) such as sudden as sudden head@@ aches and per@@ sever@@ ity .
se@@ amed may not be used in patients who may potentially be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other components .
se@@ amed as an injection below the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems since further studies are required to ensure that this is caused by no allergic reactions .
&quot; the Committee on Human@@ arz@@ t@@ ants ( CH@@ MP ) was to conclude that for se@@ amed according to the provisions of the European Union of evidence has been provided that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the company , which provides the se@@ amed for medical professionals in all Member States information packages , including information on the safety of the drug . &quot;

An@@ ä@@ mi@@ es@@ y@@ mp@@ ic symptoms and fol@@ lic@@ tions may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease last ; therefore , the assessment of individual clinical trials and disease is required by the doctor . &quot;
a rise in Hä@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin@@ s around more than 2 g / dl ( 1,25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
because of the vari@@ ability between patients may occasionally be observed in a patient individual Hem@@ mo@@ glo@@ omy values or under the hem@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin@@ - target @-@ concentration .
&quot; given this hem@@ at@@ glo@@ omy vari@@ ability should be tried over a corresponding dos@@ is@@ management , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in @-@ target con@@ dens@@ ation of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to reach 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
if the Hä@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin@@ s worth more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month cont@@ ends or if the permanent em@@ mo@@ glo@@ ws are worth 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa dose is 25 % to be reduced . &quot;
&quot; patients should be monitored in close to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are required in the lowest cost dose which is required for controlling the an@@ emia and the an@@ ä@@ mi@@ es@@ y@@ mp@@ ic symptoms . &quot;
&quot; the present clinical results suggest that patients with initial very low H@@ B value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher profits than patients , in which the initial an@@ emia is less difficult ( H@@ B &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;

&quot; the recommended dosage is 600 i.e. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which once weekly over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before the surgical procedure and on the day of intervention ( day 0 ) . &quot;

clinical trials were observed in clinical trials risks when ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis stimul@@ ants ( ESA ) were given with a hem@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin@@ - target con@@ dens@@ ation of over 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical trials have no significant benefit which is attri@@ but@@ able to the property of epo@@ et@@ ine when the Hä@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation is increasing the concentration of blood circulation and the avoidance of blood trans@@ f@@ usions .
the Hä@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin@@ ge has to be approximately 1 g / dl ( ag@@ m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in hyper@@ tension .
in patients with chronic kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency and clin@@ ically consistent coron@@ ary heart disease or storage in@@ suff@@ iciency should not be exceeded in the 4.2 recommended upper limit of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target rate .
&quot; after the time of these findings , the treatment of an@@ emia is caused by epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency that are not yet di@@ aly@@ tic , the progression of kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency did not speeds up . &quot;
in chemotherapy in chemotherapy should be taken into account for assessing the therapy @-@ efficiency of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ g@@ fa and ery@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin @-@ response ( patients who might have to be trans@@ forming ) .
if the H@@ B increase is larger than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ B @-@ value of 13 g / dl ( 8.@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) needs to minimize the risk of potential thro@@ cy@@ stic events ( see Section 4.2 treatment of patients with chem@@ otherap@@ y@@ related ana@@ emia - dos@@ is@@ customiz@@ able with the aim of keeping the hem@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin@@ s between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
&quot; the decision to use re@@ combin@@ ant Er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a utility risk considering the participation of the respective patient , which should also consider the specific clinical context . &quot;
&quot; in case of patients who are intended for a larger electrical orthop@@ edic surgery , if possible , prior to the beginning of the epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy the cause of an@@ emia is examined and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; patients who are taking care of a larger elek@@ c@@ tive orthop@@ edic surgery , as they have been a proper Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ os@@ e@@ prophy@@ la@@ xis , as they have an increased risk for thro@@ po@@ etic and vas@@ cular diseases , particularly in an underlying cardiovascular disease . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it cannot be excluded that in treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an output mo@@ ck@@ le value of &gt; 13 g / dl a higher risk for post@@ operative thro@@ po@@ etic events can exist . &quot;
&quot; in several controlled studies , epo@@ et@@ ine has not been proven that they improve overall survival with symptom@@ atic an@@ emia , or dimin@@ ishing the risk of tum@@ ours . &quot;
&quot; 4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer , which was conducted in chemotherapy when a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target con@@ dens@@ ation of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) has been increased &quot;

the most common side effects during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dos@@ is@@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the deterioration of an existing hyper@@ tension .
an increased incidence thro@@ mb@@ atory events ( see Section 4.4 and Section 4.8 - General ) was observed in patients under treatment with ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ inen .

survival and tumor growth were examined in five great controlled studies with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were dou@@ blin@@ de plac@@ ebo@@ controlled studies and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between the combined with re@@ combin@@ ant Er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin treated patients and the control of patients .
&quot; in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant Er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin patients treated patients with an@@ emia due to different frequent mal@@ ign@@ ome consistent , statisti@@ cally significant higher mort@@ ality than with the controls . &quot;
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ osis and thus related complications in case with re@@ combin@@ ant Er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin treated patients and controls satisfactory .
&quot; there is a higher risk for thro@@ el@@ astic events with tum@@ our patients who are treated with re@@ combin@@ ant Er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin , and a negative impact on overall survival can not be excluded . &quot;
&quot; it is not clear how far these results can be treated on the use of re@@ combin@@ ant Er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin in tum@@ our patients who are treated with chemotherapy with the aim of transferring a hem@@ mo@@ glo@@ ws under 13 g / dl , since few patients were included in the aud@@ ited data . &quot;

&quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et should take at least 500 mg calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip fr@@ actions should be obtained before the first inf@@ usion a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) or@@ ally or by inj@@ ections in a muscle . &quot;
&quot; the administration of acet@@ amin@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means of inflammation ) just after the application of A@@ cl@@ asta can reduce the symptoms , such as fever , muscle aches , gri@@ ppers and head@@ aches . &quot;

&quot; as the active ingredient in A@@ cl@@ asta der@@ same is as in Zom@@ eta , a part of the data material for Zom@@ eta was attracted to the assessment of A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; during the first study , almost 8 000 older women involved with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of sp@@ ine and hips were examined over a period of three years . &quot;
&quot; the second study conducted two 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , which had recently suffered a hip . it became the number of frac@@ tures over a period of up to five years . &quot;
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et , A@@ cl@@ asta in two studies was tested in a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared six months with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) . &quot;
&quot; main indic@@ t@@ ator for the effectiveness was whether the sal@@ ary of al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ ates in Ser@@ um ( a enzy@@ me , the bone substance building ) in the blood once again norm@@ alized or at least 75 % compared to the output . &quot;
in the study with older women the risk of sp@@ ine is reduced in A@@ cl@@ asta ( without other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) over a period of three years compared to the patients in plac@@ ebo by 70 % .
&quot; compared to all patients suffering from A@@ cl@@ asta ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) with those under plac@@ ebo , the risk of gir@@ der was reduced by 41 % . &quot;
in the study involving men and women with hip fr@@ actal score 9 % of the patients under A@@ cl@@ asta a Fr@@ ak@@ tur ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side @-@ effects of A@@ cl@@ asta occur within the first three days after the inf@@ usion and are less common in repeti@@ tive inf@@ usions .
&quot; A@@ cl@@ asta must not be used in patients , which may potentially be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ lic acid or other Bis@@ cu@@ on@@ ate or any of the other components . &quot;
&quot; as with all bis@@ phosph@@ ors are subject to patients at A@@ cl@@ asta to the risk of kidney , reactions to the inf@@ usion site and oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose ( Ab@@ die of bone tissue ) in the j@@ aws . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ asta presents recording material for doctors who use A@@ cl@@ asta for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis who explains how the medicine is to apply , as well as the similar material for patients in which the side effects of the drug is explained and pointed out when they should consult the doctor . &quot;

for the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and the oste@@ opor@@ osis in men is a intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion of 5 mg A@@ cl@@ asta once annually .
&quot; in case of patients with low @-@ traum@@ atis@@ ed gir@@ dle , the administration of inf@@ usion is recommended by A@@ cl@@ asta two or more weeks after the operating supply of gir@@ affe design ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et , A@@ cl@@ asta only should be prescribed by doctors , experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et . &quot;
after a treatment of Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et with A@@ cl@@ asta was observed a long re@@ mission period in patients who have addressed to therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to help patients with Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et an adequate supply of calcium , accordingly twice a day at least 500 mg of elem@@ ental calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ asta to make ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;

a pre@@ valent Hy@@ po@@ kal@@ z@@ emia is at the beginning of treatment with A@@ cl@@ asta by sufficient supply of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; due to the quick introduction of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ lic acid on the bone structure , its maximum usually can develop within the first 10 days after the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta appearance ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to help patients with Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et an adequate supply of calcium , accordingly twice a day at least 500 mg of elem@@ ental calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ asta to make ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;

&quot; kidney function Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ lic acid was associated with kidney dys@@ functions , which is associated with kidney function ( i.e. an increase in the ser@@ um Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute kidney disease . &quot;
the change in the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( measured before administration ) and the appearance of kidney failure as well as a restricted kidney function was in a clinical study in oste@@ opor@@ osis for three years compared to the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a- and the plac@@ ebo group .
a temporary increase in Ser@@ um Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of gift was observed at 1.8 % of the patients with A@@ cl@@ asta treated patients compared to 0.8 % of the patients treated with plac@@ ebo patients .
&quot; based on the evaluation of laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium values indicated below the normal fluctu@@ ation range ( less than free@@ m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , at 2.9 % of the patients with A@@ cl@@ asta in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pag@@ et studies treated patients . &quot;
&quot; all patients received adequate amounts of vitamin D and calcium found in the study on post @-@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study for preventing clinical trials in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pag@@ et studies ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study of avoiding clinical frac@@ tures after a recent gir@@ dle , the vitamin D mirror were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , but the majority of patients received an initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis vitamin D before the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; local reactions after the administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ lic acid in a large clinical trial was reported on local reactions to the inf@@ usion site , such as redness , swelling and / or pain , reports ( 0.7 % ) . &quot;

the A@@ cl@@ asta treatment led over 24 months compared to plac@@ ebo treatment at a increase in the BM@@ D by 5.5 % at the overall height and by 4.3 % by the thig@@ h .
clinical effectiveness in males In HO@@ RI@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT @-@ study were evaluated 5@@ 08 men random@@ ized and at 185 patients the BM@@ D was assessed after 24 months .
&quot; the study was not designed to demonstrate a reduction in clinical trials in men ; the frequency of clinical frac@@ tures was 7,5 % at A@@ cl@@ asta untreated men compared to 8,@@ 7 % in plac@@ ebo . &quot;
in another study in men ( study CZ@@ OL@@ 44@@ 6@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) was the once annual administration of A@@ cl@@ asta compared to the once weekly gift of the Len@@ den@@ ver@@ teb@@ ra@@ bel BM@@ D after 24 months in comparison to the output value .

11 The effectiveness of an inf@@ usion of 5 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ lic acid compared to the intake of 30 mg Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ utri@@ ents once daily during 2 months has been proven in two six months .
the combined results was observed after 6 months a similar withdrawal of pain strength and pain@@ ters in comparison to the output value for A@@ cl@@ asta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
&quot; patients suffering at the end of the six@@ teen main study were classified as a Resp@@ ect ( on the therapy ) , could be recorded in an observ@@ able phase . &quot;
&quot; from the 143 with A@@ cl@@ asta and the 107 with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ utri@@ ents treated patients , the therapeutic approach could be treated at 141 of the patients with A@@ cl@@ asta , compared with 71 of the observ@@ atory phase of 18 months after the application . &quot;
&quot; unique and multi @-@ time 5 and 15 minutes lasting inf@@ usions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ lic acid at 64 patients took the following pharmac@@ ological data that proved to be dos@@ is@@ independently . &quot;
&quot; after that , the plas@@ mas@@ gate rose quickly from on &lt; 10 % of the peak after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long @-@ lasting phase very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum . &quot;

the early distribution phases ( α and β with the above mentioned ½ -@@ values ) probably represent the rapid recovery in the bones and the ex@@ cre@@ tion of the kid@@ neys .
&quot; in the first 24 h 39 ± 16 % of the administ@@ ered dose in the urine , while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue . &quot;
&quot; the overall body @-@ clear@@ ance is independent of the dose 5.5 ± 2.5 l / h , and stays in@@ influenced by gender , age , race or body weight . &quot;
an extension of the inf@@ usion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to the acceptance of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ s@@ ect concentration by 30 % at the end of the inf@@ usion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( Plas@@ mak@@ onic centr@@ ation against time ) . &quot;
a dimin@@ ished clear@@ ance by cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 @-@ En@@ z@@ ym@@ os metabo@@ li@@ zed substances is unlikely because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ lic acid is not metabo@@ li@@ zed when people is not metabo@@ li@@ zed or no direct and / or irre@@ ver@@ sible , oxygen @-@ dependent In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ - &quot;

&quot; a summary of the EP@@ AR for the public this document is a summary of the European Public Information Department ( EP@@ AR ) , which is explained how the Committee on Human@@ arz@@ t@@ ants ( CH@@ MP ) is explained to get recommendations regarding the application of the drug . &quot;
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type @-@ 2 diabetes ( also known as well as ins@@ ulin @-@ dependent patients ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) in which met@@ form@@ in ( a di@@ ab@@ et@@ es@@ medi@@ ator ) may not be used together with any other di@@ ab@@ et@@ ants medicine ( dual therapy ) .
&quot; it can be applied in addition to Met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) , which cannot be satisfactory with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ ated dose . &quot;
in combination with a s@@ fon@@ yl har@@ n@@ ant or ins@@ ulin may be kept the previous dose of the Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ harm@@ n@@ assi@@ s or ins@@ ulin in case of patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here the dose of the sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ harm@@ ac@@ tic or ins@@ ulin delivery should be reduced .
&quot; this means that the body @-@ own ins@@ ulin can be improved , and the blood sugar mirror can be used better , thus allowing type @-@ 2 diabetes . &quot;
&quot; with more than 1 400 patients the effectiveness of acet@@ tos in tri@@ ple@@ ology , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a s@@ fon@@ yl har@@ n@@ ant , in addition they received up to 3.5 years either Ac@@ tos or plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ fied hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) , which shows how good the blood sugar is set . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos led to a reduction in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c acid , which makes the blood sugar values reduced by using 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of the additional gift of accounts for existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ harm@@ n@@ ant showed in a reduction in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values in a reduction in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values , while the additional gift of plac@@ ebo led to a reduction of 1.9 % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study , in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and ins@@ ulin in 28@@ 9 patients were examined , the patients , the Ac@@ tos in addition to ins@@ ulin , compared with 0.7 % in the patient , which were additionally plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were visual dys@@ functions , infections of the upper respir@@ atory tract , weight gain and hy@@ po@@ äs@@ th@@ esia ( dimin@@ ished sensitivity to irrit@@ ation ) . &quot;
&quot; accounts may not be used in patients who may potentially be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) compared to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , or any of the other components , still in patients with liver problems , heart @-@ suff@@ iciency or di@@ ab@@ etic K@@ eto@@ azi@@ ebox - in the blood ) . &quot;
&quot; it has been decided that Ac@@ tos as part of a mon@@ otherapy ( in the sole use ) as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients should serve in which met@@ form@@ in is not shown .
October 2000 agreed to the European Commission Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited a permit for the transport of Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union .
&quot; the tablets are white to white , round , v@@ aul@@ ted and carry on one side the mark@@ ings &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the heading &quot; AC@@ TOS . &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is also displayed for the combination with ins@@ ulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus whose blood sugar has been adjusted with ins@@ ulin and in which met@@ form@@ ality is in@@ appropriate due to contr@@ ain@@ dic@@ ations or in@@ compati@@ bilities ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; for use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under 18 years of age , no data is available , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from the presence at least one risk factor ( e.g. former her@@ edit@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose stage . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of a heart @-@ suff@@ iciency , weight gain or est@@ rogen , especially those with reduced cardiovascular reserve . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of a heart suff@@ iciency , weight gain and est@@ rogen , when pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is used in combination with ins@@ ulin . &quot;
a cardiovascular Out@@ come study with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mak@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease has been performed .
&quot; in this study , an increase in reports of heart @-@ suff@@ iciency was revealed , which however did not lead to an increase in the mor@@ ality in the study . &quot;
in patients with increased output liver vas@@ cular values ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the standard division ) or with other signs of a liver disease may not be used .
&quot; if the AL@@ T mirror is increased to the 3 @-@ times of the upper limit of the standard division , the liver enzy@@ me values as soon as possible are again to control . &quot;
&quot; if a patient &apos;s symptoms developed , point out on a hep@@ atic dysfunction , such as uns@@ ett@@ led nau@@ sea , fatigue , appeti@@ sers , fatigue , appeti@@ sers and / or dar@@ ker Har@@ n , are the Leb@@ ri@@ val values . &quot;
&quot; the decision whether the patient will continue with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , should be led to the provision of the lab parameters from the clinical assessment . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , a dos@@ is@@ dependent weight gain has been proven to sti@@ r and in some cases associated with a fluid @-@ organ . &quot;
as a result of a Hä@@ mel@@ l@@ az@@ on came under the therapy with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on a slight reduction in the middle hem@@ mo@@ glo@@ o values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and the hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.3 % ) .
similar changes have been observed in compar@@ ative controlled studies with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under met@@ form@@ yl bin@@ s at 3 @-@ 4 % and at a reduced extent also in patients suffering from Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ harm@@ n@@ ant and ins@@ ulin ( relative reduction of the Hä@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin@@ s at 1 @-@ 2 % and the hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
&quot; as a result of increased In@@ sul@@ in@@ sensitivity , patients , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on as or@@ ale branches or three @-@ way combination therapy with ins@@ ulin are preserved , the risk of dos@@ is@@ dependent Hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; after the launch of the launch was reported under the treatment with Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ onen , including Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , about a appearance or a deterioration of a di@@ ab@@ etic Mak@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ de@@ ed with a reduction of the visual ac@@ u@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear whether the intake of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and the appearance of Mak@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ de@@ men should be aware of a direct connection , but compar@@ isons doctors should be aware of the possibility of a Mak@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ ver if patients report on disorders of visual sharp@@ ness ; a suitable oph@@ thalm@@ ologic assessment should be considered . &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of announ@@ cements from random@@ ized , controlled , double @-@ blind trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on . &quot;
&quot; the hydraulic frac@@ ture incidence was 1,@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patients with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated by women and 1,@@ 1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with compar@@ ative o@@ dic@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a study about 3.5 years on the investigation of cardiovascular events , occurred Fr@@ ak@@ architec@@ tures at 44 / 870 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 Fr@@ ak@@ enh@@ ances per 100 patient @-@ years ) in patients who were treated with compar@@ ative o@@ dic@@ ation . &quot;
patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or this occurs is the treatment ( see section 4.6 ) .
&quot; studies on the study of interactions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on has no relevant effects on pharmaceutical in@@ ine@@ tics or pharmaceutical dynamics of di@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; interactions with pharmac@@ euticals , which are metabo@@ li@@ zed by these enzy@@ mes , e.g. or@@ ale contrac@@ ep@@ tive , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium @-@ blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ er . &quot;
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with Gem@@ fi@@ bro@@ zi@@ l ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) result in an increase in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on around the 3 @-@ fold .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C8 in@@ duc@@ tor ) performed in a reduction of the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
&quot; this is due to the fact that under treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , dimin@@ ished in pregnancy , hyper@@ ins@@ ulin and increased ins@@ ulin resistance of the parent and thus reduces the availability of the metabo@@ lic sub@@ str@@ ates for the fet@@ al growth . &quot;
&quot; very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; common &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rarely &gt; 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , single cases : unknown ( of these data cannot be estimated ) . &quot;
these lead to a temporary change of the Tur@@ g@@ ors and the b@@ illing index@@ es of the lens as they are observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic activity .
&quot; in clinical studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , AL@@ T eleph@@ one occurred over the triple of the upper limit of the standard division as often under plac@@ ebo , but rar@@ er than in compar@@ ative groups under met@@ form@@ in or Sul@@ fon@@ yl har@@ n@@ ant . &quot;
in an out@@ come study in patients with pre @-@ existing advanced mak@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease was the frequency of a heavy cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on by 1.6 % higher than under plac@@ ebo when pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on b@@ z@@ w .
&quot; since the launch of market in@@ suff@@ iciency under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , however , more frequently when pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was applied in combination with ins@@ ulin or in patients with cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; it became a summary analysis of announ@@ cements from random@@ ized , controlled , double blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.@@ 100 patients in patients with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated groups and over 7.@@ 400 patients in the patients treated with compar@@ ative medicine . &quot;
&quot; over a period of 3.5 years of running pro@@ active study , Fr@@ ak@@ tures occurred at 44 / 870 ( 5,@@ 1 % ) of the patients with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated patients compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) for patients who have been treated with compar@@ ative o@@ dic@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; intake of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days occurred no symptoms . &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on seems to have an activation of specific core @-@ recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ation Activ@@ ated Rec@@ ept@@ or @-@ g ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ g ) ) to function what is leading in the animal model to an increased In@@ sul@@ in@@ sensitivity of liver and skel@@ etal muscle cells .
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on can reduce the Glu@@ cos@@ e@@ production in the liver and the periph@@ eral gl@@ uc@@ tance increases in case of ins@@ ulin resistance .
a clinical study involving Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on versus Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d as Mon@@ otherapy has continued over two years to investigate the time until the end of the therapeutic effects ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &gt; 8,@@ 0 % after the first 6 treatment costs ) .
&quot; at the time after two years after the beginning of therapy , a blood sugar control could be maintained ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8,@@ 0 % ) by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on at 69 % of the patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de ) . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo@@ controlled study over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar has been adjusted in spite of three mon@@ ati@@ ger optim@@ isation phase with ins@@ ulin , to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or plac@@ ebo random@@ ized . &quot;
&quot; in case of patients under pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduced the middle H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c - value for 0,45 % , compared to the patient , which still only received ins@@ ulin ; a reduction of ins@@ ulin in the group was observed . &quot;
in clinical studies on one year at Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease of the album in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Qu@@ ot@@ ien@@ tes in comparison to the output values .
the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( Mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus plac@@ ebo ) was tested in a small , on 18 weeks laid out investigation on type @-@ 2 di@@ abe@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; in most clinical trials were compared to plac@@ ebo , reduction of overall plas@@ ma tri@@ gly@@ cem@@ enting and free fatty acids and a rise in HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels , as well as low @-@ level , however clin@@ ically not statisti@@ cally increased L@@ DL@@ - cholesterol level . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on compared to plac@@ ebo , met@@ form@@ in or Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de the overall plastic gly@@ cem@@ enting and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L @-@ cholesterol levels . &quot;
&quot; compared to plac@@ ebo , under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was not found a statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol levels , while in met@@ form@@ in and extre@@ cl@@ azi@@ d decreased values were observed . &quot;
&quot; in a study of 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on not only reduced the so@@ ber tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de , but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ d@@ ecting mirror , both about an effect on the tri@@ gly@@ cem@@ eri@@ d absorption as well as the hep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic synthesis . &quot;
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a cardiovascular Out@@ come study , 52@@ 38 patients were treated with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mak@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease in groups of random@@ ised , which received over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing anti@@ di@@ ab@@ etic and cardiovascular therapy either Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; after oral application , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is rapidly res@@ or@@ ised , with the top @-@ concentration at un@@ changing pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in plas@@ ma usually reached 2 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; based on this basis , the contribution from M @-@ IV to effectiveness in roughly the triple the effectiveness of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot;
&quot; in Inter@@ ac@@ tion@@ studies , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on could no relevant effect on pharmaceutical in@@ ine@@ tics or pharmaceutical dynamics of di@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with Gem@@ fi@@ bro@@ zi@@ l ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C8 endcapped ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; after oral use of radio@@ active market pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , the mark@@ er has been found mainly in f@@ ather@@ less ( 55 % ) and at a lower scale in the Har@@ n ( 45 % ) . &quot;
the middle plas@@ ma Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ alb@@ an time of un@@ changing pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on amounts to people 5 @-@ 6 hours , and all of the active Met@@ abol@@ ites lies at 16 - 23 hours . &quot;
&quot; the plas@@ tic@@ on@@ centr@@ ations of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and its Met@@ abol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function lower than in healthy promot@@ ers , whereby the ration@@ ality of the or@@ tal clear@@ ing of the mother is similar . &quot;
&quot; tox@@ ic@@ ological studies occurred in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys dis@@ agreement after repeated administration of Plas@@ ma plas@@ ma , an@@ emia and rever@@ sible ex@@ cent@@ ric heart hyper@@ trop@@ hies . &quot;
&quot; this is due to the fact that under treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , dimin@@ ished in the bases of hyper@@ ins@@ ulin and increased ins@@ ulin resistance , and thus reduces the availability of the metabo@@ lic sub@@ str@@ ates for the fet@@ al growth . &quot;

in a further study over two years the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in each case were examined by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d .
in clinical studies on 1 year under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on showed a statisti@@ cally significant decline of the Alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Qu@@ ot@@ ien@@ tes in comparison to the output values .

&quot; Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane was produced on a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type @-@ 1 diabetes , in which the pancre@@ as can produce no ins@@ ulin , in which the body is not able to use the ins@@ ulin effectively . &quot;
&quot; in the study after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ zed hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which indicates how well the blood sugar is set . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane led to a withdrawal of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror , which pointed out that the blood sugar levels were similarly strong as with another human ins@@ ulin . &quot;
Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may potentially be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human@@ ins@@ ulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
&quot; in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ ane may be adapted if it is administ@@ ered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood sugar ( the complete list is the Pack@@ ages ) . &quot;
the Committee on Human@@ arz@@ t@@ ants ( CH@@ MP ) had to conclude that the benefits of Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane in the treatment of diabetes against the risks over@@ weigh .
October 2002 the European Commission shared the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S a permit for the transport of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ ane in the whole of the European Union .

&quot; if the transition to Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane is required when the patient is needed for a dosage adjustment , it may be necessary for the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after switching . &quot;

the drug is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ@@ transpl@@ ant since it was not investigated for these groups .
&quot; in the first study , part of the 1 0@@ 72 patients were participating , the efficacy was thirteen different Aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once every day 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) with that of a plac@@ ebo ( hypo@@ medi@@ ator ) and Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( a different drug for treating hyper@@ uri@@ k@@ emia ) . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , two dos@@ ages of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was applied to a dose of once every day 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day . &quot;
main indic@@ t@@ ator for the effectiveness was the number of patients whose ur@@ inary pi@@ pel@@ ines in blood during the last three measurements was under 6 mg / dl .
&quot; in the first study had 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of the patients , the aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of the patient which once daily 120 mg received in the blood of under 6 mg / dl . &quot;
&quot; compared to this , this was 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of the patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nau@@ sea , and ab@@ normal liver values . &quot;
&quot; in particular in patients with cardi@@ ac coron@@ ary , there may also be a higher risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; the Committee on Human@@ arz@@ t@@ ants ( CH@@ MP ) was to conclude that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in reducing the ur@@ inary pi@@ pel@@ ines in the blood , but also a higher risk of side effects associated with the heart and blood vessels . &quot;

&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used for treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease , in which the bones are in@@ ch@@ ained ) in women after men@@ opause , in which a risk for a small vitamin D mirror exists . &quot;
&quot; the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or loss of other medicines ( including ant@@ acid , calcium , and vit@@ amine supplement ) . &quot;
&quot; to avoid irrit@@ ation of the es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient may take up after the first food intake of the day , the early 30 minutes after taking the tablet should not lie down . &quot;
&quot; since Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at and vitamin D@@ 3 are already separated from each other in drugs that have been approved in the European Union , the company presented data from earlier studies and published literature . &quot;
&quot; the company also conducted a study with 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis , in order to detect the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in terms of increasing the vitamin D mirror . &quot;
&quot; after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients had been treated with low vitamin D mirror in the patients who were treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 11 % ) than those who took exclusively Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( 32 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the company also laid data in front of that , that in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at @-@ dose is exactly the dose which is needed for the prevention of a bone tissue . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of the muscul@@ ature of muscul@@ ature ( muscles , bone or joints ) and symptoms of the diges@@ tive apparatus ( diges@@ tive disorders ) , g@@ rie@@ h ( diges@@ tion ) , g@@ rie@@ h ( diges@@ tion ) , g@@ rie@@ h ( fl@@ ashing tum@@ ble ) , as well as sau@@ res . &quot;
&quot; in case of patients with possible hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against al@@ end@@ ron@@ age , vitamin D@@ 3 or any other components may not be used as AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE . &quot;
&quot; it may not be used in diseases of es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with Hy@@ po@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low cal@@ ender mirror ) or in patients who can not stand up at least 30 minutes or sit . &quot;

&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first food , drink or use of pharmac@@ euticals ( including ant@@ acid , calcium , calcium and vit@@ amine supplements ) . &quot;
&quot; following notes are exactly to be followed , to reduce the risk of ös@@ oph@@ age@@ al irrit@@ ation and associated side effects ( see Section 4.4 ) : &quot;
&quot; • AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be har@@ dened by the day only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • patients should not leave the tablet or tablet in the mouth , as a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ ynge@@ al ar@@ zer@@ a . • patients should not stop before the first food intake of the day , the early 30 minutes after taking the tablet occurs . &quot;
B . pe@@ p@@ tical Ul@@ cus , active gast@@ ro@@ man in@@ ale bl@@ eeding or surgical interventions in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ be in@@ al@@ tr@@ act except P@@ yl@@ or@@ oplast@@ y , only under particular attention ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; eco @-@ soph@@ ism reactions , such as Ö@@ soph@@ agi@@ tis , ös@@ oph@@ age@@ ale Ul@@ zer@@ a and ös@@ oph@@ age@@ al ero@@ sions , were rare in patients under the intake of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( partially these were severe and demanded a hospital ) . &quot;
&quot; the doctor should therefore draw attention to all the signs and symptoms that should be pointed out on possible mal@@ oph@@ age@@ al irrit@@ ation like dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ie , pain when sl@@ ing or retro@@ ast@@ rology pain , or new or wor@@ ding of so@@ d@@ burn the medicine and get medical advice ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 The risk of severe oph@@ age@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients who are not able to take accurate and / or it after the appearance of symptoms that will point on an ös@@ oph@@ age@@ al irrit@@ ation . &quot;
it is very important that all d@@ osing transfers to the patients will be shared and understood by the patient ( see Section 4.2 ) .
&quot; during the large @-@ scale clinical studies with al@@ end@@ ron@@ at no increased risk was rarely found ( after market launch ) Mag@@ en- und Du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ zer@@ a , including some severe and with complications , reports ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;

&quot; there are no data available to indicate whether the ab@@ uses of a bis@@ phosph@@ or therapy for patients , which dimin@@ ished the risk of a oste@@ otic surgical procedure , dimin@@ ished the risk of a oste@@ onal surgical procedure . &quot;
the clinical assessment by the treating doctor is author@@ it@@ ative for the therapy planning in every patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the patients should be instruc@@ ted that they should take the break of taking a dose of a dose AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should take the tablet next morning after they have noticed their failure .
&quot; you should not take two tablets on the same day , but taking the intake of one tablet per week as originally planned on the week@@ day . &quot;
other diseases that affect the mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D @-@ deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ atism ) should be treated prior to the treatment of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
&quot; al@@ end@@ ron@@ at foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium @-@ supplements , Ant@@ azi@@ da and some or@@ ale medicine can imp@@ air the res@@ or@@ ption of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at when they are taken at the same time . &quot;
&quot; therefore , patients need to wait after the intake of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at least 30 minutes before they take other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although specific Inter@@ ac@@ tion@@ studies were not conducted , al@@ end@@ ron@@ at in clinical studies have been taken together with a multitude of usually prescribed medicines without being clin@@ ically relevant interactions . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for application in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy or by pregnant women .
&quot; animal studies with al@@ end@@ ron@@ at does not leave a reference to direct ash@@ amed effects with regard to pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose of the pin@@ ers was reported in patients under Bis@@ cu@@ on@@ ates ; most of the reports come of cancer patients , but it was also reported on oste@@ opor@@ osis . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the Ser@@ um @-@ cal@@ ci@@ ums entered to &lt; 8,@@ 0 mg / dl ( 2,@@ 0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the ser@@ um - phosph@@ ate to &lt; 2,@@ 0 mg / l ) in both treatment groups with similar frequency . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at as a result of a or@@ atory over@@ dose can occur Hy@@ po@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia and side effects in the upper guest house , So@@ d@@ burn , Ö@@ soph@@ agi@@ tis , Gast@@ ri@@ tis or Ul@@ zer@@ a . &quot;

&quot; in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the evidence of the BM@@ D of sp@@ ine and tro@@ chan@@ ter continued to continue ; also the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur@@ hal@@ ses and the entire body was maintained . &quot;
fit consisted of two pl@@ az@@ ebo@@ controlled studies where Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at daily ( 5 mg daily over 2 years and subsequently 10 mg daily continues either via 1 or 2 years ) :

&quot; 9 distribution studies on rats have revealed that Al@@ end@@ ron@@ utri@@ ents are distributed by 1 mg / kg temporarily into soft parts , but then quickly distributed in the bones , or with the urine . &quot;
&quot; devi@@ ation of a single dose of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at were approximately 50 % of radio@@ active substance within 72 hours with the urine , and little or no radio@@ activity was re @-@ found in the f@@ ters . &quot;

&quot; although no clinical data is above , yet to expect that the ren@@ al Eli@@ mination of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at as in the animal also try to be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with reduced kidney function , it is expected to expect a slightly higher Kum@@ ulation of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at in the bone ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;

Adv@@ ag@@ raf is administ@@ ered adult patients who became a kidney or liver tran@@ splan@@ ts to prevent a rep@@ ul@@ ment of the tran@@ splan@@ ts organ by the immune system .
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gr@@ aft have already been deployed in the EU , the company has submitted its results from previously published studies with pro@@ gra@@ f / pro@@ gr@@ aft and data from the published literature . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the results of a clinical study were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney stress , whereby the application of Adv@@ oc@@ raf is compared with Pro@@ gra@@ f / pro@@ gr@@ aft or Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in . &quot;
main Indi@@ c@@ ator of effectiveness has been the number of patients in which the transpl@@ ant after a treatment duration of a year ( by example under@@ sear@@ ched how often a renewed organic transpl@@ ant or a resum@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis needed ) .
&quot; in addition , more studies were carried out on 119 patients with kidney transpl@@ ant and 129 patients with liver transpl@@ ant and investig@@ ates how Adv@@ ant@@ raf is recorded compared to Pro@@ gra@@ f / pro@@ gr@@ aft of the body . &quot;

&quot; in case of patients with possible hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other constitu@@ ents may not be applied . &quot;
patients and doctors have to be careful when others ( especially some herbal ) medicines have been taken at the same time with Adv@@ oc@@ raf as the Adv@@ ant@@ raf @-@ dose or the dose of the same can be adjusted accordingly .

only doctors who are familiar with the immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant therapy and treatment of transpl@@ ant patients should arrange this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant therapy .
&quot; due to clin@@ ically relevant differences of the system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , this can lead to transpl@@ ant@@ ations or an increased incidence of side effects , including sub@@ - or over@@ immune repression . &quot;
patients should always keep the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage adjustment ; re@@ orientation of the formulation or the regime should only be made under the narro@@ wing control of one in the transpl@@ ant medical physician ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; as a result of conversion to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug surveillance and corresponding dos@@ is@@ customiz@@ ations must be carried out to ensure that the system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains . &quot;
the dosage of Adv@@ ag@@ raf should be primarily based on the clinical assessment of det@@ ention and toler@@ ability in the individual case and on blood @-@ level regulations ( see below ) recommendations
&quot; after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f on Adv@@ ant@@ raf , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ Tal@@ mirror should be controlled before the switch and over two weeks after conversion . &quot;
&quot; day 4 was the system@@ ic exposure , measured as Tal@@ mirror , with both form@@ ulations both at kidney and in @-@ er@@ ated patients . &quot;
careful and repeated controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Tal@@ mirror are recommended during the first two weeks after transpl@@ ant under Adv@@ oc@@ raf to ensure adequate substance exposure in the immediate transpl@@ antation phase .
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low clear@@ ance , an adaptation of the Adv@@ ag@@ raf @-@ Dos@@ is@@ schem@@ as can last several days until the ste@@ ady State reaches . &quot;
&quot; if the condition of the patient allows no or@@ ale intake of drugs , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment can be introduced ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml of conc@@ ent@@ arte to produce a inf@@ usion solution ) with a dose of approx . &quot;
&quot; the application of Z@@ ur supp@@ ression of the transpl@@ antation has to be maintained by the immun@@ ology ; consequently , a maximum duration of the or@@ tal therapy cannot be specified . &quot;
Dos@@ is@@ ations - Ni@@ er@@ entr@@ ine@@ al transpl@@ ant prophy@@ la@@ xis of the or@@ ectal cancer therapy should begin with 0.20 - 0,30 mg / kg / day as once daily gift at the morning .
further dosage adjustment can be later required as the pharmaceutical in@@ ine@@ tics can change from Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the course of stabil@@ isation of the patient after the transpl@@ antation .
Dos@@ is@@ recommendations - liver transpl@@ ant prophy@@ la@@ xis of the transpl@@ ant therapy should begin with 0.10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift at the morning .
dosage adjustment - switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f on Adv@@ ag@@ raf must be a tran@@ sp@@ ective receiver of twice daily dose of pro@@ gra@@ f capsules on a once daily intake of Adv@@ ant@@ raf so that the conversion in relation 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) obtained on the entire day @-@ dose to take place .

&quot; heart transpl@@ ant For adult patients , which are placed on Adv@@ oc@@ raf , is a or@@ ale initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day daily once in the morning . &quot;
&quot; other Tran@@ spl@@ itter Rec@@ ei@@ vers Re@@ quired does not exist any clinical experience with lung cancer , p@@ ank@@ atic - and color@@ ectal Plan , in an oral initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis of 0,@@ 2 mg / kg / day and for intestinal tran@@ splan@@ ts in an oral initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis of 0.@@ 3 mg / kg / day to use . &quot;
dos@@ is@@ customiz@@ ations in special patient groups with reduced liver function Z@@ ur maintenance of blood levels in the trendy area can be required in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions a her@@ b@@ tion of the dose .
&quot; patients with reduced kidney function As the kidney function does not affect the pharmaceutical in@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , it may be assumed that a dosage adjustment is not required . &quot;
&quot; due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potenti@@ als of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , is a careful monitoring of the kidney function ( including a regular determination of ser@@ ver@@ tically modified , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ incl@@ ination and a monitoring of the ure@@ th@@ ine ) . &quot;
changing of Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ ant@@ raf When the conversion from a Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in@@ - to a tac@@ tical @-@ based therapy is advisable . ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
&quot; recommendations on the Tal@@ mirror in full @-@ ut , the dose should be primarily based on the clinical assessment of det@@ ention and toler@@ ability in the individual case by random sampling of full @-@ level tac@@ tical controls . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended to perform frequent controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us talents during the first two weeks after transpl@@ ant , followed by peri@@ odi@@ c controls during the maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; blood levels of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also be changed after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f on Adv@@ ant@@ raf , tin @-@ adap@@ tion , changes of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant therapy or with simultaneous application of substances which could change the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood circulation ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since Adv@@ oc@@ raf is a medicine with a low clear@@ ance , adjustments of the dose may need several days until the Ste@@ ady State entered . &quot;
&quot; the data in clinical trials allow you to conclude that a successful treatment in most cases is possible , if the talents levels in the blood 20 n@@ g / ml can not exceed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical practice , the talents of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the first time after liver transpl@@ ant@@ ations usually lie in the range of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; during the following accounting therapy of liver , kidney and heart tran@@ splan@@ ts , as a rule , blood vessels were used in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; this has led to serious undes@@ irable events , including transpl@@ ant@@ ages or other side effects which can occur in a result of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us under@@ - or over@@ exposure . &quot;
patients should always keep the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage adjustment ; re@@ orientation of the formulation or the regime should only be made under the narro@@ wing control of one in the transpl@@ ant medical physician ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; 5 Z@@ ur treatment of adult patients with transpl@@ ant har@@ ass@@ ment , which proved to be proven to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants as therap@@ ists , are still no clinical data for the ret@@ ailer formulation . &quot;
&quot; to the prophy@@ la@@ xis of the transpl@@ ant at adult heart tran@@ splan@@ ts , and transpl@@ ant@@ ees in child @-@ old are still not a clinical data for the ret@@ ard@@ ant formulation Adv@@ ag@@ raf . &quot;
&quot; because of possible interactions between the tac@@ tical levels of the tac@@ tical mirror in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the intake of the cur@@ rants ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) is included , or other plant healing during treatment with Adv@@ ant@@ raf ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea is a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - concentr@@ ations in the blood , since the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels under such circumstances can be subjected to significant fluctu@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , under Pro@@ gra@@ f a cardi@@ omy@@ opathy was referred to Kam@@ mer@@ - or sep@@ um@@ hyper@@ trop@@ ho@@ ie , which therefore can also occur under Adv@@ oc@@ raf . &quot;
&quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders , are an already existing cardi@@ ac disease , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver dys@@ functions , infections , liquid @-@ load and oils . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , the effect of sunlight or UV @-@ light should be restricted by suitable clothing or use of a sun @-@ protection by using a high protection factor . &quot;
&quot; if patients , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , symptoms for PRE@@ S such as head@@ aches , changed consciousness levels , cr@@ amps and visual dys@@ functions should show a radi@@ ological investigation ( e.@@ g . &quot;
&quot; since Adv@@ oc@@ raf bore , ret@@ ard@@ ert , L@@ act@@ ose is included in patients with the rare Gal@@ act@@ osis Gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ intoler@@ ance , L@@ act@@ ase @-@ deficiency or gl@@ uc@@ ose non @-@ specific caution . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application of pharmac@@ euticals or herbal remedies are known as Hem@@ mer or in@@ duc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , the metabolism of Tac@@ tic@@ lim@@ us can increase or reduce the blood values of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us . &quot;
&quot; it is therefore recommended that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - blood levels can change in simultaneous gift of substances , which can change the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A metabolism , and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose to maintain uniform concentr@@ ations accordingly . ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; a strongly distinctive interaction was made with an@@ tim@@ yk@@ oti@@ ka such as K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol , Flu@@ con@@ az@@ ol , I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ol and V@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ol , as well as with the Macro@@ lid antibiotic Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ eas@@ ers ( z ) . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ oc@@ ine@@ tics studies , that the rise in blood levels mainly from the increased bio@@ availability of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , caused by the in@@ hibition of gast@@ ro@@ pe@@ al contrac@@ tion , results . &quot;
&quot; high @-@ value Pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or Meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on , as it is used in acute extraction actions , can increase the concentration of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood or lower . &quot;
effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on the metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ Hem@@ mer ; therefore the simultaneous application of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is metabo@@ li@@ zed by the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 metabo@@ li@@ zed that may affect the metabolism .
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can put down the clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid @-@ contrac@@ ep@@ tive and thereby increasing hormonal exposure , in decisions about recep@@ tive action is especially careful . &quot;
&quot; the results of animals have shown that Tac@@ tic@@ lim@@ us potential , decre@@ asing the clear@@ ance of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ on , and extend their semi @-@ value @-@ time . &quot;
&quot; the results of a small number of investigations on transpl@@ ant patients have no evidence that under Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there is risk of unwanted events with regard to the course and the result of pregnancy . &quot;

Adv@@ ate is used for treatment and prevention of bl@@ eeding in patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( one by the lack of factor VIII @-@ related , inn@@ ate blood @-@ interference ) . &quot;
dosage and frequency of use are based on whether Adv@@ ate to treat bl@@ eeding or prevention of bl@@ eeding in surgical procedures .
patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency that causes blood flow problems like bl@@ eeding in joints , muscles or internal organs . &quot;
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extrac@@ ted from human plas@@ ma but after a method which is called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA @-@ technology . &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a cell , into which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced to the formation of the human bar@@ inn@@ acle factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; Adv@@ ate is similar to another in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but similarly , however , is different so that medicines does not contain proteins or animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies in patients with severe to medium @-@ severe har@@ op@@ hili@@ a A , including a study with 53 children under six years , the application of the medication was evaluated for prevention of bl@@ eeding , as well as in surgical procedures . &quot;
&quot; in the main study , the effectiveness of Adv@@ ate was evaluated in the prevention of bl@@ eeding in 86 % of 510 new blood @-@ sep@@ tum with &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; respectively &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are Sch@@ win@@ del , head@@ aches , Py@@ re@@ xie ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; Adv@@ ate must not be used in patients who may potentially be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against the human od@@ ine factor VIII , mouse or Ham@@ ster@@ ers or any other components . &quot;
March 2004 the European Commission shared the B@@ ax@@ ter AG permit permission for the transport of Adv@@ ate in the entire European Union .
dosage The dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution treatment are based on the sword of the factor VIII @-@ Man@@ gels , after the place and the extent of the blood and the clinical state of the patient . &quot;
&quot; at the following hem@@ mor@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events , the factor VIII @-@ activity in the appropriate period is not among the specified plas@@ mas@@ onry ( in % of the standard or in i.e. / dl ) . &quot;
injection all 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repe@@ ating until the p@@ ains and acute symptoms are removed .
injection of 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the risk to the patient is above .
&quot; during the treatment process , the control of the dose and frequency of inj@@ ections will be reasonable for the factor VIII @-@ plas@@ mas@@ onry . &quot;
individual patients may differ in their reaction to factor VIII to reach various in vi@@ vo Recovery and have different half @-@ value times .
3 prophy@@ la@@ xis Z@@ ur long @-@ term prophy@@ la@@ xis of blood in patients with severe har@@ op@@ hili@@ a A should be given to doses between 20 and 40 that are given by factor VIII per kg body weight at a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
&quot; if the expected factor VIII @-@ plas@@ ma activities can not be achieved , or if the bl@@ eeding is not controlled with a reasonable dose , a test must be done if necessary to detect an in@@ em@@ bit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective , so other therapeutic interventions must wo@@ unded . &quot;
&quot; the administration speed is to be directed after the end of the patient , with maximum inj@@ ecting rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . &quot;
the formation of neutr@@ alised antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ ko@@ ag@@ ul@@ li@@ atory activity of factor VIII @-@ oriented Ig@@ G immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins that are quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plas@@ ma by modi@@ fying Beth@@ es@@ da As@@ say .
&quot; to develop the risk , inhibit@@ ors with the extent of exposure to the factor VIII , whereby the risk within the first 20 ex@@ position stage is on the largest and genetic and other factors . &quot;
&quot; in patients treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 expos@@ ures and an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ cally known in@@ stig@@ bit@@ or@@ isation , after conversion from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product to another , the re @-@ encounter of ( lowest ) inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; due to the rare appearance of the h@@ amm@@ op@@ hili@@ a A in women are over the application of factor VIII during pregnancy and breast@@ feeding period . &quot;
&quot; the patients with the greatest number of patients were in@@ stig@@ bit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) , all occurred in previously untreated patients , raised a higher risk to formation of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ z@@ zin@@ ess ( each 3 patients ) . &quot;
&quot; very common ( &gt; 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data cannot be remo@@ vable ) . &quot;

&quot; based on the data of the first data available , the CH@@ MP available has been rated as positive , but considering that the safety profile must be closely monitored in the following reasons : &quot;
&quot; therefore , the CH@@ MP is based on the basis of the Security Council of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which makes a filing of PS@@ UR@@ s all 6 months required , decided that the authorization procedures should apply for 5 years . &quot;
December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ec@@ ular Limited was officially approved by the Committee on Human@@ arz@@ t@@ ant ( CH@@ MP ) to resume its application for approval by Adv@@ exin for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
&quot; however , however , the chest , the brain , the bones , or the soft parts ( tissues which combines other structures in the body , surrounds and supports ) . &quot;
&quot; it is a type of virus that gene@@ tically modified , that there is a gene in the cells of the body . &quot;
&quot; the virus in Adv@@ exin is a &quot; &quot; aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; &quot; which changed that there is no copies of themselves to produce themselves and thus no infections in human beings can trigger . &quot;
Adv@@ exin could have been shed straight into the tum@@ ors and thus enable the canc@@ erous cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
&quot; the p@@ 53 protein , which is made from that not def@@ ective in the human body using existing p@@ 53 gene , contributes to the recovery of corrupt DNA and to kill the cells if the DNA cannot be recovered . &quot;
&quot; at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ cancer , with which the p@@ 53 gene is def@@ ective , the p@@ 53 @-@ Protein does not work properly , and the canc@@ erous cells can continue to grow and share . &quot;
&quot; the company laid data from a study involving a patient prior to the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ cancer in the field of basement , in the bones and in the brain . &quot;
&quot; after the CH@@ MP had checked the answers of the company on the questions asked , there were still some questions un@@ explained . &quot;
&quot; based on testing the initial entries created by CH@@ MP on Day 120 , a list of questions that will be sent to the company . &quot;
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP opinion , it was not sufficiently proven that the injection of Adv@@ exin in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ore takes advantage of the patient . &quot;
the committee also had concerns relating to the processing of the drug in the body and the type of administration and the safety of the drug .
&quot; in addition , the company had not sufficiently proven that Adv@@ exin could be manufactured in a reliable manner and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient . &quot;
&quot; the company did not note the CH@@ MP , whether the withdrawal of consequences for patients who has currently participating in clinical studies or &quot; Comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate Use &quot; programmes with Adv@@ exin . &quot;
&quot; changed active ingredients , meaning that the tablets are so combined , that one of the effective ingredients are released immediately and the other slowly is released over a few hours . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat the symptoms of the seasonal Rhin@@ i@@ tis ( h@@ ack@@ et , by an allergy to poll@@ en res@@ ided inflammation ) in patients with nas@@ al ger@@ m swelling ( hidden nose ) . &quot;
&quot; for adults and adolescents from 12 years , the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice a tablet daily , which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food . &quot;
&quot; the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and ended as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al sl@@ ender ( pet@@ ri@@ fied nose ) . &quot;
a treatment period of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medication can be moved to the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main @-@ effective dimensions were the changes of gravity of the hay@@ loft which were reported by the patient before the beginning of treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
&quot; during the study , patients captured their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and reviewed with a standard sc@@ ala , how hard the symptoms were in the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; for viewing of all gr@@ ading of the nose reported the patients , the aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze reported the patients who took the aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , compared with 35,@@ 9 % in the patient , the pseudo @-@ eph@@ edr@@ ine alone . &quot;
&quot; if only the swelling of the nas@@ al gland , patients were regarded as Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze an all@@ evi@@ ation of symptoms by 3@@ 7.2 % compared to 26,@@ 7 % in the patient who took the disaster alone . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ die ( heart hunting ) , harmon@@ izing , head@@ ache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ enz ( sleeping ) , in@@ som@@ nia and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may be used for patients who may possibly be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Des@@ ir@@ at@@ adin , Pse@@ u@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine or any of the other components , opposing agents or Lor@@ at@@ adin ( a different drug for the treatment of allergi@@ es ) are not applied . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may also not be used in patients who suffer from a bott@@ len@@ eck ( higher water pressure ) , cardi@@ ac or vas@@ cular disease ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ re@@ osis ( caused by a brain @-@ blood stroke ) or have a risk for a hem@@ orrho@@ ean stroke . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission shared an approval for the transport of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze across the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , however it is the whole to sw@@ allow ( i.e. without it to sm@@ ashed or to ch@@ ew ) . &quot;
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be applied due to the failure of data for in@@ consistency and effectiveness ( see Section 5.1 ) not in children under 12 years of age .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms .
&quot; it is recommended to limit the time of time to 10 days , since long @-@ term waste the activity of Pse@@ u@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine can decrease in time . &quot;
&quot; after the decrease of the swelling of the Schlei@@ cher in the upper respir@@ atory , the treatment can be continued with des@@ o@@ vers@@ adin as mon@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; since Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze Pse@@ u@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine contains , the medicine is also con@@ domini@@ ated in patients suffering with a mon@@ opo@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) -@@ Hem@@ mer or within 2 weeks after completion of such therapy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ e@@ tical activity in combination of Pse@@ u@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine like Bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , Per@@ go@@ lid , Er@@ erg@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other dec@@ on@@ ges@@ tive Rhin@@ oplast@@ y , eph@@ yl@@ ep@@ hr@@ ine , Eph@@ edr@@ ine , Ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ olin , Nap@@ haz@@ ard , etc . ) . &quot;
the safety and effectiveness of this combination therapy have not been tested for this patient stret@@ cher and the data are not enough to speak corresponding recommendations for dosage .
&quot; the safety and effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver disorder , and the data are not enough to speak the corresponding recommendations for dosage . &quot;
&quot; patients need to be informed about the treatment in the appearance of hyper@@ tension , or a t@@ ach@@ y@@ ar@@ die or of Pal@@ ot@@ ations , cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , nau@@ sea or any other neurological symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or rein@@ forcement of head@@ aches ) must be set . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of the following patient groups , patients suffering from digital is • patients with cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia • patients with hyper@@ tension • patients with hyper@@ tension • patients with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ din@@ ous in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder construction or bronze in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is aimed at least 48 hours before carrying out dermat@@ ological testing , as Anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka otherwise can prevent positive reactions to indicators for Hau@@ tre@@ actions or reduce it in their scale . &quot;
&quot; in the framework of clinical trials with Des@@ ir@@ at@@ adin , in which Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol additionally have been administ@@ ered , however , were no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes of the Plas@@ tic@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
&quot; in the results of the psychological tests , there were no significant differences between the patients with the disaster and those with plac@@ ebo patients , regardless of whether it was taken with alcohol alone or alcohol . &quot;
&quot; this has not yet been identified for the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ ir@@ at@@ adin , nor has not been identified as interactions with other drugs can not be ruled out . &quot;
&quot; deser@@ at@@ adin inhi@@ bits in @-@ vi@@ vo CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in @-@ vit@@ ro studies have shown that the medicine CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not hem@@ med and neither a sub@@ str@@ ate nor an in@@ stig@@ ator of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ one . &quot;
&quot; the in@@ conceivable of the application of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not secured , experience from a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies however do not increase the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities in comparison to frequency in normal population . &quot;
since realisation studies on animals are not always transmitted to humans and to cause vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ al characteristics of Pse@@ u@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine should not be applied Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in pregnancy .
&quot; however , patients should be raised about it that in very rare cases may come to a ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness which can lead to an impair@@ ment of the traffic , or the ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; symptoms can vary between a Z@@ NS depression ( Se@@ coding , Ap@@ no@@ e , dimin@@ ished mental attention , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , heart circulation ) and a Z@@ n@@ NS stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , Tre@@ ble , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; head@@ aches , anxi@@ ous , fright@@ ening , mus@@ cular , mus@@ cular , arousal , At@@ emin@@ in@@ suff@@ iciency , cardi@@ ac , respir@@ atory , t@@ ect@@ ins , t@@ aming , t@@ ann@@ ins , t@@ innitus , visual dys@@ functional , and hyper@@ tension , or hyp@@ ot@@ ony . &quot;
&quot; a Z@@ NS stimulation is especially prob@@ able in children , just like A@@ trop@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth @-@ dry , p@@ up@@ lift@@ rigi@@ d and - di@@ lat@@ ation , hood , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gast@@ ro@@ man in@@ ale symptoms ) . &quot;
&quot; these include both the in@@ hibition of self @-@ locking cy@@ to@@ k@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human cor@@ st@@ cells / Bas@@ ophil@@ es , as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the eag@@ le molec@@ ule P @-@ rar@@ er on end@@ ot@@ hel@@ m cells . &quot;
&quot; with an individual dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin showed no influence on standard measurement sizes including the strengthening of subjective sl@@ ings or the tasks which are connected to the thread . &quot;
controlled clinical trials was reported in the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily in comparison to plac@@ ebo .
the or@@ ale application of Pse@@ u@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in the recommended dosage can cause further sympath@@ om@@ im@@ e@@ tical effects such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ ate or manifestations of a Z@@ n@@ NS arousal . &quot;
&quot; there were 1,@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal Rhin@@ i@@ tis , with 4@@ 14 patients Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets got . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets , determined by the overall cor@@ es for symptoms ( except nas@@ al s@@ ger@@ m swelling ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Pse@@ u@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the vibr@@ ating effect , determined by the nas@@ al ger@@ m swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ ir@@ at@@ adin on the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or ethnic @-@ ethnic groups . &quot;
within the framework of a single @-@ dose study to the pharmaceutical ine@@ tics of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is Des@@ ir@@ at@@ adin within 30 minutes after the administration in the plas@@ ma .
&quot; after the per@@ or@@ atory application of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy promot@@ ers over 14 days the flow of hydro@@ chlor@@ ine , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ o@@ vers@@ adin and Pse@@ u@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in day 10 reached . &quot;
&quot; as part of a pharmac@@ oc@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dos@@ is@@ study , which was carried out with the formulation as a tablet to healthy adult pro@@ cl@@ ans , was found that four Pro@@ b@@ anden Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was bad . &quot;
a component @-@ Inter@@ action study reveals that the exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of Pse@@ u@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine after the sole gift of Pse@@ u@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in bio@@ ä@@ equivalent was for exposure to a Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety sp@@ harm@@ ac@@ ology , for tox@@ icity in repeti@@ tive gift , the pre@@ clinical data can be recognized with Des@@ ir@@ at@@ ine , however no particular dangers for humans . &quot;
&quot; the combination poss@@ essed no greater tox@@ icity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient of Pse@@ u@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; in reproductive @-@ related studies , the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adin / Pse@@ u@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was in the oral gift at rats in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in rab@@ bits in a dosage from up to 120 mg / kg / day not ter@@ at@@ ogen . &quot;

A@@ eri@@ us was examined in eight studies with about 4 800 adults and young people with allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis ( including four studies in seasonal Rhin@@ i@@ tis and two studies in patients who also had as@@ thma ) .
&quot; the effectiveness has been measured by changing the symptoms ( itch , number and size of the quad@@ ru@@ ding of sleep and performance on the day ) before and after six @-@ weeks treatment was established . &quot;
&quot; other studies have been submitted to prove that the body is the sy@@ rup , the solution for taking and the mel@@ ting tablets in the same manner as the tablets and the application in children is harmless . &quot;
&quot; in allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis , when the results of all studies were considered , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us to an average decrease of the symptoms ( symptoms ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in the patient who received a plac@@ ebo . &quot;

there is limited experience from clinical trials to effectiveness in the use of Des@@ ir@@ at@@ adin with young people from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
&quot; the treatment of inter@@ mitt@@ ances allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis ( Performance of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be done according to the previous disease process , and can end up after the end of the symptoms and be resum@@ ed at their resum@@ ption . &quot;
in the Persian Rhin@@ i@@ tis ( appearance of symptoms at 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) can be recommended to patients during allergi@@ es period .

&quot; clinical trials in different indications , including allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis and chronic idi@@ opathic urine , were reported in the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most frequently raised side effects , on the more common than with plac@@ ebo , fatigue ( 1,2 % ) , mouth @-@ dry ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0,@@ 6 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study with 578 y@@ outh@@ ful patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common secondary head@@ aches were treated at 5,@@ 9 % of patients who were treated with chlor@@ o@@ vers@@ adin and were treated with 6.6 % of the patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ professional study , in which up to 45 mg di@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( nin@@ ety times of clinical dose ) were administ@@ ered , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;

&quot; in addition to the established classification in sa@@ is@@ onal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis can also be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis and Persian rhin@@ i@@ tis . &quot;
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis is defined as the appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
Persian rhin@@ i@@ tis is defined as an occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
as on the basis of the overall cor@@ es of the questionn@@ aires for the quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ economic vi@@ tis was decreased , dimin@@ ished A@@ eri@@ us effectively caused by seasonal @-@ allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis . &quot;
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ aria was examined for further forms of the Ur@@ tik@@ aria because the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology regardless of the path@@ ology in the different forms similar to and chronic patients can be simpler to be considered easier and chronic patients .
&quot; since the hist@@ am@@ inf@@ ancy is an important factor in all ur@@ inary diseases , is expected that Des@@ ir@@ at@@ adin is expected to improve symptoms apart from the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ aria . this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines . &quot;
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic urine was A@@ eri@@ us effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the lowering of size and number of squares at the end of the first tin interval . &quot;
&quot; as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka in chronic idi@@ opathic urine , the minority of patients , which is not found on anti@@ hist@@ amine , out of the study . &quot;
an improvement of the itch by more than 50 % was observed at 55 % of the patients with disaster patients compared to 19 % of the patients treated with plac@@ ebo patients .
&quot; the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the disorder of sleep and wax , as it was measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate these variables . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmaceutical in@@ ine@@ tics study , in which the patients @-@ demo@@ s are comparable with the general seasonal Rhin@@ i@@ tis population , was achieved at 4 % of patients achieved a higher concentration of di@@ lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
there are no maintenance points for a clin@@ ically relevant Kum@@ ulation after once daily use of Des@@ ir@@ at@@ adin ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days before .
&quot; however , the enzy@@ mes of Des@@ ir@@ at@@ adin responsible enzy@@ me was not yet identified , so interactions with other drugs will not be ruled out completely . &quot;

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of the meals to all@@ evi@@ ate the symptoms of the symptoms of allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis ( including interactive rhin@@ i@@ tis ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see below 5.1 ) .
the prescription doctor should be aware that most cases of Rhin@@ i@@ tis in children under 2 years are caused by infection ( see below 4.4 ) and that no data are available to support a infectious rhin@@ i@@ tis with A@@ eri@@ us .
&quot; in addition to the exclusion of upper respir@@ atory infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ alies should play a role in diagnosis , physical investigations and corresponding laboratory and skin investigations . &quot;
about 6 % of adults and children aged 2 to 11 years are metabo@@ li@@ ze di@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and learn a higher sub @-@ load load ( see below 5.2 ) .
&quot; the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years , which is restricted , is identical with the children that are normally metabo@@ li@@ zed . &quot;
this drug contains Sac@@ char@@ ose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients should not take patients with inherited problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance or su@@ cro@@ ase inhibit@@ or in@@ suff@@ iciency of this medicine .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not observed during the clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol can be administ@@ ered ( see below 5.1 ) .
in a clin@@ ically @-@ pharmac@@ ological study was not reinforced during simultaneous intake of A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol ( see below 5.1 ) .
the overall prevalence of side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up group as with the plac@@ ebo group .
&quot; clinical studies with adults and young people in different indications , including allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis and chronic idi@@ opathic urine , were reported in the recommended dose 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ disciplinary study on adults and juven@@ iles , which were administ@@ ered up to 45 mg of di@@ lor@@ adin ( nin@@ ety clinical dose ) were not observed , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
children aged between 1 and 11 years have arrived for an anti @-@ hist@@ amine therapy in question received a daily dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ind@@ osis of 1.25 mg ( at the age between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( between 6 and 11 years ) .
&quot; because the course of allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis / chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic urine and the profile of di@@ lor@@ at@@ ine in adults and children are similar , the effectiveness data of disaster can be extrac@@ ted in adults on children &apos;s population . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical study with multiple specialists in adults and juven@@ iles , in the disaster in a dosage was applied to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clin@@ ically @-@ pharmac@@ ological study on adults and young people , in the disaster in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the ne@@ un@@ fold of clinical dose ) was applied over ten days in adults , no extension of Q@@ T@@ c @-@ Inter@@ v@@ alls . &quot;

&quot; in two plac@@ ebo controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic urine was A@@ eri@@ us effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the lowering of size and number of squares at the end of the first tin interval . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this limited metabo@@ lic phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations higher in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
&quot; similar pharmac@@ ological parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ oc@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ professional study with the Sir@@ up@@ form@@ ulations of children between 2 and 11 years , with allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis , the restricted metabo@@ li@@ ze . &quot;

June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. the Committee on Human@@ arz@@ t@@ ants ( CH@@ MP ) officially created that the company will resume its application for authorisation from A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to the prevention of viol@@ i H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 @-@ influ@@ enza in adults and older people .
&quot; A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and older people to protect flu , which is caused by the tribe ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influ@@ enza A virus . &quot;
&quot; this is a special kind of vaccine that might cause a trunk of the flu , which might cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; a grip pan@@ de@@ mic breaks off when a new tribe of the flu @-@ virus emerg@@ es , which can easily spread from man to man , because people still have no immunity ( no protection ) against it . &quot;
&quot; according to the filing of the vaccine , the immune system recogni@@ zes the immune system included in the vaccine as &quot; body @-@ foreign &quot; and forms antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; by doing this , the immune system later is able to form a contact with a flu @-@ virus this pedi@@ ms faster . &quot;
&quot; afterwards the membran@@ es of the virus with the &quot; &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which recogni@@ zes the human body as a body @-@ alien ) , separated and used as part of the vaccine . &quot;
&quot; a inspection of some of the study records showed that the study was not conducted according to the &quot; &quot; good clinical practice &quot; &quot; ( G@@ CP ) . &quot;
this allows the scope of clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine not to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre@@ pan@@ de@@ mic vaccines .
&quot; should you take part in a clinical examination and need further information about your treatment , please contact your doctor . &quot;
&quot; if you would like more information regarding the foundation of the CH@@ MP opinion , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which are caused by human immune vulnerable res@@ ili@@ rus from type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) which is caused to inf@@ lic@@ ted Imm@@ une Def@@ iciency Syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who cannot sw@@ allow the capsules , can be taken as a solution to the one , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the security of this combination was not investigated . &quot;
&quot; A@@ generative should only be ordered if the doctor has tested , which anti @-@ viral medicines has previously been taken , and the lik@@ eli@@ hood has been judged that the virus is applied to the drug . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and other anti@@ viral medicines . &quot;
in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg is aimed at the recommended dose of a@@ gener@@ ase after the body weight .
&quot; in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , it reduces the HIV amount in blood and keeps them on a low level . &quot;
&quot; AIDS not to heal , however , can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also delay the development of associated infections and disorders . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , however , were examined in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , were examined in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults previously had not been treated with prot@@ eas@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; that with low do@@ si@@ fied k@@ avi@@ r reinforced medicinal drugs , was compared with 206 adults , which had been taken before prot@@ eas@@ ants , with other prot@@ eas@@ ers . &quot;
main indic@@ t@@ ator for the effectiveness was the proportion of patients with no thought@@ ful concentr@@ ations of HIV in the blood ( Vir@@ us@@ last ) or the change in the viral last after treatment .
&quot; in the studies with patients who had previously had a prot@@ eas@@ ant previously had no viral last than 400 copies / ml as under plac@@ ebo , but A@@ gener@@ are was less effective than an in@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in children , A@@ gener@@ are also decreased the viral load , although treated by the children who were previously treated with prot@@ eas@@ ers , only very few on the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the study with adults , the previously treated with prot@@ eas@@ ants , the viral medicines of drugs called the Vir@@ us@@ last after 16 @-@ weekly treatment as well as other prot@@ eas@@ ants : &quot;
&quot; in patients with HIV , which was resist@@ ent against four other prot@@ eas@@ ants , it came under A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger waste of the Vir@@ us@@ last after four weeks than in the patient who continued their previous protests . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ generative ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , v@@ om@@ iting , rash and Fati@@ gue ( fatigue ) . &quot;
2 / 3 p@@ gener@@ als may not be used in patients who may potentially be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against am@@ bl@@ en@@ avi@@ r or any of the other components .
&quot; aspir@@ ation may not be used in patients , the Johann@@ is@@ kr@@ aut ( a herbal supplement to the treatment of depression ) or drugs that are just as drugs are built and in high concentr@@ ations in the blood health are harmful . &quot;
&quot; as with other drugs against HIV consists of patients , the A@@ gener@@ als , the risk of an Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y ( changes in the distribution of the body fat ) , a oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose ( symptom of bone tissue ) , or an immun@@ isation syn@@ dro@@ ms ( symptoms of an infection caused by forming the immune system ) . &quot;
&quot; the Committee on Human@@ arz@@ t@@ ants ( CH@@ MP ) conclude that the benefits of A@@ generative drugs used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines used to treat with other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy for HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
&quot; A@@ generative is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ oc@@ ine@@ tic amplifier , but the committee was noted that the benefits of A@@ generative in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who have previously seen no prot@@ eas@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally approved under &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; , &quot; since the approval of scientific reasons , limited information is limited . &quot;
October 2000 shared the European Commission of G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited a permit for the transport of A@@ gener@@ ase in the whole of the European Union .
&quot; an@@ am@@ ase is used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1@@ - infected , prot@@ eas@@ former adults and children from 4 years . &quot;
&quot; usually , aspir@@ ase capsules are to be administ@@ ered for pharmac@@ euticals capsules on pharmac@@ o@@ en@@ avi@@ r , along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the use of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance of the patient , and the treatment of patients ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r as a solution to take up is 14 % lower than by am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution are not inter@@ change@@ able on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; 2 If A@@ generic capsules are applied without the ampli@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sting ) , higher doses must be applied to an@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
pharmaceutical in@@ ine@@ tics , effectiveness and safety of as@@ gener@@ als in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ eas@@ ers were not examined in children . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ is is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the failure of data to un@@ obj@@ ection@@ able and effectiveness ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on pharmac@@ ological data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions on 300 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application is to be performed in patients with mild or moderate liver interference with caution , in patients with severe liver function , it is consistent ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; aspir@@ ation may not be given at the same time with pharmac@@ euticals , which have a small therapeutic width and also sub@@ str@@ ates sub@@ str@@ ate of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ en@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot;
herbal supplements that contain Johann@@ is@@ kr@@ aut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) may not be applied due to risk @-@ reduced sculpture and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r during the intake of am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r during the intake of am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ are or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to an healing of HIV infection and that they can also continue to be opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of an HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including the treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transmission of HIV to other through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; usually , A@@ generative capsules are to be applied together with low doses of k@@ avi@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients who suffer chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti @-@ anti@@ viral therapy therapy , have increased risk for heavy liver effects with potentially fatal course . &quot;
&quot; for the event of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant information on these medicines . &quot;
patients with existing reduced liver function including chronic disease function including chronic @-@ active hepatitis show an increased frequency of liver therapy under anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
&quot; the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ are and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with fluid body or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ds , which are not recommended over CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended , unless the potential benefits of treatment is covered the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ ne@@ tics of the effects including Mor@@ bus Cus@@ hing and Supp@@ y of the adren@@ al function ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
as the contrac@@ tion of the H@@ MG Co@@ A reduction inhibit@@ ors Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ vast@@ atin strongly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is dependent on the simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase with Lov@@ atin and Sim@@ vast@@ atin because of the increased risk of My@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ ta not recommended .
&quot; 4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , like car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ular Rati@@ o ) , are available methods for determining the substance identification . &quot;
&quot; in case of patients who are taking these medicines at the same time , aspir@@ ation may be less effective due to decreased plastic levels of am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r less effective ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the possibility of metabo@@ lic interactions with am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormonal contrac@@ eption can be changed , however the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions . &quot;
&quot; when meth@@ ad@@ on is given at the same time with am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored at op@@ i@@ at@@ ent@@ ment symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of k@@ avi@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; due to the possible risk of risk tox@@ icity , due to the high prop@@ ylene gly@@ co@@ ders of the A@@ generative solution to one of four years , it should be applied to children under a age of four years and should be applied with caution at certain other patient groups . &quot;
&quot; A@@ generative should be set on duration 5 , when a rash accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms , or the Schlei@@ cher is involved ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients who received an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ eas@@ ants , was reported on the appearance of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia or an exception of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus . &quot;
many of the patients had other diseases to their therapy drugs needed to be associated with the development of a diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or a hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
&quot; B. higher age , and with drug addi@@ cts factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ viral treatment and associated metabo@@ lic disorders associated with it . &quot;
&quot; at h@@ amm@@ ophil@@ es patients ( type A and B ) , who were treated with prot@@ eas@@ ers , are reports of an increase of blood vessels including spontaneous k@@ ut@@ aner hem@@ at@@ oms and hem@@ an@@ thro@@ es . &quot;
&quot; in case of HIV infected patients with heavy immune therapy ( ART ) can develop a inflammatory reaction to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or res@@ ist opportun@@ istic infections , which leads to severe clinical conditions or deterioration of symptoms . &quot;
&quot; although a multi @-@ factory app@@ rais@@ al is accepted ( including use of cor@@ tical ero@@ ids , alcohol consumption , heavy immun@@ ology , higher body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ) , were reported cases of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose especially in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width of drugs must not be given simultaneously with pharmac@@ euticals that have a low therapeutic width and also sub@@ str@@ ates sub@@ str@@ ate of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ en@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width a@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be combined with pharmac@@ euticals whose substance is primarily associated with pharmac@@ euticals and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r causes that lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and lead to a resistance development .
&quot; in trying to attempt the low plas@@ mas@@ onry through a dosage increased by other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , were very frequently observed unwanted effects on the liver . &quot;
Johann@@ is@@ kr@@ aut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) The Ser@@ um@@ mirror of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r can be de@@ gr@@ aded by the simultaneous application of herbal preparations ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) .
&quot; if a patient is already cur@@ tail@@ ed , the am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r@@ spiegel and if possible to check the viral load and to reset the cur@@ rants . &quot;
a dosage adjustment for one of the drugs is not required when Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r administ@@ ered together with am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz below ) .
5@@ 08 % increased for C@@ max against 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) administ@@ ered .
in clinical trials d@@ osing of 600 mg Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily used to substanti@@ ate the effectiveness and un@@ obj@@ ectivity of this treatment schem@@ at@@ as .
52 % lower when Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with calcium ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) administ@@ ered .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r in the plas@@ ma that were obtained by the combination of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with calcium ( 400 mg Lop@@ on@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day .
&quot; a d@@ osing recommendations for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r and Cal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , there is a close @-@ sized surveillance , since the effectiveness and un@@ think@@ ability of this combination is unknown . &quot;
&quot; there was no pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic study conducted in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but due to the anta@@ ci@@ de component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , is recommended that the revenues of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see Ant@@ azi@@ da below ) . &quot;
therefore at the property of E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz in combination with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dosage adjustment required .
&quot; the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz in combination with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended , since the exposure of both prot@@ eas@@ ants would be low . &quot;
the effect of Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ in to other prot@@ eas@@ ants and existing limited data might suggest that Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ into the Ser@@ um@@ en@@ avi@@ r may be lo@@ wers .
&quot; if this medicine should be used at the same time , caution is advisable to be less effective since Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din because of the decreased and possibly sub@@ therapeutic plas@@ mas@@ onry might be less effective . &quot;
&quot; if these medicines are applied together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ val surveillance is to be made , as an accurate forecast of the effect of the combination of am@@ bl@@ en@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult . &quot;
the simultaneous gift of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to a rise in Plas@@ mak@@ et centr@@ ation ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 193 % and thus a rise in the associated side effects associated with ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin .
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons , ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin is required along with A@@ gener@@ ase , becomes a reduction of dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin on at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data is available . &quot;
Pharmac@@ oc@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ generative in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin have not been carried out but could be the plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ ble of both drugs in the case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ ol with 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol in the plas@@ ma at 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 1 ) has been observed twice a day without simultaneous application of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ or or in@@ duc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can be applied together with A@@ gener@@ ase , possibly lead to interactions . &quot;
&quot; patients should therefore be applied to toxic reactions associated with these medicines , if they are used in combination with an@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; based on the data of other prot@@ eas@@ ants , it is advisable that Ant@@ azi@@ da is not taken at the same time as aspir@@ ation as it can come to res@@ or@@ ting disorders . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application of anti@@ conv@@ ul@@ si@@ va , which are known as an enzy@@ me ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degrad@@ ation of the plastic tail of Am@@ bl@@ en@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; the Ser@@ um concentr@@ ations of Cal@@ ci@@ um@@ can@@ al@@ blocks such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , Fel@@ odi@@ pin , ni@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can increase 10 by Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r , thus increasing the activity and tox@@ icity of this medicine . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous intake with A@@ generative can increase its plas@@ tic@@ on@@ centr@@ ations , and with PD@@ E@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in conjunction with hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual dys@@ functions and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , in Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily together with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days declined by about 86 % ( 90 % - con@@ fi@@ den@@ z@@ interv@@ all 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; consequently , the simultaneous gift of A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended , unless the possible benefits of treatment the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ ne@@ tics of the effects ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; at H@@ MG Co@@ A reduction inhibit@@ or , such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ vast@@ atin , whose contrac@@ tion is strongly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are distinctive enh@@ ancements of the plas@@ mas@@ onry at simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; since plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ egel@@ increases this H@@ MG Co@@ A reduction inhibit@@ ors to My@@ opathy , including a R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined application of this medicine with am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended to be a common monitoring of therapeutic concentr@@ ations to stabil@@ isation of the mirror , as the plas@@ tic@@ on@@ centr@@ ations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased by Am@@ bl@@ en@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , A@@ gener@@ als may not be applied together with oral Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) , while at the same application of A@@ generative Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am caution is advisable . &quot;
data for the simultaneous application of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ eas@@ ers indicate a possible rise in the plastic seal of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am to 3 to 4 @-@ fold .
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ on is administ@@ ered together with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored at op@@ i@@ at@@ ent@@ ment symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of k@@ avi@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; because of the per@@ sever@@ ance of historical compar@@ isons , there are no recommendation to be given as the am@@ bl@@ en@@ avi@@ r@@ - dose than is administ@@ ered when Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r is administ@@ ered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ on . &quot;
&quot; in simultaneous gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gener@@ ase , an increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ ised rati@@ o ) is recommended because of the possibility of a weak@@ ening or rein@@ forcement of the anti @-@ oxid@@ ant effect ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tiv@@ a is not pre@@ f@@ able , hence alternative methods for receptions is recommended . &quot;
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants ( for example D@@ esi@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended in simultaneous gift of A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; this medicine must be applied only after pregnancy , for the mother in comparison to possible risks to the possible risks for fet@@ us . &quot;

the imm@@ ort@@ ality of A@@ gener@@ are was examined in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; most of the adverse effects associated with the A@@ generative treatment side effects were slightly damaged , and they rarely occurred to treatment . &quot;
&quot; in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are related to the intake of an@@ am@@ ase or another simultaneously to HIV treatment applied medicines , or whether they are a result of the under@@ under@@ ne@@ al disease . &quot;
&quot; most of the above @-@ mentioned side effects come from two clinical studies ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which with prot@@ eas@@ ers do not pre @-@ treated patients 1200 mg A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily . &quot;

&quot; the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns can be subject to changes due to additional data , and it is recommended , always the current inter@@ pret@@ ations systems for analysis of the results of resistance testing . &quot;

&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ eas@@ iness @-@ resistant insulation ; the preservation of this activity seems to be dependent upon the number and the type of resistance mut@@ ations in the insul@@ ator . &quot;
the early departure of a acci@@ dental therapy is recommended to hold the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in boundaries which can impact on the following treatment .
&quot; the cover of the effectiveness of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , an random@@ ized open study ( 600 mg twice daily ) and nuclear therapy ( standard of care , So@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with lowest k@@ ew@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; one hundred and sixty @-@ six ( n = 163 ) patients with a proven virus @-@ sensitivity to A@@ generative , at least another PI and at least one NR@@ TI were included into the participation of the A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
the primary analysis presented the non @-@ sub @-@ legal analysis of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the So@@ C @-@ PI group in the Plas@@ ma last ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the plas@@ ma after 16 weeks in the plas@@ ma threshold of 0.@@ 4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
&quot; the cover of the efficacy of un@@ geb@@ oo@@ st@@ ained A@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controll@@ able studies with a total of 288 HIV infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 with PI were treated . &quot;
&quot; in the studies , A@@ generative solution to take up and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , whereas the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; there was no low do@@ si@@ fied k@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of the patients treated with PI previously had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the NR@@ TI@@ s , together with A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; after 48 weeks , about 25 % of the included patients included a Plas@@ ma HIV / 1 RNA and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ al increase in CD@@ 4 cell number of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the output . &quot;
19 Basi@@ lic@@ ating on this data should be considered at the treatment optim@@ isation at with PI to be expected benefits of &quot; Un@@ geb@@ oo@@ st@@ oned &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; after oral administration , the average duration ( t@@ max ) up to the maximum ser@@ um concentration of am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
5@@ 08 % increased for C@@ max against 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) is administ@@ ered together with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) administ@@ ered .
the administration of am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r with a meal led to a 25 % reduction of the AU@@ C but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r 12 hours following dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
&quot; therefore the minimum concentration of concentration in the ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ influenced by the food intake , although the simultaneous food intake reduces the scale and rate of the res@@ or@@ ption . &quot;
the seem@@ ing volume volume is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be applied to a large distribution volume as well as an enormous penetration of am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
&quot; this change leads to a withdrawal of the overall concentration of the substance in the plas@@ ma , whereby the amount of un@@ bound@@ less am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active part , probably remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of in@@ cum@@ bent Am@@ bl@@ en@@ avi@@ r remains unchanged , the percentage of free active component in dependence on the overall drug intervals in the Ste@@ ady @-@ State on the area of C@@ max , ss up to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , drugs , the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bits or a sub@@ str@@ ate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , to be administ@@ ered with caution when they are given at the same time with a@@ gener@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the gift of A@@ generative capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r exposure , as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r is out of the solution 14 % less bi@@ over@@ , than out of the capsules ; therefore , a generic solution and as@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ change@@ able on a milli@@ gram basis . &quot;
&quot; even the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible , therefore the effect of a kidney is likely to be low on the Eli@@ mination of Am@@ bl@@ en@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
these treatment schem@@ ata lead to am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r @-@ plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ eg@@ els comparable to those who are obtained in healthy promot@@ ers after a dose of 1200 mg Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r twice daily without simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; long @-@ term studies for c@@ il@@ ogen@@ eit@@ y with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats appeared in male animals ben@@ ig@@ ne hep@@ at@@ cellular aden@@ oms at d@@ osing weight ( mice ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily gift of 1200 mg Am@@ bl@@ en@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of the hep@@ at@@ cell cellular aden@@ oms and car@@ cin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these watched effects for man is unclear .
&quot; from the present exposure data on the human , both from clinical studies as well as from the therapeutic application , however , there is little evidence of the adoption of a clinical relevance of these findings . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and In @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity testing , the bacterial test @-@ test tests ( Am@@ es test test ) , micro@@ kern@@ test of rats and chromos@@ omes , was included in human periph@@ eral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , was am@@ bl@@ en@@ avi@@ r neither mut@@ ants nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
this liver tox@@ icity can be monitored in the clinical life by measurement of AST , AL@@ T and the activity of al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies , no significant liver tox@@ icity has been observed in clinical studies , neither during the administration of A@@ generative or after the end of the treatment . &quot;
&quot; studies on tox@@ icity in juven@@ iles , which were treated at the age of 4 days , both shown at the control and with am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r animals as well as in the animals as well as with am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r animals . &quot;
&quot; in a system@@ ic plas@@ ma view , the significant exposure under ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) as the expected exposure of therapeutic doses , however , were observed a number of low @-@ level changes including Th@@ y@@ mus@@ el@@ ong@@ ation and low @-@ subject skel@@ eton , which is to indicate a consuming development . &quot;
&quot; 24 If A@@ generic capsules are applied without the ampli@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sting ) , higher doses must be applied to an@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the simultaneous application is to be carried out in patients with sh@@ aking or lighter liver interference with caution , in patients with severe liver function , it is consistent ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 26 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , like car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ular Rati@@ o ) , are available methods for determining the substance identification . &quot;
&quot; A@@ generative should be set on duration 27 when a rash is accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms , or the Schlei@@ cher is involved ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; higher risk for a Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug addi@@ cts factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ viral treatment and associated metabo@@ lic disorders . &quot;
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r causes that lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and lead to a resistance development .
5@@ 08 % increased for C@@ max against 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) administ@@ ered .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r in the plas@@ ma that were obtained by the combination of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with calcium ( 400 mg Lop@@ on@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day .
&quot; a d@@ osing recommendations for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r and Cal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , there is a close @-@ sized surveillance , since the effectiveness and un@@ think@@ ability of this combination is unknown . &quot;
&quot; the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz in combination with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended , since the exposure of both prot@@ eas@@ ants would be low . &quot;
&quot; if these medicines are applied together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ val surveillance is to be made , as an accurate forecast of the effect of the combination of am@@ bl@@ en@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult . &quot;
&quot; if there is needed for clinical reasons , Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin is required to ad@@ minister the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin on at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although no clinical data is available . &quot;
&quot; the Ser@@ um concentr@@ ations of Cal@@ ci@@ um@@ can@@ al@@ blocks such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , Fel@@ odi@@ pin , ni@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r , thus increasing the activity and tox@@ icity of this medicine . &quot;

the underlying mechanism for the emergence of the hep@@ at@@ rop@@ ul@@ ary aden@@ oms and Kar@@ zin@@ ome has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these watched effects for humans is unclear .
&quot; from the present exposure data on man , both from clinical studies as well as from the therapeutic application , however , there is little evidence of the adoption of a clinical relevance of these findings . &quot;

the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r as a solution to take up is 14 % lower than by am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution are not inter@@ change@@ able on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be as soon as they are able to sw@@ allow the capsules , with the intake of the solution to the one stop ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ generative solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .

&quot; with an application of I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od cream in higher than recommended doses , there is a higher risk for severe local arms cuts ( see Section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , there were severe local hood cuts that made a treatment required and / or into a temporary physical impair@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; in cases where such reactions occurred at the outcome of the ure@@ th@@ ra , some women had trouble passing urine , which made a emergency cath@@ et@@ isation and treatment of the affected area . &quot;

local door@@ actions are frequent but the intensity of these reactions are generally taken during therapy or reactions form after the end of the treatment with I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od cream .
&quot; if it is necessary due to the discomfort of the patient or due to sever@@ ity of local skin interactions , a treatment can be done by several days . &quot;
the clinical result of therapy can be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
&quot; currently , no data on long @-@ term healing rates of over 36 months are available after treatment , should consider other suitable therapies . &quot;

there are only very limited data on the application of I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od for the treatment of tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ants at anatom@@ ical places outside of the face and the sc@@ alp .
&quot; the available data on the ak@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose of the under@@ poor and hands will not support the effectiveness in this case , therefore such an application is not recommended . &quot;
local door@@ step frequently occur but these reactions usually take back in the course of the treatment of intensity or after lowering the therapy with I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od Cre@@ me .
&quot; if the local door@@ step will cause large discomfort or are very strong , the treatment can be exposed to several days . &quot;
&quot; from the data of an open clinical trial , patients with more than 8 AK@@ s are less complete healing rate than patients with less than 8 l@@ esi@@ ons . &quot;

&quot; according to test timetable , the evaluation of clinical signs indicates that in these studies with five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od creams are very frequently related to severe ery@@ topics ( 31 % ) , heavy ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and too heavy sc@@ at@@ roph@@ age and sales ( 19 % ) . &quot;
&quot; for clinical studies on the application of I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od , Alo@@ pe@@ zie was established with an incidence of 0.6 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment point or in the surrounding area . &quot;
&quot; the sent @-@ time recording of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od , which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags , could lead to nau@@ sea , v@@ ache , head@@ ache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever . &quot;
&quot; the clin@@ ically most serious side @-@ effect , which emerged after several or@@ als cans of &gt; 200 mg , consisted in mort@@ gage , which was norm@@ alized for oral or intraven@@ ous fluid . &quot;
in a pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic investigation were detected after the top@@ ical application of I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od growing system@@ ic concentr@@ ations of the alp@@ ha@@ inter@@ fer@@ ons and other cy@@ to@@ k@@ ine .
&quot; in 3 am@@ ass@@ es@@ relevant phase 3 efficacy studies could be shown that the effectiveness in regards to a complete payout percentage of the F@@ eig@@ war@@ ts are significantly superior to 16 weeks of a plac@@ ebo treatment . &quot;
&quot; at 60 % of the total 119 with I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od therap@@ ists healed the fet@@ al war@@ ts , this was at 20 % of 105 with plac@@ ebo patients ( 95 % CI ) : &quot;
a complete cooling was able to be obtained by 23 % of 157 with I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od treated male patients compared to 5 % of 161 with plac@@ ebo male patients ( 95 % CI ) :
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od at five mal@@ iger application per week over 6 weeks was examined in two double blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies . &quot;
the audi@@ ences were hist@@ ological confirmed single primary super@@ fic@@ ational bas@@ al cell with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
&quot; the data from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years of present data show that approximately 7@@ 9.3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically cured and this also had 48 months long . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od during three weekly application in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treat@@ able time period , was examined in two double blind , plac@@ ebo@@ controlled clinical studies . &quot;
&quot; patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , not hyper@@ trop@@ ic , not hyper@@ trop@@ ic AK@@ - l@@ esi@@ ons within one @-@ related 25 c@@ m2 large treatment are@@ as on the un@@ clean sc@@ alp or in the face . &quot;
the one @-@ year dates from two combined monitoring studies show patients with clin@@ ician res@@ ili@@ ation after one or two treatment periods of a recur@@ ren@@ al rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) .
&quot; the approved indications of external F@@ eig@@ war@@ ts , Ak@@ tin@@ ic Ker@@ at@@ ose and Super@@ vis@@ ually Bas@@ al cell @-@ car@@ cin@@ oma occur in pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients generally not and were therefore not investigated . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dara Cre@@ me was investigated in four random@@ ised , double @-@ controlled plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies at children aged 2 to 15 years with M@@ oll@@ us@@ c@@ um containers ( I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , plac@@ ebo n = 313 ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od could not be shown in these studies at the there ( 3x / week for a period of &lt; 16 weeks b@@ z@@ w .
a minimal system@@ ic shot of 5 % ular I@@ mi@@ l @-@ cream by the skin of 58 patients with acute ker@@ at@@ ose was observed during the three weekly application during 16 weeks .

the calculated @-@ obvious half @-@ time period was around 10@@ times higher than the 2@@ hour &apos;s half @-@ time after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in a previous study ; this indicates a prolonged retreat of the medication by means in the skin .
the data on system@@ ic Ex@@ pos@@ ure showed that the res@@ or@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od after top@@ ical application on MC @-@ disease skin of patients aged 6 - 12 years was low and comparable to with healthy adults and adults with acute ker@@ at@@ ose or super@@ fic@@ i@@ tic cell car@@ cin@@ oma .
in a four months study on the painting of tox@@ icity in the rat @-@ table cans of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG to significantly lower body weight and increased Mil@@ z @-@ weight ; a four months long run study on the painting application revealed in the mouse no similar effects .
a two @-@ year study on the car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ icity in mice at der@@ m@@ aler administration in three days per week in@@ duced does not in@@ duced tum@@ ors in the application .
&quot; the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od has only one minor system@@ ic absorption of the human skin and not mut@@ iny , is a risk to see people due to the system@@ ic exposure as very small . &quot;
&quot; the tum@@ ors entered the group of mice , treated with the acting @-@ free creams , formerly and in larger numbers on as in the control group with low U@@ VR . &quot;

&quot; in the study , primarily the security of the drug was examined , but it was also measured by its effectiveness in relation to reducing the G@@ AG concentr@@ ations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver . &quot;
&quot; in children under the age of five years Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , the G@@ AG conc@@ es@@ ations in the urine are about 60 % , and half of the treated children started at the end of the study a normal big liver . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me are observed in patients aged over five years ( observed with more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , p@@ ud@@ inal pain , pain , pain , pain , pain , fever and reactions to the inf@@ usion center . &quot;
&quot; very common side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure , decreased oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measuring size of pul@@ mon@@ ary function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ die ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and sho@@ ok . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may be used in patients who may potentially be strongly over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) on Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hysi@@ cal reaction ) , not applied . &quot;
&quot; the European Pharmac@@ eutical Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will be able to review all new information , which may be announced , and update this summary . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , patients , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me are preserved to observe the reaction to the inf@@ usion and development of antibodies . &quot;
June 2003 the European Commission shared by the Company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe BV . permit approval for the transport of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in the whole of the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA @-@ technology under the use of Ch@@ o @-@ mam@@ mal @-@ cell culture ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ vary , E@@ ier@@ stock of the Chinese Ham@@ ster ) . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used to treat patients with secure diagnosis of a Mu@@ kop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ ot I ( M@@ PS I , α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neurological manifestations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treatment should be carried out by a doctor , experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabo@@ lic disease . &quot;
&quot; the initial inf@@ usion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient is toler@@ ated , every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h . &quot;
the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been established and for these patients may not be recommended to d@@ osing scheme .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me are in@@ suff@@ iciency in patients with kidney or liver in@@ suff@@ iciency was not recommended .
&quot; with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , patients may develop inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions , which is defined as any related to @-@ effect that occurs during inf@@ usion or until the end of the inf@@ usion lines ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be monitored with ma@@ id@@ y and the inf@@ usion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be made available in a reasonable clinical environment in the re@@ warding facilities for medical emergen@@ cies . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical phase @-@ 3 study , almost all patients are ignor@@ ant antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from treatment of treatment . &quot;
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of a inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; since little experience with regard to the resum@@ ption of treatment after a longer break , has to be cau@@ tious due to the theoretical risk of hyper@@ sensitivity to a break of treatment . &quot;
60 minutes before the start of inf@@ usion with medications ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ tika ) to minimize the potential appearance of infectious reactions .
&quot; in case of a slight or moderate @-@ related reaction , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and acet@@ amin@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be wo@@ unded and / or a reduction of inf@@ usion rate to half of the inf@@ usion rate , in which the reaction occurred . &quot;
&quot; in case of a single , heavy infectious reaction must be stopped , until the symptoms are brought to decrease , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amine and acet@@ amin@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is too sublime . &quot;
inf@@ usion can be performed with a reduction of inf@@ usion rate on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of inf@@ usion rate in which the reaction occurred again .
&quot; 3 ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and acet@@ amin@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ) , as well as a reduction of inf@@ usion rate on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the inf@@ usion rate , during which the predicted response occurred . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be applied simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain , because a potential risk of interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular recording of Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; animal experimental studies do not leave on direct or indirect impact on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no data on new@@ bor@@ ns which were exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase over the mother &apos;s milk , is recommended , during the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me do not have to breast@@ feeding . &quot;
the effects in clinical trials were reported mainly as inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions conducted at 53 % of patients in Phase 3 study ( treatment times up to 4 years ) and at 35 % of patients in the study conducted with participants under 5 years ( treatment times up to 1 year ) .
unwanted drug transactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me who were observed during the Phase 3 study and its extension in a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older during a treatment period of up to 4 years ( &gt; &gt; 1 / 10 ) ; common ( &gt; 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related participation of the upper respir@@ atory tract and lungs in the history of history , in addition , severe responses to , including bronze , respir@@ atory and facial skin ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children of impro@@ per medication related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , who were reported during a ph@@ as@@ - 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years , with mainly severe verification and treatment of treatment up to 12 months , are listed in the table . &quot;
&quot; intraven@@ ous 100 E / kg of intraven@@ ously weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg of intraven@@ ously weekly , 200 E / kg and intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg . &quot;
&quot; in most patients , it came from 3 months after the start of treatment at a Ser@@ o@@ con@@ version , with a severe susp@@ end form usually came within one month to a serv@@ o @-@ version ( average after 26 days of patients aged 5 years and older ) . &quot;
&quot; until the end of the Phase 3 study ( or up to a premature retirement from the study ) , 13 / 45 patients were not found by radio@@ immun@@ opath@@ ologic antibodies , including 3 patients where there has never been at Ser@@ o@@ con@@ version . &quot;
patients with error up to low antibodies form a robust decrease of the G@@ AG mirror in the Har@@ n while in case of patients with high antibodies form a variable reduction in G@@ AG in Har@@ n .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in the Phase 2 study ) showed a margin@@ ally to low neutr@@ alised inhibit@@ or effect on the enz@@ ym@@ atic Lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ e- activity in vit@@ ro who seemed to not imp@@ ly the clinical effectiveness and / or reducing G@@ AG in Har@@ n .
&quot; the presence of antibodies seem not to be associated with the incidence of unwanted medicines , even if the occurrence of unwanted medicines typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies . &quot;
the reason@@ ing for the enzy@@ mes therapy is in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the ak@@ cum@@ ulated sub@@ str@@ ate and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient recovery of the enzy@@ mes .
&quot; after intraven@@ ous Inf@@ usion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly taken from the circulation and of cells into the Ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely about Mann@@ ose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in an random@@ ised , double blind , plac@@ ebo@@ controlled phase @-@ 3 study at 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years . &quot;
&quot; although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , the majority of patients were reported from the middle phen@@ otype and only a patient pointed the severe phen@@ otype . &quot;
patients have been recru@@ ited when they had a for@@ ci@@ zed exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the FE@@ V and the absolute walking distance in the 6 @-@ minute test .
all patients were subsequently rec@@ alled for an open @-@ label extension study where they received another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) each week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
after 26 weeks of therapy the patients were treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me patients compared to the plac@@ ebo group an improvement in the pul@@ mon@@ ary function and sal@@ ut@@ ability that is shown in the following table .
&quot; in the open classification , an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects showed up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and of 182 weeks in the plac@@ ebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as follows from the following table . &quot;
the acceptance of the expected percentage of FE@@ V is not significant on this period clin@@ ically not significant and the absolute lung @-@ vol@@ um@@ ina increased further proportional to the height of growing children .
&quot; of the 26 patients with a hep@@ atic balance before treatment reached 22 ( 85 % ) until the end of the study , a normal liver size . &quot;
within the first 4 weeks a clear waste of the G@@ AG @-@ mirror in the Har@@ n ( µ@@ g / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) was established until the study was constant .
&quot; with regard to the heter@@ ogen@@ ic path@@ ogen@@ s between patients , which has been taken into account by using a combined end point ( expected percentage range ) for five active ingredients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deterioration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) and a deterioration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot;
it was conducted a year @-@ year open phase @-@ 2 study conducted in which mainly security and pharmaceutical ine@@ tics were examined at 20 patients who were at the time of their recording in the study under 5 years ( 16 patients with the severe verification form and 4 with the middle variation ) .
at four patients the dosage was increased because of increased G@@ AG@@ - mirror in Har@@ n in week 22 in the last 26 weeks on 200 E / kg .
&quot; for several patients , a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) was determined according to the Z @-@ Score for these age group ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and every 4 patients with the middle variation @-@ form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with severe verification form only limited or no progress in cognitive development . &quot;
in a phase @-@ 4 study investigations have been carried out investigations into pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of different Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me @-@ dos@@ ata on the G@@ AG @-@ Spiegel in Har@@ n , the Leb@@ er@@ volume and the 6 @-@ minute deposit . &quot;
&quot; intraven@@ ous 100 E / kg of intraven@@ ously weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg of intraven@@ ously weekly , 200 E / kg and intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg . &quot;
&quot; the d@@ osing scheme with 200 E / kg can be intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks in patients , the difficulties with weekly inf@@ usions , however , is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two d@@ osing schem@@ ata is equal . &quot;
&quot; the European Medi@@ c@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate all new information , which will be available annually , and if necessary , will be updated the summary of the characteristics of the drug . &quot;
pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients aged under 5 years was similar to the patient with older and less strongly affected patients .
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety sp@@ harm@@ ac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in recur@@ ring gifts , tox@@ icity in repeti@@ tive gifts and Re@@ production sto@@ y@@ er@@ ism , the pre@@ clinical data cannot be recognized for humans . &quot;

&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is treated with patients who have previously been treated yet , in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously used other chem@@ otherap@@ ists previously used as usual therapy . &quot;
to reduce side effects should patients be taken during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta an Corti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fol@@ ate ( a vitamin ) and inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
&quot; if A@@ lim@@ ta is administ@@ ered together with cis@@ pl@@ atin , should be given an &quot; anti @-@ em@@ e@@ tik@@ um &quot; ( drug against breaking ) and liqui@@ ds ( for a liquid lack of defect ) . &quot;
&quot; in case of patients whose blood @-@ screen changes or when certain other side effects should occur , the treatment should be raised up or the dose should be reduced . &quot;
the active form of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed slo@@ ws the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells share .
the transformation of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed in its active form is easier to match as in healthy cells that leads to higher concentr@@ ations of the active form of drugs by means of longer active ingredients in cancer cells .
&quot; for the treatment of mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ oms , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a main study of 456 patients who had previously had no chemotherapy against their illness . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of non @-@ national lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta were compared to 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease that had previously been treated with chemotherapy , with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( a different drug against cancer ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta was compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ in ( a further drugs against cancer ) , and both in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin in a study on 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously had no chemotherapy for lung cancer . &quot;

&quot; patients who had previously received an chemotherapy was the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta 8,@@ 3 months , compared to 7.@@ 9 months at doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , however , in which cancer does not attack the turn@@ outs of epith@@ el@@ ial cells , in the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta longer survival periods than with the compar@@ ative medicine . &quot;
September 2004 the European Commission shared the company El@@ i Lil@@ ly Ne@@ derland B.@@ V. a permit for the transport of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union .
any flow @-@ bottle must be activated with 4.7 ml 0.@@ 9 % of the Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ chl@@ ori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) - what a solution of 25 mg / ml yield .

the al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ ates ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ at @-@ Tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Al@@ an@@ in @-@ Tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be &lt; 3 @-@ fold of the upper border value . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dosage amount must take place under the rec@@ kl@@ ess of the blood picture or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity of the preceding therap@@ ist therapy . &quot;
&quot; after recovery , patients need to be treated according to the references made in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are applicable for AL@@ IM@@ TA as a mon@@ otherapy or in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common tox@@ icity C@@ rit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) &gt; C@@ TC degrees 2 blood .
&quot; should patients not de@@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity &gt; Grad 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity ) , the therapy has to be interrupted by AL@@ IM@@ TA until the patient has the value before treatment
&quot; the treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA has to be abandoned , if in case of patients after 2 dos@@ is@@ tive tox@@ icity , or not @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity degrees 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - fort the appearance of degrees 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity . &quot;
clinical trials did not notice that in patients aged 65 year@@ - or in comparison to patients aged 65 years or when compared to patients aged 65 years .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to non @-@ irrit@@ ability and effectiveness .
clinical trials were necessary in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance of &gt; 45 ml / min no dos@@ is@@ customiz@@ ations needed for all patients recommended dosage adjustment .
data base in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; however , patients with a liver function of the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - limit value and / or tran@@ sam@@ pl@@ ine values of &gt; the 3,@@ 0 @-@ times of the upper boundary ( in case of liver det@@ ector ) , or 5,@@ 0 @-@ times of the upper border ( in presence of liver metastatic asen ) is not specifically examined in studies . &quot;
&quot; patients need to be monitored with regard to the bone market , and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should not be administ@@ ered to patients before their absolute Ne@@ ut@@ roph@@ y has once again reached a value of &gt; 100,000 cells / mm ³ . &quot;
a dosage reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adir of the absolute Ne@@ ut@@ roph@@ il@@ inal number , thy@@ ro@@ ism and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity , as they were observed in the previous treatment cycles - ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
a lower tox@@ icity and a reduction of degrees 3 / 4 ugly tox@@ icity such as Ne@@ ut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le Ne@@ ut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie and infection with degree 3 / 4 Ne@@ ut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie has taken care when a pre @-@ line treatment with fol@@ ate and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place . &quot;
&quot; therefore , all patients must be reli@@ ant on patients with pesti@@ et@@ re@@ xed patients , fol@@ ate and vitamin B@@ 12 as a prophy@@ lac@@ tic measure to reduce treatment @-@ related tox@@ icity ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients with mild to medium kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) have to avoid the simultaneous non @-@ stero@@ idal anti @-@ inflammatory drugs ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) for at least 2 days prior to therapy , the day of therapy and min@@ de@@ - TEN@@ S 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;

&quot; many patients where these events occurred , corresponding risk factors for the appearance of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hyper@@ tension or Diabetes . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in case of patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid hydr@@ ation - accumulation in the trans@@ cellular room is a dra@@ inage of the result in front of the p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment . &quot;
&quot; 5 serious cardiovascular events , including M@@ yo@@ car@@ din@@ ers , and cru@@ el@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events were reported in clinical studies with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed occasionally , if this substance is usually administ@@ ered in combination with any other cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ dees of life ( except yellow @-@ fever , this vacc@@ ination is non @-@ trained ) not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; as the possibility of a irre@@ ver@@ sible sk@@ is@@ ance of the reproductive @-@ capacity is made by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised before treatment - need to take advice regarding sperm results . &quot;
in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &gt; 80 ml / min ) can result high doses non @-@ stero@@ idal anti @-@ acid acid in high dosage ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) to a decreased pair of effects of side effects .
&quot; therefore , caution is advisable when in patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &gt; 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or Ac@@ e- t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ acid in high doses . &quot;

&quot; there is no data in regard to the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with a long half @-@ time such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or Ro@@ f@@ ec@@ ox@@ ib , the simultaneous application must be avoided with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed for at least 5 days prior to therapy , in the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - . &quot;
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the inner status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires a increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ised rati@@ o ) when the decision was taken to treat the patient with oral anti@@ qu@@ ants .
&quot; there are no data for the use of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed near pregnant , but as with an@@ de@@ - an@@ timet@@ abo@@ ites are expected in an application in the pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should not be applied during pregnancy , except if unconditional and after careful cancellation of the utility for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; as the possibility of a irre@@ ver@@ sible sk@@ ating of the reproductive capacity is made by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised before the treatment of the hospital , advice regarding the sperm count . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed passes through the mother &apos;s milk , and unwanted effects at the embro@@ i@@ dered inf@@ estation cannot be ruled out . &quot;

the side @-@ effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gast@@ ro@@ x@@ in@@ aler nature and hang along with pharmac@@ ological effects of the medication by means that the absorption of depri@@ ved fat is prevented .
the gast@@ ro@@ pod unwanted side effects were obtained from clinical studies with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally easy and temporarily .

&quot; two double blind , random@@ ized , plac@@ ebo@@ controlled studies in adults with a BM@@ I &gt; 28 kg / m2 will take the effectiveness of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times daily in combination with a hypo@@ critical , fet@@ al nutrition . &quot;
&quot; the primary parameters , the change of body weight compared to the output value ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ isation ) , was evaluated as follows : as a change in the body weight ( table 1 ) and as part of the study contractor , which have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their output weight ( table 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although in both studies the weight reduction of 12 months has been observed , the greatest weight loss appeared in the first 6 months . &quot;
the average change in total cholester@@ in was with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 2.9 % ( output worth 5.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with plac@@ ebo + 2.8 % ( output value 5,@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .

&quot; Alo@@ xi is used in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , which are strong trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( such as cis@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the excessive trigger of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( such as Cycl@@ oph@@ osph@@ ere , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi is able to be used by the additional gifts of a Corti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ( a drug that can be used as an anti @-@ stero@@ ids ) .
the application in patients under the age of 18 is not recommended because the effects in this age group will not lie enough information .
&quot; this means that the active ingredient of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ otonin ) , prevented the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ xi has been studied in three main studies at 1 8@@ 42 adults , the chem@@ otherap@@ ists received , which are strong or moderate trig@@ gers for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the strong trigger of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting are 59 % of patients who were treated with alo@@ xi in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 of 223 ) , compared to 57 % of the patients with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron patients ( 126 of 221 ) . &quot;
&quot; while chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the excessive trigger of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting are 81 % of patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 of 189 ) , opposite 69 % of the patients with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron patients ( 127 of 185 ) . &quot;
when compared with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values are 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
March 2005 divided the European Commission of Helsinki Bi@@ rex Pharmac@@ euticals Ltd . a licence for the transport of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union .
Alo@@ xi is inde@@ xed : to prevention of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting at strong em@@ et@@ ogen@@ ic chemotherapy because of a cancer disease and to the prevention of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting at moder@@ em@@ et@@ ogen@@ ic chemotherapy because of cancer .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi on the prevention of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting that is in@@ duced by a strongly em@@ et@@ ogen@@ ic chemotherapy may be reinforced by adding any of the cor@@ co@@ stero@@ ids .
&quot; since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the col@@ dar@@ mp@@ ass@@ age , patients should be monitored with an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ scher Ob@@ lig@@ p@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ sist@@ ence I@@ le@@ us after inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; however , with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is advisable to long with simultaneous gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with pharmac@@ euticals , which is prolonged Q@@ T @-@ Inter@@ v@@ all or in patients where Q@@ t- Interactive is extended or the one of such an extension . &quot;
&quot; except in connection with a further chem@@ otherap@@ eu@@ tics gift , Alo@@ xi is supposed to be used in the days after chemotherapy or for the treatment of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies inhi@@ bit Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron inhi@@ bit the tum@@ ours activity of the five species studied chem@@ otherap@@ eu@@ tics ( Cis@@ pl@@ atin , Cy@@ tar@@ ab@@ ide , Cy@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ omy@@ cin C ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , there were no significant pharmac@@ euticals between a unique intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a ste@@ ady @-@ stat@@ e- concentration or@@ atory met@@ o@@ cl@@ op@@ r@@ ami@@ ds , an CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; in one of a population @-@ based pharmac@@ ological analysis was shown that the simultaneous gift of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ du@@ st@@ ine , Co@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , Flu@@ id@@ ine , R@@ ani@@ ti@@ dine , Ac@@ cor@@ avi@@ r , ser@@ tr@@ alin and Ter@@ bin@@ oc@@ in ) had no significant impact on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; experience for the application of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ an@@ cies are not before , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be applied , unless it is considered by the treated doctor as necessary . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials were the most common in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams to ob@@ serving side effects ( total 633 patients ) , which were at least possibly with Alo@@ xi in the context of head@@ ache ( 9 % ) and Ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of over@@ sensitivity and reactions to the administration ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were indicated in post @-@ marketing experience . &quot;
in the group with the highest dosage showed similar frequencies of unwanted events such as in the other met@@ ering groups ; there were no dose of an active ingredient relationship .
&quot; there were no di@@ aly@@ sis studies , due to the great distribution volume , however , is a di@@ aly@@ sis probably not effective therapy during a Alo@@ xi@@ dis@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; in two random@@ ized double @-@ ind@@ ly studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients were compared with &lt; 50 mg / m2 Cis@@ pl@@ atin , car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin , and 250 mg / m2 Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 ( half @-@ time 7.@@ 3 hours ) that was given by day 1 without dex@@ ame@@ th@@ ron@@ eous . &quot;
&quot; in a random@@ ised bi @-@ ind@@ ly study , the 667 patients were compared with &gt; 60 mg / m2@@ Cis@@ pl@@ atin , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 Cycl@@ oph@@ osph@@ ere and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ b@@ azin and 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron received , which were given in day 1 and intraven@@ ously . &quot;
the results of the studies with moder@@ em@@ et@@ ogen@@ s chemotherapy and the study with strong em@@ et@@ ogen@@ s chemotherapy are sum@@ mar@@ ised in the following tables .
in clinical trials in the indication of chemotherapy reg@@ in@@ vigor@@ ous and v@@ om@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) were the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and E@@ KG parameters including the Q@@ T@@ c @-@ Inter@@ v@@ alls with the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron comparable . &quot;
&quot; according to the findings pre @-@ clinical investigations , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron possesses the ability to block the processes involved in v@@ entri@@ cular De@@ - and Rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation involved and extend the duration of the action potential . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the study conducted by 221 healthy Pro@@ b@@ anden study was the assessment of the E@@ KG effects of i.@@ v. administ@@ ered Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single d@@ osen of 0,25 , 0.75 and 23 mg . &quot;
res@@ or@@ ption After intraven@@ ous cancellation of the Plas@@ mak@@ et centr@@ ations follows a slow elimination of the body with an average season half @-@ time of about 40 hours .
the average maximum Plas@@ mak@@ et centr@@ ation ( C@@ max ) and the surface area under the concentration of time @-@ curve ( AU@@ C0@@ - ∞ ) in general in the entire Dos@@ is@@ area of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients dos@@ is@@ proportional .
&quot; after intraven@@ ous gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 cans , between day 1 and day 5 common medium ( ± SD ) increase in the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron @-@ Plas@@ mak@@ es@@ zentr@@ ation at 42 ± 34 % . &quot;
&quot; resulting from pharmac@@ euticals between 0,25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron reached on 3 consecutive days , total exposure ( AU@@ C0@@ - ) was comparable with the same @-@ recur@@ sive administration of 0,75 mg . however , the C@@ max after the entry of 0.75 mg was higher . &quot;
&quot; about 40 % are eliminated by the kid@@ neys , and some more 50 % are converted into two primary Met@@ abol@@ ites , which have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on 5@@ HT@@ 3 recept@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in @-@ vit@@ ro trials for the Met@@ abol@@ isation have shown that CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in lower dimensions , I@@ so@@ k@@ ets CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; Eli@@ mination After a intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ gram / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron have been found about 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as an un@@ changing active ingredient , made about 40 % of the given dose . &quot;
&quot; after a unique intraven@@ ous bol@@ dness in healthy fraud , the overall body of 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; although patients with severe hep@@ atic dis@@ rup@@ ting the termin@@ ale Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ alb@@ tzeit , and the average system@@ ic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron increases , however , a reduction of the dose is not justified . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials were observed only after ex@@ positions which have been considered adequate over the maximum human therapeutic exposure , which indicates a low relevance for clinical use . &quot;
10 out of pre@@ clinical trials are evidence that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only be block in very high concentr@@ ations of ion channels that are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular De@@ - and Rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation .
&quot; high doses Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose ) was given in approximately the 30@@ o the therapeutic exposure for people who were given every day more than two years , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ oplast@@ y ( in thy@@ ro@@ id , pit@@ uit@@ ary , P@@ ank@@ re@@ as , epi@@ ni@@ anc@@ mark ) and skin tum@@ ors with rats , but not with mice . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not complete , but due to the high doses of d@@ osing and since Alo@@ xi is determined for a single application , the relevance of these results are regarded as for human beings . &quot;

June 2006 the Committee on Human@@ arz@@ t@@ ants ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative value in which the authorisation of approval for the transport of hepatitis C is recommended for the treatment of hepatitis C for the treatment of hepatitis C with al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution .
&quot; this means that al@@ ph@@ eon of a biological medicine called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same arz@@ t@@ onal effective component should resem@@ bles that is already approved in the EU ( also &quot; &quot; Reference phar@@ ma &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ term hepatitis C ) hepatitis C ( one by an viral infection ) .

it is produced by a yeast into which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced to the formation of the substance .
&quot; the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon presented data to compare the comparison of al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( drug structure , composition and purity of the medication by means of efficacy , safety and effectiveness in hepatitis C ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study of patients with hepatitis C , the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ eon was compared to the effectiveness of the reference rate of 455 patients . &quot;
&quot; the study was measured , as many patients after 12 of 48 treatment weeks as well as 6 months after setting treatment on the drug , ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) . &quot;

&quot; furthermore , concerns were expressed immediately that the data is not sufficient for the stability of the drug and market development . &quot;
&quot; the number of patients with hepatitis C , used to treat Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar in clinical trial . &quot;
&quot; after setting treatment with al@@ ph@@ eon flame ret@@ ard@@ ant the disease in more patients than in the reference rate , Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects . &quot;
&quot; apart from that , the drug has been introduced in the study to investigate the question , in@@ compar@@ ing the drug is an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) , not sufficiently vali@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; it can be applied to the treatment of Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( one with cr@@ acking in@@ compatible skin detection ) , and small in@@ infected la@@ wl@@ ess@@ ations ( R@@ iss@@ or or snor@@ ing wo@@ unds ) , di@@ ced and lic@@ ted wo@@ unds . &quot;
Al@@ tar@@ go is not supposed to be used to treat infections which were thought@@ fully or probably due to meth@@ ic@@ en@@ resist@@ ent Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ go against these kinds of infections may not affect .
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years of age may not exceed 2 % of the body &apos;s surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient is not talking about two to three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments . &quot;
it works by blocking the bacter@@ i@@ ellen Ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cell where proteins are produced ) and inhi@@ bits the growth of bacteria .
main indicator of the effectiveness was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was exp@@ elled after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of the 139 patients below Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of the 71 patients under plac@@ ebo spoke to the treatment .
in the treatment of infected door@@ way Al@@ tar@@ go and Cef@@ al@@ exin @-@ related response : when the results of both studies were surv@@ ey@@ ed at home affairs , about 90 % of the patients of both groups were treated to treatment . &quot;
&quot; however , in these two studies , however , that Al@@ tar@@ go has been created in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( vain @-@ filled cav@@ ity in body tissues ) or of infections , which have been thought@@ ful or presum@@ ably caused by MR@@ SA , not effective enough . &quot;
the most common side @-@ effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation at the order .
&quot; the Committee on Human@@ arz@@ t@@ ants ( CH@@ MP ) was to conclude that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go in the short @-@ scale treatment of the following super@@ ficial infections against the risks over@@ weigh : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • in@@ fied small la@@ er@@ ations , di@@ ced or genital wo@@ unds . &quot;
May 2007 the European Commission shared the company G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd. approval for the transport of Al@@ tar@@ go into the entire European Union .
patients in which have no improvement within two to three days should be examined once and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in the case of awareness or serious local irrit@@ ation by the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be , the treatment is dis@@ continued , the ano@@ int@@ ment can be carefully checked and an adequate alternative therapy for the infection . &quot;
&quot; Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin shall not be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known as Er@@ re@@ ger , or suspected ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials in secondary wound was the effectiveness of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections , caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) were insufficient . &quot;
&quot; an alternative therapy should be considered , if after a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment have no improvement or a deterioration of the infected site . &quot;
the effect of simultaneous application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical resources on the same skin surface is not investigated and the simultaneous application of other top@@ ical medicines is not recommended .
&quot; due to the low plas@@ ma concentration , which were achieved in people after top@@ ical application on de@@ di@@ ced skin or infected super@@ ficial wo@@ unds , is a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition is not expected ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
3 After simultaneous gift of 2 @-@ times daily 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol increased the mean re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max after top@@ ical application of 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be on di@@ ced skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the low system@@ ic exposure to top@@ ical application in patients are dos@@ is@@ customiz@@ ations not needed for necessary when top@@ ical Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is used during a system@@ ic treatment with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a reproductive medicine after or@@ atory intake and are inadequate in terms of a statement regarding the birth and the f@@ öt@@ ale / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should be applied only during pregnancy when a top@@ ical anti @-@ bacterial therapy is clear and the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the gift of a system@@ ic antibiotic .
&quot; when deciding whether the stit@@ ches continued / completed , or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go should be termin@@ ated , is reduced between the benefits of breast@@ feeding for the inf@@ estation and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies at 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections , the Al@@ tar@@ go was applied , was the most common reported adren@@ al irrit@@ ation at the administration of the state which is about 1 % of the patient . &quot;

the drug mechanism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the sel@@ ective inhibit@@ or of the bacter@@ i@@ ellen syn@@ thesis by interaction with a specific bond @-@ site of the bacter@@ i@@ c Ri@@ bos@@ ome that differs from the Bin@@ ding of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial and bacterial .

&quot; should be conceivable on the basis of local prevalence of the Resi@@ st@@ enz , the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in at least some inf@@ ect@@ oral forms , should be a consultation by experts . &quot;
&quot; there were no differences in the In @-@ vit@@ ro activity of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the insul@@ ate sensitive or resist@@ ent to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in were . &quot;
&quot; in the case of non @-@ speaking , the presence of tribes with additional viral factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on @-@ Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered . &quot;

Ambi@@ rix will be used for protection against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases which concern the liver ) in children between a 15 and 15 years that are not imm@@ un against these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is applied as part of one of two doses of existing vaccines , whereby protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after administration of the second dose . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used when immun@@ isation is a low risk of hepatitis B infection and is ensured that the existing vaccines can be led to the end of two doses . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her dose against hepatitis A or B is desired , Ambi@@ rix or other hepatitis C can be given . &quot;
&quot; vaccines work by bringing the immune system ( the natural def@@ enders of the body ) , &quot; how it can cry against a disease . &quot;
&quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recogni@@ zes the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; foreign &quot; and creates antibodies against it . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix contains the same components such as the Twin@@ rix adult since 1996 and has been awarded a vaccine Twin@@ rix children since 1997 .
&quot; the three vaccines have applied to protect the same disease , but Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administ@@ ered as part of one of three doses of existing vaccines . &quot;
&quot; because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults identified identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix adults , also used as a cover for the use of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
the main indic@@ t@@ ator for the effectiveness was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective anti @-@ cent@@ ric anti @-@ centr@@ alism .
in an additional study with 208 children the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared with a sixth month and a 12 @-@ month gap between the two inj@@ ections .
Ambi@@ rix led up between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children one month after the last inj@@ ections to the development of protective anti @-@ cent@@ ric antibodies against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection from Ambi@@ rix at a six @-@ month gap between the inj@@ ections was similar .
&quot; the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine ) are head@@ ache , appeti@@ sers @-@ man@@ power , p@@ ains at inj@@ ecting , redness , mat@@ eness , and irrit@@ ability . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix may not be used for patients who may potentially be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients or ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) not to be applied .
August 2002 divided the European Commission to the company G@@ lax@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ olog@@ icals - a permit for the transport of Ambi@@ rix across the whole
&quot; the standardization plan for the Grun@@ di@@ mm@@ ation with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ inated , whereby the first dose is administ@@ ered by the election and the second dose of between six and twelve months after the first dose . &quot;
&quot; if a collection of hepatitis B is desired for hepatitis A as well as for hepatitis B , can be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al vaccines or with a combination of a combination . &quot;
&quot; according to a Grun@@ di@@ mm@@ ation with the combination @-@ hepatitis C , anti @-@ hepatitis C ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) - and anti @-@ hepatitis A @-@ virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) anti@@ body values are located in the same size order as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al vaccines . &quot;
&quot; it is not yet entirely assured whether immun@@ otherap@@ ists have addressed , a refres@@ her , as protection require , as they are also in no longer det@@ ectable antibodies as they are protected by the immun@@ ologic memory . &quot;
3 As with all inj@@ ections should be used for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hysi@@ cal reaction after the gift of the vaccine for medical treatment and monitoring always available immediately .
&quot; if a fast protection against hepatitis B is required , the Stand@@ ardi@@ f@@ sch@@ ema is recommended using the combination of using the 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B @-@ A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ antes hepatitis B @-@ surface area . &quot;
&quot; at Hä@@ modi@@ aly@@ sis and persons with distur@@ b@@ ances of the immune system , after the Grun@@ di@@ mm@@ ar@@ isation under circumstances does not reach an excerpt of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibodies , so in these cases the gift of further vaccines can be necessary . &quot;
&quot; since an in@@ tra@@ der@@ mal injection or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration could lead in the glut@@ eal muscle to a sub@@ optimal imp@@ ending success , these inj@@ ections should be avoided . &quot;
&quot; at Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ o or blood @-@ in@@ dependen@@ cies , Ambi@@ rix may be in@@ sured , however , because in these cases the in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular gift can come to blood . &quot;

&quot; in case of patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune def@@ ective , it may not be achieved sufficient immun@@ isation . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , which has been carried out with 3 vacc@@ ination of this formulation in adults was the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ern@@ ers , head@@ ache and fever comparable to the frequency that was observed in the earlier Thi@@ om@@ ers@@ al@@ - and preser@@ v@@ ant vaccine form@@ ulations . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies , 2029 vaccines have been administ@@ ered for a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ination at age of 1 to 15 years . &quot;
&quot; in a study with 300 participants aged 12 to 15 , including 15 years , the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix has been compared with that of the 3 @-@ doses combination . &quot;
&quot; only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and mat@@ ern@@ ess on a calculation basis for a vacc@@ d@@ osis ambi@@ rix , but not on a calculation basis per person . &quot;
pain has been observed after the Gift of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 0.3 % of the trial compared with 39,@@ 1 % in the treatment after the gift of a dose of 3 doses .
&quot; after the complete vacc@@ ination reported 6@@ 6,@@ 4 % of the Pro@@ b@@ anden , the Ambi@@ rix had gotten over , over pain , compared to 6@@ 3.@@ 8 % at the Pro@@ b@@ anden , which were vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dosage combination . &quot;
&quot; however , the frequency of mat@@ ernity was comparable to high ( i.e. , over the whole vaccine @-@ cycle at 39,@@ 6 % of the Pro@@ b@@ anden , the ambi@@ rix got compared with 36,@@ 2 % of the Pro@@ b@@ ahs that got the 3 @-@ doses . &quot;
the frequency of prehistoric pain and mat@@ ern@@ ess was small and comparable to which was observed after administration of the combined vaccine with the 3 @-@ doses vaccine .
&quot; in a compar@@ ative study of 1@@ - to 11 @-@ year imp@@ fl@@ ingen , the appearance of local transactions and general transactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ group comparable to which has been observed in administration with the 3 @-@ doses combination with 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B @-@ A @-@ surface area and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B . &quot;
&quot; however , with the 6@@ - to 11@@ - year @-@ old , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix had been a frequent appearance of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per Pro@@ band . &quot;

the Ser@@ o@@ converted rates for anti @-@ h@@ bs were 7@@ 4.7 % one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second one to the month 6 administ@@ ered dose ( d. h. in month 7 ) .
&quot; 7 In a compar@@ ative study conducted at 12@@ - until including 15 year @-@ olds , 142 two cans of Ambi@@ rix and 147 were combin@@ ant with three cans . &quot;

&quot; the Hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted by viral food and beverages , but may also be transmitted by other ways , such as bathing in by dra@@ inage water . &quot;
&quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a bl@@ est face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( yellow ) and other symptoms that may possibly make a stationary treatment . &quot;
&quot; as with all vaccines the ambi@@ rix may not fully protect against an infection with hepatitis C or hepatitis B virus , even if the whole vaccine has been completed with 2 cans . &quot;
if you have infected your child before the administration of both vaccines have been infected with hepatitis C or hepatitis B virus ( although you / your child can not feel uncomfortable or ill / feels ) can be a vacc@@ ination a disease may not prevent .
&quot; protection against other infections that cause the liver damage or symptoms that are similar to those of a hepatitis C or hepatitis B infection , cannot be convey@@ ed . &quot;
• if you already have an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine including Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction can express itself through ju@@ ck@@ eting rash , breathing or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you have occurred a allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B . • If you have a serious infection with fever . &quot;
&quot; • If you want to quickly have protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. , within six months and prior to the included administration of the second vacc@@ ination ) . &quot;
at a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination the doctor will advise you / your child from a vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix .
instead he will recommend you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis B / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective measurement per vacc@@ ination ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ active hepatitis B @-@ B virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface area ) .
the second vacc@@ ination of this vaccine with reduced content to effective components usually administ@@ ered a month after the first dose and might give you a vaccine protection against completion of the vaccine .
&quot; sometimes , Ambi@@ rix will suffer from people suffering from severe blood disorders , among the skin and not in the muscle . if you are weak@@ ened / your child due to a disorder or treatment in your / her body &apos;s self @-@ defense . &quot;
&quot; ambitions may be given in these cases , but the immune response of these persons on the vacc@@ ination may not be sufficient so that a blood test can be required to see how strong the reaction to vacc@@ ination is . &quot;
&quot; 21 Be your doctor , if you have given your child further medicines / takes ( including those who have been able to receive without prescription ) or if you / your child have recently been vacc@@ inated , or immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ine ( antibodies ) have received or this is planned in the near future . &quot;
&quot; however , it can be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses . &quot;
&quot; if another vaccine has to be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as possible as different limb@@ s . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix starts at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient . &quot;
&quot; usually , Ambi@@ rix pregnant or nursing women is not administ@@ ered except it is urgent that they will vacc@@ inated both against hepatitis A as well as hepatitis B . &quot;
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have shown an allergic reaction to ne@@ omy@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
&quot; if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new date as soon as possible . &quot;

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs to 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs to 50 without need@@ les .
&quot; based on the data that has been known since issu@@ ance of the first approval for the transport network , the CH@@ MP opinion that the full @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive . &quot;
&quot; however , Ambi@@ rix has been released only in a member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available security data for this medicine is limited due to the low patient exposure . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps can also be used in patients aged over one month with in@@ complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ def@@ ective or with hyper@@ tension @-@ mix@@ tures ( brain , as a result of high ammon@@ ium end@@ ulations ) in the history of history . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps is divided - split into several items to meals - sho@@ cked , among the food mixed , or over a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ eme ( by the stomach into the stomach of the leading hose ) and a nas@@ al son@@ de ( by the nose in the stomach @-@ leading hose ) . &quot;
&quot; it was not a compar@@ ative study , since Am@@ mon@@ aps could not be compared with another treatment or with plac@@ ebo ( a lamp drug , i.e. without substance ) . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps can also lead to appeti@@ sers @-@ loss , a ab@@ norm@@ ality in blood , depression , fri@@ ction , flavors , flavors or taste , p@@ endant , v@@ om@@ iting , v@@ p@@ ation , irrit@@ ation , un@@ pleas@@ ing body cur@@ se or weight gain . &quot;
the Committee on Human@@ arz@@ t@@ ants ( CH@@ MP ) had to conclude that Am@@ mon@@ aps will be effective in patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary tract for high ammon@@ ium levels .
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps was approved under &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; , &quot; because of the rar@@ ity of the disease at the time of admission only limited information on this medicine . &quot;
the application is inde@@ xed with all patients where a complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ man@@ gel is already manifest@@ ed in the new@@ born @-@ age ( within the first 28 life @-@ days ) .
&quot; in patients with a bel@@ t@@ mani@@ fold form ( in@@ complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ def@@ ective , which is manifest@@ ed after the first life of life ) , then there is an indication for use when in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese is a hyper@@ bl@@ em@@ ic un@@ cep@@ hal@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; for inf@@ ants , for children , which are not able to sw@@ allow tablets or for patients with bad disorders , AM@@ MON@@ APS is also available in granite form . &quot;
the day @-@ dose is individually calculated with respect for prot@@ otypes and the growth and development of daily prot@@ ein@@ ment of the patient .
after the previous clinical experience the normal daily dose of Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day for children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.5 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight of 20 kg as well as with Her@@ an@@ growing and adults .
&quot; in patients , who suffer from a very firm lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ b@@ yl@@ ase , is the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ rul@@ lin or argin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3,@@ 8 g / m ² / day required . &quot;
patients with an Ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must receive argin@@ ine in a dosage from 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8,@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
&quot; AM@@ MON@@ APS tablets may not be administ@@ ered to patients with sl@@ ating disorders , as a risk for the emergence of eco @-@ soph@@ ag@@ ul@@ zer@@ a when the tablets do not immediately reach the stomach . &quot;
each tablet AM@@ MON@@ APS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium per 20 g of so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
&quot; therefore , AM@@ MON@@ APS should therefore be used in patients with con@@ sti@@ ched in@@ suff@@ iciency or severe kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency , as well as with Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ re@@ tention and o@@ de@@ formation of clinical conditions only with caution . &quot;
&quot; since met@@ abol@@ isation and ex@@ cre@@ tion of so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at over the liver and the kid@@ neys , AM@@ MON@@ APS should be applied to patients with liver or kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency only with extreme caution . &quot;
the importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MON@@ APS during pregnancy is therefore non @-@ trained ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; in sub@@ cut@@ aneous gift of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats ( 190 - 474 mg / kg ) , it came to a slo@@ wing of ne@@ ural multip@@ lication and increased loss of neur@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; it also found a consuming irrit@@ ation of zer@@ eb@@ r@@ als syn@@ ap@@ sen , and a dimin@@ ished number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth . &quot;
&quot; it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate upon people in the mother &apos;s milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MON@@ APS , during the stagn@@ ation period ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , AM@@ MON@@ APS , at 56 % of patients joined at least an unwanted event ( AE ) and at 78 % of these undes@@ irable events that she was not connected with AM@@ MON@@ APS . &quot;
&quot; frequency is defined as follows : very common ( &gt; 1 / 10 ) , commonly ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able tox@@ ic@@ ical response to AM@@ MON@@ APS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 year old anor@@ ectal cancer , which developed a metabo@@ lic anti@@ recipes , heavy hy@@ po@@ kal@@ ine , Panz@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ie , periph@@ eral N@@ europ@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
a case of an over@@ dose entered a 5 month old mini@@ child with a failed single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate that showed during a intraven@@ ous administration of cans up to 400 mg / kg / day a dos@@ is@@ limited neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabo@@ lic active connection that is con@@ ju@@ y through acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine about phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine con@@ ju@@ y over the kid@@ neys .
Stö@@ chi@@ ometric is seen phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine comparable ( both connections contain 2 nit@@ rogen hormone ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an ag@@ ative support for ex@@ cre@@ tion of over@@ estimated nit@@ rogen .
5 patients with disorders of the ure@@ ter @-@ cycle can be accepted that for each gram cul@@ min@@ ate Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at between 0.12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nit@@ rogen produced .
it is of meaning that diagnosis is early and the treatment is immediately started to improve the survi@@ vor@@ s of survival and the clinical result .
&quot; the progn@@ osis of the early diagnosis of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms in the new@@ born age was almost always inf@@ ist , and the disease was carried out in treatment with Per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids , or with their sti@@ ck@@ eting an@@ alogue within the first year of life . &quot;
&quot; by Hä@@ modi@@ aly@@ se , the use of aging ways of nit@@ rogen ( so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , so@@ dium ben@@ zo@@ at and so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , it was possible to diagnose the survival rate of new @-@ born child ( however within the first life of life ) diagnosed diseases to 80 % . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients there was time with many other intellectual disabilities or other neurological defic@@ its . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a bel@@ t@@ mani@@ fold form of the disease ( including female patients with the heter@@ ozy@@ got@@ hic form of the or@@ ni@@ thin@@ b@@ yl@@ ase deficiency ) , which were treated with so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and a prot@@ ein@@ reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % . &quot;
&quot; already existing neurological defic@@ its are hardly rever@@ sible in treatment , and in some patients may occur a further deterioration of the neurological condition . &quot;
&quot; it is known that Phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ox@@ i@@ dered on phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ox@@ i@@ dered , which is con@@ form@@ ated in liver and kidney disease with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine . &quot;
the concentr@@ ations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its Met@@ abol@@ ites in Plas@@ ma and Ur@@ in were determined according to the gift of a single dose of 5 g so@@ dium tox@@ icity and with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis as well as repeti@@ tive gifts of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled studies ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its Met@@ abol@@ ites was also examined in cancer patients after intraven@@ ous hy@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after a or@@ atory single dose of 5 g so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in tablet form were found 15 minutes after taking measurable plas@@ mak@@ et centr@@ alism by phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary c@@ lical sw@@ ings or Hä@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin@@ opath@@ ies was after different doses of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) the next morning after night@@ ly fasting no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in the plas@@ ma .
&quot; for three of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , which were repeated with so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 20 g / day oral ) in the plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ kes on the third day five times higher than after the first gifts . &quot;

&quot; according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses had no cl@@ ast@@ ogen@@ ic effects ( examination 24 and 48 h after or@@ aler administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MON@@ APS Gran@@ ules is either taken out oral ( inf@@ ants and children who can not sw@@ allow any tablets , or patients with bats ) or via a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ eme or an Nas@@ en@@ son@@ de . &quot;
&quot; after the previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day for new@@ born baby , inf@@ ants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.5 g / m ² / day for children with a body weight of 20 kg as well as with Her@@ an@@ growing and adults . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of ammonia , argin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( in particular bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , Car@@ ni@@ tin and ser@@ um prot@@ ein in the plas@@ ma should be held within the normal range . &quot;
&quot; in patients , who suffer from a very firm lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ b@@ yl@@ ase , is the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ rul@@ lin or argin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3,@@ 8 g / m ² / day required . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MON@@ APS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5,@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium per gram of so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium per 20 g so@@ dium poly@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; when R@@ atten@@ f@@ utes were exposed before the birth of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active met@@ abo@@ lit by phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ) , it came to l@@ esi@@ ons in the pyramid cells of the brain rin@@ ce . &quot;

based on research on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of ur@@ inary tract may be assumed that for each gram it may be produced so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at between 0.12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nit@@ rogen .

after a or@@ atory single dose of 5 g so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in granite form were found 15 minutes after taking measurable plas@@ mak@@ et centr@@ alism by phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
during the duration of durability the patient can save the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of over 25 ° C .
with this procedure the small measuring po@@ ons are 0.95 g the average measuring po@@ on 2.8 g and the large measuring spo@@ on 8.@@ 6 g so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
&quot; if a patient has to get the medication above a probe , AM@@ MON@@ APS can also be solved in water ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at amounts up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with these rare diseases are lack of liver en@@ cyclop@@ a@@ ics , so that they cannot sw@@ allow for consumption of proteins in the body after consumption of proteins in the body . &quot;

&quot; angi@@ ox is used for the treatment of adult patients with &quot; acute Kor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ ms &quot; ( ACS , decreased blood flow to the heart ) , for example by inst@@ abil@@ er Ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ din@@ ers ( heart attack ) without &quot; &quot; ST@@ - Heb@@ ung &quot; ( an anom@@ alies of the electro@@ cardi@@ og@@ ram or EC@@ G ) . &quot;
&quot; will be applied to prevent blood@@ ho@@ stages in patients who extends to a PCI , a higher dose is administ@@ ered and the inf@@ usion can continue up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this can contribute to patients with Ang@@ ina or coron@@ ary heart to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
&quot; approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of an@@ gi@@ ox has been compared with a gly@@ kop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ IA @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( G@@ PI , another drug for preventing blood treatment ) with the conventional combination treatment with Hep@@ arin ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ) and a G@@ PI was compared . &quot;
&quot; during the PCI the patients often became a st@@ ent ( a short tail ) used in the arter@@ ies , in order to prevent a cl@@ asp and they received additional medicines to prevent bl@@ eeding , like Ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and aspir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of ACS , An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without a gift of G@@ PI - in preventing new events ( deaths , heart attack or re@@ as@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days respectively a year as much as the traditional treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients who under@@ went a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox in terms of all indicators was just as effective as Hep@@ arin , except for heavy blood vessels , in which it was significantly more effective than Hep@@ arin . &quot;
angi@@ ox may not be used in patients who are potentially overweight ( allergic ) against Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine , other her@@ ud@@ ine or any of the other components . &quot;
&quot; it may also not be used in patients who recently had a bl@@ eeding , as well as people with strong high blood pressure or heavy kidney disease or a heart infection . &quot;
the Committee on Human@@ arz@@ t@@ ants ( CH@@ MP ) had to conclude that An@@ gi@@ ox is a acceptable replacement for Hep@@ arin in the treatment of ACS and during a PCI .
September 2004 divided the European Commission to The Company The Medi@@ c@@ ines Company UK Ltd . permit approval for the transport of An@@ gi@@ ox in the whole of the European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute Kor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ men ( inst@@ ab@@ ile Ang@@ ina / non @-@ lever in@@ far@@ es ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) at an emergency handle or if an early intervention is planned .
the recommended initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with ACS is a intraven@@ ous bolt of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an inf@@ usion of 0,25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; if the patient is carried out on a PCI line , an additional bolt from 0,5 mg / kg should be increased and the inf@@ usion for the duration of the intervention to 1,75 mg / kg / h will be increased . &quot;
after PCI you can resume the reduced inf@@ usion dose of 0,25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours .
&quot; immediately prior to the procedure , a bol@@ ting will be administ@@ ered by 0,5 mg / kg , followed by an inf@@ usion of 1,75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the Rhin@@ oplast@@ y . &quot;
the recommended dosage of an@@ gi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of a initi@@ als of resolution of 0,75 mg / kg body weight and a dose of partial inf@@ usion with a dose of 1,75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention .
&quot; the safety and efficacy of a single pin connector has not been studied and is not recommended , even if a short PCI procedure is planned . &quot;
&quot; if this value is shorten@@ ed ( ACT after 5 minutes ) to below 225 seconds , a second pin should be made of 0.@@ 3 mg / kg / body weight . &quot;
&quot; to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values , the re@@ constitu@@ ent and dil@@ uted drugs prior to the application was carefully mixed and the Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis quickly intraven@@ ously intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; once the ACT amounts to more than 225 seconds , another supervision is no longer required , provided the 1,75 mg / kg inf@@ usion d@@ osis is administ@@ ered properly . &quot;
&quot; in case of patients with medium @-@ heavy kidney trucks ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which is dealt with a PCI ( whether with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in against ACS or not ) , should be used a lower inf@@ usion rate of 1,@@ 4 mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; if the ACT value is below 225 seconds , a second Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis is administ@@ ered by 0,@@ 3 mg / kg and the ACT 5 minutes after the second Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis again . &quot;
&quot; in patients with intermediate @-@ heavy kidney disease , which resulted in the Phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) , which resulted in approval was the ACT value 5 minutes according to the property of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Bol@@ us without dosage adjustment at an average 36@@ 6 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
3 In case of patients with heavy kidney disease ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients is in@@ gi@@ ox conf@@ lic@@ ated ( see below 4.3 ) .
the treatment with an@@ gi@@ ox can be reached 30 minutes after ending the intraven@@ ous mer@@ ged Hep@@ arin or 8 hours following the termination of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous Hep@@ arin of the molecular Hep@@ arin .
&quot; • known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or other components or against her@@ ud@@ ine , active bl@@ eeding , and / or irre@@ ver@@ sible in@@ dependen@@ cies . • harder un@@ controlled hyper@@ tension , and sub@@ ver@@ sible bacterial infection . • heavy kidney disease ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and for di@@ aly@@ sis patients &quot;
patients are carefully monitored during treatment carefully with regard to symptoms and signs of a blood pressure especially when Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine is administ@@ ered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ul@@ ans ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; even though at PCI @-@ patients under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine , most bl@@ eeding occur at arter@@ ial points , can occur in patients suffering from a per@@ k@@ ut@@ aneous coron@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) , during the treatment in principle all bl@@ eeding may occur . &quot;
&quot; in patients , the war@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in should be considered to ensure the value of the IN@@ R Wer@@ ts ( International Reg@@ ular Rati@@ o ) should be considered to ensure that the value after lowering the treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine once again achieved before the treatment existing level . &quot;
&quot; starting from the knowledge of the drug mechanism of antibodies ( Hep@@ arin , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tika or thy@@ ro@@ cking sh@@ em@@ mer ) can be assumed that these substances can increase the blood pressure . &quot;
the combination of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine with Th@@ ro@@ ism and anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants are the clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ al parameters in any case regularly control .
&quot; the experimental investigations are related to the impact on pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , the un@@ binding or post@@ nat@@ al development inadequate ( see below 5.3 ) . &quot;

the following information on side effects are based on the data of a clinical trial with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine for 6000 patients who under@@ gone a PCI .
both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in group as well as in the compar@@ isons with hep@@ atic groups it came in women as well as in patients over 65 years of more severe events than in male or younger patients .

&quot; the following side effects , which are not listed above , have been reported after extensive use in practice and are sorted according to System@@ atic classes in table 6 . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine is to break down immediately and to monitor the patient &apos;s eng@@ eli@@ hood with regard to the signs of a bl@@ eeding . &quot;
&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox contains Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine , a direct and specific th@@ rom@@ atic inhibit@@ or , which is both at the cat@@ aly@@ tic Center as well as the Ani@@ on@@ en@@ bin@@ ge region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in bin@@ ds , regardless of whether Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in in the liquid stage or at home . &quot;
&quot; the bond of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine at Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and thus its effect , is rever@@ sible because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in turn off the bond of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Arg@@ 3 @-@ pro@@ 4 slowly resulting in re@@ generates the function of the active centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in re@@ generates . &quot;

if the patient has been operating below a PCI one should be given an additional bolt of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine and the inf@@ usion for the duration of the intervention to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h can be increased .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used for treating adults , young people and children from six years with diabetes that require treatment with ins@@ ulin . &quot;
A@@ pi@@ dra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdom@@ inal wall , the th@@ igh@@ s or the Ober@@ arm inj@@ ected or as continuous inf@@ usion with an ins@@ ulin pump . &quot;
diabetes is an illness in which the body does not produce enough ins@@ ulin to regul@@ ating the gl@@ uc@@ ose pi@@ eg@@ els ( sugar ) in the blood or which ins@@ ulin is not effective .
&quot; ins@@ ulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in differs greatly from human@@ ins@@ ulin , and the change means that it appears faster and a shorter activity has more than a short @-@ effective human@@ ins@@ ulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra was used in combination with a long @-@ effective ins@@ ulin in patients with type @-@ 1 diabetes , in which the body can not produce ins@@ ulin in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years . &quot;
&quot; type @-@ 2 diabetes , in which the body ins@@ ulin may not be effective , A@@ pi@@ dra was examined in a study involving 8@@ 78 adults . &quot;
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the modification of the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ y@@ lic hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that shows how good the blood sugar is set .
&quot; in the first study with adults with type @-@ 1 diabetes , after six months a reduction of 0,@@ 14 % ( from 7,@@ 60 % to 7,@@ 46 % ) compared to a reduction of 0,@@ 14 % at In@@ sul@@ in@@ l@@ is@@ per . &quot;
in adults with type @-@ 2 diabetes the lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was a reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration by six months with A@@ pi@@ dra as compared to 0,30 % at human@@ ins@@ ulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra must not be used in patients who are potentially overweight ( allergic ) against ins@@ ulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in or any other components that are already suffering from any hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
&quot; the cans of A@@ pi@@ dra may be adjusted , if it is administ@@ ered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood glu@@ co@@ ders . &quot;
September 2004 the European Commission shared the company San@@ o@@ fi @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH provided a licence for the transport of A@@ pi@@ dra across the European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous inj@@ ections either in the area of the stomach ceiling , to apply or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous inf@@ usion in the area of pancre@@ atic - . &quot;
&quot; due to the reduced gl@@ uc@@ ogen@@ esis capacity and dimin@@ ished inhibit@@ or , the ins@@ ulin needs to be brought down in patients with a restriction of liver function . &quot;
&quot; any change of the active force , the stamp ( glasses ) , the In@@ sul@@ int@@ yp@@ s ( normal , N@@ PH , galvan@@ ized , etc ) , the type of ins@@ ulin ( animal ins@@ ulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can draw a change in the ins@@ ulin requirements . &quot;
&quot; 3 . insufficient dosage or the break@@ age of a treatment , especially in patients with a ins@@ ulin diabetes , can lead to a hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and a di@@ ab@@ etic K@@ eto@@ azi@@ de ; these states are potentially life @-@ threatening . &quot;
the conversion of one patient to another ins@@ ulin or an ins@@ ulin of another manufacturer should be performed under str@@ ingent medical supervision and can make a change of dosage .
the time of occurrence of a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the use of the ins@@ ulin profile and can therefore change to the switch of medical schem@@ as .
&quot; to the substances that increase blood sugar levels increase and reinforce the incl@@ ination to Hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ vern@@ s , include or@@ ale anti@@ di@@ ab@@ etic , ot@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , mon@@ o@@ xy@@ yll@@ able , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ phen , S@@ ic@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ fon@@ amid antibiotics . &quot;
&quot; in addition , under the effect of Symp@@ ath@@ oly@@ tika such as Bet@@ ab@@ lock@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ id@@ ine , Guan@@ eth@@ id@@ in and Reserve @-@ pin the symptoms of the ep@@ in@@ ep@@ in@@ ep@@ hr@@ ine dis@@ cord or be missing . &quot;
&quot; animal experimental studies on reproductive medicine showed no differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and Human@@ ins@@ ulin in terms of pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , the birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ enters into the human mother &apos;s milk , but in general , ins@@ ulin does not appear in the mother &apos;s milk , nor will it res@@ or@@ ned to oral application . &quot;
&quot; below are the clinical studies known of clinical trials , group@@ ed according to system organs and sorted according to decre@@ asing frequency of their appearance ( very common : &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency based on availability ) . &quot;
&quot; cold @-@ welding , cool and bl@@ asse skin , ti@@ redness , nerv@@ ousness or tre@@ mor , anxiety , unusual creation disorders or weakness , confusion , conc@@ ert@@ ness , head@@ ache , nau@@ sea , nau@@ sea , and cardi@@ ac . &quot;

heavy Hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ vern@@ s with consci@@ ous@@ less@@ ness can be given by an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous inj@@ ections of Glu@@ k@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) that will be treated by any given person or by intraven@@ ous gifts of gl@@ uc@@ ose by a doctor .
after a gl@@ uc@@ t@@ onal inj@@ ecting the patient should be monitored in a hospital in order to determine the original thing for the heavy hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and avoid similar episodes .
ins@@ ulin controls the blood sugar levels through the stimulation of the periph@@ eral gl@@ os@@ sy ( especially through skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) as well as by the in@@ hibition of gl@@ uc@@ ose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub @-@ ut@@ aner Ga@@ - be carried out faster and the ingredient is shorter than at hu@@ - man@@ em normal ins@@ ulin .
&quot; in a study with 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 @-@ diabetes mel@@ li@@ - tus showed In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in in the therapeutic range of 0,@@ 0@@ 75 to 0.2 E / kg a dis@@ proportionate increase in glu@@ cos@@ ity effects , just like Human@@ ins@@ ulin . &quot;
ins@@ ulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has twice as quick impact like normal Human@@ ins@@ ulin and achiev@@ es the complete glu@@ cos@@ iness effect approximately 2 hours earlier than Human@@ ins@@ ulin .
&quot; from the data was clear that at an application of In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal has reached a comparable post@@ p@@ ran@@ ger gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control , as with human@@ ly normal ins@@ ulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal , became a better post @-@ ran@@ di@@ ale control as with human@@ ly normal ins@@ ulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; in 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal , In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 15 minutes after the start of the meal , will be a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control as with human@@ ly normal ins@@ ulin , which is given 2 Mi@@ - n@@ utes before the meal ( see figure 1 ) . &quot;
