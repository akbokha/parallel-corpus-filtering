<seg id="6">"bilify is used for the treatment of severe to severe manifold episodes, and to the prevention of manic episodes in patients who have addressed in the past in the past."</seg>
<seg id="7">Injection-solution is applied for quick control of increased unrest or behavioural disorders when the orale intake of the medication is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in both diseases, the solution can be applied or applied for patients with patients who are having the sacks of tablets difficulties."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in patients, at the same time other medicines are taking, the same as asbilify, should be adjusted the dose of bilify fy."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this affects the signal transmission between brain cells by" neotransmitters, "i.e. chemical substances that allow communication between nerve cells each other."</seg>
<seg id="11">"Aripiprazol probably acts mainly as" partieller Agonist "for the receptors for the neurotransmitters Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means that Aripiprazol like 5-hydroxytryptamine and dopamine, but in low extent than neurotransmitters works to activate the receptors."</seg>
<seg id="13">"since Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine can play a role, bears Aripiprazol to normalize the activity of the brain, causing psychotic or manic symptoms and it will be prevented."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the effectiveness of bilify, the repeating the symptoms, was examined in three studies of up to a year."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared to 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar disorders, compared to increased unrest, compared to a period of two hours with a placebo."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in another study Abilify was carried out over twelve weeks to 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the effectiveness of bilify and placebo, which had been stabilized to some 160 patients, in which the manic symptoms have already been stabilized with Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the effectiveness of bilify injection solution was compared to 301 patients with bipolar disorder, which compared to increased unrest, with which by Lorazepam (another antipsychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours compared."</seg>

<seg id="23">"bilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses decreased, also more effective than placebo the symptoms increased unrest and were similar effective as Lorazepam."</seg>
<seg id="24">"the most common side effects of Abilify (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extracurred (optional), head pain, blurred (optional), fatigue, nautical (increased storage), fatigue and exhaustion, insomnia, insomnia, insomnia) and anxiety."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Committee on Humanarztants (CHMP) was to conclude that the benefits of bilify episode in the treatment of schizophrenia and the prevention of a new manic episode in patients, who had predominantly manic episodes, and in which the manic episodes had overcast the treatment with Aripiprazol, compared to the risks."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in addition, the Committee came to the outcome that the benefits of injection solution in the rapid control of increased unrest and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manicophrenia or in patients with manicophrenia, if a ortal therapy is not suitable compared to the risks."</seg>
