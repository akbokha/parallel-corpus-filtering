the package &amp; package ; contains various modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite its low size they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some features of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by using this easier .
&quot; for more information about using &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or . &quot;
&quot; to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , choose settings extensions .... opening the card menu and select the desired modules . &quot;
&quot; this is a list of default modules from the package k@@ de ; add @-@ ons . please note that any more modules are installed on your system , if you have additional software installed . &quot;
&quot; you should install the package base , which contains &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , before you compile this package . &quot;
&quot; to use the crash module , click in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or . then you can view the page , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , or the list of cr@@ ashes , if available , delete . &quot;
the module An@@ filter ( also called folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under extras . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s current working directory on different types .
&quot; to view the DO@@ M designs in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to view the extras , select Extr@@ as DO@@ M tree ... and then open a new window with the DO@@ M of the document . as a default , the ad begins with the wor@@ zel@@ k@@ way of the document , example : basic element , all other no@@ des are sub @-@ elements of this saus@@ age . &quot;
the module &amp; F@@ S@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides a further view of objects with the M@@ IME @-@ Type I@@ node / directory with local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different tool@@ bar and text views to see the content of your local file system .
&quot; the partic@@ ular@@ ity of &amp; F@@ S@@ View ; consists in the display of a so called Tree @-@ map . Tree @-@ Maps allow the representation of size of objects in wast@@ ed structures . each object is proportional to its size . this size must possess the property that the sum of the sizes of the sub@@ ordinate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
&quot; if the size of a file or folder , the size of a folder as the sum of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , a graphic and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command can be considered . &quot;
in &amp; F@@ S@@ View ; is an entry in the Tre@@ es representation a rect@@ angle that represents a file or a folder in your fil@@ es@@ ystem . for easy navigation possess the rect@@ angle meaningful colour@@ ing and lab@@ eling settings .
&quot; the color of a rect@@ angle that is switched on view mode , can be either depth for the slight detect of the se@@ ach@@ ers or the image of another file name , like name , owner , group or m@@ ime type . &quot;
&quot; a rect@@ angle can be described with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each feature you can specify , if enough room to display exists , or if the surface of sub@@ ordinate rect@@ angle may occur . furthermore , you can set the relative position of the cap@@ tion in the rect@@ angle . &quot;
&quot; in Dar@@ ing algorithms for Tre@@ em@@ aps , the general rule should be observed that the surface is proportional to the size of the entry . at the Tre@@ ble in &amp; F@@ S@@ View ; this goal is not always available to present the sub@@ ordinate entries . please note that less space for the frame is lost when the rect@@ angle square is square . &quot;
&quot; as a division of an entry of an entry for the sub@@ ordinate entries , the implementation remains to be left . here it is possible for the circum@@ cis@@ ed and for the avoidance of space over@@ flowing as part of the square . the best methods of this line are lines , columns , or recur@@ sive sections . &quot;
&quot; you can specify the minimum surface area for an entry over the menu view view . instead , a smoking pattern is drawn into the area of the superior entries to indicate that this area is actually covered by a sub@@ ordinate entry . &quot;
originally a &amp; F@@ S@@ View was originally intended as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map Wid@@ gets that was developed for applying K@@ C@@ ach@@ egr@@ ind .
the picture gallery can be found in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ menu under Extr@@ as picture gallery ... or with C@@ tr@@ l ; I .
&quot; if you call the picture gallery , you will open a dialog with which you can specify the image of the gallery . &quot;
the option titles from the page allows you to adjust in a text field the title of the picture gallery page .
&quot; the option images per line has a sli@@ der and a screen , to adjust the number of mini@@ pictures of each line in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; with the cross @-@ field fil@@ en@@ ame of the picture , you determine whether the fil@@ en@@ ames can be displayed among the mini@@ ature in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; with the cross @-@ box file size of the picture , you determine whether the file size is displayed under the mini@@ ature in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; with the cruci@@ fied image size , you &apos;ll show whether the size of the pictures can be displayed among the mini@@ pictures in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; in the dialogue folder , you place where the gallery will be stored and which sub@@ folders are to be included . &quot;
&quot; in the file selection store in HTML file , you specify where the HTML page is to be saved . &quot;
&quot; with the cruci@@ fix@@ ture under@@ folder , you can set up with a sli@@ der or a rotating field , up to which plane the sub@@ folders are included . &quot;
&quot; with the quotes original pictures you can copy , whether the original pictures should be copied into the gallery . &quot;
with the An@@ cross @-@ box commentary file you can indicate a commentary file for the cap@@ tion of the pictures in the gallery .
&quot; in the clo@@ ister colours , you can indicate for the Mini@@ ature pictures a different color @-@ depth than in the original pictures . &quot;

&quot; a simple to @-@ use camera service will be available to you with your digital camera , so that you can download your photos directly in &amp; B . of course , more than 1000 digital cameras will be supported by library of g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , each medium and each card@@ holder is supported by your operating system , with &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ement . &quot;
&quot; she came ; contains a fast image editing with basic training tools . you can use them to evaluate your photos , comment , to evaluate and correct . editing abilities can be easily expanded with KDE image Plugins interface ( manual ) modules . &quot;
&quot; though &amp; digi@@ ous came ; easy to use , it represents stupid professional skills available . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit Far@@ br@@ aum and all available modules support the raw converting using li@@ bra@@ w , DN@@ G @-@ Export and ICC color . &quot;
&quot; improved database with significantly more met@@ ad@@ ata , such as &amp; eg ; about the camera or the lens , about which can be sought . &quot;
&quot; like all &amp; none ; programs is also free , an open source project . that means , it is dependent on the support of the end users . you should therefore report problems and improvement possibilities . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ tization : trying to make the mil@@ king of problems or suggestions for them . wherever you are in the program , the help menu features an associated problems or wishes .... This opens a dialog with a sub@@ ordinate system . all required information is already registered here . follow the instructions to send your report . &quot;
&quot; when she came ; is a project that is supported by a community . i.e. , the user and developer will help each other . if you have a regular users of &amp; yourself , then we would like to answer any questions about other users . in this mailing list , however , you should be able to answer any questions about other users . in this mailing list , however , you should be so powerful in this language . &quot;
you can also visit the digi@@ tization ; homepage visit to get news about free versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ tization .
the best start to get up &amp; digi@@ tization ; to participate is the registration in the developer mailing list . guide to the registration in the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ tization .
&quot; when you come and run ; for the first time , you will be asked where you want to store your pictures and your database . you can select a local , remote or remote folder . just enter a local , remote or remote folder , just select a folder or folder folder to select a folder . &quot;
in the second field you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here the data is stored . this path remains the same for all imaging .
&quot; later you can add as many folder as you would like to add . &amp; B. came , you will additionally use as Al@@ ben@@ library . settings of K@@ am set up . &quot;
&quot; if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can indicate the top folder , the images , you can indicate the base folder as an album . no picture will be changed as an album . no picture will be changed as an album . during the check of the folder you will get a progress report like this : &quot;
&quot; she came ; thir@@ st for recur@@ sively the libr@@ arian path@@ way in his whole depth . you can &apos;t shut down a sub@@ folder , unless it was i@@ ste in hidden folder . this can help you put a point in front of the name of the sub@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums are in My Al@@ ben@@ list no photos as symbols . you can change that by clicking any photo from the album , and this will be used as a album symbol . &quot;
&quot; once you have configured the base folder you can set up , you can set up your digital camera . afterwards you should learn how to use My albums and My sampling , to manage your photos into the albums . &quot;
&quot; raw data support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , so it can also handle . the support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out whether a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the menu help raw materials supported . &quot;
how to set up this and work with raw files in the sections of Ro@@ h Dec@@ o@@ der@@ settings and Ro@@ h work@@ flow .
&quot; a simple to @-@ use camera service will be available to you with your digital camera , so that you can download your photos directly in &amp; B . of course , more than 1000 digital cameras will be supported by library of g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , each medium and each card@@ holder is supported by your operating system , with &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ement . &quot;
modern digital cameras are log@@ ged by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IEE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) to data transfer . the camera can also be realized as USB mass storage device . older cameras can also use the connection to the connected port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&quot; digi@@ tization ; uses the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 to communicate with digital cameras , which was developed an ever increasing number of more than 800 cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol , which was developed by the International Imaging Industry Association , allowing the transmission of pictures of digital cameras to b@@ illing and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need additional drivers . &quot;
&quot; many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the calcul@@ ator . as photos in general are large files and transmission via the resp@@ ectable port is slowly , this connection is now out@@ dated . &amp; digi@@ tization ; supports these cameras and leads the transfer of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 through . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link . &quot;
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 has to be created with li@@ bex@@ ar support so that the umb@@ nails can be read by some lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 @-@ camera ri@@ pe . if the car@@ rot support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you &apos;ll possibly can &apos;t have th@@ umb@@ nails possibly or the generation could be very slow . &quot;
&quot; one of the most beautiful things on your own , is how easy to extend its functionality by modules : &quot;
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I modules : the KDE Image plug @-@ ins interface Project ( manual ) is a approach to develop a common modular structure for your digi@@ tization ; , K@@ Photo@@ album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . goal is to provide the modules all the graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section . &quot;
&quot; modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way , as it can also be a user . your advantage is that it &apos;s much easier to supplement &amp; digi@@ tization ; through writing a small module to add a function , as the changes entered into &amp; tre@@ ad ; even carry out . &quot;
&quot; to simplify the window , you can either remove the page with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or change in full text mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + F . &quot;
&quot; that pull and dra@@ in from pictures , you can place an image in a different part of the Al@@ ben@@ bau@@ ms , about the horizontal partition line or into another application window . the only limitation is not the same picture in terms of keywords , fil@@ en@@ list or addi@@ c@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; - a fil@@ yp@@ ical selection allows you to lift up the most common : JP@@ EG , P@@ NG , T@@ IF@@ F , Ro@@ w , films and audio &quot;
&quot; the filter filter is used only for the fields that is currently displayed in the tool@@ bar , only when this ind it works on the fil@@ en@@ ame only when this ind it will display symbols . which fields are indicated , you can configure in the dialog of aging settings . &quot;
&quot; the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; presents an organized view on your photo tree . these albums were saved according to the folders , in which they were saved on the hard drive , according to the name of their collection in the Al@@ ben@@ ches or after the date , which the album can be changed at the album of the album . &quot;
&quot; if you have set a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . you can also add a screens@@ hot directly to a album . select the album Im@@ por@@ ate screens@@ hot . &quot;
&quot; to copy a picture from an album to another one or move , you can drop the photo with the mouse on the target album and drop it . you can move to the same type as well as multiple photos . just select all the photos and move it to the target album . &quot;
&quot; an album includes a collection of photos and the album properties , allowing you to access information about this collection . to click on the album properties , click on the album and edit the context menu album button . &quot;
&quot; Alb@@ um@@ - Coll@@ ections : are a method to mark your albums , so that you can be group@@ ed by yourself under a common name if you want to add a collection of your photos , if you want to add new collections into collection . if you want to add new collections , you can do this in the settings for collections . &quot;
&quot; Alb@@ um@@ - Date : is used , if you sort your albums by date with view albums sort by date sort . &quot;
&quot; the buttons El@@ t@@ ester , average , neu@@ ester : these put the date on the oldest , the latest image or the passage of the album . to do this , first tries to calculate the average of pictures from their EX@@ IF data . if this fails , instead , the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder . &quot;
&quot; if you first came to an album in &amp; B. , the first picture is selected as a symbol of the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; this will help you remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative , and you might want to select another photo as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to select another photo as an album icon , you must click on the picture with the right mouse button and in the context menu &amp; quot ; As a album &quot; &quot; album &quot; &quot; button . in addition , you can draw the photo to the album in the list to put it as a symbol . &quot;
an album can always be included in a collection and can not be s@@ acked out .
&quot; she came ; supports the input of sampling for individual photos in the area My sampling list left at the main window . album collections have another effect . the collection always includes all the photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
the picture window will provide you the main view of your photos . if you select a album you &apos;ll be displayed in this album in the picture window . each photo will be displayed in a preview . each photo will be displayed with the two Lup@@ ins in the tool@@ bar .
&quot; when you open an album the first time , you &apos;ll just wait while the th@@ umb@@ nails will be generated . this can be avoided in which you can generate all the umb@@ nails . &quot;
&quot; information about each image will be shown below the image preview . what information is , you can change via settings ; you can set up here the albums and adjust the range images to your wishes . &quot;
&quot; the th@@ umb@@ nails have a moment to rest and leave the mouse over a picture . the help shows the main features , including all the keywords of a photo . the screens@@ hot in the section in the main window shows such a help . &quot;
photos are all that I arrived at &amp; B . albums and keywords will allow you to organize your pictures as it fits . you can reach all the functions that comes with &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ation . you can have the choice between the viewing menu of preview or the menu image in the menu bar . you have the choice between the viewing images , a slides@@ how or the processing of the pictures . &quot;
you can open the image editing with a photo by clicking on F@@ 4 image processing ... or the context menu of the image using the right mouse button and editing ... you will find a guide you can edit and change your photos . you can view your photos and change them .
&quot; it may occur that if you come ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by opening the context menu with the right mouse button . here , and how to adjust it to your needs if your program is not en@@ umer@@ ated , you will find information in &amp; k@@ de ; manual . &quot;
&quot; you should note that it can come after processing through other image editing programs . some programs store these data not only if you changed the changed image . thereby , this information is lost from the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , bl@@ ending etc. lost . &quot;
&quot; she came ; puts two ways of rotation . the easiest way is to click on the P@@ review and select Dre@@ ams . in the sub@@ menu , you can indicate the degree of rotation . &quot;
&quot; to change the fil@@ en@@ ame of a photo , you can click on the preview and select F@@ 2 ren@@ aming from the context menu . note that you keep the extension ( .@@ jpg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; when you came a photo from your digi@@ tis@@ ement ; clear , it is del@@ ayed to the mos@@ ses of &amp; k@@ de ; p@@ ayed . f@@ 8 picture Del@@ ete or f if you prefer to delete it , you can use this by using Shi@@ ft ; Det@@ f . &quot;
&quot; the view &amp; quot ; My dat@@ um@@ sli@@ ste@@ quot ; organis@@ es your photos on the data . &amp; digi@@ tization ; used either the EX@@ IF @-@ Date or , if this is not available , the date of the last change of the file . &quot;
&quot; select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be displayed in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the dat@@ ashe@@ et below in the file view , so that you can only see the photos of the selected days . &quot;
photos with keywords provides a flexible and powerful option to organize your photos and cat@@ alog@@ y . tags are sti@@ ckers to be assigned to each photo or whole groups . once a key@@ word was assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this key@@ word or search again . &quot;
&quot; if a key@@ word is selected , all photos , which are marked with this key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; Е@@ т@@ и@@ к@@ е@@ т@@ и : Е@@ т@@ и@@ к@@ е@@ т@@ и : Е@@ т@@ и@@ к@@ е@@ т@@ и : you can also organise your tags log@@ ically . you can also move parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My sampling are , so you can find the tags you &apos;re looking for , easily find . &quot;
&quot; the keywords will be stored in a database for quick access and proven key@@ word in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JP@@ EG , so you can also use your tags in other programs . furthermore , the tags you have noticed while the loss of the database are imported as soon as it came ; the pictures notice . &quot;
&quot; you can add new tags by clicking with right mouse button either on &amp; quot ; My sampling record , or click on an existing key@@ word , and then click on an existing key@@ word after you have cli@@ cked on an existing key@@ word , this is the subject of this key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; you can delete a key@@ word by clicking on the key@@ word ( right mouse button and delete it , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the key@@ word is removed from this photo . &quot;
&quot; you can change the position of a key@@ word by moving it to the desired position in the tree and drop it there . then , a menu that gives you the possibility to move the key@@ word . a key@@ word can be at a time only once in the tree . &quot;

another mode is better suited to print quickly from a photo series . if you are using pa@@ ar@@ wise navig@@ ator from the tool@@ bar to view it in the left @-@ hand side . the right to the right picture is displayed in the right area . this makes it easy to work through a number of similar pictures .
&quot; of course , the normal sol@@ der actions also work straight from the lumin@@ ous as F@@ 4 file editing .... &quot;
all pictures from the right side bar of the main window are available for both umb@@ nails in the lumin@@ ous . this makes it e.g. easy visual differences to link pressure data .
&quot; in the lower end of each area you will find a built @-@ in swing function , which you can find at the crossed arrows . to keep the visible area of the picture , you have to preview it and the &amp; L@@ MB ; pressed in the mode preview then both pictures show the same picture area . &quot;
the zo@@ oming works as well as in other views . simply use the z@@ oom regul@@ ator under the pictures or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel in the picture into the picture and out to zo@@ oming . this happens in both pictures when you see in the mode preview .
&quot; what is a digital component management - apart from the fashion word ? digital survey , each part of the process follows after the picture was taken up until the final issue and permanent storage . each of the photos , sc@@ ans or digital photos saves a form of digital measurement management . most of us make this however not in a systematic and efficient way . &quot;
&quot; we give you a tool , you will find a plan and practical tips as you can secure your pictures . we look at the procedure for digital fot@@ ograph@@ ers the &amp; digi@@ tization ; we see the download , re@@ group@@ ed , re@@ group@@ ed , optim@@ ised , waiting , wait , waiting and export of image files . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Digital component management takes on , inde@@ xed , categ@@ orized , sec@@ ures , transform@@ ers , transform@@ ers and exported content that have a mon@@ eti@@ zation or cultural value . &quot;
&quot; met@@ ad@@ ata are defined as data about data . met@@ ad@@ ata are required in accordance with your definition , information about or documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment . &quot;
&quot; I dare to claim if you find more than 1,000 photos on your computer , then you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you will be sure to save very fast search and secure archiving to which you can access other programs , platforms and formats . &quot;
&quot; the first thing you do and you need to know something in your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . you have to decide whether you want to save it to your photos , whether you want to save it to a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc . note that you will need to switch to a larger drive . &quot;
&quot; maybe you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be found quickly via your location , because you were in one year several times the same place . if you make ample photos , then you will use sub@@ folder as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . export is then a folder for images that you print or publish on a website . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have different requirements such as version@@ ing of photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant access of images on different topics and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % archives and 5 % working files will not want to organize your structure for this content . &quot;
which types of files fit together ? the separation of data types makes the stack @-@ processing easier . separate new from old files .
the separation of original and work@@ files simplified a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derived image .
&quot; we also recommend the met@@ ad@@ ata option in the introduction of met@@ ad@@ ata in &amp; digi@@ tization ; this ensures that Ex@@ if@@ - and IP@@ TC data are written into the file . if you forget this , then you can also save the met@@ ad@@ ata from the database in the files by selecting the appropriate point . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change ? this provides a met@@ ad@@ ata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones . &quot;
&quot; now the real job starts , since you should now select every photo key@@ word , sign@@ ments and a rating . of course , you can choose the same attribute and put the value then . you start the best with the rating or the rank . this makes sense , since you can concentrate on the best photos . &quot;
&quot; now let &apos;s have a keywords , key@@ word how to continue with other programs frequently , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot;
if you import cat@@ alog@@ y pictures from a different source with built @-@ in key@@ word then it will insert it ; automatically the tree for you build b@@ z@@ w the pictures in the right place . the changing key@@ word are done by &amp; digi@@ tization ; updated while the sub @-@ trees were persec@@ uted .
&quot; the graphic shows how different met@@ ad@@ ata is over@@ cutting . this is a very gro@@ ove representation , as each block consists of met@@ ad@@ ata in truth from many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and cal@@ ender data are properties of all pictures . &quot;
&quot; enough of the key@@ word - the next section refers to cap@@ tions or comments , the third important tool for your met@@ ad@@ ata . &quot;
&quot; you want most nobody to see your photos just , you want to share it with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies . you are sure to get interested in your photos . &quot;
&quot; look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a nice beach panorama . if you consider it closer , then catch some details to see people , the place . &quot;
&quot; and now I say to you that of the Lan@@ de@@ platz of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Norman@@ die 60 years after landing is . Wow ! one starts to dream , memories , the historical time span is again present , you might even hear the silence . so the cap@@ tion has completely changed your perception of this panoramic position . &quot;
&quot; for others who consider your photos may be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should show a story . remember , the key is the meaning of the viewer to help Him about the motive that she moves to understand what you understand . &quot;
&quot; it is fine when an image is not perfect , if it &apos;s strength only has to work with a complaint for yourself alone . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ement ; you can export as much text , in an internation@@ alized alphab@@ et ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) , then these sign@@ ments will also be exported to your wishes into the cap@@ tion and / or the titles of the Web @-@ g@@ eri@@ es@@ ystems . you have to tell it a second time that it &apos;s not a second time . &quot;
remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find yourself in another city without navigation system ? was they not a boring planet before Goo@@ gl@@ e@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now already with light speed . &quot;
&quot; the possibilities for the Ge@@ ol@@ oc@@ alization can already be trac@@ eable and will be back in the future . I &apos;m sure that one day , you can easily repeat your journeys through pictures with geographical details . you can also export k@@ ml files as well as G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flick@@ r &amp; etc ; with the Goo@@ gl@@ e@@ Maps spect@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; copy@@ left is a word play with copyright and refers to the practice the copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on distribution and modification of copies . the same freedoms also apply in all modified versions , so also for the works of others . &quot;
the following description tells you what information in the furnishings page comes from &amp; digi@@ tization ; as information should be depos@@ ited :
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should add your name , or the name of the person that have created the photo , e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer , e.g. the name of a company or organisation should not be changed . this field does not support compromise nor sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; author : associated with the author . this field contains the work @-@ drawing of the photographer . examples of this can be the title such as : employee photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or Independent on commercial photographer . since this is a reference to the author &apos;s field , this must be filled out of this . &quot;
&quot; publisher ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the provider to identify who this photo offers . this does not necessarily have to be the author , such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations can be listed here , then the group / Agency will offer the image here . &quot;
&quot; it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although this is no protection against abuse . each of a little more than base knowledge in working with computer can delete or change . the solution to this problem are digital water@@ marks . for individuals , this is very important for the majority of your photos only of low interest . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals this protection is very important . &quot;
the digital water@@ marks per picture is unique . &amp; digi@@ tization ; will be available in the near future such a module for for@@ kli@@ fts .
&quot; topics : PL@@ AT@@ TEN@@ FE@@ H@@ LER , turn@@ outs , electricity violations , ECC , transmission errors , al@@ ment of the storage media , recovery , redund@@ ancy , life @-@ size , temperature , data size , common super@@ sti@@ tions &quot;
&quot; of course , we do not talk about CDs that can happen on the street or a fire . this kind of losses happen to you even in traditional paper pictures or negative . in this section , it is about problems with the so called &quot; New Media . &quot;
&quot; K@@ roll On@@ track , the biggest data re@@ fine company in the world , has some interesting statistics which has a data loss . &quot;
&quot; to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs , they must be treated as well as a couple of years . of course , you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archives . of course , you can also get CDs and DVDs in archives . there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 that is a lifetime of 100 years for themselves . whether you believe it is in your mess@@ aging space . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD discs can be read@@ able , but you can use this risk in which you use good disco@@ s and good recording sessions and they are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write much reliable . it is therefore the right to select . &quot;
&quot; CDs and DVDs are very sus@@ cep@@ tible to errors , even if you have just written . therefore , they use a control mechanism to protect themselves . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for the form@@ atting and check@@ sum . despite this massive protection they are needed by chemical aging , ultr@@ avi@@ ol@@ ettes light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; for faul@@ ty CDs and DVDs there is a favorable program called I@@ so@@ B@@ uster which seems to do wonders for CDs and DVDs . it also runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; it is also not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read the corrupt disk , HDDs , Flash@@ media , USB drives , etc . &quot;
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs appear to win the For@@ mat@@ war against HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six sm@@ al the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8,5 GB . all that has been said to CDs and DVDs also applies to Blu @-@ ray disk .
&quot; slow to burn slow with a good recording of high quality media in an un@@ propri@@ ated format . afterwards , you can check the media with a description , date &amp; author features and afterwards @-@ protected location . don &apos;t forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read this media . &quot;
Disk@@ manufacturers keep your statistics for yourself . their manufacturing facilities include a new disk , but not the data . Google will provide a large field study about the error mechanisms of hard@@ disk drives : dis@@ errors . &quot;
&quot; shortly : dis@@ ks hold on the longest in the temper@@ a range of 35 ° C to 45 ° C . with lower temper@@ amental error , S@@ MAR@@ T may not determine this bug . some of S@@ MAR@@ T probably termin@@ ate these errors . these are particularly legi@@ tim@@ eh@@ ler and publisher . the expected life @-@ time period is between 4 and 5 years . &quot;
&quot; this is just the complete twi@@ light due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also make data loss due to a black@@ out if you saved the files , but these losses can normally be returned without any major problems . &quot;
&quot; while most electrical devices black@@ outs do not cover much , this can cause serious damage . on your computer these anom@@ alies may cause severe damage , complete data loss , hardware @-@ alter@@ ation , pun@@ ched mother@@ boards and other defects . therefore , protect yourself before the un@@ avoidable that leads to a loss of time and money . &quot;
&quot; the most common protection against black@@ points is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that is an integral part of the energy @-@ person , but it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ bar . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should pay attention to the UL 14@@ 49 Standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also pay attention to the protection against light@@ ning and thus protecting the properly connected devices . &quot;
&quot; because an over@@ voltage of each cable can use to your computer , you should consider that also all periods can be connected to your system . some manufacturers will also provide a telephone connection for your mo@@ dem . others provide connectivity options for the co@@ ax@@ ial mo@@ dem and the TV card . &quot;
&quot; if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially developed for not@@ ebooks and therefore also contain the protection for the mo@@ dem . this makes you ideal for travel . &quot;
&quot; while an over@@ voltage protection your system is protected from smaller fluctu@@ ations in the power lines , it will not really help you with a complete cup . even an expression of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in a inter@@ rup@@ tive power supply . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the protection against over@@ tension , these devices can automatically make cordless energy available when a electricity loss occurs . this gives you the opportunity to store your data and running the system again . if you have a US@@ V , then you should be sure that they are the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . in addition , the lifetime of the battery and the attached software is interesting . &quot;
&quot; concern the potential risk , which is exposed to your computer system and compare his security in electricity disorders with the cost of avoiding this . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can be used up to &amp; euro ; 20 cost , A 500@@ W US@@ V can be used as well your computer . at the end you should always remember all the cable before you go to the holiday . &quot;
&quot; Amazon Web Service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple memory service . using the right configuration you can use this as drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to store this as a backup target for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amount of data . &quot;
&quot; they are compared to the HDDs home , however very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 500 . furthermore , you must send the data via the compar@@ atively slow Internet . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the solutions are suitable only as a solution against a local data loss of the most important pictures . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . &quot;
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flick@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are available on photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not get your pictures in full resolution online . for 25 $ per year you get un@@ restricted memory that should be checked in reality . &quot;
&quot; from point of view of data protection are the Web @-@ solutions very safe . transmission errors are automatically generated , thanks to the TCP protocol , and with the big companies included in the supply of a backup and distribut@@ ing memory . thus , they are des@@ ast@@ er@@ sure . &quot;
the diagram illustr@@ ates the elements of the transmission chain in calcul@@ ator . all transmis@@ sions are sus@@ cep@@ tible to transmission errors . the file system z@@ fs and tr@@ fs provide at least the data integr@@ ations between operating system and hard drive .
&quot; the worst thing is that you no one says when a transmission error occurred , not when this happened in your hardware . no one seems to have been destroyed until you have no protection in your computer . no one seems to have thought it in your computer . no one seems to have thought about it . the internet with its TCP protocol is a much more secure data path than that of your computer . &quot;
&quot; un@@ reliable power parts are another source of transmission , as they create inter@@ oper@@ ing within the data flows . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed . &quot;
&quot; even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year . &quot;
Z@@ FS of Sun Mic@@ ros@@ ystems seems to be one of two candidates to deal with turn@@ out errors on low levels and is available under one of the GPL in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it soon is available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows available . read this article in English .
Oracle has launched its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs file system . this is still used in alpha status . it uses the same protective mechanism that is used and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not yet part of the kernel .
&quot; do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss in the not@@ ebook and 46 % at work systems . at not@@ ebooks , the proportion of theft is already 50 % . &quot;
&quot; data loss due to viruses is less common than most of viruses . it leads to a lower damage , as such as theft or new installations ; and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux , has been no longer sight@@ ed for a long time . &quot;
open source file systems are less sus@@ cep@@ tible to data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , travel F@@ s , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to the common file systems . a very good English article can be found here . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investig@@ ating process in a sudden inter@@ ruption during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status will be avoided before the issue was not completely saved before the issue is lost . &quot;
viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss . &quot;
&quot; digital cameras are removed from digital cameras , 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings from fundamental physical borders . it is that the technology is further developed , there is a natural limit for these progress . sensitivity and smoking character@@ ises for all types of light sensors are not far away from this border . &quot;
today cameras are heading towards the 10 Meg@@ api@@ x@@ el@@ sensors . even if this resolution has been too high for comp@@ ac@@ t@@ cameras and high @-@ quality optics are the optim@@ ism for comp@@ ac@@ t@@ cameras . even DSLR cameras have your limit on 10 @-@ 12 Meg@@ api@@ xel . for higher resolution you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
a 750@@ GB disk will get you today for 100 &amp; euro . so you can &apos;t take no other for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are often affected by a plan and test this backup before you make any more dangerous as the rein@@ st@@ allation of your operating system , exchange of plates or the size change of hard drives . &quot;
&quot; suppose you make every day your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a light@@ ening suggests you happiness if the drive was not connected with the moment . &quot;
&quot; a disaster proposes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget passengers : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous for your data . they normally concern a whole room or the entire house . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Des@@ ast@@ er@@ prevention is always a non @-@ local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stairs into the neighboring house , into your office or similar . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of physical separation : as above , is a common reason for a data loss despite secure the panic . if you have a backup which is not immediately available , then you can save the one day . &quot;
complete backup : a complete backup of all the files are supposed to be assured . it is a snap@@ shot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential assurance : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete assurance . generates a complete snap@@ shot of two periods : the complete assurance and of the last difference insurance .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . you can restore the original status at any time after doing so . this backup comes to a version@@ ing system with the exception that it is only down@@ stream and not continued .
r@@ sync is a wonderful small tool that you can set up easily on your machines . in contrast to the script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file formats copied . this happens now and if you want to increase security through ss@@ h .
secure important pictures directly after you stored them on your computer to DVD or other op@@ tic medium .
&quot; this approach lets you discover enough time to discover losses and restore . at the same time you come for a backup but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the working files . at the end , you will have a complete total length of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snap@@ shot for at least one month and a snap@@ shot for each month . any further th@@ inner should be done manually after you have a complete review . &quot;
&quot; topics : met@@ ad@@ ata in the image file stored IP@@ TC information , Associ@@ ated X@@ MP files , original , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ finding images and met@@ ad@@ ata , copy of images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , visibility , ... , use of the internet . &quot;
&quot; with that valuable pictures will survive the next 40 year , that &apos;s about the time span in which you really are interested in you because they are interested in your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be observed : &quot;
&quot; because the future due to your nature is un@@ predic@@ table , all 5 @-@ 8 years should look at and new rate during the time . unfortunately , there is no other option than a certain vig@@ il@@ ance . the less variations you have used in the past , the more easily it is the questions of the future . &quot;
this question should actually be answered by explanations in this document . use and change to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtu@@ alization is nowadays available for everyone . so if you have an old system that is important to read your images and install it on and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
&quot; on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and back@@ ups , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard . stay with open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the specialist for the possibility to change a system in its size . this means always to enlarge .
&quot; we assume that you have planned the scal@@ ability with one and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated record or partition . with * nix systems like &amp; Linux , you can copy this area and move it to a new record : &quot;
&quot; check with the command d@@ mes@@ g , whether your new record was detected by the system , but do not hang it . &quot;
&amp; dollar ; dd if = / dev / s@@ db # source is / dev / s@@ dc / dollar / dev / s@@ dc / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the plate in MB@@ 2.@@ 3 , fat@@ 16 , 32 and rei@@ ser@@ fs &amp; dollar ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of rei@@ ser@@ fs &quot;
open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day does not have any software anymore you can read it . this task is easier by year to year .
&quot; GI@@ F is a proprietary , patented format that disappears from the market . so you should no longer use it . &quot;
P@@ NG was developed as an open source standard developed by GI@@ F . however it can be much more . it is lost by X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC met@@ ad@@ ata . the disadvantage is that there is relative many administrative information but not as many as T@@ IF@@ F needs and a slow Comm@@ pression . this format we would like to make you stor@@ ing your pictures . &quot;
T@@ IF@@ F was widely used as a picture format . T@@ IF@@ F can be stored in un@@ com@@ pressed form or in a container with a lost @-@ free com@@ pression sal@@ g@@ . a problem is however that this format is adapted by many people . there &apos;s more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
DN@@ G The Digit@@ ale Neg@@ ative file format is a licence @-@ free and open feed@@ format that was developed by Adobe Systems . DN@@ G was developed on the T@@ IF@@ F / EP format and is committed to the use of met@@ ad@@ ata . a handful of camera is now available and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon it also sometime .
&quot; this may be one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Metad@@ ata Plat@@ forms . it is a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . the file information will be stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF . &quot;
&quot; many photographers prefer to archive an original of your recording , mostly in raw format , as it saves the met@@ ad@@ ata separately from the image file and the image file will come up and as shown above . therefore , you should consider whether you use DN@@ G as a container and put everything there . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online met@@ ad@@ ata , working on a architecture and modelling , discussions and collaborative work in the D@@ CM@@ I community groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and enlight@@ ening efforts to achieve a broad acceptance of met@@ ad@@ ata standards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import images from the camera , the map reading or the scanner . so long the images on the camera are available , you can use this as temporary backup . &quot;
convert raw files to DN@@ G and save them in your raw archive . this function is not yet implemented .
&quot; for a subtle processing , you can use external programs . if you come back with your pictures again ; edit , then you should add the met@@ ad@@ ata again . these have been cut down by the other programs . &quot;
&quot; protect the edited paintings for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them only in Web@@ gal@@ ries , co@@ de to MPEG , use in contact sheets , print run &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos into a album , you can get a description of how you can add photos that you have already installed on your hard disk . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for import of images to your album database . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; B. , connect them to the PC , turn the camera to the display mode and turn it on . another description can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; when you start the camera interface , it is trying to connect with your camera . if the connection is made , a fer@@ ous -@@ indicator can be displayed on the camera . if this is the case , the fil@@ en@@ ame and a symbol for file arrangement for each file , photos , movies , music etc . on the camera shown . &quot;
&quot; before you download the photos on your computer , you may need to see the camera information on each entry . with the side@@ bars and met@@ ad@@ ata from the camera interface you can see the properties of an entry or met@@ ad@@ ata . &quot;
&quot; this dialog shows file properties and the photo information that is stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer . notice , that with some digital cameras do not have any information available . &quot;
&quot; the rider met@@ ad@@ ata shows the internal met@@ ad@@ ata such as head , manufacturing , GPS etc. the image . this information is the same as with the met@@ ad@@ ata @-@ side@@ bar from the main window of &amp; B. or the image processing . note that these met@@ ad@@ ata are not available at some digital cameras . &quot;
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button . this loads all photos of their camera to a single album in &amp; B. . when downloading the photos are not deleted and we recommend you to check if the pictures were sure to delete the photos from the camera .
&quot; if you do not want to download all the photos , you can only select the desired space method of &amp; none . once you have selected the photos , use the button download and then download it . the button Sel@@ ected is selected as long as you selected , until you selected some photos . &quot;
&quot; if your camera is supported , an option is downloaded new . these pictures were not yet marked by &amp; digi@@ ous . in this case , the new pictures are marked with a star in the previous post . if you choose this option , of course only the new pictures are downloaded . &quot;
&quot; when you download the buttons All download or download it , a dialog will be displayed in which the images are displayed . the list of the existing albums will be sorted as regular folder , displayed in the section My albums . select the target album out of the list and press OK . &quot;
&quot; after you selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; B ; invites the photos from the camera to the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all the button once you want to delete the button . if you just want to delete some of them , so you have to select these first and then delete it off . &quot;
&quot; note that there is no possibility that you have deleted from the camera to restore . the photos are not completely deleted from the camera ; if you want to delete it from the camera ; if you want to delete it from the camera ; if you want to delete it from the camera . if you want to delete it from the camera , as this is much faster . &quot;
cameras use as a fil@@ en@@ ame for the photos often not particularly meaningful names . the file names are usually deleted once again after the photos are deleted from the camera . therefore it may be useful to integrate the date and time in which the picture was made to integrate into the fil@@ en@@ ame .
in the next section you will find options for rotating and mir@@ rors of the picture and for file @-@ based sub @-@ based sub @-@ types . if you use this last option is automatically created a folder per day .
&quot; the options Dur@@ ing the transmission opens three more options that are performed before the pictures are stored on the plate . if you select this , the corresponding additional entries will be copied into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded pictures . &quot;
if you want another date format than the standard format you can use for example in the editing field you can use e.g. in the editing field you can use the option below &amp; time . for further adapt@@ ations you should read the help of the command str@@ f@@ time .
&quot; when you use the camera fil@@ en@@ ame , you have the option to change the fil@@ en@@ ames in small case letters . or in large letters , if you prefer this . &quot;
&quot; the new fil@@ en@@ ame , the &amp; Pres@@ ence came ; for a photo being used , will be displayed below the name that displays the camera in the preview . your settings will be stored and automatically used when you open the camera again next time . &quot;
&quot; she came to perform all the information about the camera &apos;s orientation for the time of recording . not all cameras represent this information . in the section side@@ bar Metad@@ ata you can read more details , about the information that your camera has been embedded in the photo . &quot;
&quot; the automatic rotation is usually switched off , and if your camera does not provide this information , lets the photo over@@ turn the automatic rotation . if you want to switch the automatic rotation , use the button Exp@@ and@@ ed and select the Autom@@ atic rotation in the lower area of the window . &quot;
if your camera is made available via the date where the photo has been made available to download it ; this sub@@ types are based on the picture data . all the cameras can be downloaded in the same sub@@ album . not all cameras make this information available . in the section side@@ bar Met@@ a data you can check out which information your camera could be embedded in the photos .
&quot; this option is usually off @-@ off , and in this case saves &amp; digi@@ ous ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this option , you have to reset this option . use the button @-@ based subtitles at the bottom end of the window . &quot;
the easiest way to upload photos from your computer to your camera is the button . select up@@ loaded dialog box &amp; k@@ de ; appears in which you can select the files that will be up@@ loaded . you can also choose more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
&quot; once the image selection is done , asks &amp; digi@@ ous ; you , where the images are to be loaded highly . a folder of dialog for the camera appears . select the folder and press OK to load the upload . the images will not be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; in this document , GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is meant as a general term in this document . this is a position that is indicated in long@@ it@@ ud@@ inal and l@@ ati@@ tudes and which can be displayed on a map . determining the data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian GL@@ ON@@ AS , the European Galil@@ eo or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional photo@@ grap@@ hen can link it interesting to link a picture with an accurate geographical place . not everyone uses a plane to transfer an area by automatic recording of GPS data to kar@@ to@@ graphic . environmental planners , military , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability . &quot;
&quot; if you have forgotten later , where exactly the photo was done , you can locate a postcard to another &amp; B ; users want to locate the place of the photo , or just want to document this aspect , it &apos;s good the positioning data of a photo . &quot;
&quot; the question is , how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that exi@@ v@@ 2 many GPS data fields , such as the direction , saddle and card refer@@ ral . the question is actually more how the data stored in these fields ? there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the correct hardware , via a post @-@ processing of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical assignment ( manual ) and finally over the manual input of known places . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there is currently no camera integrated with GPS unit . but there are a few that work with GPS receiver . either as cards or by sending the data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;

&quot; downloading the GPS data from a device can be performed with g@@ p@@ sman or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . you have to store this data in the g@@ p@@ x format , since it is the only format that is supported by the module for geographical assignment . &quot;
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract data from pictures and from GPS . on the following page you can make the same under &amp; Linux : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
&quot; if you know the long@@ it@@ ud@@ inal and l@@ ati@@ tudes or other data , then you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ if@@ Tool by Phil Harv@@ ey . it uses the characters used ( e.g. by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle ) . &quot;
&quot; map@@ s.@@ googl@@ e.com show no European road cards . here are some European pages , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe . &quot;
&quot; she came , trying to give you as much control over his work processes as possible . to access these settings , you have to split into the menu settings ; you can set up in eight pages . you can switch between these settings by clicking on the symbols of the left . &quot;
&quot; select action can be set on inline display or picture editing , so you put the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ tization ; fixed , if you click on an entry in the main view . &quot;
&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the Stand@@ ardi@@ zation and the copy@@ legal data . this data is automatically selected in the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields . also in a database synchron@@ ization , these data are used in the IP@@ TC fields . &quot;
&quot; car title is a syn@@ onym for fi@@ denti@@ tion : this field should contain the profession @-@ drawing of the photographer . this can be design@@ ations such as an employee photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . as this is a detailed description of the car field , this must also be filled . &quot;
&quot; editor is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to enter the photo . this does not have to be the author , such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations should be entered here , then the group or agency should be en@@ umer@@ ated here . &quot;
&quot; the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC field . thus , the met@@ ad@@ ata are permanently included in the image and not only available in the database of &amp; digi@@ tization ; these met@@ ad@@ ata are also available to other programs and can be imported , without being lost . &quot;
&quot; image cap@@ tions as embedded accus@@ ations ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JP@@ EG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments that you may be read to your photos , with which in pictures included in the pictures . therefore , your compl@@ ementary text can also be viewed by other images , these are already written by the documents ; over@@ written . &quot;
&quot; the page settings contains all options for the information that appear if the mouse c@@ ursor in the main window on a file rests . depending on the chosen option , this information is displayed or not . &quot;
&quot; # 160 ; digi@@ tization ; supports a number of different image formats and some video formats and audio formats . to determine which date types &amp; audio formats ; to indicate which fil@@ es@@ yp@@ es of this list came , and remove any file in one of these extensions ; Alb@@ um@@ ord@@ ner , which has no one of these extensions , and ignored . &quot;
&quot; the default settings you can reset again , by pressing the button Ref@@ res@@ h to the right of each category . &quot;
&quot; the settings of the lumin@@ ous of &amp; digi@@ tization ; can be placed on this page on the default values , however , if you can then use the lumin@@ ous mode . some pictures have different sizes and the syn@@ ch@@ rone mode . if you have one , then you can only get better results . &quot;
&quot; by default , the image editing a black background behind the shown photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select this one . you can switch the tool@@ bar when you use the image processing in full screen mode . &quot;
over@@ - and sub@@ str@@ ated areas of an image can be marked with dar@@ ker and bright color in the picture . these colors will be specified here . in the image editing of this picture mode can be switched on with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
&quot; with Chro@@ ma Sub@@ sampling is meant that the images can be coded in a higher resolution of lumin@@ ance than in the color formations . please read this article in Wikipedia about the closer explanation . &quot;
&quot; with the setting P@@ NG com@@ pression , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation is not dimin@@ ishing the image quality since P@@ NG requires a lost @-@ free algorith@@ m . if you have a quick computer , you can put this value on a high com@@ pression . this means 1 : a low and 9 a high com@@ pression . &quot;
&quot; with the option T@@ IF@@ F files com@@ press , you can switch the default version for T@@ IF@@ F images . this reduces the size of the T@@ IF@@ F images . it does not affect the quality of the image quality as the Def@@ end algorith@@ m @-@ free works . &quot;
&quot; with the setting loss of loss of JP@@ EG @-@ 2000 files you can be able to save it freely . even if you were written the de@@ duc@@ tible setting , the relationship between quality loss and file size was far better than in normal JP@@ EG . as this paragraph , met@@ ad@@ ata was not yet supported , but was in the planning . &quot;
in previous versions of &amp; Pres@@ ence ; the image editing only one image for photos . currently it develops very quickly to a tool for mani@@ p@@ ulation of your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of the image processing .
&quot; the default level is that all green pixels are equal . if the straight @-@ up green pixels of the C@@ CD sensor is created when you use this option , solve this problem with a minimum loss of details . this option marks the image a little soft , elimin@@ ates this distinction with a minimum loss of details . this option marks the image a little soft , eliminated with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method . &quot;
&quot; if this option is set , the white balance is used in the camera . otherwise , if set , the automatic paint balance is used . &quot;
&quot; this setting is only used when the white balance is not set . standard is it a fixed color balance , which was photographed on a white card that is photographed in sunlight . &quot;
&quot; this setting is supported only for fu@@ ji Super C@@ CD SLR cameras . the use of the second sensors has received the effect that under@@ lined images in four steps , more details will be ignored in the nickname . for other cameras this option will be ignored . &quot;
&quot; the default it is the nickname , so the parts of your pictures are burned down , due to the in@@ ability of your camera to consider the top color . the setting of colors create some failed outcomes , because they can try out some parts of the missing information from the nickname . &quot;
&quot; this is possible because blue pixels in general are not so fast s@@ add@@ ling like green and red . and d@@ ging , therefore try the missing green and red shares from the still not saturated blue pixel . of course , this is a question how much color or white you want . &quot;
&quot; when you select the option , you get the possibility to put a level . here is a value of three a compromise and can be customized for each image individually . &quot;
put the L@@ umin@@ aire according to your taste . you probably have to put it somewhat higher than the standard 1 . but this can also be done later in the images of the &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ation . in order to keep the time for the Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing small , you should be conservative . &quot;
&quot; a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorith@@ m is a digital image process to reck@@ on a complete picture of the particle data , which displays many cameras and have known a matrix colored pixel . this algorith@@ m is also known as CF@@ A @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation or color construction . &quot;
&quot; and D@@ cra@@ w came to you three alternatives : Bil@@ in@@ ear , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dient ) was the first algorith@@ m that was used by me . Bil@@ in@@ ear is interesting if you are looking for a quick fix with an acceptable result . &quot;
if you know the colour vari@@ ance of your l@@ enti@@ ls you can use the red and blue @-@ proof values here . this is certainly the best method for a colour@@ ing correc@@ tions as you performed during the raw converter .
&quot; a profile translated into color information and can be given instructions as these are given again . there are also L@@ CMS and digi@@ tis@@ ement , information such as the color information from a Far@@ br@@ aum in the other , therefore the colors are as accurate as possible . &quot;
behavior issues when a picture is opened in image processing / color @-@ administration system with raw files .
&quot; see the folder here , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , in which you save all your profiles . &quot;
settings of ICC profiles have the possibility &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to be depos@@ ited . everything can change when opening the blank file later .
the colour@@ ing view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your images colored not the whole screen .
the input profiles should be made to the camera maker and model that you use . not all profiles are provided on the same way . currently corrected d@@ cra@@ w gam@@ ma not for con@@ versions at 16 bit depth . this means that you have to perform the colour @-@ tone yourself .
&quot; there are other options like the soft @-@ proof profile , with which you can em@@ ulate as your printer can be given back as your printer and some colors therefore very saturated . this could be correct , rather than on the blind algorith@@ m of your printer . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras , it is quite obvious that color profile is provided with them for which is . unfortunately not in the models of Canon . therefore , here follows a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is of course un@@ officially : &quot;
&quot; the Canon profiles can detect the style for the goal : F for an accurate style , L for landscapes , N for Neutr@@ al , P for portrait and S for the standard style . &quot;
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; image Plugin interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; sculp@@ ting and image work@@ ings are supported ; many modules support which have been written to cooperate with every program , which supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface . &quot;
&quot; if your distribution has the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select which you want to use , and these are then loaded by &amp; digi@@ ous ; loaded , these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition you will find some also in the context menu of the preview . &quot;
&quot; short @-@ command for tasks , which are carried out by modules , can set in the menu under settings of short command . &quot;
further information ( in English ) via K@@ IP@@ I @-@ modules can be found on the K@@ IP@@ I project at http : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the hand@@ books of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
&quot; the settings of the slides@@ how should be easy to understand . the upper shelf l@@ ends the time between the pictures , usually are 4 @-@ 5 seconds well . the other An@@ cross @-@ fields turn off the met@@ ad@@ ata or off , which ends at the bottom of the pictures during the display . &quot;
&quot; the camera properties show on the left side a list of all currently supported cameras . on the right there is a button Autom@@ atic detection , which is trying to identify a camera which is connected to the computer . currently , here are serv@@ ings , US@@ B@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the end you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wi@@ re@@ - ( IEE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) , this field will only have selected the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / remo@@ vable , indicate where you attach your camera . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ement ; to use , you must connect the camera with your computer to put it into the display mode . &quot;
&quot; Pro@@ bi@@ ere you out , whether or digi@@ ous ; the camera automatically recogni@@ zes . if not , you can set Cam@@ amo@@ del and port manually . after you have set your camera , your camera will appear in the menu camera . &quot;
&quot; you can select any type of name for your camera . this will be displayed in the menu cameras of the main window . if you own more than one camera , you can insert it here . &quot;
&quot; with the option of confirmation dialog for the moving of &gt; Pictures , you can display the conversation of &amp; le ; when delet@@ ing a photo in an album . in the sections delet@@ ing a photos and delete an album you will find more details . &quot;
&quot; the editorial changes through the right side bar can be tac@@ kled by the right side bar , if you use the option to apply changes in the right side bar without any queries . otherwise , you will need to apply changes to the button . &quot;
you can also under@@ go the display of the welcome image of &amp; digi@@ ous ; at the starting point , this speeds up the starting process of &amp; digi@@ tization . &quot;
&quot; the setting up after new photos are forcing &amp; digi@@ tization ; the base folder after new or deleted albums / photos . this extends the starting time of &amp; digi@@ tization ; if something came out of the base folder , asks &amp; digi@@ tization ; you whether it shall delete these from the database . &quot;
various colors schem@@ as can be used in &amp; Pres@@ ence ; used to adjust the main window to suit your tastes . these settings can be selected under settings design out of the tool@@ bar . a preview of the available designs will be raised below :
these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for your digi@@ tization ; find more information about it in this tutorial .
&quot; she arrived ; contains a fast image editing with some basic tools . you can use them to view your photos and correction and improvement . the image editing can be started by a click with the left mouse button of the preview of a picture or via the context menu of preview , advertisement / editing menu . &quot;
the image editing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ ous ; therefore they are not part of your distribution . for more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules you can set up in the image processing .
&quot; a status line at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current date number , magni@@ fying factor and the current image size indicates . &quot;
a menu bar at the top edge and below the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most common functions .
&quot; the processing functions of the image editing changes your photos . however , any of the functions will change the original photo before you save the file saving or the button save from the tool@@ bar . note that you can no longer recover the original photo once you saved the image . &quot;
so you should possibly create a copy of your image before you change it . this can be saved with file Save as well .
&quot; as long as you have not saved the photo , you can re @-@ use the original image by connecting from the menu or button re@@ manufacture the button editing in the tool@@ bar . you will lose any change that you have performed in the photo since the last stor@@ ing . &quot;
nearly every action of the image processing can be und@@ et@@ ected or restored . the last action you can und@@ o by clicking on and re @-@ re@@ produced by selecting editing from the menu .
&quot; if you often use this , you should make yourself the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ z for return , and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Um@@ sch@@ alt @-@ Z to re @-@ establish . &quot;
&quot; if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; in the tool@@ bar a moment longer press , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu items , all actions are also und@@ o and restored respectively . &quot;
&quot; once you have started the image editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same key@@ word by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , image high , image r@@ als or the entries in the menu file , you will be asked if you want to store this . &quot;
you can in the photo and out zo@@ oming in which you use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or the symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the safest menu .
&quot; to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : enlar@@ ging factor automatically choose &quot;
&quot; view Full Mode shows the photo in full text mode . you &apos;ll also appear in the normal view , in which you use the es@@ c button . normally , you can view this in the creation of dialog from &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ement ; change this you can view this in the creation of dialog box ; change this window , you can view the section on the installation of the image processing . &quot;
&quot; if you want to print the current image , you can select the image below and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; Print@@ dialog . you can custom@@ ize the settings before you print your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the main menu , you can print single images or whole phrases . whole images can be printed out of your selection . you just need to select the pictures with the default methods and select from the menu album , export printing assist@@ ent . if you follow the wiz@@ ard , you just need to make your choice . &quot;
&quot; the next window has a side bar at the right edge , which displays important information and promotions for the selected images . the same side bar is available without the navig@@ ation@@ ist , even in the image processing , it is displayed as one of the five tab is cli@@ cked : &quot;
&quot; multiple , click on the same tab lets the side bar appear or disappear again in the edge . &quot;
&quot; in the compl@@ ementary view you can type of cap@@ tions with unlimited size or insert . note that the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are permitted in the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC@@ - fields , so that you can be used by other programs . &quot;
the IP@@ TC data only support ASC@@ II characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are formed after 2000 characters and are shaped by special characters . if you want to use the IP@@ TC marking field in other applications , you should be aware of these restrictions . &quot;
&quot; after you comment , use either the button or simply switch to the next image , the sign@@ ments will then be saved . &quot;
&quot; besides the use @-@ button there is a button More . with this you can read further met@@ ad@@ ata from the selected file or database . however , you can also write the met@@ ad@@ ata to the files . this will always be done if you have chosen a met@@ ad@@ ata setting , which always will be written into the pictures . &quot;
the rating rating shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in Su@@ chen and sor@@ ti@@ ments . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut . to evaluate multiple images at the same time , select this out and use the context menu . &quot;
the assessment will be written in the IP@@ TC field . the coding follows the diagram in the following table :
&quot; the sampling shows a search box to the fil@@ tering of the key@@ word , the sampling tree and a selection box with the previously mentioned in this &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ation ; -@@ session of the key@@ word . &quot;
the sampling tree is dynam@@ ically adapted to the specified key@@ word . you can limit the number of possibilities in search of a key@@ word quickly . this ability is particularly useful when you have a lot of keywords .
&quot; the input field at the bottom end is a further relief in the input of keywords in a picture series . if you have entered different key@@ word , these are stored for quick access . &quot;
key@@ word can also be set by Select the appropriate an@@ cross fields in the tree . all tags of an image are stored in the IP@@ TC field key@@ word .
&quot; when multiple images are selected in the main window and select a key@@ word in the sampling tree , this is only applied to the up@@ scale image and not applied to the entire selection , if you want a selection with a key@@ word , please read the section key@@ word filter . &quot;
&quot; the side@@ bar sampling is used to change the selection of the images shown in the main window . normally , the left side bar with their album , - fil@@ um@@ - , key@@ word and search views are used . if in addition one or more sampling are used from the right side , only the cut @-@ up of these two are displayed . all of the keywords are available . &quot;
&quot; you can also drag and drop it . suppose you have already chosen in the main window to provide you with sampling . if the key@@ word already exists , you can simply drag it out of the right side bar and then enter a dialog you ask if you want to put the key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; in the upper example , the main window shows the pictures on a calendar day . the sampling is reduced to one calendar day . they were selected using Str@@ g + a , and after that a key@@ word from the right sampling is drawn and stored there . a dialog asks if this key@@ word should be set . &quot;
this search for changes takes place during each start of the program . you can also be switched on settings as well .
&quot; if you have a rule with and created and notice that it would be one or , you can change it easily with a double @-@ clicking on the text and in the control area . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : the entry in which the database is sought . this can be an album , name , key@@ word , image , key@@ word , etc . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string , which is already set in the database . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can set a Ex@@ tended search across all elements of the database with the following options : &quot;
&quot; if you want to group options , you only need the cross box at the end of the rule and then use the button group@@ ing . the options then look like follows : &quot;
why were Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Flick@@ r not listed ? the free space place is limited there on 1 GB and you will not want to store the images in the full resolution .
this article / tutorial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I found it mainly on &amp; digi@@ tization ; s concrete implementation .
&quot; the reason why you use a colour@@ ful work@@ flow , that is the colors that you have photographed or sc@@ anned colors . with a colored workout flow , you can reach that the colors on your monitor are using your camera or scanner same and that the colors you print or in the web publish them from your digital dark@@ room . &quot;
&quot; if the theme comes to color management , everyone wants to know which buttons it does not need to provide adequate background information on color management work@@ flows . additionally , the sense of this tutorial is to provide you with deeper information to make your own informed choices so that you get the desired results . &quot;
&quot; if your image work@@ flow meets all of the criteria listed below , then you don &apos;t have to take care of color management . &quot;
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum . ( further information can be found below )
&quot; your only other images are sent by e @-@ mail or the web , where s@@ R@@ GB of de @-@ facto standard is . &quot;
so when s@@ R@@ GB works so well and life for everyone is so easy to use why one should then use another color @-@ room and therefore have to worry about color @-@ alt@@ ed .
&quot; a visual example of the Lim@@ itation of s@@ R@@ GB compared to the colors we can really see below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hu@@ by region , and the colors in the s@@ R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum , the tri@@ angular region . &quot;
&quot; if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ R@@ GB with some larger farms , so visit Bruce Lin@@ d@@ blo@@ oms excell@@ ente page and then click on info and then on Information About R@@ GB Working Sp@@ aces . &quot;
do I have to calibr@@ ate my monitor when I decided to work just in the s@@ R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum ?
&quot; yes ! whether you work in the s@@ R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum or not , you need to work your monitor k@@ alli@@ bri@@ ghter , since s@@ R@@ GB closes the circle . if you are working as in the Far@@ br@@ aum of s@@ R@@ GB , then you need to use either your monitor on the s@@ R@@ GB standard calibr@@ ation , an appropriate monitor profile or both . &quot;

&quot; this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions , which can improve an image in most cases . therefore , use it before you try further manual processing . &quot;
&quot; the functions norm@@ alize the same , automation ab@@ equal and contrast extend from the menu of Cor@@ rigi@@ d Autom@@ atic correction automatically try out of your colors the best . you will have to experiment with these effects , to see which is best in your photo . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize : this method scal@@ ert the leu@@ ka@@ emia over the entire image , so the dark@@ est point black and the bright@@ est point is as bright as possible without its colour sh@@ ady . this function is often a magnetic correction for pictures that are dark or well @-@ grown . &quot;
&quot; same : this method j@@ us@@ ks the lumin@@ osity of the colors of the selected image , so that the hist@@ o@@ grams of the intensity is as flat as possible . this makes it a very powerful operation in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it also produces just tr@@ ash . it is a very powerful surgery , which causes either wonders in a picture or it destro@@ ys it destroyed . &quot;
&quot; automatic shut@@ ters : this method maxim@@ izes the color range in the red , green and blue channel . you will find the dark and bright bor@@ dering tones and j@@ us@@ ks the red , green and blue @-@ channels on the complete hist@@ o@@ grams . &quot;
&quot; contrast : this method improves the contrast , and the lumin@@ osity of the R@@ GB values of an image by the shifting of the lowest and highest values in between . this is only visible in well @-@ balanced images and can be a good correction for poor photos . &quot;
the whit@@ eboard is equal to &amp; Pres@@ ence ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white @-@ comparison of a photos .
&quot; the white @-@ equal correction is something limited as over a Far@@ br@@ aum with 8 @-@ bit each colour , so if you can perform too far from the original image . if you can perform the white balance in the blank mode , which in 16 @-@ bit mode , your ways of correction are better . &quot;
&quot; this tool is based on a white @-@ equivalent sal@@ d , which is copy@@ right@@ ed by P@@ aw@@ el T. Jo@@ ch@@ ym . they start him via the menu @-@ type color white balance sheet . &quot;
the board can be adjusted in size . on the left are the original image as well as the preview of the target picture . preview is dynam@@ ically to see the original pieces of the tool . if you want to see the original white un@@ equal , then it &apos;s enough to click on the sub @-@ window . &quot;
the preview of the target pictures has a red mark@@ er . the L@@ umin@@ ous of the pix@@ els under this mark@@ er is shown as vertical line in the hist@@ og@@ ram .
&quot; on the right up , a hist@@ og@@ ram is displayed , as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ o@@ grams is very helpful , even in well illuminated images , most of the pixels have very small L@@ umin@@ aire levels . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ous . &quot;
the contrast of your result depends on shadows , satur@@ ation and gam@@ ma . the shadow of judicial system lets you improve your photos or even download . &quot;
&quot; to play An@@ stat with the above controls , you should use the color temperature @-@ Pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then connect somewhere to the image to calculate the color temperature of the white balance . this way , the temperature and green levels are automatically set . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can set the white drop @-@ off with the list of pres@@ ets . the following settings are available : &quot;
the over@@ se@@ aling indic@@ t@@ ator increases the colors when more than a color canal of the pixel is over@@ exposed .. it will display the combined result in the white balance sheet . this will be displayed as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the buttons Save as and shop make exactly this . any h@@ iring of the white balance you can have set it into a text file and later upload again .
the button settings puts all the filter values back on their default values and the associated neutral white balance . note that even neutr@@ ale settings are a different picture of your original . if you save it the original image will be changed .
&quot; you can adjust here the Ko@@ di@@ lig@@ atory per color canal of the be@@ processed image . 8 @-@ bit Ko@@ d@@ ations is better suited for high @-@ quality images . this coding also requires more record , calcul@@ ating time and stands for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , T@@ IF@@ F and DN@@ G . &quot;
&quot; this tool opens the same dialogue as to the processing of raw materials . it uses the change and assignment of color @-@ fil@@ tering . color setting can be performed by the sub @-@ window instructions for the use of color @-@ fil@@ tering , you can rate the chapter color management . &quot;
&quot; another important tool is available in the menu under colors clay correc@@ tions . this tool provides an integrated way to save multiple color channels at the same time . this is useful when your camera or your scanner always need the same mistakes and you can always need the same correction . in the manual for the key correction , you will find further information . &quot;
a very powerful way to correct ins@@ ure problems is the tool for gr@@ ad@@ ation that you can find under colors gr@@ ad@@ ation in the menu .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ ous came ; tool Far@@ be@@ els puts you four color effects , a solar fl@@ yers , a ne@@ on @-@ effect , a ne@@ on @-@ effect and a cant@@ onal filter . &quot;
&quot; in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ ization , was also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , a effect of which was created when one made a partially developed pressure from a short flash . this was the effect that the bright@@ ening areas dar@@ ker and the colors caused by the second ill@@ um@@ ination . the result was a partial neg@@ ative of the picture . this tool permits you to make this interesting effect fine . &quot;
&quot; the intensity controls the solar power . at approx . 50 % intensity shows the image what chem@@ ically possible is . a further increase will finally create a negative image , that so not to be done on Fot@@ op@@ ap@@ ir . &quot;
this is an example of solar cells . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and processed the ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is at 30 % .
the Vi@@ vid filters simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from a satur@@ ation that he makes a stronger contrac@@ tion that makes the colors brilliant and smooth . try it easy to em@@ bell@@ ert a lot of photos .
&quot; Vel@@ via is the brand name for one on day@@ light optim@@ ised dy@@ at@@ ure@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth picture structure . Vel@@ ocity offers greatly saturated color , but also some photographs , especially those who are hardly matched landscapes . &quot;
&quot; the ne@@ on@@ filter si@@ simul@@ ates Ne@@ on@@ light on the contr@@ asts . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the sli@@ der repeti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on@@ light . in large images , the filter can rech@@ arge the entire CPU for a moment . &quot;
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not un@@ common that you can correct the color double and the lumin@@ osity of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . all your p@@ ups can be displayed in the menu under colors . once you are happy with the result you are using the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
if you can make a photo with bad light conditions you can get the reverse problem : one too great satur@@ ation . even in this case the tool is for brightness / satur@@ ation instead of raising them . all changes you can perform in the preview . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
&quot; between the complex tool gr@@ ad@@ ation and the simple lumin@@ osity / contrast / gam@@ ma is the tool key @-@ correction to improve the exposure . even if the dialog to this tool is very complicated , you need to explain the area of the sli@@ der . concrete the three sli@@ der below the hist@@ o@@ gram@@ ms . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graph of the intensity values , a hist@@ o@@ grams of the active channel , or the selected section . under the graphs are three sli@@ der into which , the left side represents the dark and the right side represents the bright areas . &quot;
the easiest way to learn the operation is to move to the Reg@@ ulators and to take care of how the image changes .
&quot; on the right , the original and preview of the picture can be seen as dynamic , updated by the settings of the picture . on the left , the following options are available . &quot;
&quot; sc@@ aling : with this drop box can be adjusted , whether the hist@@ o@@ grams with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y axis is often displayed . for pictures of a constant color , the linear hist@@ o@@ grams of a single pillar is dominated by a single pillar . in this case , the logical hist@@ o@@ grams of a single pillar is beneficial . &quot;
&quot; three shelves : the top for the dark ones , the middle for the bright notes , and the lowest for the middle notes , frequently Gam@@ ma@@ ths . &quot;
&quot; the three shades can be used in the original image of the original picture , in order to detect the input values of the shadow , middle and bright tones automatically . in addition , there is a button for a fully automatic regulation . &quot;
output levels : the output levels allow the selection of manual values for every area . there are also two shelves which can be used to modify the output values . for example , the com@@ pression of output values can be used as background to create something else in the foreground . &quot;
automatically : with this button the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the picture .
&quot; save as well as loading : with these buttons , the added values are stored in the file system and later loaded again , the Gimp Levels format is used . &quot;
&quot; if you use this mode and the three colour pi@@ p@@ ets , the input values will automatically be used for all shadows , means and Sundays . activate the shades of the original image to set the input values of the hist@@ o@@ grams for Rot@@ - , green@@ - , Blue and the L@@ umin@@ aire channels . &quot;
&quot; the option of over@@ se@@ aling Indi@@ c@@ ator controls all color channels , to display over@@ se@@ ated pixel and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , that means you get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s not a effect in the final result . &quot;
&quot; below you can see an example of the judicial system values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and Alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left side , half of the origin@@ als and the target picture is displayed . preview is dynam@@ ically depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available : &quot;
modifications to the channel : this selection box allows the channel to be modified by the module :
&quot; in addition to this box there are two symbols to switch between a linear and log@@ ari@@ th@@ ine view , mostly the linear mode is the most linear mode of the most linear mode . in this case , the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode also helps the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mix mode . &quot;
&quot; if you move for example a cur@@ v@@ ator to the right , for example the bright notes , then you can see that these bright tones with dar@@ ker output buttons and that the corresponding pixel pixel will become dar@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; the preview of the original pictures is a red mark@@ er to see . if you want to change this mark@@ ings in the area you want to change , the original line is shown on the curve , which is worth the original . create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value after your taste . &quot;
save as well as loading : with these buttons you can make exactly this . each corner you can have created this file system will be stored and later loaded . the file format is the Gimp Cur@@ ven@@ format .
&quot; if you want to create this method and the three colour pi@@ p@@ ies -@@ buttons automatically create the check@@ points of the shaft , middle and sun @-@ tones . activate the colour pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click on the original picture to set the check@@ points for the red , green , blue and L@@ umin@@ anz@@ kur@@ ve . &quot;
&quot; the option of over@@ se@@ aling Indi@@ c@@ ator controls all color channels , to display over@@ se@@ ated pixel . if in more than one channel , you get the combined result now , you get the effect only in preview and it &apos;s not a effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a black @-@ white photo that was corrected in the L@@ umin@@ anz@@ Channel . Sch@@ atten@@ - and Sundays was applied with the colour pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the cur@@ ves . the original picture is ( 1 ) and correc@@ tive ( 2 ) .
the channel mix@@ er of the &amp; digi@@ tization ; image editing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the shades of the photos .
the channel mix@@ er is another highly developed tool to mix the shades of the images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel mix@@ er of the image editing .
with the Kan@@ al@@ ight box you can select the color for the hist@@ o@@ grams : this gives you a first reference how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash . the left area of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed as compared to their own rider .
&quot; the preview of the target picture has a red mark@@ er . if you position this in the picture , a vertical line appears in the hist@@ og@@ ram to show you the appropriate level . &quot;
the controls for the module are right below : regul@@ ator for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you are also able to activate the appropriate color components . this is particularly practical if you also have the appropriate color components , since the channel mix@@ er then DAS tool for creating great black @-@ white conver@@ ti@@ ments of your photos . try to reduce the green canal for black @-@ white portraits . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially when you mix Monoch@@ rom , the reduction of a color leads to a visible smo@@ other that looks at the same place in the color canal and whose smoke is different in each channel differently . if that is the case you can improve your Monoch@@ rome conversion , in which you can reduce the far@@ ewell first . &quot;
the stor@@ ing and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any bl@@ ender setting can save you for later and then load file format is the Gimp channel mix@@ er format .
&quot; the option of over@@ se@@ aling Indi@@ c@@ ator controls all color channels , to display over@@ se@@ ated pixel and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , that means you get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s not a effect in the final result . &quot;
below you can see a picture in which the blue channel is rest@@ ful . the option L@@ umin@@ ous preserve is activated . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography has always been intri@@ gu@@ ing because of your abstr@@ action . with the development of digital photography is black / white a work@@ step as color images can be converted to the computer . also with a set of film roll@@ ers profiles .
&quot; Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3200 , Il@@ ford FP@@ 4 Plus , Il@@ ford Pan@@ F Plus , Il@@ ford Pan@@ F Plus , Il@@ ford X@@ P2 Super
green filters : simul@@ ates a black / white fil@@ tering with a green Lin@@ sen@@ filter . this looks good at all scenarios and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky . therefore similar to the 00@@ 4 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) Grün@@ filter .
orange @-@ fil@@ ter : simul@@ ates a black / white film@@ strip with a or@@ angen Lin@@ sen@@ filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and air pictures . so similar to the 002 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) Oran@@ ge@@ e . &quot;
rot@@ ect : simul@@ ates a black / white film@@ strip with a red Lin@@ sen@@ filter . this creates a dramatic Ascension effect and can simul@@ ate lun@@ ar time . so similar to the 00@@ 3 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) Rot@@ filter .
Gel@@ at@@ filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film@@ strip with a yellow Lin@@ sen@@ filter . this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) joints .
Sep@@ i@@ aton : produces hot bright and middle tones . this is very similar to the process of expression of a print and the re@@ development in a Sep@@ i@@ at@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and thus similar to the 005 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
&quot; with the &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ement ; tool texture , you can apply decorative textures to an image . &quot;
&quot; adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color picture or not , you can look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points , or as a wall image on a wall . the menu @-@ application image can be used for it . &quot;
Rel@@ ief : move this parameter to the right increases the face of the depth and three @-@ dimension@@ ality of texture in the image .
a paper textiles is used on the photo below . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) . the parameter Rel@@ ief has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; Pres@@ ence ; tool frames can add a decorative frame to add a picture .
the eye of an observer in the limits of a picture is not easy task . a way to keep its attention is to set the picture a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the emerging eye . below picture frame can add the module from the image processing .
&quot; type : with this parameter , you place the desired Rah@@ mental type for your image . thoroughly um@@ ented the picture with a coloured line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce , there , with a nice tri@@ dimensional frame of the ideal for a button and decorative adds a decorative frame with patterns . &quot;
width : indicates the width of the frame in percent . the value range for the width is from 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; that with the frame the frame image will be larger than the original , but the same side @-@ ratio will have the same aspect ratio . this is important for the print of images , especially if you cut the tool after page ratio . &quot;
&quot; with this practical tool , you can easily insert a form@@ ated text into an image in any one place . this also goes to several places if you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . simply type the text and place it with the mouse . use text editor , orientation , color from the color tree and the character set . you &apos;ll be the bigger picture , the larger needs the character set . at the end , you simply need a frame around the text and / or a half @-@ clear background . already , the picture is ready . &quot;
&quot; any setting , which you chose for your text may be changed , until you press the button &quot; OK &quot; after the image is saved , the text is part of the picture . it can no longer be changed . &quot;
with the &amp; digi@@ tis@@ one ; tool St@@ ones you can apply a sten@@ cil via an image .
the menu image sten@@ cil uses in the image processing can be used to place sten@@ cils via an image .
&quot; for the sten@@ cil there are no restrictions on the size and orientation . however , you need to use the P@@ NG file size and should also be able to add an e @-@ mail in English to the &amp; digi@@ ous database , send an e @-@ mail in English to the &amp; digi@@ tization ; mail@@ ing@@ list digi@@ came @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .. &quot;
&quot; if you use this tool for the first time , you need to put your sten@@ cil with the button @-@ folder with the button @-@ folder in dialogue . choose the folder in which you copied the template into the template . these settings will be run for the next start . &quot;
after the Wur@@ zel@@ ord@@ ner was set for the sten@@ cils of a building that reflects the folder structure of the template &apos;s folder . the selection of a folder updates the pres@@ ch@@ marking of the sten@@ cils automatically .
&quot; under the preview , there are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fying factor and the position of your image . &quot;
enlarge : this button enlarged the image below . it is centered to the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse kno@@ b .
reduced the button : this button crus@@ hed the picture . it is to apply the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the sten@@ cil to the entire image , you have to check the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse kno@@ b . &quot;
move : use this button to move the picture under the sten@@ cil picture . take the image and place it at the desired position .
use OK when you want to apply the sten@@ cil to your image . the picture will then be adapted automatically to the image size .
&quot; she came , makes three different tools available for grinding . each of you has advantages in other areas . &quot;
&quot; shar@@ pen@@ ed is a traditional tool for grinding . it is very fast and easy , but especially in dark areas , gran@@ ting pictures . &quot;
&quot; Un@@ ti@@ fe @-@ mask works on the contrast of the edges to look inside a picture . in fact , it is not a bit , it works more psychological Dun@@ st and it makes it a really good job . the algorith@@ m was taken from Gimp and he is copy@@ right@@ ed by Win@@ ston Chang . &quot;
&quot; Ref@@ ok@@ us@@ ds may be the best of the three , since he really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its use and has different parameters for adjustment . &quot;
photos without focus as well as most digital pictures require a correction of the sharp@@ ness . this in turn leads to a color point . this in turn leads to a common color . this same phenomenon can be observed if color points are printed on paper . SLR cameras require usually more detri@@ mental than normal cameras for the private user .
&quot; in JP@@ EG @-@ images , a camera is often applied in the case . images in the pipe @-@ format must always be shar@@ pen@@ ed during the processing . &quot;
&quot; some scanner turn a sharp@@ ness already during the reading of the picture . if you dis@@ able these de@@ activate , you get control of your image . &quot;
&quot; in some situations , you can get usable results by shar@@ pen@@ ing a photo with the shar@@ pen@@ ing work@@ book . this can call you using the menu @-@ application basket . &quot;
&quot; but you should hereby handle carefully , since the results are not very natural : the worst technique increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also increases the smo@@ ker technology to shar@@ pen@@ ing a picture , you can find more information and a comparison of all techniques for grinding . &quot;
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too scar@@ ce . the solution to draw the image a little soft to draw . use the tool for soft marks with the menu output cor@@ rigi@@ d soft and experiment with settings . the curtains on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter bl@@ ender is a very good tool to remove v@@ eil from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
&quot; the original image and the preview can help you edit the image , which shows the output of the filter with the current settings . &quot;
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often produce good results and should first improve the effect . an increase in the radius or the amount reinforce the effect . if you make the in@@ sharp@@ ness mask is too strong , rough@@ ness and the impression of gr@@ ats in the proximity of sharp edges . &quot;
the radius is how many pixels are affected on each side of a edges by the filter . high resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . you should therefore find pictures best in their final resolution .
the amount provides the percentage between the original and the wis@@ ely picture one that is added to the original . thus the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
&quot; the swelling is a rup@@ ture from the maximum R@@ GB value and to apply differential amount . it can thus be applied as a minimum change between the tones of shar@@ pen@@ ing , except and therefore beautiful error in faces , directions and water surfaces . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of bl@@ ur@@ red lifting filter . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and the processed image the ( 2 ) . bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ k@@ ieren has been applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a weak@@ ening = 0.0 . &quot;
the &amp; Pres@@ ence came ; tool Ref@@ ok@@ us@@ tici@@ ze re@@ focuss@@ ed an image by enhancing the sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ right@@ ed filter algorith@@ m of Ernst Li@@ ppe .
&quot; this tool tries to move an image to &amp; quot ; in which it makes the defi@@ ance . it uses a technique called F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ tering . it is using a technique called F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ ming . you can start using a technique called F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ ming . you can boot it from the menu by using colors Ref@@ ok@@ us@@ se in the image processing .
&quot; in practice the circular F@@ altung works much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche F@@ altung . the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche F@@ altung has a very long tail , depending on the original pixel . the F@@ IR Wiener in@@ verse of the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ schen F@@ altung is affected in most cases even very strongly influenced by the remote pixel . it causes unwanted results . &quot;
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular F@@ altung . it &apos;s the most important parameter for using this module . you can put a higher value when your image should be very bl@@ ur@@ red but then it should look at the cou@@ p@@ ons .
cor@@ relation : a increase in the cor@@ relation can help reduce arti@@ facts . the cor@@ relation can be reached from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0,5 and the values are close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.95 and more . a high value for the cor@@ relation reduces the sharp@@ est effect of the module . &quot;
Rau@@ sch@@ filter : an increase in the smo@@ k@@ filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . however , values can be higher than 0.1 rarely . however , values can be higher than 0.1 only rarely . if the smo@@ ker filter is very bad . a high value will be high . a high value will continue to merge the picture . &quot;
&quot; Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche Sch@@ är@@ fe : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche Sch@@ är@@ fe . in most cases , you should use this value on 0 to avoid poor@@ er arti@@ facts . if you use a value un@@ equal zero , so you might also have to increase the cor@@ relation and / o@@ der@@ den Rau@@ sch@@ filter . &quot;
Mat@@ ri@@ zen@@ ge : this value determines the size of the transform@@ ational size . an increase in matri@@ xes can choose good results . however , that the module is very slow when you choose big values for this parameter . in most cases you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
&quot; the stor@@ ing and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any kind of re@@ voc@@ ative parameters you have set it will be saved for later and can then be loaded . &quot;
&quot; try to perform all the cutting , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the picture before using the module . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible immediately , but they left un@@ pleasantly art@@ ef@@ acts . &quot;
&quot; if you are reading and com@@ press , &amp; eg ; as JP@@ EG , you should use the module to un@@ com@@ pressed image . &quot;
&quot; generally , bl@@ ur@@ red masks better results than sharp@@ ens . this could be caused by this , the bl@@ ur@@ red mask is used as sharp@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; theoretically possible , bl@@ ur@@ red masks always has to produce art@@ ef@@ acts . even under optimal conditions it can never show the effect of the noise filter . virtually , the result of the F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ ters can always be at least as good as the Unknown Mas@@ ke . the F@@ IR Wiener Filter is often better in processing small details . &quot;
below you can see a comparison between the different filters on a small un@@ focused image :
the original un@@ sharp colour picture that has to be corrected . this picture was made with an an@@ alogue camera . the un@@ focused result is due to in@@ vigor@@ ous light for auto @-@ focus Lin@@ se .
&quot; for more information about the methods of shar@@ pen@@ ing , in digital pictures , you can read a technical comparison in English under this address . &quot;
&quot; the Reg@@ ulators Gl@@ ass@@ ed sets the in@@ sharp@@ ness of the area of the zone , to generate a natural p@@ up@@ ille . &quot;
&quot; the dy@@ es allows a customized color for the P@@ up@@ ille . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can set it here . &quot;
the tool pic@@ l@@ acked is one of the most developed tool in order to remove the desired art@@ ef@@ acts with unprecedented speed .
the in@@ painting algorith@@ m was developed by IM@@ AGE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
&quot; this tool contains several pre @-@ settings than starting points , in order to simplify the restoration . the available pre @-@ settings are listed below : &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the filter settings , you can use the tab smooth@@ ing and advanced settings . &quot;
&quot; detail@@ ing p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the maintenance of the details . a small value leads to more homogen@@ eous regions more homogen@@ eous regions and details sharp . a value of 0.@@ 9 should get details so much . please note that the detail@@ ing always be sub@@ ordin@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; Rich@@ mond Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ ed even@@ ly in all directions , while a value close to 1 is only in one direction . if you have a movie gran@@ ular@@ ity or C@@ CD Rau@@ schen will produce a high value of cor@@ rug@@ ated similar patterns . JP@@ EG arti@@ facts are best placed at a value in the vicinity of 1 . &quot;
&quot; smooth@@ ed &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smooth@@ ing factor above all . then put this value suitable for the degree of smoking in your image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : these parameters affects bigger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is necessary if there is difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ding effects it must be higher than 3 . &quot;
repeti@@ tions : returns on how often the algorith@@ m is going through . normally here is 1 or 2 .
&quot; comp@@ ass @-@ gradual integration of the an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha is chosen , it should also be small to choose that little corner will produce a long term . you should therefore choose this value as much as possible and to suit your needs . &quot;
&quot; integr@@ ally st@@ ew@@ ays &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integr@@ ally st@@ umps on pixel . you should bet the value small 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smooth@@ ing and never exceed 2 . &quot;
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation use : the more quality that you receive through the selection of this option is only low . it doubled the term . we recommend it to allow him to leave it .
the buttons Save as and charging accurately this . any setting of image error can be correct in a text file and later be loaded again later .
image error is compar@@ atively very fast at work . but it can nevertheless last very long and take a high CPU load depending on it . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button break@@ down .
below you can see how images with small art@@ ef@@ acts can be corrected . the module is done on a photo that in Guatemala City has been caused by a bad film storage during the trip . the original picture is under ( 1 ) to see and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; Pres@@ ence came ; diamond reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce images . it uses a copy@@ right@@ ed algorith@@ m of Peter H@@ eck@@ ert .
&quot; this tool provides sel@@ ectable picture filter available to remove st@@ ains and other arti@@ facts , e.g. from dust or hair , e.g. from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensors from the camera or mo@@ i@@ pping ; -@@ effects of saved images from books or magazines . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about Sensor@@ smoking cameras , you can read it in English in this tutorial . &quot;
the screens@@ hot top shows a typical scene which was made with a digital camera and a high standard of ISO . it shows a gran@@ ting smoking that can be successfully removed by this tool .
&quot; in the following , you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub @-@ window details and the sub@@ window advanced settings may remain in default settings . &quot;
&quot; radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . great values increase the time that the filter is needed per pixel and can count the picture and the color in it is dealt with and thus smaller faul@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; sharp@@ ness : controls the pixel plate . this value sets the pix@@ el@@ ab@@ outs of the filter to the front , if you change this setting . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter image details can no longer receive and smo@@ kes or lubric@@ ate again . &quot;
&quot; edges : controls the ben@@ ch@@ imp@@ unity for the sharp@@ ness . this value increases the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong can not occur the entire noise , if you want to remove it on a value close to the max@@ im , if you want to remove a watch@@ ful smo@@ ker or JP@@ EG arti@@ facts without losing any details . &quot;
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance @-@ proof of the picture . we recommend you either color or lumin@@ ance to change a picture . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process that is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color @-@ toler@@ ance of the image . we recommend you either color or lumin@@ ance to change a picture . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process that is controlled by the details settings .
&quot; gam@@ ma : controls the Gam@@ mat@@ oler@@ ance of the picture . this value can be used to increase the toler@@ ant levels of the dark areas , which typically tend to increase faster , but he also mer@@ ges the Sch@@ atten@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; atten@@ uation : controls the judicial system of the ph@@ as@@ cen@@ y absorption . this value is defined as quickly the adap@@ tive filter radius on variations of illumin@@ ance . if he is lifted up , the edges may occur . if he is on his minimum , the rough@@ ness and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter can occur on the edges and is the recommended method for this . &quot;
&quot; save under and load : these buttons are used exactly for it . all parameters of smoking reduction , which you have set , can be stored in the file system and later loaded . &quot;
this is an example of how smokers can change your life . the original picture is marked with ( 1 ) and correc@@ tive with ( 2 ) . the smoking reduction has been applied with the default settings .
&quot; sometimes a picture is too scar@@ ring for your purpose . the solution to draw the image a little soft to draw . use tools for soft marks with the menu @-@ order cor@@ rigi@@ d soft , and experiment with the smooth@@ est on the right side of the dialog it shows the effect of this operation on your photo . &quot;
the &amp; Pres@@ ence came ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most widely developed tools to reduce photo@@ art@@ ef@@ acts .
&quot; this filter for restoration gives you the opportunity to remove a lot of unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts of your images . it is very well adapted to remove the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sches Rau@@ schen , com@@ pression , com@@ pression , com@@ pres@@ sive or thought@@ ful digital images , and thus receives the content like it also makes the human eye . &quot;
&quot; the algorith@@ m can be used for color and textures , which is performed with a different tool that was performed . the algorith@@ m for restoration was developed by IM@@ AGE team of G@@ REC CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ rich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
JP@@ EG arti@@ facts reduce : the com@@ pression of JP@@ EG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away from it . as a def@@ ective com@@ pres@@ sion@@ sal@@ g@@ ai@@ mus , he creates some com@@ pression &amp; quot ; art@@ ef@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that correct in un@@ com@@ pressed picture . this attitude is supposed to correct these problems . &quot;
the buttons Save as and charging accurately this . any h@@ iring of photo restoration can be saved into a text file and later loaded again .
&quot; photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast during work . however , it can still last very long and take a high CPU load . you can therefore leave the calculation at any time with the button b@@ ending . &quot;
below you can cut like a photo with like @-@ shaped smokers .. The module is applied to a black and white photo that was taken with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 Film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the in@@ famous film gran@@ ular@@ ity on the faces . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the correc@@ tive under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time textures was reduced to an old color photo that was created with a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ ef@@ lighting and the Fot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ tization ; tool hot@@ pixel permits the photos containing a C@@ CD camera , eight were to remove . it uses algorithms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pix@@ i project , which are copy@@ right@@ ed by Martin Dick@@ op@@ p . &quot;
&quot; bright , tot@@ e or hot pixel are particularly at high @-@ quality raw mode photos a problem , as many cameras with JP@@ EG com@@ pression over a built @-@ built supp@@ ression for hot pixel . &quot;
&quot; this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixel quot ; and &quot; &quot; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; at a photo with a dark sub@@ screen method . there are currently no manual method to select the bad pixels . &quot;
download this file into the wiz@@ ard with the button dark . the tool will recognize automatic the hot and bright pixel . these are highlighted in the image show .
&quot; if you have an old digital camera , it &apos;s important that you will record the dark picture directly in the connection to discover new hot or bright pixels by C@@ CD Def@@ ective . &quot;
&quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should load the right dark picture to the correc@@ ting picture . an automatic processing of the dark picture will find the bad pixel . note that the wiz@@ ard will notice the last dark picture and this automatically loads in the next session . &quot;
the image area and the preview help you correct within the image to correct the result . the video clip shows the output of the filter with the current settings . poor pixels are lifted in all sections .
select an area around the def@@ ective pixel on the preview and the results of the filter . choose the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ish this pix@@ el@@ blocks to inter@@ pol@@ ishing . this is the available filter .
&quot; Dur@@ ing : it will be determined on average of the pixel size . it will be assigned to each def@@ ective pixel in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this will be done separately for horizontal and vertical line . &quot;
linear : all pixels have a distance of 1 from Pix@@ el@@ block will be drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ishing pixels in the block .
square : this is the default filter@@ method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less on the Pix@@ el@@ block ( 1 @-@ dim ) or a group of square cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ dim ) or a group of square cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ dim ) and is used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
Cub@@ an : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less will be de@@ duc@@ ted to calculate a bi @-@ Cub@@ an surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of Cub@@ an ves ( 1 @-@ dim ) or a group of Cub@@ an ves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ishing pixels in the block .
&quot; below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction in a color photo , from a def@@ ective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long periods , the original image has increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and the correc@@ tive picture is below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Pres@@ ence came ; Vign@@ e@@ ti@@ fying correc@@ tions is a tool to correct the labels , i.e. sub@@ ordinate corners , one image to correct . &quot;
&quot; fores@@ ight objective , especially the middle and large photo format , can frequently illumin@@ ate the entire sensor area . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they can reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light to the sensor there . Tele@@ lenses show these circumstances also this behavior . &quot;
&quot; but he also has dis@@ advantages . many center filters require a factor 1.5 or 2 at Bl@@ ending filter , which it should impossible to keep the camera with the hand . fores@@ ight object , even with center filters , an opening of f / 16 or less use , as otherwise obsc@@ ure effects arise by movement . &quot;
&quot; with the great ventilation ranges from today &apos;s film and film scanner , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a Center@@ filter by an ä@@ qui@@ val@@ ent transformation in a raw image , which is done without this filter . the tool allows for a painting filter to an image . the algorith@@ m is copy@@ right@@ ed by John Walker . &quot;
with three regul@@ ators you can control the spra@@ yer correction filter and with three further the exposure of the target image .
&quot; density : this parameter is controlled the degree of lumin@@ osity on the point of the greatest density the filter . the default density is 2,@@ 0 , what a optical filter with a Bl@@ ending setting of 2 , un@@ lock the density to compens@@ ate for a greater degree of Vign@@ e@@ ading , reduce it to compens@@ ate for a small degree . &quot;
&quot; lumin@@ osity , contrast and gam@@ ma settings : the mach@@ ining of an image with the Vign@@ et@@ ti@@ fying correc@@ tions reduces the lumin@@ osity of the pixels using these options . you need to tick the exposure of the target image with these options , as you need to only increase positive values because you only need to increase the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want a more refinement of the exposure of the target image , let the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / gam@@ ma at zero and use the gr@@ ad@@ ation from the &amp; digi@@ tization ; image editing of the menu color Gr@@ ad@@ ation . &quot;
this is an example of the Vign@@ et@@ ti@@ fying correc@@ tions on an image . the original picture ( 1 ) shows the temp@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the correc@@ ting picture . a lamp @-@ increased and contrast @-@ correction was also carried out in the image with this tool .
the &amp; Pres@@ ence came ; Lin@@ sen@@ ver@@ end is a tool to correct the effect of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ right@@ ed algorith@@ m from David Ho@@ d@@ son .
&quot; this tool works with geomet@@ rical distor@@ tions . colored inter@@ rup@@ tions cannot be corrected with this tool . &quot;
the co@@ efficient of the second ridge is the general geomet@@ rical distor@@ tion of the lens and can correct the con@@ cave or con@@ form form of the picture .
&quot; the co@@ efficient of the third crest has a similar round , but on the edges from . this correction is not applied in the tool . &quot;
the co@@ efficient gr@@ ades corrected the remote corners on the distant ridge . if you combine these two can be eliminated any geomet@@ rical aber@@ ration virtually eliminated .
&quot; generally speaking , this value controls the strength of the distor@@ tion second di@@ ades . with negative values can be corrected , and positive values of kis@@ sed distor@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; corner : this value controls the strength of the distor@@ tion fourth crest . this value affects more than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; Corner parameters has the reverse characters of the parameter . &quot;
z@@ oom : this value sc@@ ali@@ zes the picture size and thus leads a correction first di@@ ades through . negative values increase while positive the image size .
&quot; bright : this value j@@ us@@ ks the brightness in the corners of the picture . negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values they increase . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best filter settings , illustr@@ ates the dialogue with a preview the distor@@ tion correction . the values you use for your image will be stored and used at the next start as default values . &quot;
the heavy @-@ and @-@ shaped correction should be carried out before all cuts or size changes . in the best way you cut this correction as all first . if you perform an image and then perform a heavy @-@ shaped correction would be the effect of the fal@@ seh@@ ood .
&quot; to help you find the best correction to help you find this tool a vertical and horizontal relief line . move it to an important place , such as the sea side or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . afterwards , you can correct the tonn@@ / kis@@ sed distor@@ tion with the help of lines . &quot;
if you correct a kis@@ sed distor@@ tion the resulting image black corners . you can transform them with the cutting @-@ tool in the menu item or remove the z@@ oom reg@@ ler of this dialogue .
&quot; for most images the heavy correction correction is drawn . the next logical step for some motives , such as photographs from the front , frame and paintings , it is the perspective so correct that all angles in the picture 90 degrees have . note that if you keep the camera with your hand you will always have an easy inter@@ ruption of the perspective . &quot;
this is an example of the heavy correction correction is applied to a church in Norway . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the algorith@@ m is based on a method for simul@@ ating infr@@ ared film of the G@@ imp@@ guru film website which is available under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ i@@ ot@@ ot@@ film , see this URL . this film has an sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
&quot; in the left side of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse you can see the effect on different parts of the picture . &quot;
&quot; below the preview , you can set two parameters set out film gran@@ ular@@ ity and film @-@ sensitivity ( ISO ) . enable the optional texture to simul@@ ate a highly sensitive film . the ISO Reg@@ ulators changes the quantity of the film gran@@ ular@@ ity and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in the conversion . green meadows are white like snow ! &quot;
&quot; as the filter channels are used for re@@ produce of infr@@ ared film , especially the green channel makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photographs , as the color @-@ formations are missing . &quot;
this is an example of the infr@@ ared fil@@ tering from New Zealand . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a kind of au@@ ra in the light .
&quot; the &amp; Pres@@ ence came ; filter film gran@@ ular@@ ity is an easy to use tool to reproduce film gran@@ ting on your pictures , such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X , known . to increase the sensitivity of the films , the manufacturer has big silver panels of the photo em@@ ul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; the filming of your photo gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . if you want to get this special , gallery @-@ like , street photographic , gran@@ ular sight especially in your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ men photos , so you have to use this filter . &quot;
&quot; with the Reg@@ ulators , the ISO @-@ sensitivity can be applied to the control of the intensity and gran@@ ular@@ ity of the Kör@@ ner calibr@@ ated . the default value is , although often higher values need to be set on ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need more bas@@ ins , you can apply the filter several times . &quot;
this is an example of the film makers at a black / white image . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and the processed the ( 2 ) . the used film @-@ sensitive to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; B ; filter oil painting generates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copy@@ right@@ ed algorith@@ m of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; Pres@@ ence came ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . natural pictures and breast@@ feeding are good for this effect .
&quot; there are two regul@@ ators to affect this effect . the top select the brush @-@ size between one and five out . th@@ icker brushes are better for large pictures . smooth brushes are the smooth@@ est or , from the other side , the hing@@ es . &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original picture is characterized by the ( 1 ) and which worked with the ( 2 ) . Pin@@ sel@@ size for this 640 pixels large picture is 1 and smooth@@ ed 17 .
&quot; the &amp; Pres@@ ence came ; filters coal @-@ drawing , uses color and intensity gra@@ dient to change a carbon in the drawing , are therefore not ideal for this effect . it &apos;s helpful if you imagine which scene you would have chosen to sc@@ uba you . this would be good pictures to start with it . &quot;
there are two shelves with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper reg@@ ler select the pin size and the lower j@@ us@@ ks the contrast ( par@@ amount ) .
this is an example of coher@@ ent filters . the original image ( 1 ) and the changing picture ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be improved by adjustment of the intensity .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ tization ; filter engra@@ ving your image in 3 @-@ D , as if it was st@@ acked in wax . it uses a copy@@ right@@ ed algorith@@ m of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; See ; Filter engra@@ ving is a fast tool to return your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well in pictures with a simple structure , where color is not the most important of the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mo@@ urn landscape . &quot;
&quot; the depth allows the contrast to the fil@@ tering . a value of 30 , equivalent to 10 % , is the default setting . &quot;
this is an example of the engra@@ ving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal picture into an artwork by using distor@@ tions . it uses copy@@ right@@ ed algorithms by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : shares the image in cells and makes it look as if it is looked by glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : analog to the wav@@ blocks 1 will be distor@@ ted here with a different version of glass blocks .
some effects need a long time to calculate and create a high CPU load . you can cancel this effect at any time with the button b@@ ending .
with this filter group you can transform a normal picture into an art work by means of in@@ sp@@ ill effects . it uses copy@@ right@@ ed algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
z@@ oom Un@@ sharp@@ ness : caught the picture along ast@@ er@@ sing lines that go from one central point . this simul@@ ates the in@@ sp@@ ur@@ fs of a zo@@ om@@ iting camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of often in sports photography .
radi@@ al un@@ tough@@ er : caught the picture by rotation of the pixels by a focus . this simul@@ ates the in@@ sharp@@ ness of a revol@@ ved camera .
removal bl@@ ur@@ fs : caught the picture to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera . the object seems to be back in the background .
&quot; movement of movement : caught the image by horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the in@@ sharp@@ ness of a linear movements , z : B : from a car or train photographic , camera . &quot;
soft@@ ness in@@ sharp@@ ness : caught the picture soft in the dark and strong in the bright tones . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ am@@ our photos or add a warm and subtle light . &quot;
sho@@ ok : caught the image by random shift in pixels and simul@@ ated by the in@@ sharp@@ ness of an arbitr@@ ary moving camera .
intelligent Un@@ sharp@@ ness : finds the color @-@ pool in the picture and wis@@ ely these without changing the rest .
&quot; mos@@ aic : shares the photo in rectangular cells and then creates it , by filling with an average pixel value , new . &quot;
some effects need a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore break this calculation at any time with the button b@@ ending .
the shelves are a nice little tool to make rain drops on your picture . this gives it natural your images a wet look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copy@@ right@@ ed algorith@@ m .
dri@@ pping size allows the size of the drop to change . since the dri@@ pping size does not automatically grow with the size of the picture . number changes the number and density of drops . fishing changes the op@@ tic effect of drop in the picture .
&quot; you can hold with the &amp; digi@@ tization ; post a range free of rain drops . use the tool to select the area , for example a face that will be free to select the area will be free of rain drops . &quot;
this is an example of the rain drops . the original picture ( 1 ) shows a peaceful sunset and the processed image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
&quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it through mir@@ rors or rotating in the right direction . the tools to be transformed in the menu and transform mir@@ rors . &quot;
&quot; bub@@ bles is definitely one of the most advanced tools , to enlarge a photo to enlarge in a minimum loss of image quality . &quot;
&quot; the big question is easy . the big question is , how can you find a picture of zo@@ oming , when the limits of the resolution can be reached ? how can you find the missing information again or guess ? the C@@ Im@@ g @-@ algorith@@ m is used here , makes it a good job . try it and you will see it yourself . &quot;
&quot; if a photo is the wrong size , you can change it on the desired size with the tool size . select it in the menu and enter the target values . &quot;
&quot; the tool to change size uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method , in order to increase the pixels . if you want a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool to fade . &quot;
&quot; many images use a type of inter@@ pol@@ ation , for example Spl@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation for enlarge an image . the underlying algorith@@ m photo has been developed by IM@@ AGE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
you have to say the tool as you want to change the size . these settings are available in the rider New Size and are listed below :
&quot; print ratio : if this attitude is enabled , when entering the new size the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : these parameters affects bigger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is necessary if there is difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ding effects , it must be set up higher than 3 . &quot;
the buttons save as and loading are being used exactly as a text file can be saved as a text file and later be loaded later .
&quot; photograph is very fast with what makes it , but it can still take very long and take a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button b@@ ending . &quot;
you can see below an example of photo blo@@ wing down by a small color picture on the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged image ( 3 ) . the P@@ review ( 2 ) is the result of linear relative to the comparison .
&quot; the cutting of a photo is not only a frequently performed surgery , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to cut a picture with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and pull the rect@@ angle , create . you will see this rect@@ angle while you move the mouse . &quot;
&quot; when you leave the mouse button again , the area of the photo will cut off . thus , you can change a good overview how your photo will be cut off . you can easily create the size of the rect@@ angle . a new rect@@ angle can easily create by clicking on the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; once you are happy with the cut @-@ cut , use the button editing in the tool@@ box in the tool@@ bar and the photo will be tailored ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the file file saving or file saving under the menu to save the newly @-@ cut photo . &quot;
&quot; in the background area you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by changing the corners with the mouse . the print ratio , which you have defined in dialogue remains . &quot;
&quot; in the tool after page ratio , you can indicate the orientation as high @-@ format or cross format . in the high format , the larger value of height and in the cross @-@ format of width will be assigned . &quot;
&quot; the tool after aspect ratio is used to cut a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same , regardless of whether you &apos;re cen@@ timeters , In@@ ch or any other physical size . you can see below a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier and their side @-@ relationship . &quot;
&quot; at the right end of the dialogue , two buttons are automatically horizontal or vertical . &quot;
&quot; below , you can set the area down in dialog with the Max . relation to the area to access to the greatest possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation . &quot;
&quot; the tool after page ratio cut its attitudes depending on the orientation ( horizont@@ ally or ver@@ tically ) , these settings are stored as default values depending on orientation . the changed image dimensions are reflected in the EX@@ IF data , so that the EX@@ IF data are reflected in the original image and not the original image . &quot;
&quot; the settings of the mer@@ ging aid enable help to incorporate your images better , so that you can get your pictures better . these help include : &quot;
harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic ponds are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . as the third @-@ reg@@ ains , harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles are a way to share a rect@@ angle in similar harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles at the di@@ agon@@ als . &quot;
&quot; Golden centre : the Golden centre is a division which is based on different natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of Nau@@ til@@ us pussy , or the leaf @-@ leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful . &quot;
&quot; Golden division is the ir@@ rational number 1,6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it has been used for the ancient Egyptians and p@@ yrami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden division in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number is derived from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i eps . 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; from where each number remains equal to 1 equal to the sum of their two forward numbers . one composition is considered as vis@@ ually harmon@@ ious . &quot;
the golden centre provides liquid @-@ lines when you put an image together . these assistance are listed below :
&quot; the Golden Spir@@ als will bring you good results for your photos . compared to third @-@ reg@@ res@@ el , the golden spiral produces a liquid line of the eye along the line of the spiral , creating a balanced visual river . &quot;
&quot; another rule is the right corner of golden spiral , also called golden spiral . it should be a line that the eye can be at the center of the composition . this can be a line or different objects . this something can simply be there without the eye , it will fulfil its task . &quot;
&quot; the Golden Tri@@ angles are also guided from the top of the golden spiral . your verti@@ ces are the middle points of the sides of the golden tri@@ angles . note that in contrast to harmon@@ ious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are no equ@@ itable tri@@ angles . di@@ agon@@ als can place an static object of dynam@@ ical object . &quot;
&quot; when you run golden tri@@ angles around your frame , you create an effect of professional photo@@ grap@@ hen dynamic symmet@@ ry . try to place your sculp@@ tor on one of the inter@@ sections and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot reach any other way . &quot;
the options horizont@@ ally reflect and soli@@ ds can be used to reflect the harmon@@ ic dough .
&quot; with the button of button , you can set the color of the aid lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the aid lines can be invisible . this way you can adjust the color of the lines of your current image . &quot;
the Free Rot@@ ation is a tool to rot@@ ate an image to any angle .
&quot; if you make a photo , then it happens easy that you can &apos;t fix the camera exactly vertical or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture where things came about a corner . you can fix this with the &amp; digi@@ tization ; select your free rot@@ ation and save your target angle . &quot;
&quot; turning your picture with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this sli@@ der are given in degrees . with the button settings , you can set the sli@@ der again on 0 degree . a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture will be shown on the right top . &quot;
&quot; at your help , the module Free Rot@@ ation provides a horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse c@@ ursor in the image to position the two lines . now you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now j@@ us@@ ks the angle as described in previous section . &quot;
&quot; after you rot@@ ated a picture , you will find unwanted holes in the corners . an opportunity to fix it , it is the function trans@@ forming out of the image processing . &quot;
an elegant way to cut the picture is the function Autom@@ atic cutting . select one of the following options :
the option anti @-@ ali@@ asing smooth@@ es the image a bit after the rotation . please note the above warning .
all per@@ spec@@ ulative transform@@ ations are carried out at a fixed point of the reference point . this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
&quot; to change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview is then automatically re@@ calculated . on the right side of the dialog , you will find some information which help you to change the perspective : &quot;
&quot; new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas which emerged through the transformation , in pixel . &quot;
&quot; new height : indicates the height of the new image , including the empty areas which emerged through the transformation , in pixel . &quot;
angle left at the top : shows the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the trans@@ forming area .
angle right up : displays the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the trans@@ forming area .
angle left below : displays the current angle in degrees at the bottom left corner of the trans@@ forming area .
angle right down : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the trans@@ forming area .
&quot; according to the adaptation of the perspective , the image will be a little spar@@ ed . for a single adaptation this effect is small , but two adjustments generate a twice as strong effect and you should avoid it if possible . &quot;
after you adjust the perspective you get un@@ pleasantly tri@@ angular holes on the corners . one way to downhill this is the image with transform@@ ers cut out of the image editing .
&quot; the tool @-@ tool is used to move a part of the picture into one direction and move the other part into the opposite . it is not turning the image into a parall@@ el@@ og@@ ram . this is not turning into a parall@@ el@@ og@@ ram . you can transform this module over transform . &quot;
&quot; thr@@ ust your image by using the horizont@@ ally angle and the vertical angle . you can press horizontal and vertical . if you press to pres@@ et , the angle is displayed on zero . a preview of the effect will display you and the new dimensions of the target image will be shown on the right of the umb@@ nails . &quot;
&quot; to your help , a vertical and horizontal line appears . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your image and push the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool @-@ tool to start your picture . &quot;
&quot; after you have carried out the sh@@ ing , the image is a bit wi@@ ped out . for a single switch , this effect is usually neglected twice as much as possible , and therefore you should avoid this . &quot;
after switching the image has un@@ nice tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate this is the image with transform@@ ers cut out of the image editing .
&quot; she came to read and write a number of libraries and other packages to read and write pictures . the available formats are therefore related to your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries have been comp@@ iling . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to process a large number of imaging formats . &quot;
&quot; due to this dependence on other libraries , it is impossible to provide a list of all available file formats . however , you will always find JP@@ EG and T@@ IF@@ F . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ tization ; displays only files in form of formats . this happens on the file extension and a comparison of this with a defined list . if the extension is specified in the list . you can upgrade the file in the list . you can change this list of file extension , and change the file . in the section configuration you will find further information . &quot;
virtually all digital cameras save photos in one of two formats : JP@@ EG or T@@ IF@@ F . some cameras allow you to select the format . a detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ tization ; supports both formats .
image com@@ pression is the application of data com@@ pres@@ sion@@ ing to digital pictures . thereby , redund@@ ant information is reduced to save the image data on an efficient way . &quot;
&quot; JP@@ EG 2000 is also supported . in general , there is better , gl@@ atter@@ ing results as JP@@ EG with the same com@@ pression ratio . the 200@@ 0s can also be lost , if this is stated in the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to learn more about the pipe format , you can read under Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous landscape and Cambridge in colour very helpful instructions in English . you can convert raw materials in JP@@ EG or T@@ IF@@ F with the raw image converter . in the section configuration you will find further information on the use of modules with &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ement . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ tization ; supports the store of raw materials only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is included in &amp; digi@@ tization . all cameras can be seen below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a brief list of raw formats used by &amp; digi@@ tization ; supported : &quot;

you can choose color somewhere on the screen and then find them in the colour selection on the left side .
&quot; &amp; k@@ graph@@ ite ; is a KDE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . graphs are used in science , especially in science , especially in computer science . so far there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graphics &amp; X11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with only few functions . &quot;
&quot; this project has set itself the goal , to replace these programs through a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de program . &quot;
&amp; k@@ graph@@ ite ; is a KDE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs ; -@@ programs are free layout programs . &amp; programs are free layout programs . &amp; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; an application has the following functions :
integration in &amp; Kate ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of graphs in &amp; Kate ; the graphs are re @-@ calculated and in &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; )
&quot; menu to open the graphs in &amp; Kate ; to open or the graphs in &amp; k@@ graph@@ ite ; in a &amp; Kate ; -@@ component to open
loading of big graphs ( currently there are problems from about 1000 knots and a h@@ ack to represent more than these knots )
&quot; further needed software : &amp; k@@ graph@@ ite ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program , which is required &amp; graph@@ ically ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for the presentation of graphs that will be required in detail : &quot;
&quot; the main window shows the open grap@@ hen , each in its own sub@@ window . in the beginning , if you open &amp; k@@ graph@@ ite ; without a argument , the tool@@ bar contains only the symbol file and the ( blank ) list opened . click on the first icon to open the dialog file . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected one or more &amp; dot ; files selected , the main window looks like in the lower screens@@ hot : &quot;
&quot; as you can see , an overview in the corner is displayed when the Grap@@ h is bigger than the string . you can select a fixed position of this overview or select this position automatically . &quot;
&quot; the mouse wheel use ( high and r@@ under without special keys , left and right at penet@@ rating &amp; Alt ; -@@ Taste ) ; &quot;
the zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by the factor 10 . below you can see the maximum reduction of a graph .
&quot; when the file has been changed in &amp; k@@ graph@@ ite , loaded file from another program , the following window will be displayed : &quot;
&quot; you can choose whether the Grap@@ h will be re@@ loaded or if you want to ignore the change , so that later your decision will change . if you want to change your decision later , you can put your decision later , you can set the menu item settings ; set up ... see also . &quot;
&quot; if you want to open a graph@@ end@@ at@@ ei outside of a running &amp; k@@ graph@@ ite ; -@@ instance , in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; c@@ graph@@ ite ; -@@ instance , or want to represent the inv@@ ading grap@@ hen in a sub@@ window of the already current instance . &quot;
&quot; as with the last option , you can permanently save your choice but also change it with the interior dialog . &quot;
&quot; in schedule , you can open all graphs in your last session . again , you can save your choice both as well as later . &quot;
&quot; you can also define how the grap@@ h will be divided into several pages , the number of horizontal and vertical pages may be chosen freely . &quot;
&quot; when you use several pages , you can choose if the parts of the grap@@ hen will be fitted on one hand , the side @-@ ratio will be ignored . if you keep the side @-@ ratio , the pages may not be filled from each part of the graphs . &quot;
print @-@ show with one on several pages shared with no head@@ line and with another font
&quot; this page shows the opportunity to determine the behavior if a file has been altered on the hard disk , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can set a standard behaviour ( automatically re@@ loading or ignore the change ) or the program every time . &quot;
&quot; the page opens the opportunity to set the behaviour of &amp; k@@ graphical viewer , when a graph will open outside of a running session . you can set a standard tab for this case ( the graphs in a new window , or in a sub@@ window of already running session ) or determine that every time is needed . &quot;
&quot; the site administration gives the possibility to set the behaviour of &amp; k@@ graph@@ ite ; you can set a standard behaviour ( the files of the last session or not ) or determine , in every start to be asked . &quot;
&quot; the context menu , typically at one click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; appears , offers further options : &quot;
&quot; here you can choose from different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ Lay@@ out@@ algorithms , the entries , as described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z , are : &quot;
&quot; &amp; dot ; -@@ algorith@@ m , the standard for proper grap@@ hen . he produces hierarch@@ ical or se@@ ated represent@@ ations of judicial graphs . the algorith@@ m lays down the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short se@@ ams and as possible as a few cant@@ een . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorith@@ m is the standard for un@@ just graphs . it is used in accordance with the spr@@ ing@@ board algorith@@ m . this is used by the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wai algorith@@ m , which is syn@@ onymous with statisti@@ cally multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling . &quot;

the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization allows the GPS co @-@ ordin@@ ates in the met@@ ad@@ ata of an image and edit . the geographical data are stored in the EX@@ IF @-@ sampling of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization makes tools available to locate photos geograph@@ ically in the spher@@ ical coordination system that is used by GPS and Galil@@ eo , too . height , long@@ it@@ ud@@ inal and l@@ ati@@ tudes are used . &quot;
to corro@@ sion your pictures with geographical data you need a GPS track as XML @-@ file in g@@ p@@ x @-@ For@@ mat@@ .@@ g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ p@@ sman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
picture Ge@@ ograph@@ ical Loc@@ alization Cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
&quot; select the pictures you want to set up in the main window and call the menu . the above to visual dialog appears . this file contains the possible cor@@ relation over time and loc@@ alisation , you need to load a trace file with GP@@ X file . this file contains of course data that were taken at the same time at the same time as the images of your camera . &quot;
&quot; when the file load , an automatic cor@@ relation carried out the coordinates into red . GPS gau@@ ge data are recorded in GMT @-@ time and therefore the camera will be calculated with the GMT . this can be done with the time zone . &quot;
the setting for the maximum time devi@@ ation gives a high vari@@ ance for the GPS time and camera range . lies the devi@@ ation below are the data gathered together . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you do not have a trace data from one place for images you can edit the g@@ p@@ x file manually and add to the pictures . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all pictures in this area .
&quot; the options Inter@@ pol@@ ishing and differential in min. can be used if you don &apos;t have appropriate data . if you know that in reality is a locality in a great time difference between camera and GPS , you can put this limits here and then press the button to inter@@ pol@@ ishing . &quot;
&quot; the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful , if you have taken a number of photos on the same place . as the dialog will use the coordinates of a call to the next notice , you only need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo . &quot;
&quot; this location can also be found with the indicated map and be found and enlarge . select the right region and enlarge S@@ e.@@ Make it again , until you have to be selected manually . the map can be changed manually . the map can be changed between card mode , satellite screen and a mixed mode . &quot;
complete outside the K@@ IP@@ I module there are possibilities to hang around the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that the exi@@ f@@ tool is used to provide a stack of pictures with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
&quot; this module can export your albums in a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.01 . you can select the albums that will be exported as HTML pages and provide the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is set for UT@@ F @-@ 8 , to enable the best possible internation@@ alisation . &quot;
the module has four tab in which the settings can be adjusted . the tab allows you to select all albums on the right . the albums are not hierarch@@ ically displayed . the albums are not hierarch@@ ically displayed . the albums are not hierarch@@ ically displayed on the right hand side . in the section below the Al@@ ben@@ preview and the text that appear in the head of the HTML page will be shown .
&quot; the rider appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this tab is largely declared a page in which any picture is displayed , a new page will be displayed in which the image is displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your standard image , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show , displayed : &quot;
&quot; the rider album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be saved with all your associated images . select a folder on which you have writing . a sub@@ folder with the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ or Export , which contains everything , will be created there . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the JP@@ EG file format , the EX@@ IF @-@ Information of your original pictures will also be stored in the new pictures . &quot;
with other color @-@ depth you can change the standard colour depth . the influences of course also influences the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
&quot; the rider shows you some of the settings from the album rider for the umb@@ nails , which are small images displayed in the gallery . &quot;
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press Canc@@ el to break the process .
&quot; when the module generates the pages , the window will not automatically closed . you can therefore start the program to determine whether errors during generating . the web browser will be started automatically at the end to display the preview of the gallery . press Connect to close the module . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I Graphic is a very fast and flexible OpenGL based tool to look at pictures .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I Graphic is permitted to see a selection of pictures and run on them base operations such as la@@ wns , zo@@ oming or rel@@ oc@@ ating . the vie@@ wers can be used with short notice and prompt access to its functions . &quot;
after the start a picture is shown by default in full screen mode . this can be changed into a window mode .

currently the K@@ IP@@ I module Metad@@ ata Editor has no documentation . if you want to change this situation please contact the mailing list k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
&quot; using the import capacity of the met@@ ad@@ ata model , you can copy data from an image to another . this will then select the fil@@ tering dialog with which you want to copy the folder dialog with which you want to copy the met@@ ad@@ ata . the data will be copied after you click OK . &quot;
&quot; this function does not work with all formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not in any target format . JP@@ EG is supported by writing . please check out exi@@ v@@ 2 to see which formats are supported . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slides@@ how .
&quot; the MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length , to convert . this module uses the packages M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick . between the single images you can also add an audio file at MP@@ 2 or W@@ AV the slides@@ how . &quot;
all images are automatically selected on the correct size for the chosen video format . additionally you can use a background color for the slides@@ how . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium program you can use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
&quot; first , you must first select the pictures that will be packed into the MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au . afterwards , you can create via extras MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au create the module . &quot;
the images you selected are then available under image files in the portfolio . there you can also change sor@@ ting of images or the content of the list .
&quot; after you are satisfied with your list , you should custom@@ ize the other settings . the video format is selected from different formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD , you must select the appropriate TV standard PAL , Sec@@ am or NT@@ SC . PAL is pre @-@ set and probably the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the next step , you should indicate the time in seconds the picture is displayed . the speed of the image will be specified below . a low value creates very sudden , a high contrast , very smooth picture change . &quot;
&quot; the background color can be set next . in doubt you should leave them black , the name and path of the generated file you can specify as the name of the MPEG @-@ output file . keep it as possible as the extension mp@@ g . &quot;
&quot; if you specify a audio file under name of the audio source file , this will be integrated into the movie . after you start all settings your wishes . depending on the speed of your machine , you can go fast or enjoy a coffee and enjoy the slides@@ how , if you are back again . &quot;
&quot; if a note appears that Ko@@ di@@ ers or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick Pack@@ ages over the button settings right down . &quot;
the printer assistant allows multiple images to print on a sheet of paper together in standard photographs . this combined pictures can also automatically print with the image processing Gimp . this is e.@@ g : useful to print you or using the Gimp module to direct printing .
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import your own images stored in one of three formats JP@@ EG , T@@ IF@@ F or P@@ PM . &quot;
&quot; the conversion is based on the command line tool for cra@@ w from Dave Coff@@ in . an original offer from Him is : expect from d@@ cra@@ w not that it creates the same results , like the software from your camera maker . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w better results ! &quot;
&quot; first , select the RA@@ W file that is to convert and run the module . the Ra@@ w image converted window appears in the mode for a single image . with the button preview , you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture . &quot;
&quot; you can now optimize the values new j@@ us@@ ks to optimize the conver@@ ti@@ fication process . the first option will decide whether the camera will be used as gam@@ ma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the image later . &quot;
&quot; a four colors of GB@@ G conversion can be selected , so that you can use the double information . if your camera has no effect in R@@ GB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switches has no effect . &quot;
&quot; once you are happy with the review , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the converting result . the fil@@ en@@ ame remains equal and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JP@@ EG uses a lost algorith@@ m and produces the smallest file sizes . &quot;
&quot; the Tag@@ ged Image Format , T@@ IF@@ F , ret@@ ains all the information of your image and uses the lost @-@ free L@@ Z@@ W com@@ pression . &quot;
&quot; if you intend to edit your images frequently , or you should not otherwise use the JP@@ EG format , since it is only limited number of operations before the image quality is deteri@@ or@@ ating . T@@ IF@@ F and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot;
&quot; if you choose JP@@ EG as a storage format , the met@@ ad@@ ata are stored in the RA@@ W file in the JP@@ EG file in the P@@ 50@@ EC file . &quot;
&quot; if you have adjusted your settings , you can start converting kno@@ b the conversion . if you want to break this process again so you can break this process . &quot;
&quot; the stack mode allows you to convert different images at once . use this mode , so if you are sure , e.g. by testing in one single image , which are the best settings . &quot;
&quot; the options available are virtually identical with the version for individual images . however , this is useful here , however , if this has been created in an earlier attempt . a preview is not available . the progress report shows how far the conversion is advanced . &quot;
&quot; this module can be used to re@@ com@@ press all pictures in an album . it uses the program converting from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported : &quot;
&quot; this module can be used for ren@@ aming all pictures of a album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the speed and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the file should be used . &quot;
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a picture collection . it uses the convert program from Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can set the image size or enlarge . these are four types of imaging change :
&quot; proportional to 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . width or height of the image is automatically selected , depending on the image orientation , selected . the print ratio remains unchanged . &quot;
proportional to 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here the side @-@ ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option e.g. to adjust your image to the screen format .
not proportional : dis@@ proportionate size change in two dimensions . the print ratio is changed during this option .
&quot; pressure preparation : prepare the picture for the photo printing . the user can adjust the printer solution and size of the phot@@ op@@ api@@ ers . the target picture , including background size , size and background color , is adjusted accordingly . &quot;
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your favorite e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images beforehand . some more pictures can be moved to the list of pictures .
&quot; after which you started the module , the images will be displayed with the pictures you selected . you can add more pictures to the button . for the last selected picture , a preview is displayed on the right . &quot;
you can also drag images to the image list and add it to the pictures you want to add to the pictures .
&quot; with the button images , the selected images are removed from the list of the pictures . &quot;
after you have selected all the pictures you can open with the button OK the new message window of your e @-@ mail clients . you just have to add the addresses and the header . the pictures selected are attached to you as an app@@ endi@@ x .
do not pay attention to many pictures at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations for the size of the related e @-@ mails . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails when you want to send a lot of pictures .
the e @-@ mail window will be used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is stored and every@@ time again until you change them .
&quot; select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the right path for your installation . &quot;
&quot; if you use the Google Mail service , you have to install the G@@ mail agent on your computer . you can download it here . &quot;
&quot; after the selection of comments in a raised file , the comments to the images are attached to a text file and attached to the mail . &quot;
the P@@ NG format under the menu Images file format is not very suitable to use the size of photo files . you should therefore use P@@ NG if you have a quick internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend you the JP@@ EG format .
&quot; if you select JP@@ EG under pictures file format and the original files in the JP@@ EG format , then the original Ex@@ if@@ data will be added to the pictures . &quot;
&quot; when the process is finished , the window will not automatically closed the status of status , in search of errors , you can see . your e @-@ mail programme will be started automatically at the end . with the button shooting , you can lie this window . &quot;
&quot; after starting the module advanced slides@@ how , a window with questions like you want to have shown your slides@@ how . you can choose between the pictures you selected and all pictures of the album . &quot;
&quot; the option OpenGL transitions in the presentation will use very elegant cap@@ tions using OpenGL . however , you have to own a corresponding graphics card , as otherwise the slides@@ how will be very slow . &quot;
&quot; the option file is displayed , that the fil@@ en@@ ame of images in the lower left corner will be displayed during the presentation . &quot;
the v@@ eil option makes it possible to display the presentation in a continuous loop . you can then manually break it with Es@@ c .
the option pictures acci@@ dentally choose that the pictures are displayed in a random order . so it is not used the order of images in the album .
&quot; among del@@ ayed between images , the temporary distance between the individual images can be set . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transi@@ tional effect . &quot;
there is more than a dozen transi@@ tional effects between which you can choose . acci@@ dentally choosing a different effect at any transition between the pictures .
&quot; during the slides@@ how , you can access a tool@@ bar on the upper left side of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn you off . &quot;
&quot; with this tool@@ bar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and the next picture and stopping the slides@@ how . &quot;
&quot; on the left side of the screen , you can view the current date names , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date is currently not documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I teams under k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de.@@ org. : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module wall@@ painting is a tool to set a picture as a background picture for the work@@ space .
&quot; this module consists of the selected picture , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as the background for your KDE work@@ space . &quot;
&quot; once you have provided your pictures and videos with notes , you can see with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the image we are available in each group , so in persons , places and in the group keywords entries . &quot;
&quot; in the browser window you see the categories , for which you have entered information when you have information and videos with notes . in addition , there are entries to look after EX@@ IF @-@ based information to view the folder structure on your hard disk and of course the current anticip@@ ations . in the following , each one is described here . &quot;
&quot; if you press with the mouse on the entry , the view of the browser changes . see picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select another person will be shown only the pictures on which both persons are to be seen . through this selection method , you can limit the number of pictures taken from a few thousand pictures to some images . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected all the persons , places and other settings , you can view photos to view the images of your efficiency . &quot;
&quot; in the picture every person has the same symbol before their name . you can save with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , but for each person you can save your own image , the same applies to places , key@@ word and other categories that you have defined itself . see the picture . &quot;
&quot; to view images beside the name , select the button that you want to use the button on the tool@@ bar . this has the advantage that you can display for example symbols with pictures of people and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you do not have any suitable pictures for your key@@ word ) . &quot;
&quot; however , you must specify which image should be displayed for each individual person . now , you can view the image online Editor , as shown in the picture . here you can view the picture for the appropriate person . in the see window , you can adjust the magni@@ fying factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image should be displayed and cut down . &quot;
&quot; if you visit the main window of the entry , you &apos;ll show you a dialog who is very similar to the dialog for fixing the image properties . this dialog can see you on the picture once again . &quot;
&quot; if you enter a string into the field lab@@ eling or description , the sign@@ ments and descriptions of images will be sear@@ ched for this text , so for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options in the lower part of the window you can browse all the images following certain names , as you can see in the picture . here , after pictures , on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are depic@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , but if you don &apos;t like to read hand@@ books , but rather try to try right functions , you have the following alternatives to this book : &quot;
go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and take a look at the quick @-@ entry to the screen photos and the introductory videos .
&quot; start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , and select in the first dialog the demo , if you run &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , for the first time , or select in the menu Help menu photo album , demo album . as a result , some examples are loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , as a connected HTML document to download . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar look here : . as the name suggests , this bar shows you data statistics on the images in your database . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can display several different time units . each bar shows then another unit . you can switch between the units of years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by pressing the bar only 10 @-@ minute sections . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline allows you to inter@@ actively use the following ways ( if you select a date , you will see the first image of this date in preview display ) and also shows the tim@@ eline always shown the current date of the currently displayed pictures , if you navigate in the preview view . &quot;
&quot; you can also select a section of the tim@@ eline by clicking the mouse button and select the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the time information , you will be displayed only pictures of this period . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a beam of the time bar . &quot;
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; introduces you two options to create HTML sites with your pictures . the one is available in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version is described in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version which you can create using the menu HTML ...
&quot; before HTML pages you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and target . in the following , each area is described more exactly . &quot;
&quot; first , enter the title of the bli@@ cks and a description that should contain the HTML file later . on photo album , HTML @-@ example pages you see an example of these settings . &quot;
&quot; next you choose whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , will be created , which is supposed to see on the overview page . for more information on the export files you will find in . &quot;
&quot; last , you can select which information on the HTML page are to be displayed . therefore , you can avoid that information will be displayed by a party . notice that all pictures are exported from a party . please note that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . you can not use this setting to hide certain pictures from particular viewer . &quot;
&quot; in this area you can specify how the HTML pages are to look like . most of the settings are clear , which is not specifically entered . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the page you can view different resolutions for the images . therefore , those who have to look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no images download for example a resolution of 1600@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the viewer of your side can change the resolution at any time , so it can also change your pictures with low resolution , which leads to a lower transmission time , as if he wants to get a picture bigger , it changes to a higher resolution . &quot;
&quot; in this setting area , you place the different folder and the URL where your website is stored . &quot;
&quot; best , select a base folder for all your HTML files and for each subsequent set of a new sub@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; first , you have to select the main folder in which all your images are stored . this folder will be stored and you can select for all future images of the location . here you can select either a folder or by KDE supported protocol , for example : &quot;
&quot; after you have created your pictures , you can check if this really is all for vie@@ wers . if you have created a URL for the base folder after the pages have been created , this folder will be created . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; if the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder , you will need to copy them manually . so that the import function , see , correctly , you must specify the final destination of the files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located . &quot;
&quot; the settings described here are all three on basic folders or URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder created , whose name you specify in terms of output folder . &quot;
&quot; if you &apos;re on a family party , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you might have to write a HTML page for viewing the pictures . however , you can of course have a HTML page for viewing the pictures , then you have to do with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , then do not have to do this work yet again . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ in file . these can import others into your database . the properties are involved with ex@@ - and imported . &quot;
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im -@@ files , internal and external . they differ in whether the pictures themselves are stored in the file , or whether in the file is only a link to pictures . the advantage all pictures can be attached to the file and that file is so independent . the obvious disadvantage is however the file size . &quot;
&quot; you can export a .@@ k@@ in file either directly from the menu file ... or together with HTML @-@ pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ in file along with a HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ in file . &quot;
&quot; a external .@@ k@@ im file looks for the pictures in a double way . first , the pictures are not found in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ in file using HTML @-@ Export . &quot;
the following will be descri@@ bing the dialog for the export of images which you can export across the menu file .
the most important option of this dialog is whether to act internal or external .@@ k@@ in files . there are the following three choices available :
&quot; in the manual , you need to copy the images to the .@@ k@@ in file , copy the pictures in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ in file . &quot;
&quot; with the option Autom@@ atic in the vicinity of the .@@ k@@ im file copy , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , the pictures automatically copy to you . &quot;
.@@ k@@ im -@@ files are normal Zip files . as most images are already com@@ pressed with JP@@ EG and the XML @-@ file itself is usually not worth to com@@ press the files . if you want to com@@ press it anyway , just select the option of export file . &quot;
&quot; the last option of this page is Maximum photo size : if you want to send your friends pictures , as the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very big . here you can limit the size by saying that every image is no more than 800 pixels high and wide . &quot;
&quot; select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ in from the web browser or from the menu file impor@@ ters ... , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , will import &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , as described in . &quot;
&quot; the wiz@@ ard for import consists of four steps . first , you have to select which images you want to import , after which folder the import can be copied . &quot;
&quot; it may be that you can import the category people of the import@@ ing file person@@ er ( if you are a dump ) , while this category is in the third dialogue window asked which categories of imported file should be imported , and which categories that are in your database . &quot;
&quot; in the fourth step , you can import the categories of import@@ ing file with the categories of your current database . an example of this can be seen in the picture . &quot;
&quot; it must be easy to browse and look at the pictures . if you look at pictures , one often want to see pictures of your Italy and watch a picture with your boyfriend , you might want to see all the pictures where this friend is pic@@ tured . &quot;
&quot; in this hand@@ book you will run the different steps from ( 1 ) fixed the information about your pictures , over ( 2 ) the look and prestige , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and adapt@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Photo@@ album was started as a program for the pamper@@ ing of your pictures . however , it was extended and today it takes care of your videos . in many places in this hand@@ book will be talked about pictures , but often this also closes videos with one . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , all its information in the file index@@ .x@@ ml can be found in the top folder of their pictures . this is a simple XML file that you can copy with a program of your choice , e.g. stand@@ ar@@ dis@@ ks or re@@ visions in CV@@ S , where they want . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , noted the folder in which your images are stored and used it automatically . if you want to start another database in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , so you can start another folder tree ; with the option -@@ c . as example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / images / index@@ .x@@ ml . &quot;
via the menu option settings k@@ photo@@ album ; Set up to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . in the following section of the user book you can change the different settings options .
&quot; links see six different symbols , with which you can view settings for viewing and view the options for the viewer . for each setting , you can access a detailed help you can call on the F1 button and click on the desired option . &quot;
&quot; in this case you describe how you can set different properties , e.g. individuals , places and tags . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums . &quot;
&quot; click on the dialog , which is used to already edit existing groups . for each available group you can select an cap@@ tion and a symbol . &quot;
&quot; in the section there are sub@@ categories already mentioned . in the dialogue options , you can set full members groups , for example , all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a medi@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; in view the settings options , which are available to you for the fixed list of members . with the above selection list , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left of the window , you will find a list with the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories . &quot;
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; shares his modular system with other graphic applications such as car@@ am and g@@ wen@@ view . this module is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image Plugin interface . rate information can be found on the homepage of Ki@@ pi .
&quot; the modules can be called by using the menu modules . the modules can be downloaded and are not described in this manual , because they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page that you can call on the modules themselves . &quot;
&quot; since the modules of multiple applications are shared among each other together , it can be tested that the modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; only very little tested using the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album , demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or via the menu Help . do not say , I would not have been war@@ ned ! &quot;
&quot; the applications that use the modules via K@@ IP@@ I , are very different , allowing you to be some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not work . this is the disadvantage when you share functions with various applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that an album is simply a folder . even though &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , this type of order is not supported , so you can use the order to be able to use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; thereby simul@@ ated &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , the current album that simply corresponds to the current view , so all pictures that shows you the picture show at the moment . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the current album &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , the modules also has to pass a list of albums . here , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , as follows : &quot;
if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser displays the content of a category e.g. all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; or it will have set the category you have specified in the creation of dialog as a category for virtual albums , so if you use for example the category people , will be chosen &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , so if you would have chosen and pass this to the module . &quot;
since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not compatible can you remove them from the list of modules . start the setup dialog and select in the area modules which modules are to be loaded .
&quot; on the picture you can see an example of a boot screen , once you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , with your own pictures . &quot;
&quot; as you are used by any other KDE application , see above a menu and a tool@@ bar . below the tool@@ bar you can see the window , you will find no information about your pictures , now please click on this window to show you an overview with all existing images . &quot;
&quot; one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , is the opportunity to see any picture with notes , where the image has been recorded , etc . you can use every image either individually or for a larger number of images specified at the same time . if for example , on all pictures Jes@@ per pic@@ tured and all pictures were recorded in Copenhagen . &quot;
all these notes can be used for the search and brow@@ sing as you can read in the section . if you want to see these notes if you use the built @-@ in viewer .
&quot; in view three lists with a text box by setting persons , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , because you will always use it again if you enter information about your pictures . &quot;
&quot; following an idea is the moving of the images within the list : if you have a family party , and on all 50 pictures , you can see the same 5 @-@ 10 persons , so you can find that the names of the names are moved up , the persons can quickly find and assign . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to get a alphabe@@ tical list , click on the icon for Sor@@ ting according to date under the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have any comments selected for each photo , you might want to edit all the pictures and add these pictures with notes . in this case simply click on the above and back buttons , which are under the preview of the picture on the top right . &quot;
&quot; if you have multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more comfortable to highlight all these images and use the menu item multiple entries at once with a note . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . moreover , San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California . &quot;
&quot; in the picture you see a browser window that shows the USA as an over@@ group . to show you that it is an over@@ group , a special symbol is displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the context menu of the allowance , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new sub@@ category or sub@@ category . in addition , you can also make an entry into a category and lay there to make this one sub@@ category of this entry . attention , this requires that you just sort out your category alphabe@@ tical sort . &quot;
&quot; you can move the individual elements of your placement , by clicking the l@@ edge of the frame , click and move . you can make out of a frame also a separate window by drawing it outside the window area . &quot;
&quot; if you have adjusted the appearance of the window to your needs , you are satisfied with the settings , click on the button options ... that offers you the possibility to save the current structure and appearance of the window . &quot;
&quot; you can also drop a frame completely . if you would like to see this window later , use the button options ... and then click here window / fade . this process can be seen in the picture . &quot;
&quot; selecting the entry images displayed in the browser , you will find an overview with preview images of the currently selected images , or any pictures in case you do not have a filter here . you can configure the size of the th@@ umb@@ nails , from simply down@@ side of the mouse with the middle mouse button , configure . try it simple . &quot;
&quot; when you leave a picture on the background of your desktop , this picture is set up as a background picture for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; when you click on a picture , this is displayed in the picture . if you still have not opened a window with a picture , a new display device will be created . &quot;
&quot; you can also delete images in the image show . simply select the appropriate images you want to delete , and select either the remote button or select in the menu Edit selection . now you will see the window that you can see in the picture . &quot;
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can also use this problem with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . of course you &apos;ll have the pictures saved somewhere , so &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . in the picture you see the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , if not all necessary images can be loaded from the hard disk . &quot;
&quot; images in which the right upper edge is cut off , are not stored on the hard disk . however , for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , however , photos are available , so &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , so you can view the preview of this pictures . however , you can also view these pictures with the image . &quot;
&quot; as you see , this function requires that you want to copy files from folders and returns again . if you want to avoid using the question of the relevant CD . if you want to avoid trouble @-@ burning your images , please buy a bigger hard drive to save all the images . &quot;
&quot; in the menu pictures you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you would like to have a little more privacy , you would like to view the pictures that you can see for others and click on Current View all the images that you can see for others and click on the menu items all except current view . &quot;
&quot; so you have set the pictures in the case of being hidden . if you give the laptop now your little sister , you simply select the menu item pictures , allowing all the images that you have been locked . if you want to get the pictures again , click on lock . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to set a password that must be entered into account of the pictures . to set up this password , simply select password in the menu of privacy . &quot;
&quot; please remember that this picture protection is not at all very safe . for example , all pictures on the hard disk and the other can be able to read or delete the password as an un@@ encrypted text only , those with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar with regard to private pictures . &quot;
&quot; the reason why you have all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and hours of hours to spend it is of course that you want to view it at some point . for this reason , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . this is why you can preview the preview , as described in . &quot;
&quot; the viewer is able to see in . it shows of course the image , but additional all the information you have to enter into the image , such as who is on the image , when and where was it done , etc . &quot;
&quot; if the Info@@ Box on the upper part of the picture you want to see , so you can also configure your mouse into it . you can also configure , which information is displayed and whether all of these options are displayed according to a right click on the viewer . the text box menu can be shown below . &quot;
&quot; some words in the Info@@ Box are under@@ lined . if you click here it is displayed on Anne Hel@@ ene , showing the browser to you all pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you have chosen persons from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene would have chosen . &quot;
&quot; if you have loaded several pictures in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the keys image high and image . you can jump to the first and last image with Pos@@ 1 and end . these functions are also accessible from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; when several pictures are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as slides@@ how . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , then loads a new image after a few seconds . as frequently it can press a new image by pressing the str@@ g button and Plus or minus . then the slides@@ how is started through the keys C@@ tr@@ l ; S . &quot;
a very useful ability of the spect@@ ator of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in this mode uses the vie@@ wers to change the complete place on the screen . simply use the input button to switch in full text mode and back .
&quot; when you use the viewer , you can start in the picture and turn out zo@@ oming . to Her@@ e@@ o@@ omen you can easily drop a rect@@ angle . with the minus button , you can get back the plus button zo@@ om@@ t in the middle of the picture . shows like a z@@ oom @-@ rect@@ angle is marked and indicates the result of the zo@@ oms . &quot;
&quot; with the point button you can reset your z@@ oom , so that the image will not be zo@@ omed to the zo@@ oms , so each pixel puts the screen on the screen a pixel size . &quot;
&quot; note that the only zo@@ om@@ oper@@ ations that work with videos work , that they are in and out zo@@ oming with the plus @-@ grade key . &quot;
with the functions menu from the context menu you can turn the picture . this does not work with videos . you can do any comments on the current image with the menu item from the context menu .
&quot; when you look at pictures , you can see a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten on the picture . at the moment you can preview the break and configuration dialog of the picture to specify this name . however , you &apos;ll be able to highlight the picture and consider additional pictures . &quot;
&quot; another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer in order to see the images on paper . to see which photos you want , you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark it as good or bad , while you look at one after another . &quot;
&quot; for the two examples above gives you the viewer the possibility to provide images with characteristic while you watch them . characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can press a feature that you press the corresponding letters . in the picture you see a picture in which the features A , B and C are set . &quot;
&quot; once you have set features on your images , you can see in the browser . so you can see all the images you want , print or whatever you have chosen . this is described in . afterwards , you can use a module to copy the selected images on a CD or whatever you want to make . &quot;
&quot; categories and especially features can be displayed in the umb@@ nail . if you can view the categories in dre pre @-@ view view , then you can simply press the letter for the characteristic once the picture was selected . this can be seen here : &quot;
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on an image . for this case allow you &amp; k@@ photo@@ album to paint .
&quot; the mixture is not saved with the image , but in the database . the way you can und@@ o your mind later . &quot;
in the picture you can see an image in the painted menu . to turn the painting Mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . to end up the painting on the picture menu . to end the game , just hit the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window . &quot;
&quot; to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; work , you need to master the application of the program &amp; Pov@@ ray ; not complete , but the documentation to &amp; Pov@@ ray ; should you necessarily read and understood . &quot;
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are shown in the property properties and shown the object in the wire modules .
&quot; you can also select multiple objects simultaneously . but not the sub@@ object of an already chosen object , since all sub@@ items are already selected with the object . &quot;
&quot; to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu item in the menu item . &quot;
&quot; there are multiple possible positions , the following over@@ up menu appears , so that you can choose the right position : &quot;
&quot; with delete either from the menu bar under editing , or from the context menu of the right mouse button , you can remove selected objects from the scene . &quot;
&quot; if you have altered properties , click to apply these modifications . have invali@@ d values displayed , a message will be displayed with a bug description . then you can click the input cards and click the changes with Canc@@ el . &quot;
&quot; when you enter the path to &amp; Pov@@ ray ; -@@ user documentation in the interior dialog , you can view the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; reference to the indicated object with the help . &quot;
&quot; you need the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this property . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user &apos;s documentation . &quot;
&quot; if you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can view a preview in the self @-@ made view . &quot;
&quot; press review in the self @-@ made view and a small example of the scene is selected using the selected texture . as default , the entire texture is selected , even if you want to have a part of texture ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , cross locally . &quot;
the screens@@ hot shows the check@@ points of the camera . you can drag these check@@ points with the mouse button and thereby change the position and direction of the camera .
&quot; when a transformation is chosen , the control points and it becomes a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the centre for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for postpon@@ ements . you can change the shift by pul@@ ling with the mouse within the window . &quot;
each object has an visible model . you can indicate this value relatively to the visible level of the superior object or as absolute value . objects are only shown if they are selected or the visible level of visible within the tool@@ bar of the scene .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window order as a default . the object tree and view of the object @-@ properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
&quot; if you do not like the standard window order , or if you need any other arrangement , you can set it as you can . you can also store several window lists and switch between different arrangements . &quot;
&quot; to anchor a window above or under a present view , drag the anchor to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle then shows the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the anchor to the right or left of a view . the new view will then be anch@@ ored on the right or left side of this view , and extends over the overall height . &quot;
&quot; if you wish to arrange several views , drag the anchor in the middle of a different view . you can then change between the views by clicking on the cart@@ on card top in the views . &quot;
&quot; the last possible window order are narrow views : views that are not anch@@ ored in the main window . to release a view from the anch@@ oring , drag the starter on the desktop , or click on the small left at the top left at the header line . &quot;
&quot; to close a view , click on the small cross in the box . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between arrow and cross . &quot;
&quot; you can insert additional views in the main window . in the menu view , you can find entries for any type of views . new views are hur@@ ting , you can anchor it in any position . &quot;
&quot; the current window view can save you with view window order ... save it , a dialog is displayed in which you can save the window order under an existing or new name . &quot;
&quot; if you created a scene , you can ren@@ ders them . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for ren@@ dering , this program must be properly installed . as this manual is written , was &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.5 current . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 not supported . &quot;
&quot; to ren@@ dering the current scene , click on the symbol ren@@ dering the symbol ren@@ ders in the tool@@ bar or select the menu view of the scene ren@@ dering . &quot;
&quot; an install@@ ment mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; Pov@@ ray ; it determines the picture size and the quality of ren@@ dering . if you want to insert a scene in different picture sizes and quality levels , you can insert you as many R@@ ender Mo@@ di , from a quick preview to full display in the highest quality . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the icon The R@@ ender settings in the tool@@ bar , or in the menu view R@@ ender Mo@@ di ... , the following dialog will be open : &quot;
&quot; any re @-@ mode has a name . you can enter any name , but useful is a name that can recognize the characteristics of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in the cart@@ el size , you can enter the width and height of the framed image . if you want only a small area of the image , select the cross @-@ field sub@@ section and enter the image section for ren@@ dering in the input fields . &quot;
&quot; in the combination of quality , you can select the properties that uses &amp; Pov@@ ray ; this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user refl@@ ections . a detailed description of the ration@@ ale properties can be found in the user manual &amp; Pov@@ ray . &quot;
&quot; if an image with just one ray of the pixel is detected , various errors can arise . these pictures often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or stu@@ ff@@ ins in cur@@ ves and lines , moreover , sometimes details are not displayed when they are in the representation of smaller than one pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing . &quot;
&amp; Pov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of these errors . generally speaking images with this feature better .
&quot; if you turn anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calculated and connects &amp; Pov@@ ray ; more than a beam of the pixels . this technique is called super @-@ sampling . &quot;
&amp; Pov@@ ray ; supports two methods of great sampling . as standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive as the super sampling is adap@@ tive ; recur@@ sively because each pixel is always further divided and adap@@ tive because each pixel depends on the calculated colours . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray indicates a beam each pixel . if the difference between the colors to the neighboring pixels are calculated with super sampling . if you are calculated the low @-@ value on 4 points , a grid of 4x@@ 4 additional points will be calculated with a low @-@ value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixels is calculated : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixels . the difference is then : &quot;
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 beams per pixel . if the difference between color values are divided the pre @-@ borne threshold , then the pixel is checked in 4 sub @-@ pixel , which can be checked individually further and on further sub @-@ classification . the maximum depth of records can be used with the low level . &quot;
&quot; another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is that the generation of smokers for the beam process , called J@@ it@@ tering . if you dis@@ able J@@ it@@ tering , changes &amp; Pov@@ ray ; the pen@@ alties for a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
&quot; the last setting for the quality of ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; Pov@@ ray ; it takes a very long to calculate the scene with this feature .
&quot; on this map card you can set whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent , if the corresponding rays have no object hit . &quot;
&quot; opens a new window for viewing the &amp; Pov@@ ray . if &amp; Pov@@ ray is finished , you can find the reason for this . &quot;
&quot; to import a &amp; Pov@@ ray ; -@@ scene , select the menu file import ... and select a file in dialogue window . &quot;
currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet the complete command of R &amp; Pov@@ ray ; if in case of import error messages or war@@ nings shows a dialog window a list of all reports .
if you do not support HTML @-@ text in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import this source code between the two special comments / / * P@@ MR@@ aw@@ Beg@@ in and / / * P@@ MR@@ aw@@ end .
&quot; you can export objects from the object tree in the editor , to export the source text for &amp; Pov@@ ray . this adds to the source text of the object to the opened text file in the editor , simply highlight the source text in the editor and drag it into the object tree . &quot;
with copying and inser@@ ting in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can insert source text for &amp; Pov@@ ray ; also in your editor .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is Pov@@ ray or x @-@ Pov@@ ray .
&quot; click on help in the self @-@ made view , opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; user documentation for the indicated object . place the path to your documentation and version . supported the version 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Pov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example al@@ locations ) in the paths to the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; -@@ libraries . if you refer to files that are not found in the folder of the scene , you must also enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used . &quot;
the colour for the wire models . the second color is used for viewing the selected objects .
the color for the check@@ points . the second color is used for viewing the selected check@@ points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the visibility in the camera view and in the window type labels .
you can set the item from the points to the button @-@ menu in the context menu of the Dra@@ wing model views . you can set up the box separately for postpon@@ ements , scal@@ ations and rotation . &quot;
&quot; larger values give an accurate dra@@ in model , and thus a better variation for the indicated objects , but require more time to ren@@ dering . for some objects such as the ball , you can set the detailed level for two directions . &quot;
&quot; if you select the high level model for advanced proj@@ ections , all wire model views are further divided , if the camera is an extended projection . advanced proj@@ ections are all proj@@ ections with exceptions to perspective and the sen@@ k@@ right proj@@ ections . this property provides a better approach to proj@@ ections , but requires more time for ren@@ dering . &quot;
&quot; when you are viewing a wall , a wall behind the objects covered . the wall is displayed in a chess board pattern from two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; when you display floor , a floor is displayed below the objects . the floor is displayed in a chess board pattern from two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; if you activate ben@@ ign , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method used for ren@@ dering the scenes . the values for depth and swelling can be set . more accurate information on the parameters can be found in the section R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di . &quot;
on this page you can change existing window lists or create new window arrangement . in the window p@@ etting arrangements will be explained as you can create window arrangement and store .
the box type standard window order : displays all existing window regulations . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the chosen window order during the start of the program .
&quot; the list of existing window lists shows all existing window lists . a new arrangement can be created with the button , and delete a selected order with the button . &quot;
&quot; any window order is identified by the name , the name must be clear and must not be empty . &quot;
the list below the name shows all the views for the chosen window order . new views can create a button with the button and delete selected views with the button removal .
&quot; the position of the new window . with new column , you create a new column on the right side of the existing windows , with ir@@ ten anch@@ oring the window under the existing window , with map card , you get a cart@@ el view together with the previous view , but creates a separate window , but creates a separate window . &quot;
&quot; so you have just finished &amp; Pov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you would like to follow without any more exact knowledge of the two programs , you should create the ultimate but simple scene , having made very popular : a bul@@ let at one level . &quot;
&quot; but you should consider the following war@@ nings carefully before you complain that you as a result only a black screen , you should consider these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you do not set a camera , no rules for ren@@ ders are used as a result you will receive a black picture . &quot;
&quot; when you insert no light sources , your whole scene lies in the dark and you only receive a black picture . &quot;
if you have anything fl@@ aw@@ less installed , take a look at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following pre @-@ defined window order : &quot;
&quot; take a little time to know the menus and the available symbols of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation , so that you can get an adequate idea of what you can expect from this program . &quot;
&quot; you will have to use these menus and symbols now frequently , so you should remember the menus and symbols and also their application . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; start with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you must first remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu @-@ order editing . so you now have a scene without objects . &quot;
&quot; the wire model shows how the camera considers the whole scene that you generate . in particular , this is the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the ren@@ der@@ ns of the scene . &quot;
&quot; the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you will see the content of the property Properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user &apos;s documentation ; find additional details . &quot;
&quot; change nothing to the basic settings of the camera , this is later instructions reserved , but note that you can change the camera in the view points . just click with the left mouse button on a check @-@ point and drag it to the desired place . &quot;
&quot; if you apply the button or enter the input , the wire model views and the lens tree change immediately according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the view of the camera . &quot;
&quot; there are lots of options to create the ground for the scene . you could include an Qu@@ ader ( inser@@ ting body Qu@@ ader ) and size on x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a reverse method for solving this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually offers a simple option . you can use an infinite plane as ground :
&quot; a good advice : select the plane in the object tree , change the name and then press the button . in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately . &quot;
&quot; the wire model shows now also the level , even if at the moment only as a limited level . if you ren@@ dering the scene , the level is stretched up to the horizon . &quot;
&quot; if you watch the object tree , you will notice that you click on the icon + before the object . you will see the different parameters of the object . in this case , you will see the different parameters of the object . in this case you will see only the standard options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the object properties . &quot;
&quot; in this scene you should move the floor to exercise a unit under the horizon , just so you can get to know some of these parameters . select shift and place the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; only choose the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose a little cre@@ ek at the moment . &quot;
&quot; in both cases , a dialogue will be displayed in which you can select how the object can be inserted . please select the name in the self @-@ box view ( name = bottom @-@ pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button preview you can see how the pig@@ ment now looks . &quot;
&quot; of course , the P@@ review of the pig@@ ments only shows a Matt@@ es black material because you can still enter settings for the pig@@ ment . you are now thinking about the colors for the pig@@ ment . also , there are many possibilities , but now take the easiest way . &quot;
&quot; if you do not preview color on qu@@ ader and ball , click on the button and then call the preview . &quot;
&quot; the material for the ground is now displayed correctly . if you are using your image now with a click on the icon , you should get the following results : &quot;
&quot; of course , this is not the colour . you need to enter two new attributes . here you need to do two new attributes . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this even more frequently , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
&quot; choose an object tree in the object tree , change the colors in the view of the object properties : &quot;
&quot; this step should you already be able to perform , because you should have understood the fundamental working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; already , the ball is just as easy as the ground : &quot;
&quot; in the view of the object properties you can instantly change the settings : on 1 ( do not forget the input bag or the button ) , so that the bul@@ let down contact with the ground . otherwise , the ball would turn off the bottom , because you have moved the ground around a unit down . &quot;
&quot; of course the ren@@ dering now results a strange result : as before , the ball surface like a Matt@@ es black material . put in the following step a suitable material . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the ball , you can now draw a material . as already at the bottom , you give the ball a pig@@ ment as color : &quot;
&quot; select First sub@@ object and change the name for example in ball pig@@ ment . click on the ball pig@@ ment , then select the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; however , you can reach more interesting effects if you take time to stop some Finish properties : &quot;
&quot; then change the values as in the following screen photos and click , or press the input . &quot;
&quot; the attitudes and reflection comes already partly good visual effects , perfect for glass or ch@@ rom@@ ed surfaces , even if metal : not even selected : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good impression of what possibilities you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; hopefully , you have already learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ tr@@ ay@@ cing is a disp@@ enser method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
&quot; if you have a scene ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ts , sho@@ ots the ren@@ derer hyp@@ othe@@ tical rays from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that reflects the scenes ) through every pixel in the scene . the ration@@ ale will affect the visual effects of light sources in the scene and as atmospheric effects , such as fo@@ g effects . thus , the scene pixels are processed for pixel . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you will see nothing without a camera , the camera is your eye , with which you see the scene . without a light source you see also nothing , the image is simply black . obviously , any scene which should be en@@ coded , some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
in the usual file dialog you can select your file . Pov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the standard file dialog you can select a file that you have previously made with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
&quot; whenever you open a new model , the file will be inserted in this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have already saved the model , it will be saved under the same name . if a new file , you must enter a name and storage space . &quot;
the scene in the last stored version has been revi@@ ved . all changes since the last stor@@ ing storage are dis@@ car@@ ded .
&quot; this menu , you can only select this menu if you still have not stored any changes in the scene . &quot;
&quot; repeatedly the previous command . this menu item can only select , if you have used mach@@ ining . &quot;
&quot; saves the current window order and opens a dialog in which you can enter a name for a new arrangement , or write an existing arrangement . &quot;
&quot; in this menu you will find options for setting up &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; , here you can change the look , the short@@ cuts and the standard behavior . &quot;
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can modify or add new orders to this option with this option .
opens a dialog to set up the tool@@ bar . you can add and remove this option tool tool@@ bar for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; orders and remove .
&quot; a B@@ ump @-@ Map is a way to pre@@ ach bol@@ ts , without any b@@ ump on the surface individually modeling and without changing the geomet@@ rical form of the object itself . &quot;
it is common to use the same file for a B@@ ump map as well as for a texture map .
&quot; basic body are simple geomet@@ rical shapes , which you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are generated from doz@@ ens or even hundreds of this basic body . these models are then processed to give them a realistic appearance . &quot;
&quot; texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on the pixel base , using a picture file as a color map . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a comfortable picture , and your browser . the application has a file browser , where you can choose pictures to display . &quot;
images can be displayed either in an own window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files which you can display with clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the button Return .
&quot; you can set whether any picture shall be displayed in an own window , or whether all pictures should always use the same window . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for a specific file , simply tap the first signs of the file in browser window . then appears a small entrance field in the lower right corner . if an appropriate fil@@ en@@ ame was found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing by return or &amp; Es@@ c . &quot;
&quot; in dialogue - &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; there are five boxes of cards . in three of them , general and editing and slides@@ how , you can set the way working of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; set in the two others , short command@@ line for the browser , can set the key@@ note for the respective window . &quot;
&quot; if the image is selected , then the images are opened in full screen mode . if the image is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background color , which you can set down below . default mode is not a full @-@ screen mode . &quot;
&quot; if this point is activated , invites &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; already the next picture in the folder , while you can see the current picture . this reduces the delay when you choose the next picture and is particularly suitable for slides@@ how . &quot;
&quot; with this option , &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; when writing the names of the most recently opened folder . when the next start opens &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; this folder will open in the browser window . &quot;
&quot; click on the coloured beams to select a background color . this is used in order to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is bigger than the picture , the background is filled with the selected color . &quot;
&quot; you can set &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show , so set that only some of the data types will display which the program can also be present . &quot;
this option is enlarged for large images the ad set on the full screen . this option is switched as default .
determine whether the slides@@ how is to start with the first image in the folder or with the selected picture .

&amp; show@@ photo ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; photo@@ processing based on the &amp; digi@@ tization ; picture editing . &amp; show@@ photo ; is part of the &amp; digi@@ tization ; project .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a quick image editing with some powerful base tools . you can use it to view your photos and implement correc@@ tions and modification .
&quot; as the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is a show@@ photo ; an open source project . this means it depends on the user to contribute to its part , at least issues and possible improvements . &quot;
&quot; a show@@ photo ; makes it easy to report as easy as possible errors or possible improvements . this displays a dialog with a link . if you are using this , your browser will open a page to reports of problems and wishes . all required information is already filled out , and you can simply follow the instructions to display your message . &quot;
&quot; a show@@ photo ; is a project supported by a community . that is , that users and developers will help each other . if you have a frequent user of &amp; show@@ photo . however , we would like to answer any other users from &amp; show@@ photo . in this mailing list , however , we would be able to answer any questions about other users . in this mailing list , however , you should be able to be powerful in this language . &quot;
the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ photo ; to participate is it the developer mailing list . guide to join the developer mailing list of &amp; show@@ photo ; .
&amp; show@@ photo ; attempts to give you as much control over his work procedures as possible . there are many options to set the behaviour of &amp; show@@ photo . to set up on these settings you need to set up the Settings show@@ photo . you can switch between these settings by pressing on the symbols of the left side .
&quot; in the area of se@@ aling Indi@@ c@@ ators , you can select the color that is displayed when the sub @-@ or over@@ se@@ aling indic@@ t@@ ator should display the colors with what you should display , in contrast , a dark color and over@@ hau@@ ling should display a dark color . &quot;
the main window of &amp; show@@ photo ; possesses a side bar at the right edge that provides you important information and actions on the selected images . the same side bar can be found in the image editing . you can display this in which you click on one of the five tab :
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an application for the scan of images which does not make more than images to sc@@ ans and rep@@ lic@@ ted .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; it is a simple application to scan images . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; can open a dialog to stor@@ ing and store the images in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can also display the images in front of the storage box .
you can check the status of the support of your scanner on the SAN@@ E project page by submitting the necessary information on this page : http : / / www.s@@ ane @-@ project@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be placed on the command line of &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; with the command sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; can be set in terminal . if this scanner cannot be opened or if no standard scanner was specified then a dialog to choose the scanner product .
the user can select the scanner scanner and press OK to open the scanner . break down &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite .
the other settings contain more detailed options of drivers . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) treated these options particularly .
&quot; to start a picture , the user can only start a lecture can start and then scan the scanning area for the final scan . the outlet can start through the preview button . &quot;
&quot; to select the image better , the user can choose from the image and out of the current selection out zo@@ oming . it can also adjust the z@@ oom so that the complete preview fits the window . &quot;
when the picture was selected and the final image can be read with the scan button .
&quot; when on the stor@@ ing a preview display in the settings , then the image is displayed in a for@@ ged , as shown below is displayed , then the image will be saved and thr@@ ust ? en leads to a break@@ age and you will get back into the main window . &quot;
&quot; through the button settings , the ep@@ onymous dialog will open in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here . &quot;
&quot; the user can view the image , if desired , before the stor@@ ing . in this case the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be cancelled . &quot;
&quot; this option allows them to select the type as &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; pictures saves the dialogue for each picture opens the dialogue in front of each image . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite , this automatically opens up with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you must also select saving without any fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
&quot; this setting defines where the images are stored when the option are saving without after a fil@@ en@@ ame , then this folder is used as standard for dialogue on saving . the default value is your home directory and you can change it with the button ... change . &quot;
&quot; this parameter defines a pre@@ fix for the automatically re@@ generated pictures and is furthermore the proposed name for the image in dialogue on saving . the automatically stored image gets a num@@ eric su@@ ff@@ ix of each time , when a picture is saved . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers . &quot;
&quot; the user can custom@@ ize the quality of image quality . this value also changes the com@@ pression value when saving . if Cho@@ ose the image quality is not selected , then the default value is used by Q@@ t . &quot;
the button aid starts KDE @-@ help with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; hand@@ book . the button About starts the KDE About -@@ Di@@ alogue for &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; the button settings shows the dialog for the settings and can be used to finish &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite .

&amp; amar@@ ok ; uses like all other programs key@@ boards . below you can set up a list of these cuts and their function . the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ specific keyboard shor@@ ts you can set up by clicking the right mouse button in the player window and choose short command @-@ command .
&quot; you may set up existing multimedia table so set that they work as &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; thus , make your keyboard for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ Control Center . &quot;
&quot; the D@@ CO@@ P interface from Amar@@ ok has many general functions , most of them can also be found in other KDE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context @-@ browser , player , playlist , play@@ lists and scripts . just look like this : &quot;
Amar@@ ok supports the command lines from Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; . additionally , Amar@@ ok has some own command lines . &quot;
&quot; you should give the user a feedback if the script should not be executed on account of any missing dependence . please check in your script , if all required modules are available and use k@@ dialog , so that the user will not pass , why a script doesn &apos;t run . &quot;

&quot; in the folder Scrip@@ ts / , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use it as base for your own scripts , or you can easily find the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple . &quot;
&quot; with the help of D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can replace data with Amar@@ o@@ and . the easiest way is to use the command d@@ co@@ p , which should be attached to every KDE installation . &quot;
most scrip@@ ting languages permit the exp@@ ir@@ ation of external programs and commands . this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can usually be called ex@@ ec &gt; relatively simple . here is an example in Python : &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ a ; send messages to all running scripts . for this reason , you should constantly monitor their default edition and respond accordingly to events . of course , a script should also ignore the events if there is no use of it . &quot;
&quot; configure points the script to view the interior dialog . to take the saving and loading of the furnishings , each script must take care of each script . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok the working folder on the folder , where all data should be saved . &quot;
tr@@ ack@@ change sign@@ aled that a new piece is played . the script could now ask for example ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions for more information on the new piece ( for example the met@@ ad@@ ata or the rod @-@ length ) .
vol@@ um@@ e@@ Change new@@ volume sign@@ alized a change of the volume . the new volume is an int@@ eger between 0 and 100 .
&quot; custom@@ men@@ u@@ cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu item@@ Tit@@ le , ab@@ st@@ ains the path to the selected files of the playlist , if a user @-@ defined menu item can also be delivered to the menu item using the cli@@ p @-@ function d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu item@@ Tit@@ le ) . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; amar@@ ok ; termin@@ ates , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed , for example the saving of data or configuration settings . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ oks script administration may also install script packages , which can be downloaded with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ b@@ z@@ 2 ) , which is optional also with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ b@@ z@@ 2 ) , which is optional also with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ b@@ z@@ 2 ) , so that the user can clearly recognize the archive as a Amar@@ ok script package . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 is only accept script packages with Ex@@ plan@@ ing amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason you should name your script packages just right .
&quot; the main cri@@ pt must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to obtain the file right : &quot;
if your script package is ready you can download it at www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.org and the link to the Wi@@ ki script page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; click . for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; script .
&amp; amar@@ ok ; is an audio Player for &amp; k@@ de ; but &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful functions and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of going through endless menus . with &amp; amar@@ ok ; &apos;s collecting browser and quick search will be found the piece within seconds .
&quot; maybe you have already some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which you want to hear ? then , the playlist browser is exactly the right thing for you . and if the decision still falls heavily , select the dynamic mode and the intelligent play@@ lists automatically retri@@ eve the right music according to certain criteria . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ o@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers IF@@ P and many generic USB systems . besides , many different audio systems can be used , so that SI@@ E can listen to your music . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right to experience your music new ! &quot;
&quot; usually one has to enter the basic folder of the Amar@@ o@@ source sources , to compile Amar@@ o@@ ok and install : &quot;
&quot; da &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake is used , you should not compile any trouble . if you encounter problems , please report it in the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications some options to enable or dis@@ able them to compens@@ ate item with the configure script or dis@@ able it . this is a list of available options .
&quot; for some of the comp@@ iling options , certain dependen@@ cies must be fulfilled so that they can be used . details can be found in the system requirements . &quot;
&quot; enabled de@@ bug@@ ging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help at the development of &amp; Amar@@ a ; you should use full use . &quot;
&amp; amar@@ ok ; can set up on the interior dialog with no effort . the dialog dialog has several cardboard cards to set the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ;
&quot; player window display the player window in addition to the playlist , or off . if the option is switched off , only the play@@ lists will be sho@@ wn@@ ess Ju@@ K . &quot;
&quot; voting bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar , the option switched off the experimental function of the voting bar@@ ometer . &quot;
voting full : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar was compiled . this is the used color scheme for the mood bar@@ ometer .
&quot; voting files in the music files are stored , this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in the settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; stored ( normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) . &quot;
&quot; external browser : lets you choose which browsers are run by &amp; Amar@@ o@@ , when a browser is needed . &quot;
use other browser : here you can specify the path to another browser which is not in the list above .
&quot; playlist when saving , the current playlist will automatically save the receipt of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok . activate this option if you want to lose the current playlist when you don &apos;t want to lose . &quot;
&quot; relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : if you activate this attitude , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , use . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files is stored . &quot;
&quot; in the piece of changes , the play@@ lists are visible to keep the play@@ lists windows - / off @-@ roll in order to keep the current piece always in the visible window . &quot;
switch to the context of the context of the context @-@ browser automatically displays the context @-@ browser to be played once the next piece is played .
in the section Ap@@ pear@@ ance you can adapt &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s appearance can be adjusted in three parts .
&quot; in the fonts , you can use the use of various fonts in &amp; amar@@ ok . you can select fonts for the following range : play@@ lists windows , player windows and context @-@ browser . press to select ... so you can choose a desired font from the selection dialog . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of custom colour scheme , you even set the qu@@ al of choice and can set a separate color scheme . apply to this under@@ lines the activated paint selection for front and background color . &quot;
&quot; playing at the start will continue , that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after the program start playing the reproduction automatically with the piece on the spot , with which they stopped at the last finish . &quot;
&quot; the sub @-@ screen display allows you to turn the switch of the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can preview the effect of all settings in this preview . &quot;
&quot; the first option is the scrip@@ tures . click on the select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD , which indicates the text in the O@@ SD sh@@ aded . &quot;
&quot; use own colors gives you the opportunity to adjust the O@@ SD colors for font and background . one click on the color areas opens the dialog to the color selection . if the colors do not use , the pre @-@ called &amp; k@@ de ; colors used . &quot;
the input field text displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD text . by type of spac@@ ing the O@@ SD can be adjusted to your own needs . below you can find a list of available space holder and what they mean .
&quot; the option screen is intended for X@@ in@@ ama users . so you can specify , on which screen a multi @-@ way monitor environment should appear . &quot;
the cart@@ el audio version allows you to select an audio driver from the selection box . some drivers activate another settings in this map card .
the map card collection is used for placing all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
&quot; here you can select the folder , which is called &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ; according to music files . to include a folder in the collection , just highlight the cross @-@ box next to its name . this section also contains An@@ cross @-@ fields to place , as with the selected folders . &quot;
&quot; sub@@ folders re@@ cur@@ ated : this causes , that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the command@@ ed as well as their sub@@ folders according to music . &quot;
&quot; changes : allows &amp; amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folder on changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . besides , a incre@@ mental search will be done to make the necessary changes to your collection . &quot;
&quot; play@@ lists : result , that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; all found play@@ lists in your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ s- and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists appear later in the play@@ lists . &quot;
&quot; the part collecting database is used for selecting a database for the collection . the combination box driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ ql . if My@@ S@@ ql is selected , another institution is necessary in the Unter@@ S@@ ql facility . &quot;
&quot; the My@@ S@@ ql @-@ institution is used for placing the database for &amp; Amar@@ o@@ . under calcul@@ ator , the machine is entered under port : the network port entered under which the database is accessed . name : is the database name , to which the database is established . &quot;
use user name : and password : to enter the data that is required for connection to the database .
&quot; the cart@@ on load bur@@ .@@ f@@ m is aimed at support for bur@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of players at a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server , and create music recommendations for the current piece . &quot;
&quot; here you enter your username and password for your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you do not have a profile , you can register one at the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website . &quot;
&quot; re@@ arranged pieces send and thus update the profile : this option allows to transmit it &amp; Amar@@ ok , to transmit the names of the played pieces to your load @-@ load profile . &quot;
similar interpre@@ ters retri@@ eve : after activation of this setting will be retri@@ eve &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a list of similar artists can be retri@@ eved from each other . note : you can use the list in the context @-@ browser settings . note : you do not need any load @-@ load @-@ profile to use this function .
&amp; amar@@ ok ; is an audio Player for Unix systems ( like &amp; eg ; Linux ) . further information can be found in the summary of the functions and gallery with screens@@ hot .
&quot; Amar@@ o@@ ok requires only the package K@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other KDE packages . you have to install K@@ deli@@ bs ( including the included programs , because &amp; amar@@ ok ; it needs some of them written by such as modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide , how to compile K@@ deli@@ bs minimal . &quot;
&quot; some features such as O@@ SD must advance that your window manager will stop the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . GNO@@ ME will thus work , but flu@@ x@@ box will help for example . we try to support Amar@@ o@@ bs on all platforms , so we use K@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because these are an excellent development environment . &quot;
probably one of your files will make a mistake in the conference library to days . you can see the file by clicking in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps
&quot; mostly , that Tag@@ lib is stor@@ med by reading the met@@ a @-@ info from this file . please report this bug to the Tag@@ b developers under bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; if you use MySQL as a database , then try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is something mature . &quot;
&quot; make sure all of &amp; Amar@@ a ; used libraries with the same comp@@ iler version have been compiled . if e.g. &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with GCC 3.4 , Tag@@ li@@ b , but with GCC 3.@@ 3.@@ x compiled , then this leads to dis@@ pl@@ unge in the processing of the met@@ a @-@ information . &quot;
&quot; if you use KDE using art@@ s@@ d , then de@@ activate the machine , if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second . &quot;
&quot; you can also send us the Back@@ pack via e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens at a crash ) . if it is a frequent background , the error is guaranteed . &quot;
&quot; this is because many programs can write data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 in the met@@ a @-@ info , but they do not feature Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem . &quot;
# ! / usr / bin / perl the &quot; The file $ ar@@ g@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib@@ - &gt; new ( $ ar@@ g@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ day , amp ; U@@ TF@@ 8 ) ; &quot;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos;@@ install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &quot;
&quot; &amp; amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( random smo@@ dus ) see in KDE 3.@@ 4.0 always active . this is a well @-@ known bug in KDE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , you can click the status @-@ effects on grey and semi @-@ transparent . note that in some cases you have to click on a symbol until three times it shows their effect . &quot;
if you receive this bug : amar@@ ok@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : un@@ a symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then please check if Amar@@ ok the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen by ld@@ d &apos;@@ sch@@ amar@@ ok@@ app &apos;s _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p Q@@ t . &quot;
&quot; to fix this bug , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ating Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok will find the right version first . &quot;
there are some possibilities . most installation problems clear by the help of a experts your Uni@@ xes or Linux distribution . you can also use help with other users or for developers . use them for the forum and IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ de@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ ok .
&quot; Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for assistance . please enter there only one mistake , if you find something at the removal of an error in Amar@@ ok itself . &quot;
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; appears only a blank playlist . how do they get music pieces here ?
this is easy . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
to keep the surface intuitive to keep the start -@@ window into the statisti@@ c window . you will find it under Extr@@ as statistics .
&quot; the meaning of these symbols has been modified with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are available for the review by the user , while the points are automatically calculated . &quot;
&quot; to evaluate pieces , must be displayed in the playlist by clicking the playlist . click anywhere in the new application column , to set the review for a piece . you can also use the short @-@ command windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ o@@ ok in the background . &quot;
&quot; select the files you want to remove , and then press un@@ f on your keyboard . or click on your selection and select from playlist remove from the pop@@ up menu . &quot;
drag a playlist file with the mouse into the playlist and let them fall exactly how you would make it with other files too . so simple is that : - )
&quot; in the tool@@ bar of the playlist , right beside the add @-@ button , is to save the button playlist . click on it . &quot;
probably you lack the program x@@ mm@@ s @-@ config . install the package x@@ mm@@ s @-@ de@@ vel and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . take a look at lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ ali@@ zations . &quot;
the E@@ quali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . also you can find it via the menu bar under Extr@@ as E@@ quali@@ zer ....
&quot; none . yes , that really is true ! none ! &amp; amar@@ ok ; uses a back@@ end independent approach , so the real question loud Which media types supports G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even run text and P@@ NG . &quot;
&quot; you can ! maybe use Fed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which are not supplied by any MP3 de@@ coder ( for pat@@ ent@@ legal reasons ) . the solution : alt @-@ F@@ 2 , g@@ g : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , input &quot;
start the Ya@@ ST Online update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s from : - )
&quot; if you use the G@@ stre@@ amer driver with the AL@@ SA @-@ S@@ ink , the device has to use a bl@@ ender . a bl@@ ender allows multiple applications to use the machine at the same time ( e.g. SB@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for AL@@ SA ( e.g. SB@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for AL@@ SA . &quot;
&quot; the output of this instruction should help you find the problem guide and a solution . for G@@ stre@@ amer , you might need to indicate another S@@ ink ( e.g. os@@ s@@ ) . &quot;
&quot; this is doing &amp; Amar@@ ok ; already . do not forget that media first de@@ coding will need . G@@ Stre@@ amer is the best choice if you &apos;re looking for a decade or with little over@@ head . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ coded it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
&quot; also X@@ M@@ MS de@@ coding the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can spend directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; use either the G@@ stre@@ amer drivers ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open sound server with highest priority ( real time listing ) and increase the size of the sound @-@ bu@@ ffer ( warning , see next Point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ s@@ wr@@ ap@@ per su@@ id is set : &quot;
&quot; at KDE 3.@@ 2.@@ X there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia co@@ dec@@ s , the disturbed reproduction . read this error report . the magni@@ fier of the sound @-@ buff@@ ers in your AL@@ SA @-@ furnishings .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help . &quot;
&quot; either do not use the Arts @-@ drivers , instead of G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install KDE multimedia completely to get the faster Arts co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; probably you use the Arts drivers . use another drivers ( the x@@ ine driver ) , or reduce the size of the Arts bu@@ ffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller of the bu@@ ffer , the less earnings are responding to visu@@ alization . yes , this is an error , please help us fix it . &quot;
&quot; G@@ stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to change to the G@@ stre@@ amer driver , cr@@ ashes &amp; amar@@ ok . why ? &quot;
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer you must register all components . run G@@ ST @-@ register to register all G@@ stre@@ amer components .

&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program burning audio or data @-@ CD @-@ R@@ s in a run ( also disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or D@@ ao ) based on a text @-@ like description of the CD content ( TO@@ C ) .
&quot; &amp; cd@@ record ; : burning all kinds of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; cd@@ record ; however , all functions , which also offers &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o , and extends these functions . therefore , &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; usually reached &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o , but for a higher quality at burned audio CDs . &quot;
cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) . on the Internet such programs are generally known as ri@@ pper .
og@@ g Pre @-@ up library : og@@ g pres@@ ump@@ kin is a completely open , pat@@ ent@@ free and professional technology for audio coding and for dealing with audio data flow . og@@ g pres@@ et benefits from open source and stands in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by the O@@ g@@ g Pre @-@ Dec@@ o@@ der@@ - and En@@ coder modules . &quot;
&quot; MA@@ D : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG @-@ audio dec@@ oder . currently , MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers layers I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by MP3 de@@ coder . &quot;
&quot; ame : a far developed MP3 de@@ coder , which can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial En@@ co@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by MP3 @-@ En@@ coder module . &quot;
FL@@ AC : a free open source co@@ dec for lost @-@ free audio com@@ pression and de@@ com@@ pression . it is used by FL@@ AC @-@ Dec@@ oder module and the external audio connector module , allowing you to read FL@@ AC files . &quot;
&quot; Lib@@ sn@@ d@@ file , FF@@ m@@ peg , FL@@ AC , Mus@@ ep@@ ack Dec@@ oder : other libraries for the processing of various audio formats . with FF@@ m@@ peg it is possible to de@@ code it to a audio CD to comb@@ us@@ en.@@ de@@ co . &quot;
&quot; SO@@ x : a relief program that can convert between different audio formats , and convert . SO@@ x is used by the SO@@ x Audio En@@ coder module . &quot;
trans@@ code : a command line program for video development . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
&quot; V@@ CD@@ Im@@ ager : an integrated author system for processing , dis@@ assem@@ bling and analy@@ sing of video CDs and super @-@ video CDs . &quot;
norm@@ alize : this tool is used to match the volume of music files to a standard level . this can be used for example to create rented CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize the different recording of the various albums lead to the un@@ nice effect that the music pieces differ according to the unlimited effect .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and automatically reproduce all videos in the base folder of the CD .
&quot; this is a convenient method , recently opened projects again . the related sub @-@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on an entry opens the project . &quot;
&quot; saves the current project . if the project has already been stored once , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it is asked for a new file name . &quot;
saves the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ame . KDE &apos;s dialog Save under is displayed with which you can choose the folder and fil@@ en@@ ame for the project file .
saves all open projects . this is the same as if you would save for each individual project file .
&quot; closes the current project . if a project is changed and not saved , asks &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after what has to happen . you can then switch between stor@@ ing and changes . besides , you can also break down and keep the project so opened . &quot;
&quot; includes all open projects . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for every non @-@ stored project , which should happen to happen , just as if you were called for each project file . &quot;
&quot; includes all open projects and ends &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; for each non @-@ stored project is asked , what should happen to happen , as if you have called the file . &quot;
&quot; when you view this entry , you can select via the subject dialog files to add the project . this has the same effect when you get the files directly from the top view into the project opinion . if the current project has a data CD , appear as added files in the base folder of the CD . &quot;
&quot; open dialogue &quot; burning &quot; for the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the qualities dialogue of the project . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; for burning the media dialog can only open when the project already contains data . &quot;
&quot; opens the properties dialog for the current project . here , you can make a lot of project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of them are described above the What is that ? -@@ Help described ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . &quot;
this entry appears only with an active data @-@ CD / DVD or video DVD project . it is useful when you use files for a multi @-@ session CD . this is useful when you have not used files for a multi @-@ session CD . it is intended for you to see the files available on the medium already existing files and folders .
&quot; this entry appears only for an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function promp@@ ted &amp; K@@ 3@@ b , imported files from the current project . this function remo@@ ves any files from the medium , they bl@@ ends only the previously imported files again . &quot;
&quot; opens the CD @-@ copying dialog . this also allows without a project file the copying of a CD to another medium . alternatively , you can also burn only one image of a CD which you can then burn later . besides , there are also the possibility of K@@ lon@@ ens instead of normal copying . you should copy cl@@ ones if you want to copy CDs with def@@ ective sectors or video CDs . &quot;
&quot; opens the DVD copying dialog . this also allows without a project file the copying of a DVD to another medium . alternatively , you can also be able to burn out a DVD with the help of copying dialogue . furthermore , the target medium must be big enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source medi@@ ums in the original form . &quot;
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ R@@ W . this allows you to delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ R@@ W .
&quot; open dialogue to form@@ atting a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , whereby the content can be completely deleted . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b , lets you choose between the writing mod@@ i and incre@@ mentally . &quot;
&quot; bur@@ ns a previously er@@ ased CD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o , * .c@@ ue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source , which is then immediately supported by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .n@@ p files are currently not supported , for this you have to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . ) &quot;
&quot; burning a previously er@@ ased DVD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o file as a source source , which can then be burned down by pressing the burning button . &quot;
&quot; an earlier DVD video can be converted . this dialog window will usually be used after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used all @-@ standing settings and even options to change the size and cut black edges . &quot;
&quot; displays information about the occasion@@ al medium . this information is displayed in the content view and contain properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD . &quot;
&quot; displays a list of tool@@ bar of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is crossed , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window . &quot;
&quot; when this is crossed , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not crossed , the status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; turn the folder view or off . the folder view contains an overview of your folder and CD / DVD drives . if the content is enabled , its content is displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , locking and un@@ locking of the drives or le@@ aking of the medium . &quot;
&quot; turn the ingredients view one or from . the ingredients allows to select and drag files into the project view . the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , provided a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view . &quot;
&quot; folded the p@@ aving in the project view or out . the p@@ ending is a narrow range , which contains only visible when the project view contains open projects . the p@@ ending has no real function , it looks only pretty and separates the project view clearly from the remaining views . &quot;
&quot; this opens a dialogue window to change the buttons for &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after you have chosen one of the available commands in the upper part , one can adapt the buttons to further down . &quot;
&quot; this will start the K@@ 3@@ b ; furnishings assist@@ ants . thus , the correct permission for burning CDs and DVDs are required . for this , system managers will need to enter the password for the system managers ( root ) . &quot;
&quot; opens the settings of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; here you can set general terms and functions . almost all functions of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b , should work on An@@ hi@@ eb . this dialog is intended for person@@ alize and stimulating the program . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also , with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface is equipped with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled for example above one shell script . &quot;
&quot; to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions to use , you can either use the command line d@@ co@@ p , or something more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are crucial to the function , therefore it is more likely to give your taste and type of your tasks . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter we assume that you can use the command line d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions , you must make sure that &amp; K@@ 3@@ b . then enter something like the following at console : &quot;
&quot; beside the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions , all &amp; k@@ de ; program common , supports &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts described below . &quot;
&quot; the Standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b , features functions such as copy@@ CD , form@@ at@@ DVD and other features for generating new projects . &quot;

&quot; for example , it is possible to fill a data @-@ project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folder and then add files to the new folder : &quot;

&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ read@@ able for &amp; k@@ de ; . with him all simply audio CD ; s can be read and installed in MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG files . also other formats are possible depending on the En@@ coder that is installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the user interface of cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( com@@ press ) . currently l@@ ame for MP3 , og@@ gen@@ c support for O@@ G@@ Gs and FL@@ AC ( abandoned @-@ free com@@ pression ) . further codes must be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) . &quot;
&quot; first , the titles of the &amp; CD ; read and stored in W@@ AV files on the computer ( lost @-@ free and com@@ pressed ) ; and then &quot;
&quot; in a second step this W@@ AV files ( usually one per title ) com@@ pressed into the MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG format , or in other formats like the verl@@ ay FL@@ AC . &quot;
&quot; for the first step , the reading of the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must now be done . &quot;
&quot; for the second step must be l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ until ( for O@@ GG ) or other Ko@@ di@@ erer installed . all these programs are usually not necessary for any Linux distri@@ butions available . however , only the codi@@ fication packages are not used , the installation is also not required . &quot;
which Ko@@ di@@ er@@ er- / File Format should be used ? the chapter Which Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction to Ko@@ di@@ erer , audio quality and com@@ pression factors . &quot;
&quot; a word to copying protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read the protection of the audio CD ; if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; in any case , it is not possible to handle a protected audio CD ; do not simply avoid the mechanisms of cop@@ ier @-@ protected audio CD ; s ! &quot;
&quot; while the dialog box must be made only once ( the furnishings dialog cannot be called until a suitable configuration has been found ) , after the daily handling of a &amp; CD ; this results ( hopefully ) for understanding the sl@@ ender approach of the user interface , over which you will often stum@@ ble at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; can convert into many formats - depending on which coding or installed programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FL@@ AC &amp; etc ; ) &quot;
&quot; can &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB can get out of the internet or can work completely without a network , whereby everything is manually recorded . &quot;
&quot; this is just a brief list of commands of the main window . on the page step by step , you will find further information about how this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of regi@@ sters for the configuration of the program . &quot;
&quot; starts the CD@@ DB inquiry of the CD @-@ data according to the establishment of request in the tab card CD@@ DB . ( this can be locally or online , in the latter case the link must be made to the Internet . ) &quot;
starts the reading and - if a En@@ coder into the tab card settings in the furnishings have been configured - the coding .
&quot; opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available En@@ coder , so that selecting a different En@@ coder is to be read as the default . it is to be noted that before the En@@ coder is configured in the tab . &quot;
&quot; opens the file manager , so that one already selected file to code is selected instead of a complete &amp; CD ; to read and to run . &quot;
&quot; opens the interior dialog to configure the type of al@@ erts ( such as protocols , Pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for Program@@ mers ( such as read the &amp; CD ; termin@@ ates ) . &quot;
&quot; opens the main dialog dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with various cardboard cards ( such as En@@ coder , to set up the En@@ co@@ ders ) . here you have to go before the program can be successfully used ! &quot;
&quot; this section describes sound quality , codi@@ fication and com@@ pression rates and helps you choose the right body . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information is supposed to go , a lost audio format is needed . besides FL@@ AC , there are also others like &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may possibly be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are the low com@@ pression rates and hardly any available commercial devices that can reproduce these files . &quot;
&quot; among the audio formats , the information generated by data com@@ pressed according to their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit@@ rate the differences become less important as both codi@@ fication will produce very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , l@@ ame will still be delivered with most distri@@ butions free , but there are open license questions . &quot;
+ high up to very high quality quality ( with high bit@@ rates ) but compared with O@@ GG slightly deeper quality for deeper bit@@ rates .
og@@ g - if only music should be heard from a computer or machine @-@ based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG copies exists .
&quot; MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices like standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special car stere@@ o@@ ids . today - initially , these devices are mostly only the MP3 format . &quot;
a brief list of parameters for audio quality and com@@ pres@@ et com@@ pression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for other parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer transparency for most people and most of the music pieces unacceptable transparency , and has quite high quality . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stere@@ o@@ systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , com@@ pression @-@ rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stere@@ o@@ systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , com@@ pression rate about 5.5 . needs always 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a tit@@ els . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stere@@ o@@ systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos;@@ = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR common stereo , com@@ pression rate about 11th 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a tit@@ els . good gen@@ ug for music of young people , portable devices and auto@@ stere@@ o@@ ids . but not good enough for better Hi@@ Fi stere@@ o@@ systems . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et st@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ K@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size , then select this setting . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; CD ; information , which are entered manually or by the program automatically generated from the free@@ DB over the internet , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / or are used with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the body &apos;s code as well as the characteristics of the music files . &quot;
&quot; in connection with Ko@@ di@@ er@@ programs , there is often a combination of programmes for the codi@@ fication and these parameters . the manual or the help to the codi@@ fication declare the switch for these programs . &quot;
&quot; for example , to add the &amp; CD ; title to the key@@ word ( English : day ) if MP@@ 3@@ s are coded by l@@ ame , the switch -@@ tt of l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; added . the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; . &quot;
this is a summary of &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button @-@ drawing ) :
&quot; that &apos;s what the free@@ DB is : a free database , in which people can download the audio CDs , so that all others can download it . it is to be noted that here only by text is spoken : &amp; CD ; titles , artists , names of pieces &amp; etc ; not from the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal , but I am meant to be legal . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; any more or less valuable , so that neither the artist nor the music business can be added . all the information can be added to the artist &apos;s music by a &amp; CD ; business , physically or virtual . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is active in a cross @-@ box address ( sending an address ) . in this type of configuration , it seems that the e @-@ mail address can not be used by server ( but it can only know the programmer who has checked the code . ) &quot;
&quot; there are copies of the main database . if &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; for the use of free@@ DB , the geographic area is to be used on the next to mirror refl@@ ections . this saves band@@ width in the network and compar@@ es the load between the machines . &quot;
&quot; a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a list of reflection for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information while reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually provided monthly ) only the updates of the database . &quot;
which output program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; in W@@ AV files to my computer ?
&quot; there are ru@@ m@@ ors that cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to know more exactly , looking at source code .... This has always been the best choice for the reading of audio CD ; see to note that the cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package should be installed at the right distribution first when this is not yet done . &quot;
&quot; to save the full W@@ AV files can be chosen the codi@@ fication and thus the desired file format ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FL@@ AC ( a lost @-@ free com@@ pression for audio data ) on the tab . other Ko@@ di@@ ers can be added on this tab . &quot;
&quot; the Ko@@ di@@ erer package must be installed from the relevant Linux distribution , before the codi@@ fication can be used . further information about Ko@@ di@@ erer can be found in the chapter Which Ko@@ di@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; after installing a codi@@ fication , further information can be obtained through the input of a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a consoles window ( eg ; Con@@ sole ) . it must be replaced by the name of the installed body . &quot;
this can have many causes . check the setup of the device recording of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drives ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , FL@@ AC &amp; etc ; ) . try both programs with a command line in a terminal . this could give an indication of what is wrong . &quot;
check if you don &apos;t want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
&quot; there is one chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , these tips can give you how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; did you read the complete manual , everything understood , but are somehow still uns@@ ure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by step , and you will get enough information to set those areas what you want . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we will launch the program for the first time , everything setup and our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to produce MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 key@@ word ( tags ) . &quot;
&quot; it must be installed cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . at least , as it is not necessary to compile the source files , what you can of course always do . &quot;
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you possess writing ( eg ; by trying to copy them with the par@@ quer@@ or something ) .
&quot; the first section covers the basic introduction of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , something which probably is done just once and &quot;
the second section describes the procedure to read a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for any extended &amp; CD ;
&quot; here we determine the user to use Ko@@ di@@ erer to com@@ pression of music ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) , where we are lazy to use the program to download the free@@ DB to download the &amp; CD ; data from the Internet . &quot;
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will most likely not be able to read any of a &amp; CD , if once the appropriate settings are found . &quot;
the device @-@ drawing is given to the les@@ hip program to read it the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces can be read .
&quot; often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the actual device designation of your drive . if this is not working or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drives , can also help with the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the available entries of the device labels for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot;
the cart@@ el General settings . here gi@@ b@@ ts do not have much to do . here an additional transformation will be defined . in our example everything will be shown as well / typ@@ ed as in the screens@@ hot .
only For un@@ complete information please select so that you will be informed if data are missing for the tools of keywords ( tags ) .
the card card CD ; settings . just choose both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the Internet from a free@@ DB computer .
note : the computer must be connected while reading the &amp; CD ; to be connected to the internet so that it can access the free@@ DB server .
&quot; the second selection field is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry found , starts immediately the read of the &amp; CD ; it is dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the fil@@ en@@ ame name / fil@@ en@@ ame or day items , they can be easily changed . the fil@@ es@@ - or fil@@ en@@ ame is changed with con@@ quer@@ or , and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; apart from this example , you would like to note : if you want to manually enter everything manually , you can download the database before . however , this is about 620 MB large , consider it twice if this is worth it . in order to use free@@ DB in the off @-@ line mode , the two choices must be selected at least the first . the mode will be set on the following map card . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB is for us free@@ DB . these are settings for the data request , for the retri@@ eve of the &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB server via the Internet . how do you know the system which data will get the CD ? read the section about free@@ DB ? read all the way it is pic@@ tured in the screens@@ hot . &quot;
&quot; mode : we have not downloaded the database , we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server . &quot;
CD@@ DB @-@ Server : please go to page fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look after a mirror server in your area . on this way the load between the machines is distributed as a first attempt to function .
&quot; both function exactly what the server concerns , because many fire@@ walls record 88@@ 80 default protocol , there is perhaps more luck with the protocol 80 , since the &amp; HTTP ; protocol is usually open to surf the Internet . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we do not want to transmit any &amp; CD ; data to the free@@ DB server should be able to dis@@ able the first stop . &quot;
simply take the settings of the screens@@ hot . ( make sure that the folder / tmp on your computer does not exist )
&quot; number of simultaneous pieces : sorry , there is a reason why more than one at the same time with just an existing drive ? parallel reading and code ? the author knows it not , therefore simply try yourself . &quot;
&quot; CD ; after reading of the last piece , pass this to the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process . &quot;
&quot; user @-@ defined folder for temporary files : if you have to delete this folder , where the W@@ AV files can be stored , the files in the private folder will not be stored when you do not want to make this folder if you want to do something with the W@@ AV files . &quot;
&quot; all just type as it is on the screens@@ hot . the command is a bit long , under circumstances the order is to be broken down to see everything . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio @-@ quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , this is an adjustment for very good audio quality , even for very good Hi@@ Fi stere@@ o@@ ids . the com@@ pression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and storage consumption . &quot;
note the entry &quot; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the restriction of the generation of tags on version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags you can also be deleted at a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
put the rest like in the screens@@ hot . some comments for future use outside this example :
&quot; number of simultaneously to bo@@ iling W@@ AV files : with a du@@ al@@ Core or quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine can be tried , more than one W@@ AV file at the same time . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s what we have just finished the basic establishment of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; this configuration is used as a standard for any use of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music , you never need to change them again . &quot;
&quot; in this section , described as the process of reading the &amp; CD ; in the hard disk , we will create MP3 files . the folder structure is described in the previous section , as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from the free@@ DB must be described in this section , must be repeated for any extended &amp; CD ; it is repeated . &quot;
&quot; since we use a &amp; CD ; use that not yet in free@@ DB , the screens@@ hot is a little different from the data for one &amp; CD ; therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually to be entered , instead of taking them out of the internet . comments are indicate to the differences . &quot;
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
&quot; if this is not yet done , so now the &amp; CD has to be defined in the main window , that is defined in the main window . &quot;
&quot; after a short moment the pieces and length should be listed in the window , such as in the screens@@ hot . this only if the &amp; CD ; identified as an audio CD ; identified by cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; if this does not happen , then search in the section questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section concerning the default settings . &quot;
&quot; attention : if the &amp; CD has been picked up from the free@@ DB , all tracks of the pieces are already filled and also displayed the name of the artist and the album . &quot;
&quot; in the event that there is more than an entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; keys for your &amp; CD ; there will be a window appears , and you can select the database entry , which your opinion is best suits your &amp; CD ; &quot;
&quot; if you do not have the attri@@ tion for the automatic query of free@@ DB ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in dialogue for settings ) , you can also trigger this manually by choosing the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you have no local database but need the data on the Internet , you need the connection to the Internet . &quot;
e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD Editor - entering the CD data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen photo . the title of the piece in the first line of the label &apos; Updated title &apos; to the rest of the data in the input field &apos; album &apos; .
the artist no longer needs to be entered into the input field &apos; actu@@ ator title &apos; unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece .
the lower comment field can be used for the individual comments ini@@ zed per piece ( the comment field of the album is used for comments which apply to all the pieces of the CD .
&quot; attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from the free@@ DB is not empty , but it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editors , so that you can &apos;t only start with the artist and album names ( e.g. if all words with major letters are beginning or not ... ) , but also to check whether there is any unwanted comments . &quot;
note : in this example we use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limited the length of fields on 30 characters for the artist , album and titles of a piece of piece and on only 28 characters for the commentary box . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags . this option is set to set up on the tab card settings . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tag information of the generated files later on any time with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags . &quot;
tags are not supported by all Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers or fil@@ en@@ ers . see the help to the Ko@@ di@@ erer to get more information .
&quot; simply select an entry , which obviously corresponds to the style of the approvals CD ; dis@@ agre@@ es . in this example , this is not important as we do not transmit the &amp; CD ; for further information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or rap for example are to be found under rock . &quot;
&quot; after choosing &quot; OK , &quot; go back to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece . &quot;
the window of the CD Editor will be back and you &apos;ll see that the fields for the album has already been filled with the specified data that we have recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . the title of the piece on any case and other information you wish .
&quot; click on the next line in the main window , and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the cover data of the &amp; CD ; &quot;
attention : this window will not appear if you have downloaded the data from the free@@ DB . it is already sorted in one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album will be displayed on the item list .
&quot; note that there are a check @-@ character in front of each line of a piece . only the titles which are selected are read out . a simple click on the line will select the selection of the piece , or add the button all pieces choose at the bottom of the screen to choose all the pieces at once . &quot;
&quot; was started by clicking on the button selection out of the reading process , this window appears to be confirmed . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what is going on . &quot;
&quot; click on the tab orders to turn off on the order window . it is in the upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool@@ bar . &quot;
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is just read on the hard disk . the status of the program will be displayed at the bottom of the window in the status line .
&quot; you can see this error message if you &apos;re trying to work with a codi@@ fier , which you have not yet installed . pieces that were not successful using a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list . &quot;
&quot; by the way , the folder for the tmp @-@ file and the target folder are not what we have entered here for example . have you checked whether you have writing access to the folder for the temporary files and the target folder ? ; - ) &quot;
now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of the reading of the first piece .
&quot; the order 1 reads the first piece of it , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the coding of pieces 1 into the format MP3 . thus to check out and code parallel . please note the status of status in the lower part of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
&quot; the author of the program has found no configuration settings to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing seems to be configur@@ able , the number of parallel processes to read and code . in case of powerful machines , the result used is unclear . the machine used with a AM@@ D@@ 64 seems to have no problem with simultaneous output and code ( of however two different pieces ) . &quot;
&quot; now the last song is read , while another piece is coded and a third order is coded into the queue of the codi@@ fication . after the last piece is co@@ dated , a small window will end with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window . &quot;
&quot; for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to generate audio files such as MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the codi@@ fication of your choice . &quot;
&quot; today with CV@@ S , there is now a pre @-@ compiled package . most distri@@ butions contain already a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package is . install the package mechanical media from your distribution . if you read this , you probably already have done it ... &quot;
&quot; this section is directed to persons that compile from source files , and not intended for users to use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for assistance , how the program can be adapted to your needs if it once runs , then the following is right for you : &quot;
&quot; a program that calls for many different other programs , has many varieties of settings . the best you can get to know the options and settings . it shows the pictures of the various cardboard cards of settings and also includes comments for options that are not used in the example . &quot;
&quot; hello , still am reading ? even if only the help menu has been cli@@ cked on the program after the first time of the program , without any a cl@@ ue as it is to go on from this somehow empty screen ( above all , if at the time of program start no audio CD ; in drive is ) , or from un@@ usually short menu ? &quot;
&quot; what is it about ? who reads this , probably has already started the program . it should somehow look like this : &quot;
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately , no e @-@ mail . the author may not maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; it is intended to do something useful or change it . at least just after contact with the author . and if you read this , he left this section and therefore agree with this suggestion . &quot;
&quot; strange if it has succeeded to pick up the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need this information , but ... &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kar@@ a@@ ok@@ esp@@ ace of &amp; k@@ de ; . beside others he has not have real @-@ time graph@@ ing and Kar@@ a@@ oke @-@ real characters of texts also some features , the other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI Player not have . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD runs on the O@@ SS system , therefore , on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support function . &amp; k@@ mid ; also supports the &amp; Linux ; ultr@@ as@@ l project driver , which is needed for CIS cards . AL@@ SA is included as soon as it will be a sequ@@ encer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with altern@@ ating color , so it is easy to follow the piece . &quot;
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI @-@ channel by the penet@@ rating of the penet@@ rated buttons on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop so that you can drag in &amp; k@@ de ; any MIDI @-@ file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows on K@@ Mid .
supports the two existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( song@@ events or textures ) . K@@ Mid automatically uses the procedure used .
&quot; seat support . if you end &amp; k@@ de ; end during the game of a song , K@@ Mid next time starts with the same song again . &quot;
&quot; supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , A@@ we , FM and CIS cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first , you can open ... from the menu file . it appears the usual file dialog with which you can select the desired song . &quot;
you can also let a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ windows fall . this also works with multiple songs simultaneously .
&quot; to play a piece of music , open it and bed the button play in the tool@@ bar , select the entry tab from the menu item or enter the Le@@ ert@@ aste . &quot;
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts once you go to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ windows . ( with several pieces they are added to a collection and then re@@ played each other . )
&quot; once &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece of play , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and travel with the controller . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song is too fast or too slow down , you can click on the arrows to the left and right of the tem@@ po@@ ise and so the play@@ back speed . to click again the original speed , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
&quot; the Le@@ ert@@ aste has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the le@@ ash as a pressure on the button break , or select the menu entry into the menu piece , so it breaks the play@@ back while no piece is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; the play@@ back . &quot;
lyrics can be stored on two types in a piece of music . some pieces use textures to others use lyrics and again other both . some pieces have no text : - )
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set out what events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically detected , so you have nothing to set manually . if you do not have the option to change the entry Autom@@ atic text selection , you will have the possibility to change this if you want to see the other way . &quot;
&quot; if you want to set a event sty@@ p , select from the menu settings the entries of textures or lyrics . the same function also have the keys 1 and 2 . &quot;
&quot; a collection is a list of MIDI files , which you summ@@ arize . these are played by the line . in this section , how you can efficiently use collections efficiently . &quot;
&quot; to create a collection , open first to the collection . this is found in the menu collection under the item Organ@@ ise .... Click Here on New and give the name for the collection . &quot;
you can also copy a existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection is included in the beginning the same songs as the original .
&quot; if you have more than one collection , you can set each time in collecting equipment . &quot;
&quot; in the temporary collection , all songs you want to add to any other collection . &quot;
&quot; when using the application this collection is not stored . concerns you , if you add many pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , it must be selected at the collection of collecting . there you can add a song with the button to add a song . it appears in turn the file dialog with which you can select the desired song . &quot;
a second method to add a song depends on the setting of Automati@@ cal Add to the collection .
&quot; if Automati@@ cal Add to the collection is enabled , a piece by opening ( using file aper@@ ture or drag and drop ) automatically added to the active collection . &quot;
&quot; when automatic add to the collection is not enabled , the opening of a piece of the temporary collection is activated and log@@ ged . this collection will then be added to the open pieces . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you must open the collectors &quot; collection , select the collection and the desired song and then click on removal . &quot;
&quot; you can select the sequence in which the songs are play@@ back . if you select the line after the sub@@ menu of the menu collections , the songs are played in sequence how they were added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; if you add songs or remove or random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , select it in collecting , or use the selection list using the Kar@@ a@@ oke text . &quot;
&quot; to jump on a song , select the button next song , the entry next song from the menu or press button arrow to the right . &quot;
&quot; to jump round a song back , select the button Previous piece , the entry of the previous piece , or press the button arrow left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collectors &quot; collection , select the collection and click on the button . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection can not be deleted . however , this does not matter as it is not saved when leaving &amp; k@@ mid ; not stored . &quot;
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thesi@@ zers that are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case the MIDI @-@ Map General @-@ MIDI events occur in events that understands the syn@@ thesizer .
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI @-@ map , which conver@@ ts all events of the change patch to B@@ right piano in events of the change patch to Tru@@ mp@@ et and thus always sound a trumpet , if originally a piano should play . &quot;
&quot; if you only have a sound card , you do not need MIDI @-@ map because all Sound@@ cards GM -@@ compatible are ( including A@@ we - and CIS cards , FM -@@ devices and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI @-@ maps . so you have to edit the appropriate file from hand ( with your favorite editor ) . &quot;
a MIDI @-@ map is a text file that saves all required sizes to play a piece of piece .
&quot; each section may only appear once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section , which may appear as many times as desired . however , that every occurrence is a different text ID ( see below ) . &quot;
Def@@ ine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; Name of Key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; A further Key@@ map ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ ANN@@ EL@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D
&quot; you see that Def@@ ine is used to view that a section begins ( except for options ) and EN@@ D , that the end of a section is achieved . &quot;
&quot; please send me your map file as an email , so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can provide for devices that are not General @-@ MIDI compatible . &quot;
in this section the patches are shown by General MIDI to your specific keyboard . general use looks as follows :
&quot; please note that the left side of the lik@@ eness is ignored . it is believed that the GM @-@ patches are in the right order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and also leave no line for one of 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; the optional All@@ key@@ s@@ To M is used to put all sounds that need this instrument with the number M ( GM @-@ patch 127 ) , you can take a Drum ( e.g. with tone 60 ) , which allows you to take a drum shot ( e.g. with tone 60 ) , which can take the same in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section : &quot;
&quot; so if now a MIDI @-@ file should play a note with patch 127 ( thread ) , it will take patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI @-@ file . &quot;
&quot; please note that here with the term drum patch of the patch is meant by which every sound is a different perc@@ ussion@@ tool ( Drum , basin , Marac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one , in which the sound means the sound height of the always same drum ( as some key@@ boards possess ) . &quot;
&quot; the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section is used to indicate how t@@ ints are shown on a specific channel or instrument , the use is : &quot;
&quot; as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section , the order of the lines is very important , as their presence . so you have to create 128 entries . &quot;
you can define several key@@ maps for each channel and every instrument . you only need to use different names in the first row .
key@@ maps are used above all to form t@@ ints on the Per@@ k@@ ets channel . look as an example the supplied key@@ maps .
&quot; this section can be used to make some channels up to others . if you want to exchange for example the first and second channel , simply make it easy at CH@@ ANN@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards , which have the perc@@ ussion on a particular channel ( General MIDI to channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; Midi @-@ devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ ANN@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section therefore has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , built according to the following pattern : &quot;
&quot; N is here the channel , which is shown on the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the key@@ note will of course be further forward in the file . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events are ignored that will change the patch on this channel . in this case , then always patch x is used . &quot;
the For@@ ce@@ Patch can be useful for example to always use the per@@ si@@ pping patch on the per@@ si@@ pping channel .
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ rati@@ o indicates , in which relationship Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der @-@ events sends multip@@ lied with the value , this is used with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then only passed on . the value 40@@ 96 is used so that in the map file will be no dec@@ im@@ al com@@ mas . &quot;
&quot; this setting is used because GM indicates that a keyboard @-@ Ben@@ der event will win with the value 40@@ 96 , a sound higher . unfortunately , however , try some key@@ boards to play up to an oc@@ tave . to find the right value on your keyboard , you must try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid ; &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI @-@ map , simply open the dialog MIDI @-@ settings . this can be found in the menu under settings , point MIDI @-@ settings &quot;
&quot; the Kan@@ al@@ view is a window with a whole series Kla@@ vi@@ aturen ( one for every MIDI channel ) . on these piano , you can see which sounds are just played . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel there is a selection list , where you have a instrument changed , the button is no longer green but red to show that no longer the original instrument is used . &quot;
the Kan@@ al@@ view ( until now ) two different views to display the players . view settings in the menu settings under the point Kan@@ al@@ view : settings
&quot; the pace @-@ LCD shows the speed that is played by a song . the higher the number , the greater the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the pace of a song . so if you find e.g. , a song is too fast to follow the text you can slow down . to change the pace , use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI @-@ file is a file that contains information about how to play a music piece . it contains the notes , the rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; . this enables the same MIDI @-@ file on two different devices to very different results , just like two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way . &quot;
&quot; good , I can force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs approximately 50 KB , while an mp3 @-@ file needs 4 MB needs ( a com@@ pression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you get a similar sound quality . in a MIDI @-@ file you can also change the single instruments , speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything . &quot;
&quot; this can happen if you have a bin@@ ary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) of &amp; k@@ mid ; without A@@ we support . to eliminate the problem you need to download a source distribution and install ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s Home ) &quot;
&quot; I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I have no desire to add all the files separately . &quot;
&quot; agree that supports &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; Drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select all the files and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window . &quot;
enable prior to activate the setting of Automati@@ cal Add to the collection . otherwise the files are added to temporary collection .
&quot; you can click the arrow key to the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD replacement to slow the reproduction . to restore the default temp@@ o , click on the LCD double . &quot;
I have a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ working area a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; in a window with my MIDI @-@ folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; in this way I have to play a MIDI @-@ file or I want to play a file only in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter the window and drag the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ;
&quot; if you want to listen to a file quickly without add them to a collection , turn to a collection , turn the default collection to the collection , and the new ; file is added to temporary collection . opening files &quot;
we will take you to play the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . so you just want to play the first file . so , you only want to record the setting of Automati@@ cal Add to the collection and opening A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this a MIDI @-@ file . &quot;
then join in B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and to create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
&quot; these people sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you very much ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , animated me to program on &amp; k@@ mid ; to program . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; Lag@@ a . at the moment I am not much time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to take a bit of time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to collect myself a bit of time . as hob@@ bies I do programming , MIDI files , make music and de@@ cks . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know where to download MIDI / Kar@@ a@@ oke files , if you want a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you want to make me happy , write me an e @-@ mail : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es &quot;
&quot; they really make me a great pleasure , if you want to send me a postcard from your home or a MI@@ DI@@ - / Kar@@ a@@ oke file from a local group . all who want to send me a postcard or a MIDI @-@ file ( if you want it ) . before you want to send a MIDI @-@ file , you should contact me as I might have the file already . &quot;
&quot; I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and nobody was swe@@ pt up for money . I would therefore like to stress that I will only be more programmed , because / if I get feedback from users ( post@@ cards or e @-@ mails ) . &quot;

&quot; in addition to this can be found &amp; k@@ mid ; also on his homepage , which can be found at http : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .html . you can also find links to sites with further kar@@ a@@ oke songs , &amp; etc ; &quot;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer because the sound quality depends much on your sound@@ card . it is not the same if you use a FM @-@ device or an A@@ we card .
&quot; if you do not have sound card , you must compile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you could have a sound card except that you can of course no music listen . &quot;

&quot; the categories &apos; updated piece &apos; , television and durability playlist can also be modified by direct edi@@ tions of the XML configuration files . of course , one can only do if &amp; km@@ ers / apps / apps / apps / km@@ . can , be used by an editor , but also by using a category Mode . by using a sub@@ group , only the XML content of this part will be shown . &quot;
&quot; after changing XML files , has to be chosen from the menu item with playlist , and either the Edit mode selected , or another category will be selected . &quot;
any changes are lost when the Edit mode leave or another group is selected without the playlist .
&quot; owing to the convenience of the author of &amp; km@@ player , some features can only be switched by changing the XML configuration files . &quot;
the animation during star@@ ters and loading can be disabled by the edi@@ tions of ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ err@@ c and Change by &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ iger option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can be easily added . &quot;
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; km@@ player ; the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / km@@ . / share / apps / km@@ . / share / apps / km@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
&quot; the animation at the starting time does not need to be short , it is automatically termin@@ ated by opening another source . this would be dis@@ rup@@ tive at the end @-@ animation , the user can therefore finish the application a second time . &quot;
a simple example of a start @-@ animation can be the indicators of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; board ; &amp; lt ; im@@ g D@@ ur = &quot; in@@ fil@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; meet ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ board ; in the source package of S@@ MI@@ L that are supported by &amp; km@@ player ; are supported by &amp; km@@ player ;
there is a rider for configuration of M@@ player in the configuration dialog by &amp; km@@ player ; here the path can be set off from the player and the intermediate memory size of the dat@@ stream from the network and other things .
another tool for trou@@ bles@@ hooting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of km@@ player . here is the output of m@@ player evi@@ dently .
there is no rider for this playlist in the configuration dialog by &amp; km@@ player ; everything must be configured through manual editing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ err@@ c . here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; with the module sw@@ app@@ i @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa is played :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within walking player ; it can even be inserted the special field Em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
&quot; so that the &amp; km@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages can be recovered , the &amp; km@@ player ; module as service provider for the M@@ ime type application / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the interior dialog file attri@@ bution of KDE . &quot;
&quot; the kon@@ quer@@ or or short player ; is displayed in a con@@ sol@@ dering application and search for error messages concerning the loading of the browser module library . if there is no mistakes , the back@@ end output is within walking player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore always a pre @-@ based background for a particular m@@ ime type is taken ( of course only if this is also determined ) , this must be done through manual variation of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example , PH@@ ON@@ ON all og@@ g files will be displayed : &quot;
&amp; km@@ . can be used by TV cards either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be configured using the scanner box and the TV channels can be edited manually or the configuration file can be edited manually .
&quot; the configuration of V@@ DR ( video data rec@@ orders ) settings in the km@@ player is the dialogue in the settings under - &gt; source &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port to use . there should be identified ports ( e.g. , it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably included a DV@@ B in it . &quot;
&quot; because the V@@ DR support of km@@ player can only use X@@ video ( presum@@ ably , this kind of play@@ back video devices should work under Linux is the only one that works ) . for this reason , the vide@@ o@@ for@@ lin@@ ux enhancement for the X server needs to be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) &quot;
&quot; being used internally by KM@@ Player for the sources different names . at the time the emergence of these documentation are dv@@ d@@ nav@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , non @-@ source , source source , v@@ cd@@ source , v@@ cd@@ source , v@@ cd@@ source , v@@ cd@@ source , v@@ cd@@ source , v@@ cd@@ source , v@@ cd@@ source , v@@ cd@@ source , v@@ cd@@ source , v@@ cd@@ source , v@@ cd@@ source , v@@ cd@@ source , v@@ cd@@ source , v@@ cd@@ source , v@@ cd@@ source , v@@ cd@@ source , v@@ cd@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . if they are enabled , they start playing the playlist . &quot;
are there evidence as I can make my CD@@ ROM drive when I play from him ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
&quot; yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is considered user root after inser@@ ting the device . this is absolutely sure to make that / dev / c@@ drom shows the CD@@ ROM drive . &quot;
&quot; X@@ ine starts only slowly , why should each time be checked my CPU to their performance ? &quot;
&quot; note : the answer is over@@ priced k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the last stored value , only the first time becomes x@@ ine the CPU . &quot;

lat@@ ex ; : a professional scroll application . under Unix @-@ like systems is likely to be trac@@ ed to the package &amp; tex@@ live ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be used in the used &amp; Linux ; for installation should be drawn to the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD .
the &amp; k@@ ile ; the project contains some already compiled packages of &amp; k@@ ile ; for various distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the k@@ ile ; -@@ website .
&quot; this hand@@ book is for everyone - regardless of the experiences with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; k@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; &quot;
&quot; advanced users need to hardly read this manual for this manual . however , the support for this project or its documentation is desired , the contact to the k@@ ile ; website should be made . &quot;
&quot; if you have questions about or when comp@@ iling from &amp; k@@ ile , or if requested , this should be addressed at the mailing list of k@@ ile @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ forge@@ .net . &quot;
&amp; k@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ surroundings for the use of all &amp; lat@@ ex ; functions in a graphic interface and within this one simple , immediate and tailor @-@ made access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; programs . furthermore , the possibility to complete , comp@@ iling , processing and trou@@ bles@@ hooting for this . conclusion , the easy to use assistant , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference and the powerful project management . &quot;
&quot; to learn more about &amp; Kate ; and its possibilities to experience , the manual should be attracted to Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can begin there directly with reading the chapter with the editor of &amp; Kate ; &quot;
for &amp; lat@@ ex ; is the right place : L@@ ay @-@ TECH ; difficult to use is also a La@@ ie ( English . lay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ mac@@ ros is also possible that it comes from the surname of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
&quot; here only a good back to &amp; lat@@ ex ; given here , it is not the ultimate book for this . to master &amp; lat@@ ex ; properly domin@@ ate , should be good balls , e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. Dal@@ y , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : document preparation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 d@@ af@@ Ã ¼ r . &quot;
&quot; just like other sig@@ nat@@ ories , contains &amp; lat@@ ex ; an introduction , with which the general features such as paper format , side cur@@ sions , and text gr@@ ading at least the command \ \ document@@ class , the Cologne command begins with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be filled with the command \ \ end { document } . &quot;
the quick @-@ level assistant of &amp; k@@ ile ; is a wet function for quick creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; for the selection of the wiz@@ ard ( menu ) provides some possibilities for creating the document . it can also be made some of the document related to the document .
&quot; document categories : hereby the type of document document won : articles &#91; book &#93; , book &#91; report &#93; , report &#91; report &#93; , report &#91; report &#93; , Articles ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ aps &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ book &#93; , films &#91; pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; , films &#91; pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user @-@ defined . &quot;

&quot; this list included the usually used supplements for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for inclusion , they only have to be considered in the cruci@@ fied field . &quot;
&quot; article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) : the documentary classes of Com@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) . &quot;
new users are not worried either . it is only a brief description of the functions and further information can be given in the section .
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; offers - as well as other source code editors - the high@@ lighting of the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the matching ) . through &amp; k@@ ile ; it is still noticed by the modest appearance of output files . however , it is possible to save you through the cur@@ atorial period of time and space . &quot;
&quot; with automatic verification of the environments , when entering a new instruction ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) by &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically generated a blank line ( for input of the text ) and the per@@ tin@@ ent line to enter the text ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can set up in the men@@ Ã ¼ k@@ ile ; set up ... La@@ TeX commands de@@ activated . &quot;
all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; che@@ ered the sub@@ division of the document into the following items ( part is the most subtle and sub@@ ver@@ est item ) :
&quot; in view of the document in Struc@@ ture , the individual elements can be changed by a mouse @-@ click on the respective changes . &quot;
when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be very helpful in creating our own &amp; lat@@ ex ; as soon as a DVI ; file &#91; framed file ( engl . D e V ice I n@@ dependent File ) &#93; created by a click with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ viewer to the corresponding line in &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code .
a DVI ; file contained a description of the form@@ att@@ ed document and also other information such as the scrip@@ tures and is next to PDF the above output from &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; there are many tools to view conversion and printing of DVI ; files for different systems and scent .
&quot; if you are looking for the elements of the DVI ; file with the editor , the exact opposite is attached to an item in the DVI ; -@@ source code is the exact opposite of it . as soon as to a section in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; the text @-@ text was cli@@ cked , becomes the appropriate place in the DVI ; -@@ viewer . &quot;
&quot; Master @-@ document : this function is used in working with multiple files . with a Master @-@ document , the work with other integrated .@@ tex files is simplified . when using a project a project project can be set up with project settings . &quot;
quick construction : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; the source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if no error in the source code are available ) .
file app@@ rais@@ al : in this mode the DVI ; -@@ file at stake : there is no call or ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after the quick construction .
&quot; in the viewing of the editing tool@@ bar , the three co@@ asts stri@@ pped in the document . the first selection of common elements were designed in the document . the first selection field is for quick integration of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The Re@@ ver@@ able &amp; lat@@ ex ; orders for sub@@ division are : &quot;
&quot; the drop @-@ box further is for example of articles such as Е@@ т@@ и@@ к@@ е@@ т@@ и : &quot;
&quot; name : with this command a name for a section , a picture or other element is created . &quot;
cover : is used for reference to a specified name ( selection of a selection field ) .
&quot; in case of quot@@ ation , a selection list is displayed with liter@@ ary entries . for the editing of &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files are appropriate editors . the author has good experience with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; and the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can be written by hand also in &amp; k@@ ile ; from hand . &quot;
&quot; the last drop @-@ box with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ h@@ ore is used for defining the font . it can be set the font for the main text , the fu@@ zz notes , etc . there are the following fonts for disposal : &quot;
&quot; when calling &amp; k@@ ile , two choices for creating a new document by selecting the document type and fixed settings . 2 . the document can be written by reason at hand . &quot;
&quot; the brack@@ ets after the command \ \ document@@ class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; establishes the scri@@ be fixed . will the scri@@ be not at the beginning , this can also be done in the text . &quot;
once the above source code has been entered the &amp; lat@@ ex ; the source code has to be compiled . the easiest way to do is the use of the menu or the button @-@ button .
the source code must be stored before the comp@@ iling . &amp; k@@ ile ; for stor@@ ing the storage automatically .
&quot; the comp@@ iling of the document faul@@ ts , should be sought in the logging after faul@@ ts . when using fast construction should be started &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece . if this is not the case , should also be noticed the protocol . &quot;
&quot; an environment ( English environment ) is a text which is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the writer , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } &quot;
the amount are only inside the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } up to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no circum@@ stance ( number ) for extra beds within an environment .
&quot; there are many possibilities for placing the read@@ ability of the read@@ ability and usability of the document . it can be used for example certain fonts , fat printing , cur@@ sions , etc . these commands may be added either with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment . &quot;
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the short printing printing and is long as long as it is closed until he is closed with a \ \ \ { emp@@ t } or another environment . a single word in one sentence can be displayed with \ \ emp@@ h { word } curve .
\ \ quote : creates a quot@@ ation in the document . the quot@@ ation begins with \ \ begin { quot@@ ation } and ends with \ \ end { quot@@ ation } .
after the background for writing the source tex@@ tual with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; this is now a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for the creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile .
&quot; once an assist@@ ants has been entered a bit of text , a few adjustments for better read@@ ability of the document should be accomplished . therefore , a quote , a few places in the fat and cur@@ si@@ veness and a poem to be used to see the differences of these commands . &quot;
&quot; once the document was seen as soon as the document has been viewed , using editor @-@ view or str@@ g e back to the editor ( in the internal viewer ) . at an external observer , the window must be closed . &quot;
&quot; once the DVI ; -@@ file was created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file will be converted . &quot;
DVI ; is a framed file format ( engl . D e V ice I n@@ ests ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi -@@ issue such as printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF -@@ transform@@ ers or Computer@@ bild . &quot;
for the printing of a &amp; DVI ; file are the same steps as for the creation of the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - can be printed by clicking on DVI ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the tool@@ bar mur@@ dered the transformation of the DVI ; -@@ file into other formats . once the DVI ; file is created from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; the source code can be created by means of woven other formats in the tool@@ bar .
the pre @-@ order search for direct jumps from the editor to the per@@ tin@@ ent position within the DVI ; -@@ file .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ bin@@ ders . there must be only Modern under settings k@@ ile furnis@@ hing ... Tools B@@ auen .
&quot; in order to fix the fores@@ try , the mouse @-@ c@@ ursor in a line of the source code must be cli@@ cked and close to pre @-@ order search . the jump to the appropriate place in the DVI ; -@@ viewer is then processed . &quot;
&quot; with this function in &amp; Oc@@ ey@@ epi@@ ece , with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; document by &amp; k@@ ile ; cl@@ adding and to the appropriate line . to be fixed &amp; k@@ ile ; in &amp; Oc@@ ular ; as text editor will set up ( settings ey@@ epi@@ ece ... Editor ) &quot;
&quot; if you are unable to use rapid construction of the &amp; DVI ; vie@@ wers can not exceed a mistake , this will be displayed in the log file or in the message window in summary . &quot;
&quot; the logging file speci@@ fies the error source in the source code . in the editor , the knot@@ ting La@@ TeX errors and n@@ Ã ¤ ster La@@ TeX errors are always available the line in which the error appears . to be cli@@ cked on the error in the protocol , and &amp; k@@ ile ; jump to faul@@ ty line . &quot;
&quot; once the corresponding button is cli@@ cked in the tool@@ bar , a window appears to select the template for the document . &quot;
&quot; if you choose from empty document , a document can be written either by reason or the wiz@@ ard to create a new document . further information can be included in the section . &quot;
&quot; classic users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be saved in &amp; k@@ ile ; created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new template , either a existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; -@@ file ge@@ ff@@ ed or a new file will be created . &amp; k@@ ile ; can create a new template by adding an existing document and selection of file template . &quot;
when creating a new document from a file by file New will replace some strings using other data ( e.g. name or character coding ) . these variables can set up in settings k@@ ile ... settings gener@@ als .
&quot; when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings from which variables are replaced by which variables are : &quot;
$ $ DO@@ LA ENT@@ CLASS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ : this string is used by entering in documentary class . typically they will be used as follows : \ \ document@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ D@@ ENT@@ CLASS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ &#93; { article } .
the easiest way to create a template is the use of the assist@@ ants and the so @-@ up of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way the following steps have been accomplished :
when creating a new document the own template would be considered by default .
&quot; a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files will be created . a simple way to create a template , should be sought after one on the Internet and the steps described below . &quot;
&amp; k@@ ile ; used &amp; Kate ; used as an internal editor . &amp; Kate ; is a text editor for programmers with the exec@@ utions of reading and style of many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for B &amp; Kate ; can be made in the menu tools directly from &amp; k@@ ile ;
&quot; to find more detail &amp; Kate ; and its possibilities to experience , the manual should be attracted to Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can begin there directly with reading the chapter with the editor of &amp; Kate . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; offers a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Command reference , which can be called for the help La@@ TeX reference reference . you will be able to find a listing of nearly all commands , which can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; use , as well as their syntax . &quot;
&quot; double @-@ click with penet@@ rated string button to cover the &amp; tex ; -@@ Word to w@@ ander . that means that in this way click on \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ &quot;
&quot; when drawing up the text with penet@@ rated lin@@ ker , the full text will be copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
when using the arrow t@@ apes with penet@@ rated circum@@ cis@@ can taste parts of the source tex@@ tured in the Edit@@ or@@ window .
&amp; k@@ ile ; has the possibilities to browse and highlight the most diverse types of source texts . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands of normal text and also the mathematical form@@ ulas are highlighted by another color . &quot;
&quot; many assist@@ ants can send you a lot of book@@ marks inside the text . this is also the jump to the jump to n@@ Ã ¤ ge or last spr@@ ing@@ board , so that it is also reflected in the first input of a drawing . &quot;
&quot; the mach@@ ining is probably one of the main aspects regarding the use of a program such as &amp; k@@ ile ; but though &amp; Kate ; already excellent features , were added in &amp; k@@ ile ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; specific commands for their selection . under editing , the following commands include the following commands : &quot;
&quot; it contains a complete paragraph ( group of lines that contain either on both sides a blank line ) . with a paragraph , it is not related to multiple tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; orders and all other lines of the source code . the only preventive thing in &amp; k@@ ile ; is therefore that the devi@@ ation is separated by two empty lines . &quot;
&quot; w@@ ading the word under the current C@@ urs@@ or@@ position . this selection also has an extended meaning , as this command also &amp; lat@@ ex ; orders with a reduction ( \ \ ) and a rec@@ alled star ( * ) at the end . &quot;
&quot; for example , a part of the document can be removed from this first . &amp; Kate ; provides the short@@ cut of C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the entire line is removed . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers with their own command such a faster mon@@ ks . under mach@@ ining removal are the following commands of the text of the text : &quot;
removed a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; k@@ ile ; is included in the description of editing material .
it has already been clari@@ fied that environments plays a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore it offers &amp; k@@ ile ; for further orders under mach@@ ining environment for a very simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
&quot; with this command , the beginning of the current environment is sear@@ ched ( no matter where the current position is ) . the c@@ ursor is placed directly in front of the command to boost the environment . &quot;
&quot; with this command , to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the c@@ ursor is placed directly behind the command to the chim@@ ney of the environment . &quot;
&quot; if the c@@ ursor before or within the command \ \ begin { surroundings } is located at the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; when entering many s@@ add@@ ed environments , you can quickly get lost in a view . this command will close the most recently used environment so that the wast@@ ed environment structure does not destroy . &quot;
&amp; k@@ ile ; also provides special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ groups that are determined by brack@@ ets { ... } are a few important commands that meet from working environment .
&quot; with this command becomes the beginning of the current group , no matter where the current position is ) . the c@@ ursor is placed directly in front of the wel@@ ded cl@@ amps . &quot;
&quot; with this command , the end of the current group is sear@@ ched ( no matter where the current position is ) . the c@@ ursor is placed directly behind the wel@@ ded cl@@ amps . &quot;

&quot; some users communicate the columns in tables , environments , and all the E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) among each other . &quot;
&quot; though &amp; Kate ; already a good source code has been installed , these in &amp; k@@ ile ; for special commands ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) are still working three according to demand and the other two are for automatic verification . all these modes can set up for different ways of working under settings and set up ... &quot;
at the beginning a new environment with the command \ \ begin { environment } will be &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
&quot; when pressing the racks , the last letter of entry is removed and mer@@ ged from the entry of the entry . on the other hand , the list can be processed by entering another letter also . &quot;
&quot; all commands are written with a brief description of their parameters . alternatively , you can choose from &amp; k@@ ile , so that a simply jump to these positions by mach@@ ining jumping brands hub , and the added parameters can be introduced . &quot;
under settings k@@ ile ; setup ... k@@ ile ; understanding the settings can be made to these lists . you can choose different winding list for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands as well as guar@@ di@@ ets of the general language use .
&quot; the command mode is for the complete understanding of environments . there is still a couple of letters , with \ \ begin and the call of the actu@@ ation mode will be used as many times , the environments used so often used that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for the understanding of the environments . &quot;
&quot; when a call for sale mode , the menu or the keyboard drives Alt + switch@@ able Le@@ ert@@ aste will automatically include the command to the opening of the environment and it appears \ \ begin { . afterwards , the ambient temperature can be termin@@ ated in the easiest way and by pressing the input key . &quot;
&quot; after this is accomplished , the environment is automatically closed again . once &amp; k@@ ile , realize that it is a lists environment , will even be a first \ \ item command . &quot;
under settings k@@ ile ; set up ... k@@ ile ; understanding settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the choice list of g@@ utter mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands .
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; supported user @-@ defined lists of ab@@ outs , which are immediately set up using settings . the lists can set up using settings k@@ ile ... K@@ ile Ver@@ sions set up the file exam@@ ple@@ .c@@ wl , in which example the entry L = \ \ La@@ TeX is included . &quot;
&quot; for example , the letter L entered into the code of L entered into the word processor , the letter of Str@@ g + Alt Le@@ ert@@ aste , the letter L will be replaced by the string \ \ La@@ TeX . &quot;
&quot; great for automatic distor@@ tions are not helpful . however , many others have been written in a document more than once . thus , &amp; k@@ ile ; the understanding of all already written forms . &quot;
&quot; this mode can set up in the men@@ Ã ¼ settings k@@ ile ... K@@ ile Ver@@ sions , and can also be defined by the thres@@ holds . &quot;

&quot; the dialog shows the recording of graphics as simple as possible . to improve the bases for the graphics formats , the sections should be observed and observed . &quot;
&quot; PS files are not as known as PDF files , but also provide an excellent basis for a listing and re@@ arrangement of pages . if the pages are arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools are re @-@ arranged and then be converted to a PDF file with ps@@ 2@@ pdf . &quot;
&quot; to be able to watch the result of the work , the source code must be compiled , all the tools are group@@ ed into the men@@ tions of creating comp@@ iling , creating and creating view . &quot;
for the comp@@ iling of the source texts for vie@@ wers as &amp; Oc@@ ular ; or the further conversion can be used by means of the keyboard ; 2 the DVI ; file is converted into a PS file by means of Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file into a PS file and be viewed via Alt ; 5 the PS file .
&quot; when using the command of the instruction is normally called a vie@@ wers after the comp@@ iling . should not be used any built @-@ in viewer , so each time becomes a new window . &quot;
a new project will be launched by the project . here the following information is asked for the project :
&quot; when entering the fil@@ en@@ ames window , the relative path must be specified from the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file . &quot;
the script function by &amp; k@@ ile ; allows the script of EC@@ MAS@@ cript -@@ Ko@@ de . the script can be managed in the sen@@ k@@ right body .
the API @-@ scripts are not yet developed and can be found in other versions of &amp; k@@ ile .
first must be said that the exclusion of scripts in &amp; k@@ ile ; a system @-@ wide object ( = k@@ ile ) with the following methods :
&quot; lat@@ ex ; is a quite distinct system , which can be expanded through a variety of different packages . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers a lot of different help to support the user . &quot;
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ live ; are supplied with many documents . in this includes documentation for the included packages and another &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference .
&quot; this is a complete retri@@ ev@@ ous Ref@@ ern@@ ment for &amp; tex ; and it is not only a description of all the programs ( but a few important packages are described ) , but rather it is ideal for searching for a specific form@@ atting . since it is a very rough type of document , it is divided into &amp; k@@ ile ; in three important book@@ marks . &quot;
&quot; due to the amount of documents with those &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; extr@@ ad@@ ited , the fin@@ den of the right document is not always easy . &quot;
&quot; all documents are divided into categories and the gra@@ dient advantage is the search for par@@ cel name or stroke . by &amp; k@@ ile , then only the results are displayed . &quot;
&quot; double @-@ clicking with the mouse or the bed , the viewer is the viewer for the document . &quot;

the version 3.2 of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; contains a lot of new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in its involvement in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; all these tools use comb@@ us@@ tion as surface and lib@@ x@@ ml@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as under@@ base . the combination provides fast , efficient , complete and productive tools . &quot;
&quot; anyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentary works , knows meant pro@@ c and as over@@ rag@@ ing it . we don &apos;t lift it a piece , we give it a graphic interface ! no longer rely on a terminal ; simply cli@@ cked the symbol for the XML processor and finished ! &quot;
&quot; this application is expecting a index@@ .@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if index@@ .@@ doc@@ book is located in the subject of folder , then leave the current working folder . if not , then they remove the selection of current work@@ folders and enter the folder in the field of other folder . &quot;
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files will be deleted every time when meant pro@@ c .
&quot; as already said , everyone who has worked on the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation have already worked , know how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there is now a great graphical user interface . &quot;
&quot; if the just opened file index@@ .@@ doc@@ book is , then they simply leave the current working folder . if not , then select current working folder and enter the folder where index@@ .@@ doc@@ book is available . &quot;
&quot; when it comes to a issue on the screen , their file is faul@@ ty . please check the reported mistakes and try again . &quot;
&quot; if the file is already marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul , then they will release the current file easily . if not , delete them with the current file the tick and select the file using another file - file sel@@ ector . &quot;
&quot; if you just want to know if the file well @-@ formed is , they click the Well @-@ formed review selection . &quot;
&quot; to the use of a &amp; DT@@ D , which is specified in the &amp; XML ; ( default ) , select &amp; DT@@ D ; ( external ) , otherwise , and DT@@ D ; ( Ex@@ ternal &#93; ) , and specify the place of the &amp; DT@@ D ; through Defini@@ tions @-@ UR@@ I ; the specification of the Defini@@ tions UR@@ I ; in the file selection required . &quot;
&quot; yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tools ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ ml@@ 2 library . &quot;
&quot; should the al@@ working file in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; already be marked , then they let the current file sel@@ ects . if not , remove the selection of the file and select the file using the file sel@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; enter the name of the file , as the result is named , the file is usually stored in their home folder . &quot;
&quot; the plugins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; la@@ wed , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even perhaps little to do . this will take advantage of the additional functionality immediately and don &apos;t have to wait until someone can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; but the plug @-@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI . more about it , they will find below . &quot;
&quot; to install a plug @-@ in or a part , we start with the menu plugins . thus , following dialogue will be opened : &quot;
&quot; this dialog enables you to manage and add new plug @-@ ins , and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; -@@ element in it : &quot;
&quot; here you can enter the search engine . when adding , plug @-@ ins can be used without a storage place ; this path to the search of the plug @-@ ins . &quot;
often working on a project several people in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shi@@ ft ; F@@ 7 Project project properties .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nickname is the nickname of the user and is used for clear identification .
&quot; one member can have several roles in the project , such as both team leader as well as sub@@ project leader . &quot;
&quot; the user can choose from the list of members of the team who he is . this happens when he is looking out the team member from the list , and the button Select as presses . the currently selected member ( their identi@@ fier ) appears after you are : text . &quot;
the nickname and setting of their own identity are important regarding messages and remarks . see for further information about comments .
&quot; in addition to an overview of her team , there is another advantage by collecting members of the team : it may be created an event to information on the team leader when something particular happens . see for further information . &quot;
&quot; event actions are actions that will be executed if something happens in the project . an example would be seen later , how much someone worked out , or the sending of a message when a file is saved , or a script that is added to the CV@@ S , once it is added to the project , etc ; &quot;
&quot; on the page event configuration of the Shi@@ ft ; F@@ 7 project project settings , events can be created , edited and deleted . &quot;
an email will be sent to the addres@@ see list of the addres@@ see list . the addres@@ see can be a team@@ - or sub@@ project leader . see where such directors can be set up .
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
note notes is simple . it can be selected either the note -@@ entry from the editor @-@ text menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation key@@ word in a commentary area followed by a text @-@ text .
&quot; notes can be sent to a determin@@ able member of the team . in this case the syntax of team leader ( nickname ) , or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nickname ) , as a part in the project of the following possibilities : team@@ leader of the team leaders should be given the corresponding sections or sub@@ project names such as in the following examples below . &quot;
&quot; top names and rolls names are independent of big or small , but spaces for cl@@ amps , and the note : make the note invali@@ d . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scripts and form@@ atting that DT@@ D @-@ agnos@@ tic is supported and web @-@ based form@@ ative and scrip@@ ting languages supported .
&quot; the settings can be reached via the settings menu . here , only above &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in . &quot;
&quot; the settings can set up by settings Qu@@ anta ... called into account . diesel dialogue extends over a few pages , which are dealt with each other . &quot;
the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; regarding tags including car completion can be changed . the entries are :
&quot; big / small @-@ tender of tags : big / small @-@ tender of automatically extrac@@ ted tags . normal Groß / Classifieds means , the tags are as inserted as they are described in the day XML files . &quot;
&quot; big / small @-@ tender by attributes : big / small @-@ prescription of automatically extrac@@ ted attributes , the attributes are inserted as inserted as they are described in the day XML files . &quot;
&quot; optional tags automatically conclude : if raised , is optional for tags , for the closing day op@@ tionally , this immediately after the &amp; gt ; inserted . &quot;
non @-@ optional tags automatically conclude : as above for all other tags with the exception of the simple tags .
&quot; starting and closing day automatically update : if switched on , the appropriate day will be changed and vice versa . &quot;
automatic refund of acc@@ ent signs : controls the automatic conversion of ak@@ z@@ entu@@ ated characters in the appropriate coding .
&quot; M@@ IME types : Mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es to detect different types of files . through the standard , the default ones can be restored . &quot;
standard character coding : the coding of newly created or in a different way than with a file opening @-@ open files ( where the coding of the file can be over@@ seen ) . this option is checked by the same in the proj@@ ective Properties if a project is loaded .
&quot; standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D will be used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D was not recognized here , but this setting is not shown from the same in the proj@@ ective Properties , if a project is loaded . &quot;
&quot; creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; created regularly backup copies , so that with a black@@ out or crash at the next start of the program the document can be recovered from this backup . it is not the same as the saving of the file . also for non @-@ stored documents will be created regularly , according to the displayed time . &quot;
&quot; preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editors or own view ( or documentation in a cardboard box ) , which makes it possible to preview the documentation and the source text at the same time . &quot;
ign@@ ite the window settings on the default back next to the next start is useful when the user interface caused by changing the M@@ DI @-@ modes and and@@ o@@ cks / depend on views through each other . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameters .
&quot; the warning output is used to control the taxes of the possibility , the display of war@@ nings by An@@ h@@ aken by no more inquiries . &quot;
&quot; the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it may change the display of symbols instead of scripts , as well as the synchron@@ izing behaviour of the V@@ PL@@ E and the source text in shared mode . &quot;
&quot; here , the par@@ ser and the struc@@ baum , which represents the illustration of the Par@@ ser @-@ knots in the document , can be set in detail . &quot;
&quot; in the field of mouse @-@ click on the struc@@ baum , the following activity offers the following action it is possible to modify by clicking the structural structure with the mouse buttons . &quot;
&quot; in the field of structural tree settings , the visibility of knots in the tree can be opened automatically with the mach@@ ining and how deep in a change of structural tree will be opened automatically . blank knots are the empty areas in the text , while the blank groups are found , in which in the current document no item was found . &quot;
&quot; the area to commemor@@ ating abbrevi@@ ations ( a kind of templates ) which are un@@ folded in groups , each can be divided into groups , each can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s may be valid , it can be a valid group for PHP in which the if@@ su@@ ction abbrevi@@ ation something else than in a group valid for Jav@@ ascript . &quot;
&quot; here , the plugins are managed . plugins are K@@ Part applications from the third page , which can be used by each K@@ Part @-@ capable application , most famous &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ ins must be given the following : &quot;
address : the path to the plugin if it is not on a stand there as $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib .
&quot; input : this information will be transferred to the plug @-@ in , so it may open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder . &quot;
&quot; component in the &quot; Only @-@ L@@ ese &quot; mode : check if the plugin denied the store . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts usually refuse the store when this option is not selected .
&quot; check the plug @-@ in : this is enabled , then test@@ et &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; whether the level of information is correct . to choose the program also , if the plugin is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , the trou@@ bles@@ hooting was completely re@@ designed . Di@@ e@@ Support for the no longer required built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; instead of the support for the db@@ g de@@ bu@@ gger . instead of this a de@@ bu@@ gger @-@ Plugin concept was implemented , the various Impl@@ ement@@ ations made via plug @-@ ins . &quot;
&quot; currently , only one plugin available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; free@@ zing ; insert . &quot;
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with selecting a suitable Debug@@ ger plug @-@ ins in the project settings . with the button options next to the de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in selection may change the specific settings .
&quot; if a bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional items appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ user interface : &quot;
a view that is shown in the content of surveillance variables . appears normally in the left dock .
&quot; a view , in which all attitudes , with foref@@ athers and conditions are listed . appears normally in the lower dock . &quot;
a view where the output is shown ( as in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger . appears normally in the lower dock .
depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger is all or part of the following functionality available .
&quot; with this action the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger , if necessary , or it shares the plugin with , to listen to Deb@@ u@@ gan@@ ing &apos;s demands . this action is opened by default , when a project is opened , that a de@@ bu@@ gger is not to be respected . &quot;
the counter@@ part of de@@ bug@@ ging session starts the session . includes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or ends the sounds to meet requirements .
sends a HTTP requirement to enter the server for a debit requirement . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to watch the current document . the output of this requirement is displayed in the de@@ bu@@ gger issue .
&quot; indicates the de@@ bu@@ gger with the execution of the script to start and information about the monitoring variables , as well as the currently exec@@ uting variables . if this happens when the script has been lifted , the execution will continue . when a debit card is started , the script will start with the requirement . &quot;
&quot; indicates the de@@ bu@@ gger to start with the execution of the script , without information on monitoring variables and current line number . if this happens when a script is raised , the execution will continue . when a debit card is given , the execution starts as soon as a request is placed . &quot;
&quot; the de@@ bu@@ gger carries out the next directive in the script , without responding to the functions or includes . &quot;
&quot; the de@@ bu@@ gger carries out the next directive in the script , whereby if possible in functions and includes errors . &quot;
&quot; indicates the de@@ bu@@ gger to move the statement and go to the next so , as if there were the current not . &quot;

&quot; this chapter describes how you can adapt &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to suit your needs , and how you can be &amp; qu@@ ant@@ y to help better . &quot;
&quot; type E@@ di@@ tier@@ eler ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used to provide support for Mark@@ up@@ - and scripts . your simplicity and flexibility is made of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a quick , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two kinds , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages and / CSS ; s &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two parts , the tag folder and the tool@@ boxes ( above the E@@ di@@ tier window ) , insert text and instructions faster into a document than one user ever could . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created out of an existing DT@@ D . see for details on the conversion . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how to create Tag@@ XML files , then the &amp; D p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also work @-@ same . in short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P . &quot;
&quot; Tag@@ XML Files ( .@@ day ) define both the specific attributes for tags and the layout and content of the peculi@@ arities , the &amp; D p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; self . tool@@ boxes enable fast inser@@ ting tags in a document without risk of writing error . &quot;
&quot; day @-@ folder are nothing but folder . they contain only the &amp; D p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . day @-@ folder bear the name of the descri@@ p@@ tive language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.01 @-@ ) &quot;
&quot; the table below lists the elements of the conference XML and declares whether they are necessary , or not . although not all necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible to make other users a better insight and more information in working with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes every element in detail . everything about possibilities and limitations is set in a simple way .
&quot; this is the root element of a meeting point . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains only one element type of itself otherwise nothing else . &quot;
the type of tags is a script function . when using is called &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only for meeting type class valid . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only for the type Meth@@ od valid . gives the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
&quot; if yes , the day has a common attribute , and the attributes within this tags can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 ) &quot;
sets a text in dialogue . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; -@@ tag . this is a just element type element .
&quot; describe an attribute of a tags . this element can only exist once for each attribute . additionally , it contains other tags that will describe how this attribute is to be displayed , &amp; etc ; This is a just element element . &quot;
returns the source tex@@ tual for the attributes in the day @-@ Edit@@ or@@ dialog and in the attribute @-@ tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used to reach the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p Metho@@ den@@ name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to reach the source of data source .
&quot; requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a cutting and a method name . the arguments that will be transferred to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ name , which means the name of the current tags . &quot;
a container day that group@@ ed the elements of a list together . it can occur for a attribute only once . it is a just element of element .
sets the position of the attribute tex@@ tual within a dialog . this day can happen for every attribute in a dialogue only once ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; Day ) . the element is empty .
gives the position and size of a field in dialogue . this day should be available for each field in dialogue ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; p@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; col@@ abel &gt; day ) . this item is empty .
there is a list of elements that may occur within the specified tags . this item is a single element type .
there is a list of elements that end a day . this item is a just element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with an &amp; XML ; -@@ De@@ ad@@ ation start : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 En@@ coding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ased and closed .
&quot; space do not affect anything but pay attention to &amp; and lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; Tool@@ tip &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; shall be replaced by no leg , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
&quot; to verify the Tag@@ XML files , the tools Dialog in the top of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a window to start and check @-@ tested Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . a further dialogue will appear to follow its simple instructions . &quot;
this function is currently not available . currently the review is given only when charging the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
in the following one example of a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; sch@@ ema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3C ; &amp; XML ; -@@ sch@@ ema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this conference file shall be schem@@ atic .
in the following one example of a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described over@@ load@@ .@@ day .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; En@@ coding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; string &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt;
&quot; the &amp; D p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor for this , accessible via DT@@ D Bear@@ be@@ ite DT@@ D settings . thus , di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly released &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly released &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly released &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; with the following entries are created : &quot;
&#91; general &#93; Version = use 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for any higher version . name = DT@@ D HTML 4.01 transi@@ tional / / EN ) Nickname = The simplified name of DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.01 transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as a nickname . &quot;
an action can set up with settings ... click on New action to the same dialogue :
the short@@ cut of this action can be assigned short@@ cuts . by clicking the button command can be assigned a key@@ note ; with K@@ one is the current keyboard shor@@ ts .
the simpl@@ est actions . it can be entered a text in the determin@@ ated settings and in execution of the action this text is inserted in the document at the current C@@ ursor position . see the example below .
&quot; this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action allows external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that will change the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) , are started . examples of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even the start @-@ start dialogue or the different See in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps . &quot;
&quot; first , the name of the script and the interpre@@ ter may be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ scrip@@ t.@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; although qualified paths allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line : global scrip@@ ting folder : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / scripts / Scrip@@ ts in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variables that can be used in the command line : &quot;
% f : we will be replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file : / from the document@@ aries .
&quot; % pi@@ d : will be replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance is running , the text is unique to the P@@ ID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from external script . &quot;
&quot; the parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or the path to the project file . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the above en@@ umer@@ ated methods , a script can take place of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul . in the selection tool can be determined what to send to the default location . possibilities are : &quot;
selected text : the selected section of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is normally only with this setting useful .
&quot; according to entering the application , the output can also be conducted . there are two types of output : normal edition , written on the default edition ; error messages , on the default edition of the text should be done by the value the drop @-@ output issue is set : &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups . in any case it is not too many , therefore one can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the market . &quot;
&quot; once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add promotions and configure your settings . select Settings actions . &quot;
&quot; the parts of this window are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . pressing the New Action button at the bottom of the window , starts editing mode . &quot;
fill out all the necessary fields and add it to the appropriate tool@@ bar .
&quot; complete everything and , if the day attributes has and you plan their use , activate dialogue &quot; Day &quot; if available , so that an input when using the promotion is possible . &quot;
&quot; Ig@@ itt ! is this a ugly symbol . who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol ? replace it , before we have difficulties . &quot;
&quot; for creating a symbol that the promotion is better represented , we will be able to use &amp; ki@@ con@@ currently ; choose graphics more programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; ki@@ con@@ currently ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select editing size . &quot;
&quot; please note that the created icon will not only help you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P . &quot;
&quot; in view that the day start , is called , I decided to create a run@@ kno@@ b as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually interpreted as loose , rigi@@ d , further interpreted ) , or should at least , a message to the user will be sign@@ aled , that calls this symbol ; -@@ day in the current document will insert . &quot;
&quot; after the creation of the symbol , it has to be associated with the action . this happens through the menu with settings ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selecting the desired action . next to the text field is a button , press it . &quot;
&quot; select the folder , in which the stored symbol is , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; press the apply button and continue them with other tags , so there are still which there or confirm with OK to complete . &quot;
&quot; suppose you want to complement some usual &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; functions to the tool@@ bar , or it should be set to adjust these to better overview by some separ@@ ators into several groups . open the tool@@ boxes to adjust the same tool@@ bar . make sure the desired tool@@ bar is selected . &quot;
&quot; I want to choose the separ@@ ator ( quite left above ) for my tool@@ bar . after selecting the element that is to be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the item to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; for example , I would like to have a quick way to access the kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add them to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; please note , as the separ@@ ator support the group@@ ing . anyone who knows my work@@ tool@@ bar could not know that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ kno@@ b the opposite of the start @-@ button . &quot;
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by pro@@ ach of all symbols to ensure that everything works .
&quot; after re @-@ XML does not backup in the right folder . after new XML does not exist , it will be saved in the correct folder , but your work@@ tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder ( s ) , if a file is opened by the appropriate type . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user is the opportunity to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the form@@ atting language , which you like most . therefore , this chapter describes how I use a &amp; PHP ; -@@ document tree for my personal use . &quot;
&quot; before you start your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory , whether someone has done it for you . &quot;
there are two parts in this process . first you must search an existing documentation for the form@@ atting / script / etc ; -@@ language . then you have to leave the do@@ cr@@ c file . we have to provide the second part we deal here .
&quot; # KDE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = pf@@ ad , relatively to this file , for example , # Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html section 2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html section 2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html section 2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Views 2 = date 1.@@ html &gt; 2 = tag@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2@@ .html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 3@@ .html &quot;
the section tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentary tree . for example you can now see in the &amp; PHP ; documentation so something :
# KDE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level elements Top element = index.html of Cont@@ ents = index.html getting Start@@ ed = In@@ tro@@ duction = % tion@@ .html ? Language Reference = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ ag@@ e.@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .html ... &quot;
&quot; notice the # before getting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this indicates that this is the sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the box @-@ box ( except reason ) m@@ d@@ ash , but try it yourself . &quot;
note that the contents of the directory is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consistent at the upper end of the building view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is displayed ! ) .
&quot; space do not affect anything , but pay attention to &amp; and &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; Resources c@@ end@@ at@@ ine are replaced . &quot;
&quot; the content section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which is designed to display a &amp; PHP ; for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; H for context @-@ help would display the documentation on the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array . there are only two types of entries here : the Con@@ text list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file connector . &quot;
&quot; a simple list of st@@ ain@@ ted context elements that are to be available ( for &amp; PHP , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) . &quot;
&quot; now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c , while the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / doc for local and global use . then create a folder ( as you set this in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation . &quot;
&quot; if you are sure that this good and it is worth to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation have been used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for the use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for the use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for the use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for the use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; community . you will not be proud to have worked with the best web developer platform . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; are you not alone . it is possible to divide the resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ boxes ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; the resources can be sent by e @-@ mail to friends , partners or else to whom will send you an email to send menu items , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email ship , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the scripts . &quot;
&quot; the resources can be up@@ loaded into our main archive , from where all the other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ views ; users can download it . the contributions are reviewed and only available if our team is correct as correct and useless for publication . to ensure a user @-@ use post , it is a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . thus , the origin of the resources is guaranteed , both for our team and for later users . &quot;
&quot; when up@@ loading , you will be asked for their passion for their private G@@ PG keys ( the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event that you have multiple keys you can have a look . in the dialog New resource you must stay on the input fields ( URL preview can be empty ) and with clicking on OK the upload will be started . &quot;
&quot; the upload can upload from the menus DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , upload , tool@@ bar , and in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , nor before the installation , examined &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the un@@ mistak@@ eable of the resource by checking the integrity and signature of the signature . if the integrity given and the resource can then be signed correctly , a message appears with the indication of the origin@@ ator of the resource . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work on XML @-@ languages , which is currently not produced by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it is now also possible to work by creating a D@@ TE@@ P package . it &apos;s the easiest way to convert a DT@@ D automatically into a D@@ TE@@ P package . &quot;
&quot; the conversion can be started from the menu of DT@@ D loading and converting a DT@@ D . select the .@@ dt@@ d file with the DT@@ D description , which will be used . afterwards , the following Dialog will appear : &quot;
target directory : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; will be written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE definition : the string that in ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE Tag , like HTML Public - / / W@@ 3C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.01 transi@@ tional / / EN http : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / ht@@ ml@@ 4 / index@@ .@@ dt@@ d &quot;
&quot; fine setting of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if enabled , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after conversion the &amp; D p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; -@@ editor , with the details of newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this possibility . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; there are some key concepts . to understand and to understand this and full benefit of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , one must first do with these fundamental concepts . this chapter attempts to offer them precisely these concepts , without their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; little benefits . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the working area is divided into three areas : global , local and proj@@ ector . this distinction affects a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; global elements are available to everyone , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; uses , available . by work@@ stations about actions is all that is marked as global , in the joint order structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this allows the group of administr@@ ators to secure different materials , actions and patterns in the global tree , which can then be available each in a multi @-@ user environment at the system . &quot;
local elements represent a personal collection of web developers for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bar . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
&quot; project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be anything from &amp; CSS ; -@@ patterns to work @-@ tool@@ boxes with special actions specifically designed for the files of a particular project . simply said , this is most restricted size . all elements are stored in the folder tree , making the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project em@@ ög@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the Edit@@ or@@ window , the components , the cart@@ els with info and the tool@@ bar . please suggest you in , and for further information about these areas . &quot;
&quot; you can click on the map with the right mouse button in order to download a context menu with the current document , un@@ loading , delete or upload the document , jump to a book@@ mark or execution of CV@@ S command to the current document . &quot;
&quot; right @-@ click in the editors lead to a further context menu regarding the processed document content , such as basic processing steps ( cutting / copy / paste ) , editing of the file under the mouse c@@ ursor , or opening of the file , if the string appears under the mouse c@@ ursor . &quot;
at the top of the editors you will find the tool@@ boxes of the editors . currently the tool@@ bar is shown ; &amp; HTML ; 4.01 transi@@ tional as standard for which one set of tool@@ boxes will be displayed . in the course of further out@@ building of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the tool@@ bar are adapted to the new functions and thus associated users needs .
&quot; the use of tool@@ boxes is really easy . if you want to insert a single day , e.g. &amp; lt ; in their document , then click on the icon that the day is represented . now , you can insert the data for this just added day . if they want to insert the data for this just added day . if they want to insert one day , you can insert several attributes , you can fill in a dialog different fields . &quot;
&quot; the construction sites ( Q@@ IT ; ) enable it to navigate in the information about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to navigate , to open and to track . in the presentation with cardboard boxes , document , scripts , attributes , and documentation are available . &quot;
&quot; project management is a powerful tool , which represents &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this view displays all the files in the project and allows the pamper@@ ing of the files in the project by right mouse @-@ click . actions such as instructions , removal , up@@ loading or delet@@ ing the files from the storage medium can be performed with the then shown context menu . &quot;
&quot; another option of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc . it &apos;s all options open . &quot;
&quot; templates can be divided into three categories , depending on which context they are used . the category depends on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the category range is always available , local templates only for the appropriate user and templates in projects are available only in the project and can be found in the project . &quot;
&quot; here you will find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of break@@ down in Global , Local and Project works here . by clicking with the left mouse button you can retri@@ eve the available information about a script via the right mouse button are further functions , such as the script to start , edit or send with an email . &quot;
&quot; with this view , one shows the internal structure of the active document . through links @-@ clicking on a element the c@@ ursor is set to the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking an element opens a list of commands in terms of navigation and refres@@ her of the tree . &quot;
&quot; this tree appears among the other buildings . with it may change some attributes , and nam@@ esp@@ ace . the modification of all available attributes allows for the change of all available attributes with a few clicks . &quot;
&quot; here is the complete documentation on the Web @-@ technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can refer to a project @-@ specific documentation . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; two cart@@ els at the bottom end of the window , can be achieved through the beneficial information : the news window and the problem window . &quot;
&quot; this cart@@ el shows information about each in Qu@@ anta current script . so , e.g. the DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to DT@@ D will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; this cl@@ ei@@ vers show all errors in the market up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; scripts , which are executed , give all error messages ( so , which exists ) in this window . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; work@@ flows are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they get the appropriate command . the tool@@ bar of the tool@@ bar is the possibility of defining their own prec@@ epts as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to define .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with your mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; sends the tool@@ bar as a com@@ pressing T@@ ar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; if they can secure one tool@@ bar in an email ; like any other secure and load !
it is reasonable if you want to adapt the place of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; auto@@ conf file a number of options that can be delivered to the configure script . to give a complete list of options available to you . / configure --@@ help one . the options are easy to understand and not running here .
&quot; if you have problems when starting from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also you should ensure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in P@@ AT@@ H in front of her bin folder . the same is true for &amp; Q@@ t . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a Web @-@ develop@@ om@@ tool for KDE @-@ surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; has been optimized for a quick web development and combines a well @-@ proven development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
&quot; during the effort to create the best &amp; HTML ; -@@ editor to create , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul began to deal with a seam@@ less idea : what would be , if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; an independent , expand@@ able Mark@@ up languages ? well , this would make him an absolutely greatest Web @-@ development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now already far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summ@@ arized : if one can define it in &amp; XML ; it should be &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for this is the appropriate &amp; IDE ; &quot;
&quot; well , to the above mentioned above must be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; development community is based on why someone else has developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; and smells is not only this all possible , but it allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; so to expand how they need it for their need . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; allows web@@ developers to increase the use of a intui@@ tional and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can increase productivity almost every task . through the program dres@@ ses they can have to remember &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . ( more about it can be found in . )
&amp; qu@@ anta ; plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for a quick web development and quickly expanded to a mature editor with many powerful functions .

&quot; a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time , if you open a file that is not found out , whereby the oldest entry is taken out . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to store code parts and whole files as templates for later use . take a look at the section about templates . should they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project pre @-@ storage folder , only a mistake is reported . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ ts when inser@@ ting the cli@@ p@@ board there , special signs to the &amp; HTML ; -@@ s@@ aut@@ é , so that they displayed correctly and not be understood by the browser as a form@@ ative instruction . &quot;
conver@@ ts the text from the cli@@ p@@ board in &amp; URL ; -@@ case that is the correct way for inser@@ ting special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s primarily used for inser@@ ting &amp; URL ; s in the anchor day .
&quot; turn the block@@ selection or off . this allows you to select text blocks , with the help of &amp; Shi@@ ft ; taste . &quot;
goes directly to a po@@ inter number . this is very helpful when your &amp; PHP ; -@@ script error messages can be saved !
seeks a string or regular expression in selected directory . a kind of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expres@@ sions to help you .
displays the message window to or not . that &apos;s the window in which you see the display of scripts and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
&quot; initial and switching of the problem @-@ re@@ por@@ ters at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window . the problem re@@ por@@ ter is activated , once you change to the structural tree . &quot;
&quot; displays the symbols left from the main window , this column allows you to put reading marks with a mouse click . &quot;
&quot; if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with the entries , depending on the position of the C@@ urs@@ ors in the document . &quot;
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu group@@ ed according to the fil@@ en@@ ames of the other documents .
opens a existing project from the hard drive . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects are stored with the fil@@ es@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog to add files to the current project . the selected files will then be copied into the project directory .
&quot; searches the project directory according to new files , which might be there . that allows e.g. video files to copy in your project folder or a sub@@ folder , and add them to the project . &quot;
&quot; loads the files in your project on the server . the list of available transport methods depend on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; from and whether you have downloaded another inputs / output modules ( K@@ IO Sl@@ aves ) . &quot;
settings such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project manages . in the chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects you will find the details .
loads a project tool@@ bar . these are kept in project / tool@@ bars and are available only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
&quot; a dialogue to save your tool@@ bar . permits you to select the type of tool@@ bar : locally or project .
&quot; opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this creates only the name . actions will need to be added by setting actions ... the tool@@ bar are stored on tool@@ bar &apos;s tool@@ bar , or you will be asked when you want to save the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; remo@@ ves a tool@@ bar from the visible range . that does not delete it from the hard disk . if you have not yet saved the tool@@ bar , you will be asked if you want to do this . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to send their own tool@@ bar on someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; team , so that the tool@@ bar is present in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as an app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; allows the upload of tool@@ bar to the main server , where anyone else can access it . see . &quot;
&quot; invite one &amp; DT@@ D ; , you or someone else made others and convert into the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own specification . &quot;
&quot; loading of En@@ ti@@ y from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it is useful if the entities out of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P are to renew , without the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; in case this global one is not present and a typ@@ ing in the global KDE folder is not available , fails . &quot;
&quot; this menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently charged work@@ stations . if the standard is loaded ( HTML ; ) work@@ tool@@ bar , there is a sub @-@ menu standard that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; allows access to the current day set of dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the menu Tags , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menu . &quot;
&quot; activated or de@@ activ@@ ates the intelligent use of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML @-@ DT@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ ting means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the inser@@ tion using a tool@@ bar , if this day goes against the rules . &quot;
&quot; in the plug @-@ ins menu , the available plugins are listed below the above menu item . click on it . click on a activated plug @-@ ins disabled . &quot;
select the syn@@ tax@@ pay@@ mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schem@@ ata depends on the col@@ ate ; -@@ version .
&quot; select the type of lin@@ t identi@@ fier . very useful , if you know people who use other OS platforms to wrap . select Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh . &quot;
checks the syntax of current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; through the external application of the company .
&quot; immediate switching between the different types of the user interface . due to some restrictions in the KDE libraries can cause the switch sometimes time or un@@ nice graphics . recommended is the card @-@ card mode , which is also default , or the sub@@ window mode , which is the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this menu contains an entry for each open sub@@ window . with selection of a entries the corresponding sub @-@ window will be activated . &quot;
switched the display of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window or off .
&quot; the changes in this dialog uses any application that use the K@@ HTML @-@ Part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Web@@ browser . &quot;
directed the behavior of the editors . in the documentation of &amp; Kate ; you can find details .
&quot; a dialogue appears , in which you can delete items from the tool@@ bar or add and to change the sequences . &quot;
&quot; this should generate a help in accordance with the environment of the mouse , but it is not yet implemented . &quot;
&quot; it is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and free licensed product , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form can be found here . &quot;
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory , and should be filled out from top to bottom , as after filling the project , the whole directory structure for the rest of the project will automatically be completed . all these paths and author information fields can be adjusted later with Shi@@ ft ; F@@ 7 Project project properties are set . &quot;
&quot; here is the name for the project to include , for example foo . when entering name file is automatically filled out . &quot;
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default she has the name of the project in small letters and without any space with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
&quot; here you can access the server @-@ address of the machine , which one wants to access local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exempl@@ .de ) or an IP @-@ address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible . &quot;
&quot; if one lets this field empty , the default settings of the selected log is used . depending on the setting of the remote machine might be an adaptation necessary . &quot;
this is the folder in which the templates for the project is stored . it is a relative path to the project and by default . if a joint collection of files is used for various projects should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder in which the tool@@ bar is stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bar . if a joint collection of files is used for various projects should be set instead of the standard .
&quot; that allows , to include files from the local file system to include the project . it can be selected several files or whole folder . &quot;
&quot; this setting is great if you have st@@ atic web content , you can download and change . when you are using script script ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to go differently . &quot;
&quot; extract if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project , which is to be integrated anywhere in the main folder . if a project is started again , not ho@@ oks . &quot;
&quot; with this option , all the files and folder will be displayed within the main folder and you can make a complete selection after the th@@ inner . &quot;
&quot; this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by An@@ h@@ aken , or , by del@@ e@@ tion of the tick , cl@@ amps from the project . &quot;
&quot; the last screen of the new project assist@@ ants contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can upload , in the menu with project properties in the sub@@ window profile , or with the short@@ cut Shi@@ ft ; F@@ 7 are changed . &quot;
some settings correspond to those in the project assist@@ ants and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( space @-@ holder is possible ) which will be re@@ bound up with project @-@ related surg@@ eries such as project folder .
&quot; suppl@@ ementary option to above , also files , which are listed in .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project . &quot;
&quot; the project view , which is loaded with the opening of the project . it can be read more about project views . &quot;
this can be selected the desired de@@ bu@@ gger . currently only Gub@@ ed can be supported . more information about Gub@@ ed you can find in . the de@@ bu@@ gger Plugin can be set with the button options . in the bug search is described .
&quot; in the sub @-@ window profiles , high @-@ load profiles ( see in ) are set to be set as well as the display of a building view for the contents of the server for any profile , by pointing a dedicated building view for any profile . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details . &quot;
&quot; in the sub @-@ event configuration , one can switch off event actions and add these actions to change or delete events . event actions will be executed if an earlier event occurs , such as the backup of a file . see the details . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus opens : the last project , which was open . this behavior can be currently not currently influenced . &quot;
&quot; to open another project , select project ... from the menu project or the icon project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project is displayed and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; closed , the project file will be automatically saved . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files . same happens when you load a new project . &quot;
&quot; the project @-@ confidence gives free access to the files in the project . there , the files in the current project can be managed . &quot;
&quot; folder are just as well , but the entries are missing and opening with ... in with the right mouse button of the text@@ box : &quot;
here you can get different profiles . the profile contains information on the site of the most sophisticated files . see .
&quot; the removal of the current profile . if only more of a profile exists , the button will end to prevent the del@@ e@@ tion . &quot;
the password is kept in the core memory and forget where there is useful if frequent up@@ loading files needed and which does not save the rather uns@@ afe password on the plate -@@ option does not appear in question .
this will stop the transmission or just leave the dialog when you change your opinion before the up@@ loading .
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; many high la@@ wn@@ profiles can be created , and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be up@@ loaded on different servers . when editing , or create a profile , this dialog will be displayed : &quot;
&quot; this is the name of the server , to which the files will be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or IP address function . &quot;
&quot; the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed K@@ IO Sl@@ aves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP , file ( locally ) and n@@ fs . &quot;
&quot; the port for transfer . normally , this does not need to be changed except the network administrator operates a service not on the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your anxiety wave this is either a time @-@ saving function or risk . use it after your discretion . the password is stored on the plate , so that it can not be simply read , but everyone with programming knowledge can be easily seen in the plain text . &quot;
&quot; a project view is only one set of files and tool@@ bar . it can be downloaded in a project many views , i.e. by simple exchange of view can be loaded and replace the current files and tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; views can be saved in the menu or the project tool@@ bar , accessible via settings of the same project tool@@ bar , open or deleted . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with which one has to do most . this helps not only increase productivity but also allows adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to its own way of working . &quot;
as mentioned above are the tool@@ bar in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; best suited over the menu tool@@ bar . use and execution differ below in the section of adding tool@@ boxes down .
&quot; the tool@@ bar and symbols can be adjusted either by using the context menu ( right click on the tool@@ bar ) , other actions such as work@@ tool@@ bar can be executed , which can be specified in dialogue , where actions on this or other materials can be visible . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a tool@@ bar , in addition the additional items will remove and processed action , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
the tool@@ bar and the actions on them can set up the menu with settings of tool@@ bar ... and define settings .
&quot; templates are basically document@@ aries , code F@@ cut@@ lets and files in general like a common file system with exten@@ sible organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or any one at the system existing directory in the pre @-@ storage area . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in about the restrictions you have for the fil@@ es@@ ystem . &quot;
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; provided precau@@ tions have conditions for their use . please read the conditions before using any template .
&quot; binary is all that not pur@@ er text is . it can be any file except text , so pictures , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; binary templates are usually added in documents using link@@ ages ( e.g. pictures with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in pre @-@ storage area under global templates . &quot;
&quot; documents can be published by any text document . based on these templates , new documents can be published in corresponding sub@@ folders . one makes a simple sc@@ af@@ folding for the purpose and organized the work in appropriate way to be efficiently . some examples can be found in pre @-@ storage area under global templates . see in for more information on templates . &quot;
&quot; this kind of templates is useful if not a new document based on a template , but the same text range is to be inserted again in the documents . you can find everything , from a comment on Jav@@ ascript or Perl basis . some examples are in the pre @-@ storage area under global templates . see in for more information on templates . &quot;
&quot; as the name says , these templates will be organized for entire websites as templates . they are a collection of various documents that can be organised in a folder structure , summ@@ arized in a com@@ pressed t@@ ar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; create a document structure for popularity ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and select a file As a template save as a local template .... &quot;
&quot; once that happen to happen , notice that ( even if it was saved as a project position ) the template is not visible in the project tree . check in the pre @-@ storage area under project templates . &quot;
&quot; select text in your document , and click on the file as a template store as local / project data . alternatively , the selection can easily be drawn with drag@@ ging and distr@@ action on the building view . &quot;
&quot; the production of binary templates is simple : the file is only copy to a pre @-@ storage folder . it is possible to use all file administration functions , such as c@@ ess@@ ation and distr@@ action , or inser@@ ting via the file tree of kon@@ quer@@ or . &quot;
&quot; it can be displayed in the file tree or in the project files , click on a folder on the right and secure Site template to enter a name for the template and secure . by default , it is saved as a local or global template . &quot;
&quot; project templates will allow a very target @-@ oriented approach . you can insert head@@ lines and foot@@ er , or dynam@@ ically with &amp; PHP ; in addition , you can insert some things in the use of templates in projects very profound in mind . &quot;
the pre@@ order structure in the sub @-@ window templates is based on the in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / apps / share / apps / share / apps / qu@@ anta / . each of this folder corresponds to one of four types of containers as above .
&quot; to set the behavior of a folder view , click in the folder overview with right mouse button on the folder and select in the context menu properties tab . the following dialog appears : &quot;
&quot; a selection with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is down@@ grade as soon as elite attributes . &quot;
&quot; this is enabled by default and fits perfectly for everything except the tri@@ bal survey . if a regular folder would be dis@@ able , unless they would be explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder , the bl@@ ah would appear with something like Text @-@ Bau@@ stein . if nothing appears , you probably find yourself in a regular folder . &quot;
&quot; allows or displayed text for templates in this folder . this could be general head@@ lines or foot@@ er for all templates for a specific project and allows copying of ingredients in a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ lines , to provide a whole presentation with the matching head@@ lines / foot@@ er lines . &quot;
&quot; in addition , we have to show a context menu ( to indicate right mouse button ) of a complete command collection for adding folders or copy , paste and paste from one place to another . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and V@@ PL ; and HTML @-@ text editor that are accessible via the menu view . the first mode replaces the Editor window in two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor .
the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor works as follows : he invites a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; XHTML ; -@@ page and a c@@ ursor . then you can edit and switch to the source code editor in which the changes performed in the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor in source code are visible .
&quot; working with the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor on a document , which contains &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; -@@ source code . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor , the source text editor is necessary . there is no plans to change this behavior . &quot;
&quot; the second mode works just like the first , except for the changes both in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor are visible and the c@@ ursor in the source text editor , and in the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor synchron@@ ously run , this mode is already active , the ke@@ yst@@ ing to the active c@@ ursor from a window to the other , where the position in the document is maintained . &quot;
the synchron@@ ization stand between the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and the HTML @-@ text editor is adjustable using settings Qu@@ anta . in the selection of V@@ PL ; -@@ View can be adjusted automatically between synchron@@ ization after one click or automatically . in principle the recommendation is recommended : a small Sp@@ anne for quick calcul@@ ator and a large pot for slow .
&quot; suppose you want to change the title of the website , so the processing of invisible tags at work with the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor will also be called once a new document with the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor will also be created . this is the reduction of suspension of suspension . this allows you to change the following : &quot;
&quot; met@@ a @-@ tags enter the storage of information about the document itself ( e.g. stroke for Internet search engines . met@@ a @-@ elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below or removed . one click on the list enables the modification of content , e.g. key words on the column name and key@@ word key wor@@ t@@ 2 on the contents column . &quot;
CSS @-@ rules are the new way forward to the creation of both sides in the browser . you can add CSS @-@ rules with the buttons below the list and delete a change over the list is exactly as with the met@@ a @-@ elements . the mach@@ ining of CSS @-@ rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS @-@ style data by pressing to the file @-@ button button and select the appropriate file .
&quot; the use of the C@@ urs@@ ors is as described in a text processing , due to due to path@@ ways , possible . under rare conditions the mark@@ ings works as usual . text can be inserted by rede@@ mption and deleted by means of back@@ taste or removal . &quot;
&quot; the inser@@ ting tags will be inserted in the same way over the tool@@ bar , as in the source code editor , it is observed that the inser@@ ting tags before already existing identical tags is not removed if an anchor tag is inserted with text , any other environments needs to be removed . &quot;
some tool@@ boxes such as the tables wiz@@ ard or the lists @-@ assist@@ ent are disabled . they are later used in &amp; V@@ PL ; work in this release the tables or lists works are used .
&amp; x@@ sl@@ db@@ g ; it is a tool for the study of style templates . in contrast to other programs for Stil@@ ts : the search for certain elements is possible and the execution of the style data can be prosec@@ uted .
&quot; to be able to compile &amp; x@@ sl@@ db@@ g ; successfully compile it , except &amp; k@@ de ; still the libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ bex@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ x@@ ml that are in a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ; already present . &quot;
&quot; stop in a template , at a place in one of x@@ sl@@ db@@ g loaded sty@@ ling or x@@ ml file or at the current node . new in x@@ sl@@ db@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in g@@ db @-@ Comp@@ ati@@ bility mode can be set and later activated . &quot;
x@@ sl@@ db@@ g select the complete path from a fil@@ en@@ ame without a path of fil@@ en@@ ames . fil@@ en@@ ames in the same folder as the top charged @-@ file fil@@ en@@ ames with relative path to the Work@@ folder con x@@ sl@@ db@@ g is available for example a Stil@@ m@@ um@@ at@@ ei .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l the following entry is possible :
&quot; in this command a partial or complete match with a pre@@ age named QNA@@ ME or specified model name is checked . &amp; eg ; template corresponds with any QNA@@ ME , which contains the string template . &quot;

there are many graphical tools to the same . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain briefly why I wrote .
the con@@ duction was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ or many changes made at the same time . another programmer had altered a lot of text in the same file . the result were numerous conflicts in the same file .
&quot; the program used by me showed me only the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly changed within these lines . and there was no evidence on the places , where perhaps only the objection had changed . this changes was a small night@@ mare . &quot;
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could display differences within one line and changes to white signs . later any amount of other useful features were added .
&quot; if you want to compare quickly text , just copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and add it into one of the comparison window . &quot;
a function which made a lot of work was the compar@@ isons and merge of folders . this function changed &amp; diff@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost in a complete file browser .
also 3 @-@ way merge together is complete . this is useful when two people operate independently of each other at a piece of co@@ de work and changes . the original file ( the base ) helps to resolve the differences . in this editor you can even edit the result even directly . in this editor you can even edit the result even directly . the screens@@ hot displays three qu@@ ell files in the result :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; helps you also in compar@@ isons and merge complete folder . this screens@@ hot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folder @-@ merge :
&quot; diff@@ user : displays the exact differences and be@@ di@@ fies the possibilities of active color monitors . if you have to check it frequently code , you will like this function . &quot;
&quot; differences in white signs and tablets are visible . if lines only differ in a certain number of white signs , one can see it at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no trouble anymore when J@@ em@@ and the unic@@ ation changes . ) &quot;
&quot; if a file is equal , and the other is different in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both files are different . &quot;
&quot; if all files are the same name , but in different folders , you can facilitate the typ@@ ing work by writing only the fil@@ en@@ ame of the first file . example : &quot;
&quot; diff@@ use 1 folder 2 Or@@ der@@ 2 Or@@ ner@@ 2 -@@ o target folder k@@ diff@@ 3 Or@@ ner@@ 1 folder 2 Or@@ ner@@ 3 Or@@ ner@@ 3 Or@@ ner@@ 3 folders 3 -@@ o target folder
&quot; the opening dialog enables the fil@@ en@@ ame fil@@ en@@ ame , the selection of the file browser ( file ... ) or select a recently opened file from the file list . the opening @-@ dialog will indicate your selection and shows them again next time . you don &apos;t have to put the file for C blank , the analysis of the differences are carried out with two files . &quot;
&quot; select folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the compar@@ isons will be selected , for B and C however a folder , then used &amp; diff@@ user ; the fil@@ en@@ ames from A to the two other folders . &quot;
&quot; when mer@@ ged , the input field is active for the goal and is to edit itself . however , it is not necessarily required to set out immediately a release file . you can do this step later when saving . &quot;
the set @-@ up button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before you start with the same / box .
&quot; sometimes you do not want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to select text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board in the active comparison window . the comparison begins immediately . in the opening dialogue you have to select no files , you can simply connect the dialog with the Canc@@ el button . &quot;
you can also use pul@@ ling and distr@@ action : simply drag a file from a file manager or select text from an editor and let him fall over a comparison window .
&quot; what thought is behind it ? sometimes a file contains such as multiple similar features . if you want to find out how similar to these functions , it would be a relatively large effort . you would have to upload only two corresponding files , it would load into &amp; diff@@ use . now you can copy the relevant sections just copy , paste and then compare . &quot;
note : currently you cannot draw anything from &amp; diff@@ use ; only the fall of text into a comparison window will be supported .
warning : some editors interpret the dial and distr@@ actions of text into another program as ex@@ cre@@ ase and paste ( instead of copying and inser@@ ting ) . in such a case your original data could be lost .
&quot; in the upper part of each text window , the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ames and the foref@@ athers number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that Windows c is optional . ) J@@ ede Info @-@ line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , leave the mouse a while over the line . then a small aid window will display the full name . ) &quot;
&quot; the three source windows are assigned the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed over the settings menu . ) &quot;
&quot; when a difference is detected , one looks at the color , which file is different . ( colour for conflicts in the settings ) . the paint scheme is especially useful when you compare three files . that &apos;s the next section ( merge ) well . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the text there is the compositions column . when differences were found , the column shows the appropriate color . in some programming languages the color is not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + , B. are white signs only in character chains and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in a few , rare cases . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line , which separates the conver@@ ts column of text , is interrupted on the places where the respective source file is not activated , the line is displayed on the broken lines . &quot;
&quot; the result window ( among the comparison windows ) also has a info line with the heading issue : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; changed &#93; when you have dealt the result . usually , it contains through the automatic merge already text , but often it also contains conflicts . &quot;
! ! ! up to all conflicts are dis@@ solved , the store is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons to find nights / un@@ resolved conflict in order to find even remaining conflicts . ) &quot;
&quot; if only two compar@@ ing windows are used , each difference is also a conflict which must be solved manually . &quot;
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the window will appear to the line included in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . ( this will also be a jump of position in windows where the top of the group will not be visible . ) This group will be highlighted the current group . it is highlighted with the color background color for the current area and each other on the left appears a black @-@ black beams .
&quot; sometimes , through the automatic assem@@ bling or by manual editing , no more line remains in the group ; then it is displayed in these lines of text &amp; lt ; one line will be displayed in the source . this text does not appear in the final file , nor in a mark@@ ings that you might copy or paste elsewhere . &quot;
&quot; the text &amp; lt ; assem@@ bling flow , however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board , if you copy such text from the result window . go carefully with this function . &quot;
&quot; note : if when selecting the sources the options ignore or ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + comments are enabled , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white signs . &quot;
&quot; navig@@ ates mainly with the images and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you are in one of the windows , you can use the arrows icon , right , end , end , stress @-@ beginning and stress @-@ end , as you can also use it from other programs . the over@@ s column next to the vertical scroll bar can also be used to navigate . &quot;
&quot; in the eye @-@ table , you can also use the other buttons to use . with the insert button , you can switch between inser@@ tions and over@@ look mode . ( default is the insert mode . ) &quot;
one click with the left mouse button in one of the compositions are synchron@@ ized the view of all windows to the top of each group ( as already in the section ) and explains the edi@@ ble output .
the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the latest / first / last difference ( stress @-@ bottom / stress @-@ top ) to the next / v@@ ori@@ gen conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ image down@@ wards ) or to the next / v@@ orian conflicts ( str@@ g @-@ image down@@ wards ) or to the next / v@@ orian conflicts ( str@@ g @-@ image down@@ wards ) . therefore , must be seen between resolved and un@@ resolved conflicts . &quot;
&quot; to copy the mark@@ ings into the cli@@ p@@ board , you will need to copy the copying -@@ button ( str@@ g @-@ C or shr@@ g inser@@ ting ) . be careful automatically to the cli@@ p@@ board and manually copy the manual copying . be careful with this option but you might fail to fail the content of the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
po@@ inters are saved according to the underlying operating system . Unix variations are using a line @-@ based characters \ \ r \ . K@@ diff@@ 3 reserves the foref@@ athers of the source files so that you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not with bin@@ aries .
the options and the list of the most recently used files will be automatically saved and restored during the next start . ( menu Settings ) - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 set up ... )
&quot; select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose from , you should not use it . ) &quot;
&quot; if you activate this option are differences in cur@@ si@@ ver writing . if the chosen script does not support this presentation , nothing happens . &quot;
&quot; on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be pointed out . on these systems the button settings automatically constitutes an odd color . &quot;
&quot; when this option is activated , the wir@@ es of the Tab@@ ulator button is inserted the appropriate number of spaces . otherwise , a tab@@ ulator character is inserted . &quot;
&quot; if you press or return , the entries of the previous line will automatically be used for the next row . &quot;
&quot; if this option is activated , each selection is automatically copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . the manual copy into the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
&quot; you can select , which line @-@ line type you prefer to save . the pre @-@ set value is the general standard selection on the operating system used . &quot;
&quot; at the compar@@ isons of files tried &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; first , all completely identical lines can be ignored in the source files . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . the second step compar@@ es every line . in this step , white signs will not be ignored . even when they merge white signs will not be ignored . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) store a wagon test &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , others have only look identical , although they are different . if this option is activated , wagon have to be disabled . during which this option must be disabled . in the default setting this option is disabled . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and related characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are nevertheless indicated , but they are treated like white signs . &quot;
in the default setting this option is disabled . changes in comments will be treated like changes in white signs .
intensi@@ vely looking for even smaller differences . the option is activated in the default setting . it is effectively with complicated and large files , but slowly with very large files . &quot;
&quot; in the automatic transmission mode , this attitude determines how long the outcome of the selection is displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict will continue . &quot;
dis@@ solve automatic all conflicts in white signs by using the selected file as a source code . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful when the Autom@@ atic selection can also be used in numbers or comments when the options are ignore or ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + -@@ comments .
these options are dealt with in the chapter on scanning order and run a con@@ duction . look for details under documentation to the directory comparison and con@@ duction .
&quot; when a file is stored and already an older version exists , the original version is attached to the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup . &quot;
adap@@ ts the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the current running program . you have to finish &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; end and rest@@ art again to make the change active . ( this option is set in the KDE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set global over the control center . )
&quot; the following codi@@ fication settings can be adjusted for each entry separately . if you have enabled this option , for all entries the above settings is used . &quot;
&quot; through the selection of fields for the coding appears a short notice , which is the local coding . ( this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character . ) &quot;
adjust the file coding for source files . this influences how special characters can be treated and interpret . as the coding for each file is adjustable separately , even files can be compared with different co@@ coding . &quot;
&quot; if you have processed a file , you can specify which coding to be used to save . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre @-@ processing commands , they may not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files can be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processing command can be set only with 8 @-@ bit ASC@@ II . ) With this option , one can specify the coding of the output of pre @-@ processing commands . &quot;
&quot; turn this to supp@@ ress cur@@ sions of changes in white signs in the text or review , ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments when the options are ignore or ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + -@@ comments are activated . ) &quot;
&quot; this selection is only available when you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are shown in a color@@ fully ko@@ di@@ ated over@@ t column . but sometimes you might just want to see the differences between two of three files . according to the choice of A &amp; lt ; C or B &amp; lt ; C is also displayed in addition to the normal still a second Over@@ view column with the required information . &quot;
sometimes you would like to use the available space on the screen rather for long lines . bl@@ ends simply the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu . )
orders the comparison side by side or over@@ each other . this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
&quot; sometimes you consider the differences and then opt @-@ immediately to bring the files together . a simple click starts together with the file name and uses the file name for output files , then the name of the most recently used output files will be maintained . ) &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it will be transferred to this external command . in &amp; R@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the instruction will be visible , and not the file itself . you can use your own preferences , which corresponds exactly your requirements . you can use this function for example , cut any dis@@ rup@@ tive parts or for correct the inser@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it is specified first to this external command ( see above ) , then the output of the instruction will be used only if you write your own processor , which corresponds to your own preferences , which corresponds to your needs . each entry line must have an associated issue line . &quot;
&quot; the thought behind it is to allow the user to enable more flexibility when making the di@@ ff results . however , most users want to program not even program@@ m@@ able . the good news is however , that in most cases , sed or perl completely suff@@ ers . &quot;
use this pre @-@ processing command to convert the input into large letters : sed &apos; s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ \ &apos; The \ \ 1 in the setup string . the \ \ A conver@@ ts the text in large letters .
CV@@ S and other version control systems use some key@@ word ( info \ \ _ BA@@ R _ log \ \ _ BA@@ R _ log \ \ _ BA@@ R _ log \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ _
&quot; while you are experimenting with sed , you may begin to understand it and maybe you may even think these regular expres@@ sions even . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
&quot; the ign@@ oring of numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of another pre @-@ processing command for lin@@ eup . sed &apos; s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 89.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; E@@ der sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , so virtually deleted by anything . &quot;
sometimes you might want to perform several missions at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; use to separate the compositions . example :
instead of sed you can also use something else like perl perl . perl -@@ p -@@ p &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / Re@@ ading / switch &apos; aller@@ gen are needed for perl some details . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs perl only ( and ) without the subject &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre@@ processor are kept for display and merge . the further operations are only changing the data that the Zei@@ len@@ ght @-@ Al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus sees .
&quot; note : in rare cases when you use a normal Pre@@ processor , the Zei@@ len@@ ght @-@ Pre@@ processor sees the issue of normal Pre@@ processor than input . &quot;
&quot; the processor commands are very useful , but as with any function , the text changes or differences , you cannot notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case . &quot;
often programmers have to edit programmer in a folder many files . for this reason you can compare with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete file recur@@ sively and merge together .
... &quot; makes for each object to merge a proposal ; you can adjust the proposal from the start , &quot;
&quot; can simul@@ ate this simul@@ ate and shows the simul@@ ated changes without it really perform , &quot;
... &quot; runs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 button ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) , &quot;
this is very similar to the compar@@ isons and merge of single files . you just need to enter a folder on the command line or in the dialog file .
&quot; when three folders are gathered together , folder 1 is used as a base . if no target folder was indicated , used &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; folder 3 as target folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , do not bring together . to start together , you have to press the appropriate menu @-@ menu or press the F@@ 7 button . ( further details follow . ) &quot;
&quot; during the reading of the folder you will inform you a small message window on current progress . if you break the scanning the folder , only the files are listed , which were compared until then . &quot;
&quot; when scanning the folder is finished , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side , ... &quot;
&quot; each file and each folder that was found during the scan , is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click . &quot;
&quot; the folder structure is usually displayed together . you can double up a folder by clicking on the + / - click , or using the arrow buttons on the left / right . the folder menu contains two functions All sub@@ directories , and all sub@@ directories with which you can catch all the folder or fl@@ ap . &quot;
&quot; when you click on a file , the file will be released and it appears a comparison window . &quot;
the symbol in the column name reflects the dat@@ at@@ ype in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
&quot; if the data type is different in different orders , then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail window to the selected object . in such a case , the tran@@ sp@@ hr action cannot be automatically chosen . if this is done together , you will be informed about problems of this kind . &quot;
&quot; as shown in the above picture , you will be used in the columns A / B / C the colors red , green , yellow , and black . &quot;
&quot; however , the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different . &quot;
&quot; folder are considered to be identical if their overall content is identical . then , the same color is the same color . at the folders , age is ir@@ relevant for its colour . &quot;
&quot; the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf@@ y , which is only green , then yellow is and later when it is old , red . &quot;
&quot; a and C identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if you do not exist , delete the target , if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; a and B are identical , but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target , if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; B and C identical , but not A : copy from A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target , if it exists ) &quot;
... A , B and C not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B a file ) : errors : contradic@@ tory data types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , this cannot be launched . &quot;
... A and B does not have the same file type ( e.g. if a folder and B a file is ) : errors : contradic@@ tory data types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist cannot be launched .
&quot; the mode for synchron@@ ization is active , if only two files and no explicit target folder were specified and if the option directories have synchron@@ ise . then choose &amp; diff@@ use ; the necessary action , so that both folders are identical . if for an entry ... &quot;
... A and B exist but not identical are : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees the visible fil@@ en@@ ames for the output files only B ; directly after the result copied &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
&quot; when two files are assembled and the option of new file will be activated ( uns@@ afe ) , then examined &amp; diff@@ user . if the files are different , but the date is identical , but the date is identical .. Sol@@ ange cannot be eliminated such error , the folder cannot be launched . &quot;
&quot; during the result there will be one file after the other . you have status column indicates , when the result was successfully completed , and according to other messages , if something is expected , you should make a final review and check if the status is everywhere in order . &quot;
&quot; if in the interior dialog , the file compar@@ ative method of full analysis is selected , K@@ diff@@ 3 other columns , deleted , not white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts will be displayed only when three folders are compared or assembled . ) &quot;
&quot; you can either merge the selected entry ( File or Od@@ ner ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the compositions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can merge this . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you have not specified a target mode , then used in the three @-@ folder mode C as the target , the two @-@ folder will be chosen as the destination and used while synchron@@ ize A and / or B as a destination . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected a target folder , please check if all entries should be displayed in the target folder , even in the folder structure . check these options to avoid un@@ lov@@ able surprises : &quot;
to bring all entries to : select directory / continue in the folder menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cuts ) . to run only the current entry : select action of current elements or push F@@ 6 .
&quot; if caused by contradic@@ tory data , there are still invali@@ d actions , a message appears to have the faul@@ ty elements . you can then select a valid promotion . &quot;
&quot; when you merge all entries , a dialogue window appears with the options , simul@@ ating and Canc@@ el . &quot;
&quot; select simul@@ ate if you just want to see what would happen , without the really changes happen . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions . &quot;
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then leads certain actions with all entries . if a manual procedure is needed ( merge a single file ) then it opens up a merge window ( note the screens@@ hot ) .
&quot; if you are finished with a file , select again fil@@ tering , or press F@@ 7 . if you have not saved any corresponding dialog . then , a corresponding dialog . then leads &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; his work will continue with the next entry . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a mistake , there will be a message and detailed status information . at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you to select the cause of the problem or to solve the trouble @-@ related entry . thus , you have the opportunity to select another action for entry or to solve the problem before you continue . &quot;
&quot; if some of the entries have been compiled individually , these entries ( in the current session ) and execute them together again . even if this has been assembled or not saved . only if you change the promotion &apos;s action , these entries will be assembled again . &quot;
the settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu settings - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 set ... ) now has a section called directory con@@ duction with these options :
only files that fit to the specified patterns are displayed in the sub@@ tree . split the pattern with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; valid plac@@ ements : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default setting must not correspond to this pattern .
&quot; files and folder that correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the sub@@ tree , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as parti@@ tions . valid plac@@ ements : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
&quot; files and folder that correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the sub@@ tree , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as parti@@ tions . valid plac@@ ements : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
ignored files that would also be ignored by CV@@ S . many aut@@ mati@@ cally be@@ got files are ignored by CV@@ S . the big advantage is that this folder is specific with a .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( look at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
&quot; in some file systems , files have an ent@@ angl@@ ed attribute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystem , a file appears as hidden . this option allows you to determine whether these files are to be displayed in the sub@@ tree or not . this option is switched on the default . &quot;
&quot; when links on files : if the option is switched off , symbo@@ lic@@ ally inter@@ rup@@ tions are compared . if the option is switched , the files are compared to which the links show . this is disabled in the default . &quot;
&quot; when the option is switched off , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is switched off , the links like normal folder will be examined and recur@@ sively . ( note that the links like normal folder will be examined and recur@@ sively ) . ( note that a link to a folder of a link would lead to a continuous loop , and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; cr@@ ashes . ) This option is switched on the default . &quot;
&quot; a complete analysis of each file through and displays the statistics columns . ( the number of deleted , un@@ resolved analysis , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The full analysis is slower than a simple bin@@ aries analysis , and much slower when it is applied to files that will not contain any text . ( enter an appropriate anti @-@ pattern . ) &quot;
&quot; if you compare a large folder on a slow network , it &apos;s possibly faster to compare only the change of change and the file size . however , this speed will cost a certain level of security . please use caution . this option is in the default . &quot;
&quot; similarly as confidential for the change of change . there is no real comparison instead . the files are considered identical , if when copying the change of change . please use caution . this option is in the default . &quot;
&quot; enabled the sync mode when two files are to be compared and no target folder . in this mode , the proposals will be identical to each folder . also the results are stored in both folders . this option is switched on in pre @-@ setting . &quot;
&quot; if there are differences , instead of bringing the copying of the newer file as action . ( this is seen as uns@@ afe , as it is assumed that the other file is not changed too . you should consider this in any case . ) This option is switched on the default . &quot;
&quot; if a file or folder is replaced by another or deleted , then the original version is ren@@ amed and gets the extension .@@ original file with the .@@ ori@@ g extension already exists , this is also associated with additional backup . this option is also folded . this option is switched on the default . &quot;
&quot; normally , the folder @-@ merge view will be able to merge with the mouse . if you do not want to switch the window boxes with the mouse . if you do not want to switch the window folder window window , and switch off the window window in the window menu and switch from a change between directory &amp; text window to switch between the two views . &quot;
&quot; probably you prefer to compare a file simply by double @-@ clicking on the menu . you can also result in the folder menu , using the folder menu . once you save the result , the status will run automatically and the file will not be assembled once you start the folder . &quot;
&quot; however , this status will be lost if you want to check the directory again : list menu : new &quot;
&quot; KDE supports network transparent with the help of K@@ IO sl@@ aves . K@@ diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders which are on local or remote machines . &quot;
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on the FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a zi@@ pped Archives with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax than local files and folders . a few things should be considered :
&quot; a path can be relatively its und@@ uly or .. . that &apos;s not possible with URLs , these are always absolute . &quot;
&quot; bad@@ ges must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , whit@@ eboard &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # foo # the URL file : / % 23@@ foo % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes through the protocol used . it follows a brief list of restrictions : &quot;
&quot; or it cannot be distinguished if a link is displayed on a file or folder , then a file is accepted as a link @-@ destination . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) . &quot;
there is no way to edit permission or change date . therefore , the justi@@ fication or change date from the original from . ( note that the option is familiar to the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . ) &quot;
&quot; the main purpose is currently available as differences in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op starts first always the built @-@ in differences , press the right mouse button on the differences , and then select In K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part view from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; usually requires &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; two complete input files . if it is applied as a patch , takes a patch file in the Uni@@ fied format . at least one of the two files needs to exist . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file . &quot;
&quot; in kon@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu P@@ review in - K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work if any of the original files exists . besides , this is un@@ reliable when the original files have been altered since the patch of the patch . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; as part executed , it only supports the compar@@ isons of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . the result , or the compar@@ isons of folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode . &quot;
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now Hei@@ st it Comp@@ are ) are already . in addition the name K@@ diff@@ 3 already indicates that it may result in like the program diff@@ use 3 out of the Di@@ ff Tool collection .
I use GPL @-@ programs already very long and have learned a lot by going on the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programmers who have taken this path or go to it .
&quot; you have compiled the program from the sources , and the configure script probably do not find the correct pre@@ fix to KDE . in the default configuration items in / usr / local , but then KDE can not find the resources for user interface ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ ui@@ .@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this topic . &quot;
&quot; if only the number of white signs is different , these lines be treated as identical ; if only a non @-@ white character is different , the row will appear as not identical . if the lines appear next to each other , this in is , but this is in the case . &quot;
&quot; the editor ex@@ clude any difference in the files where it begins and where it ends . this is necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking in the source text and select the button . this important information is , however , if the result is simply saved as text file and it &apos;s extra effort to create extra a separate file format , which could save this information . &quot;
the effort for this was so far too big . you can recover a certain version always by selecting a source A / B / C . to process larger amounts of text should be used for any other editor .
&quot; after removing text is suddenly lt ; No sr@@ c left , and the text does not delete it . what does this mean and how can it be removed ? &quot;
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; used already many colors to highlight differences . even more ho@@ oks would be conf@@ using and missing the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you very much !
&quot; to use all the functions of &amp; diff@@ diff@@ use , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or higher . &quot;
information on how to use K@@ diff@@ 3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage .
a list of recent changes can be found at http : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ forge@@ .net / ch@@ angel@@ og or in the file ch@@ angel@@ og in the Qu@@ ell package .
&quot; to compile &amp; diff@@ use ; on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; to compile and install , use the following command in the base folder of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ distribution : &quot;
&quot; KDE @-@ dir gives the folder in your system , installed in the KDE . if you are uns@@ afe , you will find more details about the RE@@ AD@@ ME file . &quot;
&quot; as &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should not have any problems at comp@@ iling . should nevertheless occur difficulties , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Mail@@ ing@@ lists . &quot;
cut ( Str@@ g @-@ X or tran@@ sh@@ alt removal ) copies into the cli@@ p@@ board and delet@@ es the marked text . insert the text from the cli@@ p@@ board to the current C@@ urs@@ or@@ position an or replaces the current mark@@ ings .
&quot; only differences are displayed : files that are identical in all folders , and therefore not in the folder structure . &quot;
&quot; ( in the current version version , you have to update to these options the folder with the function Ref@@ res@@ h . ) &quot;
&quot; there are only entries displayed , the differences also have that identical files will not be copied into the target folder . if the target folder will not already be copied into the target folder . ( the behavior will probably be modified in a later program version . ) This option is switched on in the default version . &quot;
&quot; note the buttons for selecting the source with the cap@@ tion A , B and C below the menu bar . if you attached to one of the buttons , the lines are already attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) , they will be removed when clicking on the button . &quot;
in the default setting this option is disabled . Under@@ cover in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white signs .
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager , shows a mini@@ vor@@ ti@@ look of all virtual working spaces . it is quite convenient to change the current programs on the work floor to change her size , or move it . this works both within a work@@ space and several . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager : can display all virtual work@@ spaces , as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to another . &quot;
&quot; with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both inside a work@@ space and other labour @-@ surfaces . &quot;
&quot; the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked ; if on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager , it has been cli@@ cked on an application within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager , but also cli@@ cked the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries to minim@@ ise , maxim@@ ize , on the desktop and loading . the commands make the following : &quot;
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the work@@ space . appears only when applied to an application .
send the application to selected virtual work@@ space . appears only when applied to an application .
&quot; is this road marked , you can move window within the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other working surfaces . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , are shown in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the names of the virtual work@@ spaces are shown . &quot;
&quot; select this field leaves the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; view the numbers of virtual work@@ spaces ; the numbers of the virtual work@@ spaces are displayed together with name , the names are provided with Or@@ din@@ osau@@ r , &amp; eg ; 1st work@@ space . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , the background of every work space is also shown as background in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , the current programs as small windows are displayed in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise , only the empty spaces are displayed to allow their selection . &quot;
here the view of the program windows selected . simply shows easy rect@@ angle with the proportions of the program window . symbol shows the window with their standard symbol and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program . remark : Pix@@ map is recommended only for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager will be determined : classi@@ cally leaves &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ n @-@ R@@ aster works ; wa@@ it@@ cht shows all virtual work@@ spaces in a wa@@ ag@@ right and ver@@ tically in a sen@@ k@@ right row that is very good for the display side on the desktop .
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager Mini@@ ature program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , which can display windows as symbols or with their content , and it is also running out of the control bar . &quot;
&quot; right click within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager , and then select out of switch switch ... can set the dialog settings . &quot;
&quot; currently , this cannot be modified in the dialog settings . you can do this but manually : &quot;
&quot; open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or VI . if you do not need to login to the file , you must register as user root or contact your system administrator . in this file you have to apply the key win@@ dow@@ Transpar@@ ent mode and assign values to it . possible values are : &quot;
&quot; da &amp; k@@ p@@ ager , part of the package base is , you need a functioning installation of the KDE basic packages . &quot;

&quot; &amp; km@@ ag ; is a screen saver . you can enlarge with &amp; km@@ ag ; a part of the screen enlarge , as if you use the newspaper for various users . this application is interesting for different users : this includes artists , Web @-@ designers and people with a visual impair@@ ment . this documentation is intended to be a complete manual for the use of &amp; km@@ ag . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ag ; is a very powerful application , which is constantly enhanced to new features . it is optimized for use on powerful machines . &quot;
&quot; when you run &amp; km@@ ag ; start a window as above . the main window of &amp; km@@ ag , shows the enlarged area of the screen . below the picture is displayed as a magni@@ fier window , the picture that is displayed in enlar@@ ging window , is an enlarged area of the screen and is described below as a selection window . &quot;
in the standard setting increases &amp; km@@ ag ; the area around the mouse c@@ ursor as a moti@@ on@@ ous magni@@ fier . alternatively you can provide a selected screen area in enlar@@ ging window ( selection mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse button on the screen ( eg ; on the left side of the screen ) .
&quot; you want to avoid that the mouse c@@ ursor in the enlarged window will be displayed , select the mouse c@@ ursor . please note that is not able to see the form of the mouse c@@ ursor . this is always the default side ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ mouse c@@ ursor . &quot;
&quot; in the drop @-@ window mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mo@@ unts and change its size . this can be done in the following ways : &quot;
move the mouse c@@ ursor in enlar@@ ging window and keep the left mouse button pressed so you can catch the content of the magni@@ fying window and move it . this also goes with the arrow buttons .
&quot; if you additionally press the &amp; Shi@@ ft , taste or use &amp; M@@ MB ; you can move the window window . &quot;
with this combination you can change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the drop @-@ window remains fixed and only the lower right corner is to move .
&quot; &amp; km@@ ag ; possesses a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer , to insert a file into the cli@@ p@@ board ( to add it later into other applications ) , turning the picture and much more . &quot;
&quot; start or stop the update of the ad . the update of the update causes , that the needed CPU time is against 0 . &quot;
&quot; select the actu@@ alization rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , medium , H@@ och , Very high ) . the higher the actu@@ alization rate , the more CPU time is required . &quot;

&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates one mouse @-@ click , once the mouse c@@ ursor a while at the same place . it is intended to help people suffer the R@@ SI syndrome ( Re@@ peti@@ tive syndrome ) and which each mouse @-@ click pain is prepared . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates one mouse @-@ click , once the mouse c@@ ursor a while on the same place . it is intended to help people suffer the Re@@ peti@@ tive strain of In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) and which each mouse click pain . this requires a little practice . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain that is created by clicking the mouse , and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately you can encounter pain that should be combined with the use of your computer , you should do a doctor if this is not yet done . &quot;
&quot; to make it clear : even though &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; p@@ ains that helps when clicking with the mouse , it is against pain that is caused by the account of the mouse , useless . and as with all ergonomic aids apply : the result can be different for each different . &quot;
the use of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and leads one mouse @-@ click once you sign the motion briefly .
&quot; if the intelligent rel@@ oc@@ ating is enabled , makes &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a rest , after the end of the movement , before leaving the mouse button . this way you can run the mouse , it takes a little bit of exercise , but you get used quickly by it . &quot;
this stay time must be hidden after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; one mouse click of the mouse .
&quot; is Int@@ ellig@@ ent Ver@@ push is active . here the time is shut down , the &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool becomes active . here the time is shut down , the &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after down@@ press the mouse button is waiting , before it leaves the mouse button again , if the mouse has no account of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now is now activated by mouse shift . this function is enabled , followed by a break , a click with the right mouse button . this movements are stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ txt , when &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time will start , but they can be changed later . &quot;
&quot; when the sound is del@@ ayed , you can shor@@ ten the response time , you can move on Sound &amp; Multimedia , select there sound system and here the rider General . there is a sli@@ der @-@ bu@@ ffer , which you adjust to a lower value to shor@@ ten the response times . &quot;
&quot; this setting is marked , is called &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; start with any start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only under &amp; k@@ de ; available at GNO@@ ME or other window environments , please check the respective documentation to figure out how to start a program . &quot;
&quot; if all settings go back to the values , which were set for the opening of the dialogue . have you already applied the button , the settings will be applied to the last gland of the dialog . &quot;
&quot; the best use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; initially using pre @-@ settings . in particular , the intelligent moving should let you go first off . if you have then acc@@ ust@@ omed to the automatic mouse click , you can later make the intelligent moving . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; at sounds . &quot;
&quot; first , you should consciously make yourself aware of which places a mouse @-@ click without effect remains : the click on the neutral components of windows or in places in the browser window that doesn &apos;t have a link to un@@ realized reactions . you can therefore park the mouse at such places until you want to use them again . &quot;
&quot; when your mouse bu@@ ck@@ elt , you should clean your mouse . this is usually pretty simple . the trick is that you are not just clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come with the mouse ball in touch . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to take out the mouse ball . as that happens , is different from mouse to mouse . it should be clear , if you watch the bottom of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the roles . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used . the dirt and the dirt can easily be made with a flat blade or the fingers crossed . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations the operating system inter@@ rup@@ t@@ ends the execution of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if it is just a shooting distance , that means that &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool means that the operation may not end up anymore through the slogan of the mouse button . &quot;
this happens when you use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; using another window manager and move a window .
&quot; the solution to this problem consists in that you can carry out a mouse @-@ click . this is the status of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; return , and you can continue to work as usual . &quot;
&quot; problem : if you enter text , tries &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to run mouse clicks and sets the c@@ ursor to another place . &quot;
&quot; solution : use the mouse to place the c@@ ursor to place where you want to have it . however , you can &apos;t get the mouse on a neutral area of the work@@ space , if you do not want to give it a keyboard . secure zones for the mouse c@@ ursor and menus , the gray areas around the tool@@ boxes and the cover lines of windows . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with the intelligent working , but I don &apos;t make it to edit text . &quot;
&quot; the intelligent rel@@ oc@@ ating is an advanced function of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you to handle it . it is very likely possible to copy and insert it into the cli@@ p@@ board , where you want to move into the cli@@ p@@ board , while you want to move the mouse with penet@@ rating mouse button . but there will probably be some advice to them : &quot;
&quot; use the intelligent rel@@ oc@@ ating not , if you just begin using &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; highlight text instead , lead the mouse button on the other end of the text , while you move the mouse button on the other end of the text and turn again the mouse button again . &quot;
&quot; you can use the audi@@ ble mouse click . by doing it , each mouse button presses a sound like a mouse @-@ click . so , you know exactly when in the smart twi@@ sting the shooting period begins . later , you can use the intelligent temp@@ ting even without the audi@@ ble mouse click here . but it requires some practice . &quot;
to be able to use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use the X@@ test extension for &amp; X Window ; it should be the case to most system .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available when the system features a sound@@ card and speakers and this is correct .
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; made the mouse button soon as soon as the mouse c@@ ursor shortly , this program was designed for people who suffer the R@@ SI syndrome and that the fe@@ asts of the Mau@@ sta@@ est pain is prepared . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured so that there is a certain time waiting for a drop @-@ operation starts , before the mouse is released . in this way the pul@@ ling and distr@@ action can be performed with the mouse . &quot;

&amp; km@@ outh ; is a program with the m@@ ute user can speak their computer for themselves .
&quot; with the program &amp; km@@ outh , there may be m@@ ute users to speak to the computer for themselves . the user can choose from a list of talking on propositions which are to be talked again . &quot;
&quot; on the first page of the wiz@@ ard ( lin@@ kes screens@@ hot ) enter the command , which will later be used for the voice edition of text . further details can be found in the description of the furnishings . &quot;
&quot; on the second page , you can choose the default text manual . from the text@@ bags you can often use text pass@@ able , without having to enter them . the text@@ passages can of course be edited . &quot;
&quot; on the third page ( right screens@@ hot ) , you determine the dictionary for the wor@@ ding of the chosen language . it reads the KDE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of each words . additionally , you can enter the words with an Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary . in addition , you can only describe the words with an Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary . &quot;
the main window of &amp; km@@ outh ; is clear and contains essentially an input field for the key@@ note of your sentences ( the lower white field in the screens@@ hot ) and a delay of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in the screens@@ hot ) .
&quot; if you have km@@ outh ; properly , you can enter the propositions you want to hear in the input field , which you want to hear . each mir@@ r@@ ted sentence will be attached to the transmission memory . you can select from these propositions which again to be spoken again . &quot;
&quot; with the menu entry settings km@@ outh ; set up ... open the setup dialog of &amp; km@@ outh ; this dialog includes two cardboard cards , voice @-@ output and settings , the side of vocabulary , as well as the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service . &quot;
&quot; in the input field of the cart@@ el voice edition , enter the command to call the voice @-@ generator . in the drop @-@ field below the input field , you place the string @-@ coding , with the text to the voice generator . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ outh ; knows two kinds to pass the text . select the cruci@@ fied panel , if the text is left unchanged as default to the voice generator . &quot;
&quot; if the road is not selected , the text is shared as parameter . you can use the following dimensions : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command depends on your voice generator . this command can be found in the documentation to your voice generator . examples of this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; using as a language service as a language service is used &amp; km@@ outh ; as first try to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if that is successful , the further settings on this page is also possible . the choice of this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
&quot; with the first drop @-@ down action after selecting a text message , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by choosing a text tour in the menu text connectors or in the bar for the text@@ books . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of so@@ fort , the chosen text message will speak directly and in addition to the storage area , the selected text of the text will be entered into the input field . &quot;
&quot; with the second selection panel of the editing window , you can specify , whether the text @-@ driver book can be automatically saved at the closing of the editing window . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of text matching book , the book will be saved . if you choose any changes , the text @-@ mail book will not be saved . select on request , is &amp; km@@ outh ; ask if the text @-@ use is supposed to be saved . &quot;
&quot; the vocabulary list contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the vocabulary . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; km@@ outh ; a selection field , if this list contains more than a dictionary . with this selection field , you can choose the dictionary to choose the dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons on the side you can delete dic@@ tion@@ aries or add the order of books or export them into a file . below the list , you can adjust the language in the input field and in the selection field . &quot;
&quot; select for this source the desired language ; &amp; km@@ outh ; read then the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation one . the frequency of each word is determined simply by de@@ count of the essay . in addition , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary , to include only correct words into the new dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with this option , you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; km@@ outh ; asks then which dic@@ tion@@ aries are brought together , and how to be weight@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; with this option , you place a new one , empty dictionary without entries to . da &amp; km@@ outh ; new given words automatically create into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary . &quot;
the main area of the window for the processing of text pass@@ ag@@ ers is divided . in the upper part you are depic@@ ted the text@@ books as tree structure .
&quot; in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text panel , you can change the text tour or the related key@@ note . if you have selected a text manual , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; actions such as new text pass@@ ages or books add selected text passages and books you can either delete information on the selection in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or via a fold @-@ up menu . &quot;
&quot; the order of text pass@@ ag@@ ers or text pass@@ angers can be used by drag@@ ging with the mouse to the new location or with the arrows , and the &amp; Alt ; -@@ key . &quot;
&quot; the chosen text is copied and copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field , a text section is selected , it is used to select the selected areas of dis@@ continued storage . &quot;
&quot; the chosen text is copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field is selected a text section , this is used , otherwise the selected areas of dis@@ continued storage . &quot;
&quot; the currently active phrase is spoken . if text is in the input field , this is used , otherwise the selected propositions of the flow @-@ storage . &quot;
&quot; if this menu item is crossed , a postpon@@ able material is displayed with buttons for frequently used commands . by mouse @-@ clicking on the sc@@ rolling left side and drag@@ ging the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place . &quot;
&quot; if this menu is crossed by this menu , a narrow cor@@ ste in the lower part of the main window with hints of the condition of &amp; km@@ outh ; indicated , if not crossed , this status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; if the menu item is crossed by this menu , a postpon@@ able bar for text@@ books are displayed directly under the tool@@ bar directly under the tool@@ bar . by mouse @-@ clicking on the tool@@ bar left and drag@@ ging the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place . &quot;
probably you don &apos;t have the command for the voice @-@ output not correct or not completely entered . open settings km@@ outh ; set up ... open the page General settings and enter the command for voice @-@ output on the map version . ( see creation dialog for voice syn@@ thesi@@ zers for further details . )
&quot; the Festival is a language edition of the University of Edinburgh . currently , only English , Spanish and Wal@@ is@@ cally are currently supported . the license allows to use it free of charge and dis@@ semin@@ ate it without restrictions . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of a command line for setting up the voice output , is assumed that Festival is installed in the folder / usr / local / festival . the command to voice output is then : &quot;
Free@@ T@@ TS is an integrated language generator . currently he only supports the English language . the license allows to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and dis@@ semin@@ ate without restrictions .
&quot; to show an example of a command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the folder / usr / local / fre@@ ed . the voice edition is then possible with one of the three following commands : &quot;
for the third example the option must be configured as default . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
&quot; MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it conver@@ ts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into an Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to show the text in Ph@@ on@@ eme . the license allows it to use MB@@ RO@@ LA free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications . &quot;
&quot; in our example H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text into Ph@@ on@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA , under accepting that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / mb@@ ro@@ la . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately H@@ adi@@ fax likes the final sign of the text , so that an additional character has to be added . the full command is therefore more costly than in the other examples : &quot;
( Cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / hadi@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ F _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / mb@@ ro@@ la / dev / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written into a line . the option is to be switched on as default .
the language edition @-@ D@@ äm@@ on by &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further language service that is available in the SV@@ N . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different languages .
&quot; as the attitude of the voice @-@ generator is only carried out in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use as kt@@ ts@@ d as a language service in &amp; km@@ outh . &quot;
&quot; to adjust the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service , which appears in the creation of dialog by &amp; km@@ outh ; appears if K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; km@@ outh ; successful to use , you need a voice generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; km@@ outh ; requires about 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for voice generator ) , but it depends on your computer and its configuration . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ outh ; is an application with the people who can not speak , text by the computer can be saved . it will be saved a list already sear@@ ched sentences , which the user can always rest@@ art@@ ed the user again . &quot;
note that &amp; km@@ outh ; no voice syn@@ thesizer involves . on the computer needs a voice syn@@ thesizer has to be installed .

&quot; marriage &amp; kt@@ ts ; use , you must install the Spe@@ ech Dis@@ pat@@ cher and set correctly . see also &quot;
&quot; when the first start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr or as long as no speakers are set up , the map card will be displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker , the map card will be shown . &quot;
&quot; most T@@ TS @-@ Syn@@ thesizer offer different languages and voices so also different male or female , or those that differ in volume or speed . you should also set multiple variants for a syn@@ thesizer . you should also set up multiple variants for a syn@@ thesizer . you should at least set up a speaker before you use &amp; kt@@ ts , as the program speed Dis@@ pat@@ cher can otherwise use the standard speaker . &quot;
various actors for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable to several printing expected long for the same printer .
&quot; if you click on the cart@@ el rec@@ ant speaker in kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr , the map will be displayed automatically , if you start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ s and still no spokes@@ man is set up . &quot;
all already furnished speakers will appear in this list . the preferred speaker appear on top of the list . the top speaker is used for voice @-@ output when one application is no speaker .
&quot; select a speaker click on the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list . &quot;
&quot; select a speaker click on the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below . &quot;
&quot; select a speaker click on the list , and click on this button to push the speaker in the list a line further down . the sequence of the speakers in the list are also determined their priority . &quot;
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; product system .
&quot; here you choose a voting type , there are three male and three female voices as well as a junk@@ er and girl to choose from . &quot;
&quot; click here , will appear on the new speaker at the map speaker . to change the settings of this speech , click Edit . &quot;
&quot; now you can use &amp; kt@@ on ; already almost use . go back to the map card , so that the T@@ TS service is added ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , so that the T@@ TS service is run by &amp; k@@ de ; start . now you can use the card orders to create and manage text . see . &quot;
&quot; if you have set up at least one speaker , you can launch the voice system of &amp; k@@ de ; start the cart@@ on card , to open this map card . here you can set some general options . &quot;
&quot; highlight this clo@@ ck@@ field to activate the &amp; product ; this starts the KDE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . this start is successful , the card card orders will be displayed and you can make text presentations , and you can preview text presentations and the T@@ TS @-@ system by &amp; k@@ de ; de@@ activated . &quot;
&quot; when kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is finished , run &amp; kt@@ ts ; further , provided that the field statement is activated ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; is this road marked and t@@ t@@ sm@@ s appears in pre @-@ reading automatically in the system area of the control bar , it disappears once again as soon as the pre @-@ reading is finished . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this series you can start text @-@ up , stop and resume . &quot;
with the buttons in this row you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; stop cli@@ p@@ board or to read a text file . you can also change the speaker for one job .
&quot; click or OK , then all changed settings will be taken on all pages . &quot;
the cart@@ on card orders will be displayed only when K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to boot K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the cart@@ el General and crosses some voice @-@ over@@ s ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the indicated website . check first , if &amp; kt@@ ts ; runs first , and select the text that should be read , and select in the main menu Tools text . after a short time the voice should start . &quot;
&quot; it is almost always useful to highlight the desired text of a website . you can also ski@@ p this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; -@@ pres@@ tr@@ ance and other im@@ visible brands are also read . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; Kate ; the advanced text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text you indicated below . check the text that should be read , and select in the main menu Tools text . then the voice should start . &quot;
&quot; this also works if &amp; Kate is embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; qu@@ anta . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Noti@@ fy is the tool system of &amp; k@@ de ; you can notify you of the events of this news , and you can read the text of this news also of &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; conversation ; the IR@@ C program of &amp; k@@ de ; for example you can set up different types of messages . you can set up a message when in an IR@@ C channel a message emerg@@ es , where your nickname occurs . with &amp; kt@@ ts , you can then read the IR@@ C Post@@ al text . &quot;
&quot; supports a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program K@@ Noti@@ fy , appears a menu notification in the menu settings of this program . the possible settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy differ depending on the application . &quot;
&quot; filter for the string to correct the string is a good opportunity to correct . the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which sends to delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is a good example . you removed the tags and b made / local / in@@ box , since this in most cases can be accepted as assumed . &quot;
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
&quot; in fil@@ tering , text will be edited , before he sent to the Spe@@ ech Dis@@ pat@@ cher . they are useful to select words or abbrevi@@ ations to select a suitable language and speaker , or to avoid some shortcomings of voice syn@@ thesi@@ zers and their voices . &quot;
&quot; to understand the functioning of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; &quot; Spe@@ ech Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; &quot; works with a text . &quot;
the edition of Screen S@@ ieve has the highest priority . it will be drawn to all other orders and keeps this orders . if the output of the screen reader is pre @-@ read and continued by the orders .
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor is subject to hot reserved . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will be continued after the issue of warning .
&quot; messages have the nearest priority . a message inter@@ rup@@ ts normal text . &amp; km@@ outh ; is an example for an application , the messages used . while you have a long text on a website you can greet you with &amp; km@@ outh ; someone welcome the room just bet@@ ray . &amp; App@@ lic@@ tions are also news . read about this . &quot;
&quot; the rest are simple text@@ orders . each order you encounter from the cart@@ el orders , is an example of a applications that are text@@ orders . text messages are intended for the output of longer texts , which have no special ur@@ gency . &quot;
&quot; all four orders are processed in queue , except for the issue of Screen Re@@ a@@ dern . if an application sends the output of a screen @-@ reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one such reads , this edition will be raised and ended . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to know that filter is never applied to the output of screen titles . you will be applied to normal war@@ nings , messages and text messages as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News . &quot;
filter process the text and pass it on to the next filter . at the moment there are three types of filters .
filters are carried out as modules . in the future it can still be further types of filters .
string adjustable parts of a text by other text . the plac@@ eable parts can indicate you either as words or as regular expres@@ sions , which enable the issu@@ ance of chat em@@ ot@@ icons such as : - ) by text or for the form@@ atting messages , or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better comprehen@@ sible form . &quot;
&amp; XML ; -@@ trans@@ former use a X@@ SLT @-@ file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format to another format ; are some X@@ SLT files to translation by &amp; XHTML ; in SS@@ ML .
&quot; with speaker connectors , you can depend on the contents of the text or depending on the program , send the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent to a speaker , you can read text by KDE news about how to read about it . &quot;
&quot; each of these different filters has adjustable rules , after which he is applied to a language output . if the filter does not meet , he returns the text unchanged at the next filter . &quot;
&quot; if a text message , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; sent out to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent it by all activated filters , which are set up on the page below . the processing is done in sequence in the list from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; this shows the list of the furnished normal filters . if a filter is not crossed , it is not enabled and it is not used . filters are processed down from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; click here to add a new filter . select the type of fil@@ tering , and it will be shown below the following tri@@ di@@ alogs . &quot;
&quot; for the establishment of character belts fil@@ tering , you need to enter a list of words or regular expres@@ sions as a comparison pattern . these patterns are used in text , then the text is exchanged for the corresponding spare text . big and small @-@ prescription is not observed when compared . &quot;
&quot; give your filter a name for your filter . you can choose any type of name , it must only distinguish himself from the name of the other filters . &quot;
&quot; this is the list of words and regular expres@@ sions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column according to the string , and replaced it in accordance with the string . the list is shown in the sequence from top to bottom . &quot;
click here to move the marked word or the regular expression in the list .
&quot; using these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular excer@@ pts from a file to delete the current list or delete a list from a file , the entries from the file will be attached to the existing list . &quot;
&quot; here is a language registered , the filter is only applied if the speaker for the text is shown here . click on the button to display a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you click on the mouse click the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l ; button pressed . &quot;
&quot; here is a value entered , the filter is only applied if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separated by com@@ mat@@ a . example : conversation , k@@ mail &quot;
the application ID @-@ running programs get you with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; D@@ bus ; -@@ Num@@ bers must leave you away . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the App@@ liance ID Cop@@ y @-@ 34@@ 32 indicates , you can only copy . &quot;
&quot; the drawing menu filter is applied only in the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box di@@ ciary filter when match . are all input fields , the filter is applied to all texts . &quot;
&quot; in comparison of words , the character of the string into the form \ \ s word \ \ . the words must therefore be limited by parti@@ tions ( blank characters ) . &quot;
&quot; in this hand@@ book , you will find no instructions for writing regular expres@@ sions . if you have installed the &amp; D ; -@@ editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; expres@@ sions in the package of deu@@ ti@@ ls . &quot;

&quot; enter the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c can be reached via the environmental variable P@@ AT@@ H range , also x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . &quot;
&quot; with the talk op@@ tionally filter you can send texts to a specific speaker , which is set up on the cart@@ el speaker , or to a speaker with certain properties . you can for example specify that texts should be read by k@@ mail from a female voice . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; kt@@ ts , there is a text to the filters , there is a speaker for the text . the spokes@@ person will be selected based on the speaker properties , which the program is selected , send the text to &amp; kt@@ ts , send the text to the card speakers . with the speaker editor , you can send the chosen speaker . &quot;
&quot; here is a value entered , the filter is applied , if the text includes the given regular expression . is installed on your system of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; expres@@ sions , you can call this with a click on the button to get help with the input . &quot;
&quot; to achieve a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , begin the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; here the properties of the requested Spe@@ akers are fixed . if the text comp@@ lies the above filter conditions , the speaker is selected , which corresponds to the desired requirements , click on the button on the right to display the dialog box . &quot;
use these buttons to store or load your consultation settings or delete all settings .
the spokes@@ person filter is applied only to the text if any conditions apply with an entry in the box of Di@@ esen Filter if you encounter . you have to enter at least one condition .
&quot; the language edition API , by &amp; k@@ de ; with the programmer can give their applications T@@ TS abilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD on &amp; D@@ bus ; &quot;
&quot; the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the voice syn@@ thesizer to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so that the syn@@ thesizer can use ; this syn@@ thesizer can use . &quot;
the following section contains a brief description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ bus ; interface of the Language @-@ edition API by &amp; k@@ de ; the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is is available on the look@@ out ; Acces@@ sibility website ( http : / / acc@@ essi@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications demand language services via the &amp; D@@ bus ; -@@ interface from &amp; k@@ de ; from the program kt@@ ts@@ d via the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
&quot; here , text of text to read and option is a language code as &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ; &quot;
there are even more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands
&quot; open two &amp; kon@@ sole ; -@@ windows . start the kt@@ ts@@ d in a window , then kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr in the other . &quot;
none of the mentioned language syn@@ thesizer supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
&quot; I have set the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ Um@@ form@@ er@@ filter , but when using the module for festival websites are not read . &quot;
&quot; due to a bug in the 1.@@ 95 beta , you will need to install the ( male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone so that you don &apos;t have to use it even if you do not use this voice to read on websites . please make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c installed and about the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . &quot;
&quot; certain characters or interference plates seem to cause errors in syn@@ thesizer , so all propositions is over@@ spr@@ inkl@@ es or only co@@ der@@ worlds . what can I do against it ? &quot;
&quot; first , make sure that the option string is adjusted to the correct value for the appropriate language . there are problems with certain characters or words , these may be fixed by a string adjustable filter . &quot;

KT@@ TS works with every voice syn@@ thesizer which can be started on the command line in a &amp; kon@@ sole .
the list of the above languages can be incomplete or out@@ dated . therefore take the description of the syn@@ thesizer to the supported languages . look at the website of kt@@ ts ; if you are not included in this manual .
the program &quot; Spe@@ ech Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; uses a customiz@@ able module for voice syn@@ thesizer . if you want to expand &amp; kt@@ ts ; for the use of another syn@@ thesi@@ zers , contact the developer team . &quot;
the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; it is not mandatory . de@@ bian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
&quot; to compile and compile , you need a current development environment of KDE ( Version 3.4 or higher ) including the packages k@@ deli@@ bs and the dra@@ inage files for the program &quot; &quot; Spe@@ ech Dis@@ pat@@ cher . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you have downloaded the source tex@@ tual by &amp; kt@@ ts , from the source text archive for k@@ de@@ ar@@ cs , or downloaded the each night up to date , and install the program with the following commands : &quot;
before you &amp; kt@@ ts ; use first to check whether Spe@@ ech Dis@@ pat@@ cher works properly with your voice syn@@ thesizer correctly . you can use the Shell@@ script SPD @-@ conf .
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts , used the program Spe@@ ech dis@@ pat@@ cher . the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr should be so further developed , that the establishment of Spe@@ ech dis@@ pat@@ cher is not possible and the script SPD @-@ conf is no longer needed . &quot;
&quot; a long text is broken into individual phrases . the user can either be trac@@ ted , repeat , repeat the output or break down . &quot;
&quot; if an application text on &amp; kt@@ ts ; passes , it can indicate the properties of the preferred Spe@@ aker for the issue . if you have a speaker , it is automatically chosen the most suitable speaker . if you want to know more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; one speaker sel@@ ects , see in . &quot;
&quot; click on the map speaker at the map , and then click on the box to insert a speaker in the list or click Edit , the map of the module is shown for Festival Interactive . details on the modules can be found here . &quot;
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to the Festival is included in P@@ AT@@ H you just need to enter a festival .
&quot; select the drawing code for text which is handed over to Festival . in voices , the &amp; kt@@ ts ; generally , this option is automatically made . general is that Western languages ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 use , eastern languages like Czech or Slov@@ ak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; with these sli@@ ders you provide volume , speaking speed and pitch @-@ height of synthetic language . if you are not able to select some rainy and this gray will not be displayed by you the voice you choose . &quot;
&quot; some voices , such as Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices need to be loaded on account of their size several seconds . if you loaded this anus , these voices are already loaded in the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so that ( for larger storage power ) the first set is faster syn@@ thesi@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; if this accus@@ ation cannot be selected , you have not yet set up a speaker ( or do not forget to apply ) . &quot;
&quot; this road marked is marked , is shown at the start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr the program window t@@ sm@@ gr . otherwise , after starting only the symbol of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; is this road marked and t@@ t@@ sm@@ s does not work yet , it appears in the system area , as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . this means you have the possibility to keep reading or to control it . &quot;
&quot; here all orders are listed in queue , along with the application that has set the order to the current status of the order , the number of propositions and the straight set . the spokes@@ ID corresponds to the column ID on the map speaker . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this row you can be selected by the order , which is selected in the list below , pre@@ - or return . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) . &quot;
&quot; with a click on OK , all changes of settings ( also on the other cardboard cards ) and t@@ t@@ sm@@ gr will be applied to the icon in the system section . then click on this symbol to display the program window again . &quot;

&quot; if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de can be used for the audio output , select the audio output . if no @-@ smo@@ ker will be displayed in the list , you need to install at least one module . have AL@@ SA selected , select the PC@@ M device here . &quot;
&quot; put the talk speed here . 50@@ nbsp ; % equivalent to approximately half and 200@@ nbsp ; % roughly the double normal talk speed . so these settings can be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed . &quot;
click to apply to the new settings for the current &amp; product system .
&quot; the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you have to find yourself out which device will work with you . in doubt , select Standard . &quot;
&quot; on this map card you can set out special actions that will always be executed , if the text is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &quot;
the edition of Screen S@@ ieve has the highest priority . it will be drawn to all other orders and maintains this orders . after the issue of screen readers have been read .
war@@ nings have priority the night@@ ly priority . this level is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will continue after the warning of the warning again .
&quot; News , the next priority . a message breaks normal text . &amp; km@@ outh ; is an example of an application that speaks messages . if you have a long text on a site , you can greet you with &amp; km@@ outh ; nevertheless someone can greet you just the room . &quot;
&quot; if a text is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen @-@ reader , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio @-@ release into the queue . &quot;
&quot; this audio file will always be interrupted , when a normal text is interrupted . if both single sound sound and introductory sound is active , the introductory sound is played before the introductory message . &quot;
&quot; the settings on this map card apply only for normal text entries . for messages , war@@ nings and the issues of screen @-@ response there are no particular actions when this is interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &quot;

&quot; is this setting marked , noti@@ fications when a sound is played , by &amp; kt@@ ts ; not pre@@ read . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to add events to the list or to delete it . if you want to add a dialog , where you can choose the application and event that you want to add to the list . &quot;
&quot; this event reads the message before , the &amp; conversation ; sent , if any one mentioned in an IR@@ C message of your nickname . &quot;
&quot; all events , for which in the list nothing else is specified , will be ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; use this drop @-@ field to set up , what to do , when an event hits . you have the following options : &quot;

&quot; Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is an W@@ 3C standard to mark text for a language issue . this standard contains brands for controlling voices , the speech speed , the volume , the sex and the pitch . moreover , SS@@ ML is a part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , a further W@@ 3C standard . &quot;
currently supports &amp; kt@@ on ; SS@@ ML only partly and only in the basic functions . the following restrictions are present :
&quot; you must install the Rab _ di@@ phone voice ( bri@@ tish male ) , because this is the default voice that is used in the output of SS@@ ML . &quot;
&quot; if the settings for speed or key location in the festival configuration is not on 100@@ nbsp ; % is set , SS@@ ML Text is usually very mon@@ ot@@ on . &quot;
&lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; &lt; ?

&quot; there are two types of filters - normal filters and pro@@ posi@@ tional filters . SB@@ Ds sub@@ divide the text in single sentences , because only the first set of syn@@ thesi@@ zed if only the first set of syn@@ thesi@@ zed if only the first set is syn@@ thesi@@ zed if only the first set is syn@@ thesi@@ zed if only the first set is syn@@ thesi@@ zed or stopped and ab@@ ort , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer do not directly support . &quot;
&quot; here you can see the pro@@ posi@@ tional limit@@ less filter . during the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts , it is automatically set up as a demonstration limit@@ less recognizable filter . you can change its settings or add more pro@@ posi@@ tional limit@@ less filters , but will gladly take it away from it . &quot;
&quot; in the simpl@@ est way , you learn the setup of the speaker selection through excer@@ pts . check the speech selection , then change some properties and check how the selection of the talk is altered . of course , you must have set up some more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective . &quot;
&quot; even faster with the pre @-@ reading can begin , since only the first sentence has to be processed and not the whole text , which can last very long , &quot;
&quot; you will then follow the orders on the map of the map , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer does not support this function . &quot;
&quot; for these reasons the normal pro@@ posi@@ tional bound@@ less recognizable filter is automatically set up , if you start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ s for the first time . it cannot be switched off , just removed . change anything about this filter , unless you know what you are doing . &quot;
&quot; pro@@ posi@@ tional limit@@ less filters , text with a regular expression for pro@@ posi@@ tional and add a tab@@ ular signs ( dec@@ im@@ al@@ code 8 ) on the fil@@ tering limits ( dec@@ im@@ al code ) , in front of the fil@@ tering is automatically removed from the text ) . note that the default @-@ pro@@ posi@@ tional limit@@ less rot@@ ational filter are attached . &quot;
&quot; s@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News ( none ) , war@@ nings , messages or the output of screen @-@ reaction . &quot;
&quot; if you are removed from Ver@@ see the normal pro@@ posi@@ tional limit@@ less filters , you can insert this again by clicking it in &amp; kt@@ ts ; p@@ alt@@ ed file standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c . &quot;
on the map @-@ card details you can write the talk settings for the application . the map card will be displayed when
use of the default speaker ( the top on the map speaker ) . in other words : there are no inter@@ viewer properties .
&quot; use of the most appropriate spokes@@ person , who has all the properties of a furnished speaker . if you do not delete or edit the settings of the speaker , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; this speaker is made ; otherwise , the speaker is made , the most sought @-@ made properties . &quot;
&quot; select the method for entering the desired specification , by clicking on one of the selection buttons . &quot;
&quot; select the properties of the desired speaker . if this property does not play a role , you don &apos;t give anything . &quot;
&quot; highlight this junction , if the property should prevail over other properties . you can also use several mark@@ ings here . &quot;
&quot; as the language is a critical factor when the issue is , this is always treated as a priority feature . you will rarely use this feature , if you possibly want the attribute , if you know that a certain application text is sent in another language than that in the working environment . &quot;
&quot; to use all properties in the field of speakers , the following is following to delete , click on the sel@@ kno@@ b standard speaker , and then use the speakers that corresponds to the following . &quot;
in this case 0 for the last text order in queue . you can also indicate a order number . ( without order number is input 0 required ) .
&quot; kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr rus@@ hed immediately when it is started . I have de@@ bug support , but I do not get back tracking . &quot;
&quot; g@@ stre@@ amer is de@@ duc@@ ted and &amp; kt@@ ts ; probably , the command G@@ ST @-@ register 0.@@ 8.@@ x is the command G@@ ST @-@ register 0.8 . if the problem is not solved by G@@ ST @-@ register . you can try to update g@@ inger@@ amer or un@@ install . &quot;
&quot; the audio version about AL@@ SA does not work , when I keep playing music simultaneously with another application music . if I stop a text message , free@@ zes &amp; kt@@ ts ; a message appears that says : a to open PC@@ M . &quot;
&quot; on your system , the problem is that conflicts at AL@@ SA occurs , which prevent the simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . notes for possible solutions can be found on the website of the AL@@ SA @-@ Project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ project@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; I have downloaded an additional voice for the festival on the internet . I have installed it and can use them in the festival , but kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr does not show this voice . &quot;
&quot; add in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / festival@@ int / pass@@ able to serve the other entries . if this is successful , please send a patch together with the &amp; URL ; you have found the voice to the developer . &quot;
&quot; on the map card audio there is a adjustment speed . so this works , the program must be installed so@@ x and be stri@@ pped over the environmental variable P@@ AT@@ H . some syn@@ thesi@@ zer@@ mod@@ ul@@ s such as Festival Interactive offer even on the map card for speaking . depending on the chosen voice is this active or in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; the settings for the intercom speed will be ignored , when &amp; kt@@ ts ; P@@ ML has its own tags , with which the speed is controlled . ) De@@ activate either the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; after &amp; XML ; ( see ) or if you are quite brave , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ to @-@ SS@@ ML ren@@ ch @-@ filters , and set the talk speed . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t make sure that websites be read with a female voice . I have established a female festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the websites with a male voice . &quot;
&quot; at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the day SA@@ B@@ LE GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . so this festival does not produce any errors , the X@@ SL file to converting SS@@ ML to S@@ aber the GEN@@ DER @-@ tags . the same applies to VO@@ ICE tags . &quot;
&quot; I have added a string adjustable filter filter and now I can move in &amp; kt@@ ts ; not more pre@@ matur@@ ely , or go back . on the cart@@ el orders will be displayed , the order not only from one sentence . what am I doing wrong ? &quot;
&quot; point signs ( point , question characters , dis@@ inf@@ ect , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) you are not allowed to filter . use it for these signs instead a filter for the pro@@ posi@@ tional detection . &quot;
AL@@ SA ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; Sound Architecture ) . AL@@ SA is already installed on most systems with &amp; Linux ; ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ project@@ .org )
&quot; G@@ stre@@ amer in version 0.@@ 8.7 or newer . note : you are sure that the modules for G@@ Stre@@ amer are registered by using G@@ stre@@ amer in &amp; kt@@ ts ; the command G@@ ST @-@ register . ( http : / / g@@ stream@@ er.@@ fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org )
&quot; some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA conflicts at the audio issue . if your system also counts , you can do not simultaneously play music and add a text . &amp; kt@@ ts , moreover , if you find a text order and then start another . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) . &quot;
&quot; with Stand July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de does not support real breaks . if you keep a text in &amp; kt@@ ts , the current sentence is still pre @-@ read . &quot;
&quot; the audio @-@ program so@@ x is used for general adjustment of the intercom speed , but is otherwise not mandatory . de@@ bian users can install so@@ x with the command apt @-@ get install so@@ x . the program is already included on most &amp; Linux ; -@@ CDs already included . &quot;
&quot; have you downloaded &amp; kt@@ ts ; as tar@@ ball ( with t@@ ar ge@@ pack@@ aged archive ) , sign up as normal users and un@@ pack the tar@@ ball into a suitable folder . change this folder and enter the following commands : &quot;
in &amp; k@@ de ; 4 will be removed the module &amp; arts ; probably removed or at least only on request .
the following modules for voice syn@@ thesi@@ zers are created by default . some of them possess a career dependen@@ cy of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free according to the guidelines of the Deb@@ ian distribution ) . the column configure @-@ option shows the configure parameters to which over@@ head the yield .
&quot; as an default setting , in / opt / K@@ DE@@ 3 installed , this folder is not listed in the environmental variable $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS , you have to specify as an option --@@ pre@@ fix = Target . for example

before you &amp; kt@@ ts ; use first to check if your voice syn@@ thesizer works properly . follow the instructions that you have received with the syn@@ thesizer .
&quot; Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thesizer , whose source code is obvious . the quality of the voices is generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported . with many voices , you can set out volume , speech speed and pitch . &quot;
&quot; you must install at least one language . help to find in the instructions that can be supplied with festival . would you like to read websites , you have to install the ( Male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone . &quot;
&quot; for these voices , you must compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on the transfer . &quot;
&quot; this voice continues Festival 1,@@ 95 in or later . the voice is still in an early development stage . un@@ pack the software in festival / lib / r / Russian / . if you set up the Russian voices , you need to enter the votes for ms@@ u _ ru _ v@@ sh _ di@@ phone ( 8 @-@ Bit@@ - ) coding as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
&quot; the festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux , distri@@ butions available as first on the CDs of your distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the option must be adjusted to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 option . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the option must be adjusted to a 8 @-@ bit Ky@@ ri@@ lli@@ c such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
Festival can be used together with the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; syn@@ thesizer can be used together with the l@@ ex@@ ical analysis and &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; it takes the audio issue . the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; program and the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; not complete language output system is . &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; generates language from Di@@ ph@@ on files . you need additional software to create this di@@ phone .

&quot; in this procedure additional W@@ rap@@ per @-@ Code is added to the festival , to use &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ voices to use language synthesis . note that the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ voice files will not be installed in &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ folder , but in the folder @-@ festival / lib / . instructions can be found under &quot;
&quot; IM@@ S German Festival is a changing version of Festival for German &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ voices . required is either Festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first , you install Festival and &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la , then invite MS German festival &quot;
you will find instructions in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file in the file RE@@ AD@@ ME in the package that you have downloaded . ( for use with Festival 2.0 is not required ) you just need to translate the festival in the file festival / lib / sit@@ ein@@ it@@ .@@ s@@ cm .

&quot; Festival Lite is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ed voice syn@@ thesizer , who is currently supported only a limited number of voices and languages . it is a simple voice syn@@ thesizer with yet out of voice quality . with &amp; kt@@ ts , you can set up with this voice syn@@ thesizer neither pitch , volume nor user speed . &quot;
Fl@@ ite is usually included in the &amp; Linux ; distribution distri@@ butions available as first on the CDs of your distribution .
&quot; H@@ adi@@ fix is a two @-@ stage voice syn@@ thesizer , which works with di@@ ph@@ ons . the program t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o translated text in Di@@ phone and the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; language syn@@ thesizer is created from the sound . the language quality is good , but the support is currently limited to few languages . you can set voice , pitch , speech speed , and volume . &quot;
download at least a German language file from the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ page and un@@ zip them with un@@ zip in the folder / usr / local / mb@@ ro@@ la .
&quot; copy either t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ or@@ c to ~ / .t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ or@@ c or to / etc / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o , here the r@@ c must be removed at the end of the fil@@ enam@@ el . &quot;
on the map @-@ card equipment you choose one voice and put the paths to &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; and t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o right .
epo@@ s is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener syn@@ thesizer for the Czech and Slov@@ ak language . it is a simple voice syn@@ thesizer with yet out of the stimul@@ ant quality . with &amp; kt@@ ts , you can only adjust the volume with this voice syn@@ thesizer . &quot;
launch kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr . on the cart@@ els speakers click on the map . select the path to the programs on the map speaker . enter additional parameters for the programs . enter a &amp; Con@@ sole ; epo@@ s -@@ h or say -@@ h to get more information .
&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ed voice syn@@ thesizer , which was written in &amp; Java ; i.e. you need to install the &amp; Java ; Virtual Machine on your system . with &amp; Java ; can neither adjust pitch @-@ height , volume nor intercom speed . &quot;
the command smo@@ ked allows you to use &amp; kt@@ ts ; with any lingu@@ syn@@ thesizer that can be controlled at a &amp; kon@@ sole ; on the command line .
&quot; best use a command , which writes the voice @-@ output into a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) , instead of sending the output directly to the audi@@ ovis@@ er@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; this hand@@ book explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; that allows the management of network interfaces , rout@@ ing and DNS settings . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a range of system and desktop settings on a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way , as other settings from the &amp; k@@ ward work@@ station , create a simple interface for the following tasks : &quot;
after installation will display a new module network settings in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; it can be launched by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; network settings in &amp; k@@ menu .
&quot; it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware can not install . physical devices and their drivers have to be installed and configured , so that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all shows and adjust the adjustment of network properties . &quot;
&quot; in most cases drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed in installing &amp; Linux ; with installed and installed . network devices later added , the drivers have to be loaded through modification of the following files , according to the core version . &quot;
&quot; the network settings will be loaded , if the option is selected settings in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index is chosen . when using the module network settings , it is trying to detect the platform on the system automatically . &quot;
&quot; if the platform can not be recognized , the suspension is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which the distribution and release date is best suited . through Mark@@ ting the setting non @-@ recur@@ ring issues , the definition can be hit permanent . when you start the network settings then this selection will be automatically set . &quot;
&quot; changing the network settings is possible only in the system administration mode . previously , all options are displayed gray , which means the settings can only be considered , the changing mode is not possible . in the system administration mode at the right bottom of the module . it is necessary to enter the password . &quot;
in the system administration mode the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three rider :
&quot; the rider network interfaces serves to manage network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . from the tab network interfaces , the following tasks can be performed : &quot;
the configuration settings can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and click the button set up ... in the dialog device .
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click &quot; Advanced Settings &quot; &quot; shows the dialogue with further possibilities . &quot;
&quot; using the selection of Autom@@ atic , the TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched from a DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in the automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings is required at the same time with the start of the system services . the DH@@ CP@@ - or BO@@ O@@ TP server will be required in the selection list either DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , according to the system , selected . &quot;
with the selection Manu@@ ell can be made without DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP the TCP / IP configuration . in the input field IP address the required TCP / IP address is to set the sub@@ nets .
&quot; if this setting is marked , initi@@ ates the system the network interfaces at boats . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated . &quot;
the values given in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the tool@@ box .
&quot; it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . the input of an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; kon@@ sole , you may determine if the desired address is already in use . in doubt the network administrator should be asked . &quot;
network devices can be activated or activated depending on the required network . switching an installed network device from the list and click of the interface .
network devices can be activated or activated depending on your needs . you can turn off on an activation network from the list and click of the interface .
&quot; establishes the IP @-@ address of b@@ illing in the local sub@@ net , which provides the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with calcul@@ ators in other sub @-@ network . &quot;
&quot; if the computer is present more than one network interface , the interface must be selected to the net in which the gateway computer is selected . &quot;
a machine with DNS support replaces a complete domain name through the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only address IP addresses . if the computer is only IP address : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org does not resolve this name into an IP address such as 12@@ 3.4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the machine to the nam@@ ing solution part of the fix@@ ture solution enables simple administration of this list . entries can be added to removed or modified wer@@ .@@ DNS items can be arranged through selection of a entries or notification in the list with the buttons up or herr@@ ings in the priority .
by clicking the button of button ... from the group of machine to nam@@ ing a DNS server can be added to a DNS server . it will add the dialogue of New Nam@@ es@@ er@@ ver .
&quot; first , you must enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the button Add . the entry will be added in the list . &quot;
&quot; from the group of calcul@@ ators , select an entry and then click on the button Edit .... It will be the dialog box . &quot;
the list specifically known computers describes calcul@@ ator @-@ to @-@ IP address for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily at boats if no DNS server is available . in small , closed networks it can replace DNS server . &quot;
normally the list specifically contains known computers some entries that support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses support . this is still being replaced in the test being posted in the future version 4 .
enter the IP @-@ address of the well @-@ known calcul@@ ator and click Add to add ... The dialogue of New Ali@@ as is displayed .
&quot; to enter the name of known b@@ illing and click the button Add . if the well @-@ known machine has multiple ali@@ ases , drag the other alias several times and enter the other alias names . &quot;
select an entry of a specifically familiar machine from the list and choose editing .... The dialog to edit the familiar machine is displayed .
&quot; it may be one of the following tasks to be executed , then clicking on the list of the static Ho@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; the settings made in the module settings are not immediately available in the system . to enable the changes , must be set in a &amp; con@@ sole ; the following command must be set . &quot;
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is http : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ forge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source text .
&quot; for installing the binary distri@@ butions ( mostly rpm @-@ packages ) is enough , if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t installed . &quot;
the installation of the finished compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and in one &amp; kon@@ sole ; with rpm as follows :
&quot; alternatively , a tool can be used with graf@@ ic surface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of their distribution . &quot;
&quot; for this case , installing Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; not , but in addition the development package is required with libraries and other things . &quot;
&quot; this is recommended only experienced users . however , it is not difficult , &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; to compile the following commands should do this . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology will be given , in the second , all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; updated configur@@ ations . &quot;
this section allows you to replace more knowledge about IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x only basic information on the inclusion of the PC in a small ( hom@@ e- ) network is convey@@ ed .
&quot; currently , IP @-@ networks with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) is operated . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found big spread . from IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to focus on the widespread IP@@ v@@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; one of the most important information is to assign the IP @-@ address of a network interfaces . in foreign networks , am &amp; eg ; Work@@ place is the contact person , which is a valid IP address , or if available , DH@@ CP may not be chosen arbitr@@ arily , the IP address can not simply be chosen arbitr@@ arily ! &quot;
&quot; when setting up a separate small ( home ) network , the IP address should be chosen for this purpose , to avoid IP address conf@@ lic@@ ted with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not for@@ warded in the Internet , therefore its any use is possible . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the Internet can be made possible for such machines by setting a gat@@ ew@@ ays . &quot;
for smaller networks are usually used in the range of 192.@@ 168.@@ 1.1 to 192.@@ 168.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the area is big enough for networks to 250 hosts .
&quot; in addition , the network mask is usually set at 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all computers are included in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.@@ 0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the above @-@ to @-@ back @-@ address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own computer ) . the standard route is required for IP transmission . &quot;
the network address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine . usually the address is assigned 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 of an own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface that works like a closed circle .
&quot; in this section , the configuration files are stored by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf , and where they are stored in the different distri@@ butions . &quot;
&quot; this file will sometimes change dynam@@ ically with DSL connections , so that it is not surprising if in case of active DSL connections to be found there . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; Su@@ SE , is known that this file will be sorted by the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another stand than expected can therefore occur . &quot;

&quot; &amp; b ; is a backup program for band@@ power plants on the basis of t@@ ar . it offers the possibility to create several archives on a tape , the development of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ t@@ ar led to fast , sel@@ ective exhaust . the second goal was to answer a question that my wife asked : how much longer it takes , if you saved ? &quot;
&quot; before a tape can be used , it must be integrated by &amp; b ; it can be done on three ways : &quot;
&quot; &amp; b ; sp@@ ult the band back and reads the pre @-@ voltage information of the belt . det@@ ects &amp; b ; the for@@ giving of the band not , you will be asked if the band is form@@ att@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; det@@ ects &amp; b ; the for@@ er@@ aman , searches for the right index on your record . can this not be found , you will be asked if the band@@ index is to be created . &quot;
&quot; everything has gone smoothly , the symbol changes that the band is integrated . in the status bar appears a corresponding message . the content of the belt can now be sear@@ ched by selecting the entry for the band . &quot;
&quot; before throwing the belt , first the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to achieve this . &quot;
&quot; &amp; b ; indicates a change in the symbol for the band , that the integration was solved for the band and indicates a corresponding message in the status bar . the band can now be rejected without any danger . &quot;
&quot; before a tape can be used , it must be dated &amp; k@@ dated ; form@@ att@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; a band @-@ types must form@@ att@@ ed before you can be used to save data . this process does not have to be used before using any form . this process does not need to be done before using the tape , before you can form@@ att@@ ed from the band of &amp; b . float band@@ ages usually do not use a form@@ atting of the belt @-@ advance , DAT drives , on the other hand . &quot;
&quot; after entering the band@@ name and the capacity drives &amp; k@@ dated ; with the form@@ atting of the gang . all data on the tape lost it ! after completion of the form@@ atting , the band is automatically integrated and can be used . &quot;
&quot; before you encounter the backup process , you have to select the sight@@ ed files . this can be done in three ways : &quot;
select a file or a folder in the local file tree . it is only saved to this file or folder .
&quot; select a backup profile in the tree , only the files stated in the profile . &quot;
highlight files in the local file tree with a tick . only the so marked files and / or sub @-@ folder are secured .
right click on the local file tree and select in the menu ...
&quot; once the backup is introduced , the dialog will open for backup . in this dialogue , you can once again check the selected files and change the settings for the backup . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings , the dialog will be secure . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time . &quot;
mark a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it will be checked only the selected file or folder .
highlight the files in one of the archives in the entry for the band with a tick . only the marked files and / or sub @-@ folder are examined .
&quot; click with the right mouse button in one of the archives , and select the menu item for the menu . &quot;
&quot; once the test process was started , the dialog settings for verification . in this dialog you can check your selection and change the folder for verification . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for the review , the dialog will determine the progress of the examination process as well as the data through@@ put and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; before you can lead the re @-@ making , the files that should be recovered , this can be highlighted in two ways : &quot;
&quot; select a file or folder in one of the archives , which include an entry for the belt work . it is restored only the selected file or the sub@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; select the files from one of the archives , with a tick . it is only restored the files and / or sub@@ folder . &quot;
right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select in the menu re@@ producing ...
&quot; once the resum@@ ing process was launched , the dialog will appear for restoration . in this dialog you can also check your selection and change the folder for restoration . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for recovery , the dialog will be re @-@ establish . this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data through@@ put and the remaining time . &quot;
sometimes it proves to be necessary to create the Band@@ inde@@ file based on the band &apos;s content . this process delet@@ es all existing index files for this band . you can re@@ create the index on two types of tape :
&quot; this is a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can make use of the following settings : &quot;
&quot; the current working folder , in which the backup should be made . the list of sight@@ se@@ ated files will be automatically updated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; for all the folder , which are listed under backup files are stored in the same file system , such as the folder . folder , which are stored on other file systems , you can separate separately under backup files . each entry is considered by t@@ ar regardless of the others . &quot;
&quot; perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files are changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snap@@ shot file will be saved , which have since changed since then . &quot;
the name of the file that is used for determining the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
delet@@ es the snap@@ shot file from the call of t@@ ar . this causes all files to be secured and a new snap@@ shot file for the next backup is laid out .
the functionality of buttons files are gt ; and lt ; files was not yet fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
&quot; the settings can set you up using the menu item of KD@@ at ... in the menu settings , you can make the following settings : &quot;
the full path to the device works ( usually / dev / T@@ ape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ recur@@ ring variant of the band .
&quot; if this setting is active , transmitted &amp; b ; before the tape is involved , the command will load up to the drive . at some drives , this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed . &quot;
&quot; is the option to be switched , tried &amp; b ; the end to lock on tape &apos;s suspension . possibly this attitude does not work with all band@@ power plants . &quot;
&quot; if the option is switched on , when solving the integration of &amp; b ; automatically the band is dis@@ car@@ ded . use this option not with Flo@@ ppy @-@ Stream@@ s . &quot;
&quot; if the option is switched , tried &amp; b ; the hard@@ war@@ es@@ ei@@ ving block size for the belt work . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you need to be &amp; b ; in any case the block size for your band &apos;s power plant . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; b ; a band form@@ att@@ ed , it writes a file at the beginning of the belt . this file should only reflect a block on the tape . the content of the file is composed as follows : &quot;
&quot; ( N Byte ) The band @-@ ID . the format of this character is to name : seconds , where b@@ illing name of the complete name of the system is made on which the tape has been form@@ att@@ ed . seconds the number of seconds has passed since the time in which the band has been form@@ att@@ ed . &quot;
the band @-@ ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ soldier / .
&quot; the remaining files in the band are pure t@@ ar -@@ Archive , who manage themselves directly with &amp; GNU ; - t@@ ar manage . even other t@@ ar versions should work , as long as it is not about incre@@ mental sight@@ ings . &quot;
check the contents of a backup ban@@ ker . this symbol is only active when a band is involved .
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ vie@@ wers for system protocols . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users , where you can obtain information about your system or where the system uses the different protocol files . in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users access the quick access for example on information about problems that will occur on their server . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what your computer makes it in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; it is a simplified user interface that does not know where you can receive information about your system or where the system uses the different protocol files .
&quot; in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users access quick access for example on information about problems that may arise on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore , some advanced functions tries to be fil@@ tered and evaluated with their help the protocol @-@ files of certain programs . &quot;
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 possesses &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful features . these include :
support for many different types of protocol @-@ files for the format of the sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba .
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
&quot; as you see in the following screens@@ hot , provides &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions available with their help the single protocol @-@ lines of a protocol file easily fil@@ tering and sort . the individual possibilities for sor@@ ting and fil@@ tering are shown in the next chapter of this manual . &quot;
&quot; after the start tried &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first , the main protocol @-@ file of the system - the system protocol will be opened , so you have not yet opened using system managers . the protocol files can be found under Linux usually in the folder / var / log , for the normal user usually have no permission to read . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filter bar , in order to filter by a selected criteria . the list of the log lines will now be displayed automatically , so that only a log lines will be displayed in addition to the filter option . then , a protocol will only appear if in one of the columns the string of the filter concept is included . &quot;
&quot; you can also select another entry . the string of the filter concept will then only select with the entries in accordance with selected column . select the column process , which shows you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all the protocol @-@ lines sent to which this process is sent or created . &quot;
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to detect the important protocol lines . protocol @-@ lines of level error will be displayed with a con@@ spic@@ uous color as a protocol @-@ line of level reference . the colored representation of protocol @-@ lines can be switched from the dialog box .
&quot; if you want to show only certain process ( e.g. in the system protocol or in cr@@ on protocol ) , so you can select the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process . this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a certain command such as the start of the sam@@ ba server . in this case you use filter bar . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can jump the option to new lines in the context menu of the main window to display all new record lines . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows the display of multiple protocol files in se@@ perate sub@@ windows . to use this function , use the entries in the menu window to open up additional sub @-@ windows , select in the menu a protocol on display . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website at http : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softw@@ ar@@ e.@@ org. You can find more information on the sources of sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; find also in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; Subversion archive : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ archive
&quot; welcome to the &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also as named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section runs a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . &quot;
&quot; the system V In@@ it quickly develops into the standard for the control of the program starting up the system in the &amp; Linux ; and therefore , because it is easier to use , powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD -@@ In@@ it . &quot;
I will not go further on historical aspects ( e.g. because I know nothing about it : - ) .
&quot; the In@@ it Bin@@ ding file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because maybe someone could try to make a machine on System V In@@ it , without a re@@ installation and re @-@ format . therefore , you must make sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was one . &quot;
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files in a sub@@ folder of / etc are instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folder :
&quot; in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically you need a script for each system service , which you want to start playing at the high level domain . system services include such things such as network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not contain such things like set@@ backs that only once started . such views belong to r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
&quot; r@@ c.@@ local should be placed under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems own this file , even if it does not have much use for it . you can also do a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something to do with the seri@@ ousness connection . &quot;
the kernel looks for different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first he finds .
the default @-@ level run@@ level is registered in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . you should see a line like the following :
&quot; at this point you can throw a look at the second column and probably notice that the pre @-@ set Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to edit it , then you can edit / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab by hand and change the 3 . be very careful when you fix it by clicking the system and execute the following : &quot;
&quot; but how does it start all the correct scrip@@ ting ? if you type up -@@ l input in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you probably will see something like the following : &quot;
you will notice that in this folder you cannot find the right files . instead , each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d . &quot;
how does and stops in@@ it actually system services ? very simple : each of the script is so written that it is an argument like start and stop . you can actually start this script actually from hand on the command line below :
&quot; this would stop the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the one K contains , the script will be called with the argument stop . if it includes a S , the script will start with the argument . &quot;
&quot; some people want to set up a simple way of set machines for many purposes . I could have been a server -@@ Run@@ level , which can only be htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . furthermore , I could also have a user -@@ Run@@ level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , Network &amp; etc . &quot;
here you learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another po@@ ise is easy to say not to say tri@@ vial ; simply draw an entry from the range of availability system services on one of the six run@@ level to start him on this level ( or stop stop ) .
&quot; you can change scripts between Run@@ lev@@ eling , or change the position within a level by moving it wo@@ unded . this will only happen if they get an entry from the range of availability system services . &quot;
&quot; note : entries will be postpon@@ ed when you choose them into a new zone . to simply select it from the menu editing or from the context menu , even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action . &quot;
&quot; the sor@@ ting number of an application can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case you have to edit the sor@@ ting chambers of the surrounding area , before you can try again to insert the system service . &quot;
&quot; note : at present , there is no possibility to restore entries in the tr@@ ash . be careful . &quot;
&quot; you can use the tab@@ ulator button to activate the different working areas ( Avail@@ able system services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the C@@ ursor buttons to make a selection , or below the previous one . &quot;
&quot; to move an entry into another run@@ level , move it into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it to the desired Run@@ level with inser@@ ting ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to change the sor@@ ting number or the name of an entry manually , press the input button to switch the Properties dialog . close the dialog by using the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to throw the changes . &quot;
&quot; because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the menu file require confirmation before they run . &quot;
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . pres@@ ets are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise they are stored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; amendments to the pres@@ ets are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
&quot; I have experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ lev@@ eling , and now the machine will start steady . what can I do ? &quot;
type the LI@@ LO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the default run@@ level at a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be in order ) .
&quot; I have some system services provided with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for running under Run@@ level X , but they will not be executed . &quot;
&quot; if you use &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc that are available only in these distri@@ butions available . please read the details in the manual of your distribution . &quot;
&quot; the way , such as system services started in these distri@@ butions , but is unfortunately not any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you use another distribution : please check whether all configuration files are available , and whether they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or htt@@ p@@ d ) just finish their configuration files , if their configuration files are not available or false . &quot;
&quot; the significance of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use another distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level so that this manual can be added to this manual . &quot;
this documentation refers to &amp; user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
&quot; to start with &amp; k@@ user ; to start , it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; to read . &quot;
&quot; after you have made changes , you have to store this . either using the appropriate symbol of the tool@@ bar or the entry save in the menu file . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two cardboard cards , user interface and user interface . to the processing , select the desired user or the desired group with a double @-@ clicking on the entry . it appears the dialog user interface or group properties . &quot;
&quot; some cart@@ on cards are only represented if you have enabled advanced system settings . only when you can make space constra@@ int , on which you can make individual settings . further card maps appear , if shadow passwords are installed or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as in BSD @-@ Uni@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; the map card will appear , if shadow passwords are installed or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as in BSD -@@ Uni@@ xes . &quot;
this map card will only be activated if available for at least a built @-@ in file system space ( qu@@ ota ) and initi@@ alized ( recognizable on the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the fil@@ es@@ ystem ) . here you can use the limited data in KB :
these parameters can be adjusted for each file system separately . the current file system will be selected with the help of the field system file .
the map @-@ card groups inform@@ s about the group of the selected user . the standard group that belongs to the user can be found in the field Prim@@ ary group . furthermore the user can mark the user in other groups by clicking it in the big field .
&quot; the dialogue features of the group contains a list of all users . to add a user to a group , select this user in the list . &quot;
&quot; to add a user or a group , select Add to the menu user or group or click on the matching Add @-@ button of the tool@@ bar . the editing or del@@ e@@ tion of the selected user or the selected group works analog . &quot;
&quot; with this module you can install the LI@@ LO @-@ Boot@@ Manager , remove and change the time up to the boats of the standard operating system , remove the standard operating system , modify , modify operating systems , change , change and more . &quot;
