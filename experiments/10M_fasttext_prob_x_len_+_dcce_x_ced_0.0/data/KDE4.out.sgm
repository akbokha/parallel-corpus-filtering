<seg id="482">"Refokusds may be the best of the three, since he really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its use and has different parameters for adjustment."</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digital pictures require a correction of the sharpness. this in turn leads to a color point. this in turn leads to a common color. this same phenomenon can be observed if color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras require usually more detrimental than normal cameras for the private user.</seg>
<seg id="484">"in JPEG-images, a camera is often applied in the case. images in the pipe-format must always be sharpened during the processing."</seg>
<seg id="485">"some scanner turn a sharpness already during the reading of the picture. if you disable these deactivate, you get control of your image."</seg>
<seg id="486">"in some situations, you can get usable results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening workbook. this can call you using the menu-application basket."</seg>
<seg id="487">"but you should hereby handle carefully, since the results are not very natural: the worst technique increases the sharpness of the edges, but also increases the smoker technology to sharpening a picture, you can find more information and a comparison of all techniques for grinding."</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too scarce. the solution to draw the image a little soft to draw. use the tool for soft marks with the menu output corrigid soft and experiment with settings. the curtains on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter blender is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>

<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often produce good results and should first improve the effect. an increase in the radius or the amount reinforce the effect. if you make the insharpness mask is too strong, roughness and the impression of grats in the proximity of sharp edges."</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius is how many pixels are affected on each side of a edges by the filter. high resolution images allow larger radii. you should therefore find pictures best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount provides the percentage between the original and the wisely picture one that is added to the original. thus the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">"the swelling is a rupture from the maximum RGB value and to apply differential amount. it can thus be applied as a minimum change between the tones of sharpening, except and therefore beautiful error in faces, directions and water surfaces."</seg>

<seg id="869">Proportional to 2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. here the side-ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option e.g. to adjust your image to the screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: disproportionate size change in two dimensions. the print ratio is changed during this option.</seg>

<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>

<seg id="1525">"--preset stane '= 320Kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want to have absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size, then select this setting."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"the & CD; information, which are entered manually or by the program automatically generated from the freeDB over the internet, are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can pass / or are used with & kaudiocreator; and the body's code as well as the characteristics of the music files."</seg>
<seg id="1527">"in connection with Kodierprograms, there is often a combination of programmes for the codification and these parameters. the manual or the help to the codification declare the switch for these programs."</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for example, to add the & CD; title to the keyword (English: day) if MP3s are coded by lame, the switch -tt of lame and the title parameters of & kaudiocreator; added. the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'."</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & audiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button-drawing):</seg>
<seg id="1530">"that's what the freeDB is: a free database, in which people can download the audio CDs, so that all others can download it. it is to be noted that here only by text is spoken: & CD; titles, artists, names of pieces & etc; not from the audio file itself."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"yes, it should be legal, but I am meant to be legal. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; any more or less valuable, so that neither the artist nor the music business can be added. all the information can be added to the artist's music by a & CD; business, physically or virtual."</seg>

<seg id="1534">"a visit to freedb.org provides a list of reflection for the online retrieval of & CD; information while reading a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually provided monthly) only the updates of the database."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which output program is used to save pieces from the & CD; in WAV files to my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">"there are rumors that cdparanoia is used; who wants to know more exactly, looking at source code....

<seg id="1537">"to save the full WAV files can be chosen the codification and thus the desired file format (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a lost-free compression for audio data) on the tab. other Kodiers can be added on this tab."</seg>
<seg id="1538">"the Kodierer package must be installed from the relevant Linux distribution, before the codification can be used. further information about Kodierer can be found in the chapter Which Kodierer."</seg>
<seg id="1539">"after installing a codification, further information can be obtained through the input of a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a consoles window (eg; Console). it must be replaced by the name of the installed body."</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the setup of the device recording of the & CD; / DVD drives (lame for MP3s, FLAC & etc;). try both programs with a command line in a terminal. this could give an indication of what is wrong. "</seg>

<seg id="1651">"the temporary collection can not be deleted. however, this does not matter as it is not saved when leaving & kmid; not stored."</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers that are not General-MIDI-capable. in this case the MIDI-Map General-MIDI events occur in events that understands the synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="1653">"for example, you can create a MIDI-map, which converts all events of the change patch to Bright piano in events of the change patch to Trumpet and thus always sound a trumpet, if originally a piano should play."</seg>
<seg id="1654">"if you only have a sound card, you do not need MIDI-map because all Soundcards GM -compatible are (including Awe - and CIS cards, FM -devices and so on)."</seg>
<seg id="1655">"unfortunately, there are no programs to create MIDI-maps. so you have to edit the appropriate file from hand (with your favorite editor)."</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-map is a text file that saves all required sizes to play a piece of piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">"each section may only appear once, except the KEYMAP section, which may appear as many times as desired. however, that every occurrence is a different text ID (see below)."</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define KEYMAP "Name of Keymap..." END Define KEYMAP "A further Keymap... END Define CHANNELMAP... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">"you see that Define is used to view that a section begins (except for options) and END, that the end of a section is achieved."</seg>
<seg id="1660">"please send me your map file as an email, so that I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support can provide for devices that are not General-MIDI compatible."</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section the patches are shown by General MIDI to your specific keyboard. general use looks as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">"please note that the left side of the likeness is ignored. it is believed that the GM-patches are in the right order (from 0 to 127), so you may not change the order and also leave no line for one of 128 instruments."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"the optional AllkeysTo M is used to put all sounds that need this instrument with the number M (GM-patch 127), you can take a Drum (e.g. with tone 60), which allows you to take a drum shot (e.g. with tone 60), which can take the same in the PATCHMAP section:"</seg>
<seg id="1664">"so if now a MIDI-file should play a note with patch 127 (thread), it will take patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the tone 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI-file."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"please note that here with the term drum patch of the patch is meant by which every sound is a different percussiontool (Drum, basin, Maracas & etc;) and not the one, in which the sound means the sound height of the always same drum (as some keyboards possess)."</seg>
<seg id="1666">"the KEYMAP section is used to indicate how tints are shown on a specific channel or instrument, the use is:"</seg>
<seg id="1667">"as with the PATCHMAP section, the order of the lines is very important, as their presence. so you have to create 128 entries."</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several keymaps for each channel and every instrument. you only need to use different names in the first row.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used above all to form tints on the Perkets channel. look as an example the supplied keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">"this section can be used to make some channels up to others. if you want to exchange for example the first and second channel, simply make it easy at CHANNELMAP section."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"however, these settings are useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a particular channel (General MIDI to channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9)."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"Midi-devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section therefore has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, built according to the following pattern:"</seg>
<seg id="1673">"N is here the channel, which is shown on the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the keynote will of course be further forward in the file. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events are ignored that will change the patch on this channel. in this case, then always patch x is used."</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch can be useful for example to always use the persipping patch on the persipping channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">"the value for PitchBenderratio indicates, in which relationship Pitch-Bender-events sends multiplied with the value, this is used with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then only passed on. the value 4096 is used so that in the map file will be no decimal commas."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"this setting is used because GM indicates that a keyboard-Bender event will win with the value 4096, a sound higher. unfortunately, however, try some keyboards to play up to an octave. to find the right value on your keyboard, you must try a bit with & kmid;"</seg>
<seg id="1677">"to use a MIDI-map, simply open the dialog MIDI-settings. this can be found in the menu under settings, point MIDI-settings"</seg>
<seg id="1678">"the Kanalview is a window with a whole series Klaviaturen (one for every MIDI channel). on these piano, you can see which sounds are just played."</seg>
<seg id="1679">"you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel there is a selection list, where you have a instrument changed, the button is no longer green but red to show that no longer the original instrument is used."</seg>
<seg id="1680">The Kanalview (until now) two different views to display the players. view settings in the menu settings under the point Kanalview: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">"the pace-LCD shows the speed that is played by a song. the higher the number, the greater the speed."</seg>
<seg id="1682">"you can change the pace of a song. so if you find e.g., a song is too fast to follow the text you can slow down. to change the pace, use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"a MIDI-file is a file that contains information about how to play a music piece. it contains the notes, the rhythm, speed, & etc;. this enables the same MIDI-file on two different devices to very different results, just like two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"good, I can force anyone to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs approximately 50 KB, while an mp3-file needs 4 MB needs (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you get a similar sound quality. in a MIDI-file you can also change the single instruments, speed & etc; you have control over everything."</seg>
<seg id="1685">"this can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) of & kmid; without Awe support. to eliminate the problem you need to download a source distribution and install (for example from kmid; 's Home)"</seg>
<seg id="1686">"I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I have no desire to add all the files separately."</seg>
<seg id="1687">"agree that supports & kmid; drag & Drop. simply open the folder you want to add in & konqueror, select all the files and drag them to the & kmid; -window."</seg>

<seg id="2940">"& ksystemlog; is a & kde; -viewers for system protocols. the program is suitable for inexperienced users, where you can obtain information about your system or where the system uses the different protocol files. in addition, & ksystemlog; experienced users access the quick access for example on information about problems that will occur on their server."</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users understand what your computer makes it in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; it is a simplified user interface that does not know where you can receive information about your system or where the system uses the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">"in addition, & ksystemlog; experienced users access quick access for example on information about problems that may arise on their server. & ksystemlog; therefore, some advanced functions tries to be filtered and evaluated with their help the protocol-files of certain programs."</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 possesses & ksystemlog; a number of useful features. these include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of protocol-files for the format of the syslog server and for Samba.</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">"as you see in the following screenshot, provides & ksystemlog; functions available with their help the single protocol-lines of a protocol file easily filtering and sort. the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual."</seg>
<seg id="2947">"after the start tried & ksystemlog; first, the main protocol-file of the system - the system protocol will be opened, so you have not yet opened using system managers. the protocol files can be found under Linux usually in the folder / var / log, for the normal user usually have no permission to read."</seg>
<seg id="2948">"you can also use the filter bar, in order to filter by a selected criteria. the list of the log lines will now be displayed automatically, so that only a log lines will be displayed in addition to the filter option. then, a protocol will only appear if in one of the columns the string of the filter concept is included."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"you can also select another entry. the string of the filter concept will then only select with the entries in accordance with selected column. select the column process, which shows you & ksystemlog; all the protocol-lines sent to which this process is sent or created."</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to detect the important protocol lines. protocol-lines of level error will be displayed with a conspicuous color as a protocol-line of level reference. the colored representation of protocol-lines can be switched from the dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="2951">"if you want to show only certain process (e.g. in the system protocol or in cron protocol), so you can select the process identification (PID) in the column process. this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a certain command such as the start of the samba server. in this case you use filter bar."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"in addition, you can jump the option to new lines in the context menu of the main window to display all new record lines."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"& ksystemlog; allows the display of multiple protocol files in seperate subwindows. to use this function, use the entries in the menu window to open up additional sub-windows, select in the menu a protocol on display."</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website at http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. You can find more information on the sources of sources of & ksystemlog;</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; find also in the following folder of the & kde; Subversion archive: ksystemlog; in & kde; -archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">"welcome to the & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and in the following also as named) as & ksysv; this section runs a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv."</seg>
<seg id="2957">"the system V Init quickly develops into the standard for the control of the program starting up the system in the & Linux; and therefore, because it is easier to use, powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD -Init."</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further on historical aspects (e.g. because I know nothing about it: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">"the Init Binding file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because maybe someone could try to make a machine on System V Init, without a reinstallation and re-format. therefore, you must make sure that the old Init was removed from there if there was one."</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init also differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files in a subfolder of / etc are instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.sysinit and the following additional folder:</seg>
<seg id="2961">"init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically you need a script for each system service, which you want to start playing at the high level domain. system services include such things such as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not contain such things like setbacks that only once started. such views belong to rc.local."</seg>
<seg id="2962">"rc.local should be placed under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems own this file, even if it does not have much use for it. you can also do a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something to do with the seriousness connection."</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel looks for different places after the program init and starts the first he finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default-level runlevel is registered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">"at this point you can throw a look at the second column and probably notice that the pre-set Runlevel 3 is. if you want to edit it, then you can edit / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. be very careful when you fix it by clicking the system and execute the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how does it start all the correct scripting? if you type up -l input in rc3.d, then you probably will see something like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that in this folder you cannot find the right files. instead, each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the directory init.d. "</seg>
<seg id="2968">How does and stops init actually system services? very simple: each of the script is so written that it is an argument like start and stop. you can actually start this script actually from hand on the command line below:</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the one K contains, the script will be called with the argument stop. if it includes a S, the script will start with the argument."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people want to set up a simple way of set machines for many purposes. I could have been a server -Runlevel, which can only be httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc. furthermore, I could also have a user -Runlevel, the & eg; & kdm;, Network & etc."</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another poise is easy to say not to say trivial; simply draw an entry from the range of availability system services on one of the six runlevel to start him on this level (or stop stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">"you can change scripts between Runleveling, or change the position within a level by moving it wounded. this will only happen if they get an entry from the range of availability system services."</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries will be postponed when you choose them into a new zone. to simply select it from the menu editing or from the context menu, even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the sorting number of an application can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case you have to edit the sorting chambers of the surrounding area, before you can try again to insert the system service."</seg>
<seg id="2976">"note: at present, there is no possibility to restore entries in the trash. be careful."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the tabulator button to activate the different working areas (Available system services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the Cursor buttons to make a selection, or below the previous one."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"to move an entry into another runlevel, move it into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it to the desired Runlevel with inserting (with Ctrl; V)."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"to change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually, press the input button to switch the Properties dialog. close the dialog by using the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to throw the changes."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the menu file require confirmation before they run."</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. presets are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise they are stored by & ksysv; amendments to the presets are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">"I have experimented with the standard Runleveling, and now the machine will start steady. what can I do?"</seg>
<seg id="2983">Type the LILO -Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default runlevel at a reasonable value (3 should normally be in order).</seg>
<seg id="2984">"I have some system services provided with & ksysv; for running under Runlevel X, but they will not be executed."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"if you use & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc that are available only in these distributions available. please read the details in the manual of your distribution."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"the way, such as system services started in these distributions, but is unfortunately not any standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"if you use another distribution: please check whether all configuration files are available, and whether they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) just finish their configuration files, if their configuration files are not available or false."</seg>
<seg id="2988">"the significance of the & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use another distribution, please send me information about the runlevel so that this manual can be added to this manual."</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & user; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">"to start with & kuser; to start, it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of & kuser; to read."</seg>
<seg id="2991">"after you have made changes, you have to store this. either using the appropriate symbol of the toolbar or the entry save in the menu file."</seg>
<seg id="2992">"& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two cardboard cards, user interface and user interface. to the processing, select the desired user or the desired group with a double-clicking on the entry. it appears the dialog user interface or group properties."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"some carton cards are only represented if you have enabled advanced system settings. only when you can make space constraint, on which you can make individual settings. further card maps appear, if shadow passwords are installed or for example / etc / master.passwd as in BSD-Unices."</seg>
<seg id="2994">"the map card will appear, if shadow passwords are installed or for example / etc / master.passwd as in BSD -Unixes."</seg>
<seg id="2995">This map card will only be activated if available for at least a built-in file system space (quota) and initialized (recognizable on the file quota.user / quota.group on the filesystem). here you can use the limited data in KB:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be adjusted for each file system separately. the current file system will be selected with the help of the field system file.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The map-card groups informs about the group of the selected user. the standard group that belongs to the user can be found in the field Primary group. furthermore the user can mark the user in other groups by clicking it in the big field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">"the dialogue features of the group contains a list of all users. to add a user to a group, select this user in the list."</seg>
<seg id="2999">"to add a user or a group, select Add to the menu user or group or click on the matching Add-button of the toolbar. the editing or deletion of the selected user or the selected group works analog."</seg>
