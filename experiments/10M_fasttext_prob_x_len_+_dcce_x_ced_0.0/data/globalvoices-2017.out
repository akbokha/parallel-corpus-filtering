&quot; although I had attended the US for at least once a year , I would now live there for the first time . &quot;
and that was very exciting for me .
my love of America is tremendous .
&quot; as many of my generation I grew up with American films , American authors have been read and operated by American authors . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly due to an American film journalist . &quot;
&quot; as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gr@@ ay Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , who covered with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts as Jura @-@ Stu@@ ed the Moravian @-@ co@@ ed conspir@@ acy of an oil @-@ magn@@ ates that were the top federal court with judges who were interested . &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; free to Meth@@ od Man , &quot; I was as if this is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year , which I lived in Arizona , had only strengthened my admir@@ ation for the US . &quot;
&quot; I said , &quot; &quot; America is the only country where I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting , you can always be that you are , and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
I even wrote a very sham@@ anic lovemaking letter about his size .
then Donald Tru@@ mp .
much was written about xen@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
&quot; the most extraordinary aspect of his as@@ cen@@ sion is for me , as he goes with his bott@@ len@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; he never stops up with his opinion on the mountain , as you are so beautiful . &quot;
&quot; he says exactly what he thinks , like a former colleague , and explains openly his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ American and women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , people responded to his statements and voted for him . &quot;
&quot; the 13 million voices , which he won at the Republi@@ can presidential elections , was the highest number , which has ever reached from the party . &quot;
I was speech@@ less .
&quot; who are the Americans who support these big@@ otte a person , I asked myself ? &quot;
I could not bring Tru@@ mp and his voters with the people I met during my time in Phoenix .
&quot; as for example my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journalist who takes people from all over the world , a deep sc@@ an@@ ous man with which I could talk about Islam and his past . &quot;
&quot; also called Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s world@@ view , not by Peter Bh@@ atia , the current editor of &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bh@@ atia and I met with our common love for basketball , and we spent many hours to watch the &quot; Phoenix Suns &quot; &quot; in the game . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp@@ s Int@@ oler@@ ance also stands in contrast to the gener@@ osity that I lived on Sandy B@@ ahr , who fights their lives for the environment and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me as their son . &quot;
&quot; she adap@@ ts to the commitment of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped with a lot of patience and grace to me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of the American life . &quot;
&quot; then there were Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors who helped me a lot with my career . &quot;
these people and the values they em@@ bo@@ died in deep@@ ened my love of America .
&quot; during the Tru@@ mp &apos;s path to the nom@@ ination Republi@@ can presidential data , they offered me a stop and the counter@@ part to its restricted vision of America . &quot;
&quot; however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule . &quot;
&quot; on 8 November 2016 , more than 50 million Americans , mostly White , the presidency of a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his cont@@ emp@@ t towards non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the discussion with the idea that people voted for Tru@@ mp , because they shared either its racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , because they were willing to over@@ looked these things , broke me almost the heart . &quot;
perhaps it is unfair to call the Tru@@ mp @-@ voters as r@@ assi@@ sts .
&quot; to arrange the people , one of my friends , is exactly what we led to this situation . &quot;
this is super@@ ficial and respectful and indicates an in@@ ability to understand those who act in a different way and thinking .
it shows the people that their concerns and fears about the h@@ ectic changes in their communities are not considered .
&quot; could it be that these voters are , of which most knows , for Tru@@ mp voted , because they want to attract control over a country that she has disappointed ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , they might want to say that they are still important in this America ? &quot;
maybe .
&quot; however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who commented the cruel decision to watch a man who look down with cont@@ emp@@ t on those who look differently from him . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( An@@ m . ) . : as much as &quot; bo@@ el@@ ong@@ ation of the White against all other eth@@ ni@@ es &quot; ; &quot; word from white in terms of white and wh@@ i@@ pl@@ ash , as much means as Schl@@ eu@@ der@@ sad ) , as it was the great Van Jones , exactly which America has made so great . &quot;
&quot; millions of people all over the world appreciate the American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - which faith or background you may have always like , America is always welcome . &quot;
&quot; for this country chose as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ y@@ man whose history , as he says himself , nowhere else in the world would be possible . &quot;
&quot; with the choice Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s , however , is a huge part of the white America of this promise and says : to hell with mani@@ fold , religious freedom and the whole concept of plur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is back on the herds , they say . &quot;
&quot; with all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who had fallen in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot;
&quot; on a manifestation for Hill@@ ary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp , would have my son , captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan . &quot;
the amount answered with a loud &quot; no ! &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; &quot; brood the amount . &quot;
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; &quot; answered them . &quot;
have A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; &quot; ri@@ ef@@ en they and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot;
&quot; could anyone , who is not like you , a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a vote and a strong &quot; NE@@ IN . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; God is thanks , Mr. Tru@@ mp , is not your America . &quot;
&quot; the land , for which his son was fallen , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; this is now Tru@@ mp@@ s Land , said the message . &quot;
&quot; and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could find no place in this new America . &quot;
and that breaks my heart .

what has the Mexican music school in the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero municipality in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ean city Cat@@ e@@ ura jointly ?
&quot; the music that played at both places is not only the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ... &quot;
music that lives with the waste
&quot; Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located at the edge of a large gar@@ bage dump , only 16 kilometers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial city which is very popular among tourists but world @-@ worlds from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine . &quot;
&quot; for a couple of years now , La B@@ anda de M@@ Ãº@@ sica ( Musik@@ ban@@ de ) has been playing in the community : one of children and adults existing sym@@ ph@@ ony orchestra which has found an opportunity to overcome the surrounding poverty . &quot;
a music @-@ school with 100 students has become the central interest in the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; the municipality , located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico , is known for their drugs abuse and gangs . &quot;
yet this changed after an acci@@ dental encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered the youth so a rare hop@@ eless .
the young band@@ members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca n@@ vi : &quot;
&quot; once they come from school , they go back home and immediately after lunch they run through the best streets to follow their great passion . &quot;
&quot; they always come together and play with sh@@ iny eyes and play in the Tru@@ bel you learn day for day trumpet , tromb@@ one , pic@@ colo , flute , forest horn , Pau@@ ke , Pau@@ ke , B@@ ong@@ os and the Con@@ ga . &quot;
music from the gar@@ bage
&quot; more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura - a village that is practically located at the largest gar@@ bage dump of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments that are made of recur@@ sive waste material : &quot;
&quot; music with recur@@ rent instruments that consist of local solid waste materials , made in a workshop for music instruments in Cat@@ e@@ ura where the Rec@@ ycl@@ er began under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o ChÃ¡vez that can transform parts of the crash into instruments . &quot;
&quot; the instruments im@@ itate violin , viol@@ as , C@@ elli , contr@@ ab@@ asses , har@@ ps , p@@ ones , trump@@ ets , trump@@ ets , trumpet , tromb@@ ones and perc@@ ussion , all of which were made out of the rub@@ b@@ ish . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ al and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article in Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o ChÃ¡vez , a local Ã@@ k@@ ologist and Musi@@ cians of the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura , in the early days : &quot;
&quot; first , it was very difficult because we had no room for rehear@@ sals and we had to teach at the same place , the children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live with their children . &quot;
&quot; this changed as F@@ avi@@ o , which he had never seen before : one out of waste from waste . &quot;
&quot; today , there is a whole orchestra which plays on instruments from recur@@ rent material and that is the Rec@@ ycl@@ ed Orchestra . &quot;
a documentary named &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic gar@@ bage dump ) presents the musical performance to :
the world produces about one billion tonnes of tr@@ ash each year .
&quot; those who live with him and live from him are the poorest , like the people in Cat@@ e@@ ura , Paraguay . &quot;
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
land@@ fill harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspir@@ ational spectacle of gar@@ bage @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra has played his music even before Pope Franzis@@ kus :
these East African countries show how technology and teamwork can be successful for illegal fishing
photo Â© F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that fought wild and illegal fishing .
&quot; this post , written by Emma Bry@@ ce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , published a magazine that specifically reported on international , practical solutions for environmental problems . &quot;
re @-@ release occurs during an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for common use of content .
&quot; in West Africa was then known that this ship had already operated in liber@@ ated waters illegal fishing , before it was looking for the other coast of Africa . &quot;
the East African countries were accordingly up accordingly and little gen@@ ei@@ ves to welcome a legislative bre@@ cher of this kind in their co@@ asts .
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ os , Moz@@ ambi@@ que and the Seych@@ elles mobil@@ ised himself against the ship . they ling@@ ered him , one of their ports and refuse to give him a fishing sign . &quot;
&quot; &quot; Ur@@ suddenly was the prime minister surrounded by countries that you simply deny all everything &quot; , &quot; reminds of Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a leader of the Ken@@ yan Fish@@ eries . he is part of a team that discovered the ship &apos;s ship and followed . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , the ship was driven out of the waters of the region : it was not succeeded to catch the fishes . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liber@@ ia , due to lo@@ oting of fish stocks . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , which protects criminal practices , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the N@@ RO Stop Ill@@ egal F@@ ishing ( Ill@@ eg@@ ale Fish@@ eries ) . &quot;
&quot; the members of this network are beside Somalia and Madagascar , the six countries that had exp@@ elled the prime minister out of their waters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and work together . they exchange information and stand together where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , Head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts project En@@ ding Ill@@ egal F@@ ishing . this project offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
illegal fishing is regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden is hidden because of it is extremely difficult to absor@@ b . this is the illegal fisheries a leading cause of over@@ fishing regions .
&quot; by inten@@ tional dis@@ regard to existing laws , through which certain habitats and species are to be protected , the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems can harm the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems . &quot;
&quot; but while actions against illegal fishing were hin@@ dered by bureaucr@@ atic hur@@ dles and also by the sn@@ ail @-@ emp@@ o , with the information between individual countries , so the actions of these activities occurred in real time , with trac@@ eable to F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; here the individual countries can share with each other , for example lists of existing licences , news to suspic@@ ious activities or details that you have noticed during a port spec@@ ulate or learn . &quot;
&quot; Fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very attentive , when they are at the open sea , by means of satellite data . &quot;
&quot; this allows the authorities to mark the authorities , vessels which fish in bot@@ tom@@ ed areas - about such that suggest a ship his filmed fish on the way to other ships . &quot;
&quot; in the Ide@@ al@@ incident , such surveys can show whether the participating vessels have a fishing licence , where they were on the way and possibly also whether they have a pen@@ al code . &quot;
&quot; countries that are against illegal fishing , may refuse the adoption of such ships in its ports . what does the ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to pay off pen@@ alties , as in the case of Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s then about significant financial losses for the owner , meaning that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; and that is what we want to achieve &quot; , &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , leading Director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . this latter is a consultant company dedicated to the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
a closed front
&quot; the already mentioned platform was created to attract 20 million USD in lost turnover , which will lose eight members of the network H@@ ISH @-@ i every year due to the illegal fishermen , which penet@@ rate into East African waters . &quot;
East @-@ Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fish farms that lead to the region of commercial fishing from around the world . among those also those illegal fishermen .
&quot; such practices include events as the sailing under false flag , counter@@ feit Lic@@ p@@ api@@ ere , specification of ph@@ antasi@@ es , the fish protected species and the fish in conservation areas . &quot;
&quot; &quot; they often use the lack of international cooperation and make the weaknesses of a non @-@ controlled control system , &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; earlier a ship could be illeg@@ ally fishing and a country could then say &quot; You dar@@ ed not walk my harbour . &quot;
&quot; but another country could say &apos; Com@@ m to me &apos; . &quot; &quot; and exactly this leg@@ ale hat@@ ch tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
so far the closed front works .
&quot; since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i was involved in more than 30 studies of susp@@ ects ships . &quot;
it has revealed criminal networks to spread counter@@ feit licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that were tr@@ acked several fr@@ aud@@ ul@@ ent identi@@ ties and found fl@@ edged ships and found .
&quot; due to its cooperation with Inter@@ pol , the international authority to combat crime , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing over large distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; some of our investigations carry us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; it builds a system that can help F@@ ISH @-@ i , di@@ gest@@ ed ships precise . &quot;
photo with friendly permission of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is always further developed , helps the illegal ships also helps to hide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position , &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ g@@ g M@@ at Tr@@ acking , an NGO , which also deals with fishing data and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; some of the ships turn off for example their automatic identification systems , which they can no longer be used by satellites . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Cop@@ eland helps to build a system that connects various information levels . it aims to help F@@ ISH @-@ i to find criminal vessels with greater precision . &quot;
a model program
but F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team African nations can actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the NGOs Sky@@ Truth , believes that . &quot;
&quot; recently , sky@@ truth has opened up with Google and the marine protection organisation Oc@@ e@@ ana the platform Global F@@ ishing Watch : a platform that provides satellite data and by means that the position of every single trac@@ eable vessel can be displayed worldwide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; work together with neighbours to get a better picture of what where does - this results simply meaning , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and to join their resources . &quot;
&quot; we should do this on a global level . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable trust@@ s has a similar project to run in which a global system per@@ missible the persecution of ships . &quot;
&quot; there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities are not only crimin@@ als , but they are also ho@@ oked . &quot;
&quot; ships that have previously been conf@@ isc@@ ated without licence and hardly expected to reck@@ on with consequences , they know that they are observed . &quot;
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ ISH @-@ i participating countries now have a 33 % increase in fishing sales , since fishing boats in more licenses . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had helped Gre@@ ko 1 , Gre@@ ko 1 found the insp@@ ectors on board sk@@ epp@@ ia , whose use is forbidden . &quot;
photo with friendly permission of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries &quot; , &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; in West Africa , several hundred million dollars will disappear annually by illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 six countries joined the West Africa Task Force . they are now fighting for illegal fishing , according to the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; With security is the aim of leaving more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member states could report his first big triumph : in October it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was under false flag , and not only was the ship without a license and were used sl@@ ug@@ g@@ nets , which are now prohibited . &quot;
&quot; the ship was also penet@@ rated in bot@@ tom@@ ed waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with the take of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , which go a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time the evidence that such special , collaborative approach to protect the oceans actually works in the entire world ocean . Emma Bry@@ ce is a freel@@ ance journalist and lives in London . there is a topic on environment , technology and nutrition . &quot;
&quot; their articles appeared in the Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , the New York Times and in the Guardian . situation in Venezuela continues to go back : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of cap@@ turing the country &quot;
the road movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are regarded as protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum for the President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro .

&quot; after the government of Venezuela had rejected the application of opposition to a referendum on a referendum , re@@ acted the Venezu@@ el@@ ans in whose eyes had the negotiations over the political and economic crisis of the country into the lead by themselves gathered around the streets . &quot;
under the has@@ ht@@ ag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( approximately : the back@@ rest of Venezuela ) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments against and against them .
&quot; the debate is also managed in other parts of the country - among other things in the low@@ land Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ des regions of MÃ©@@ rida and T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira , located in central Par@@ a@@ at Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the State of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the political and economic situation of the country is deteri@@ or@@ ating constantly , which makes itself noticeable in the everyday life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans through an acute lack of food and drugs . &quot;
many representatives of the opposition saw the chance of a fundamental change in the state of Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro . however , the possibility of a re@@ election of the official authorities was blocked . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ anne D@@ Ã­@@ az , Mit@@ rop@@ ath at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , sums up in its latest article in the context of government statement together : &quot;
&quot; within the framework of the social , political and economic crisis , in which In@@ fl@@ ation rates are estimated to be estimated at 500 % to the annual financial statements , and in which a serious and far @-@ depth lack of food and medicine is considered to be the only way to reg@@ ain its institutional structures and to close a new government of government . &quot;
&quot; the election of M@@ esa de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ Ã¡@@ tica or short MU@@ D ( about : r@@ under table of the Democratic unity ) , the demonstr@@ ators are closely aligned with the support of the National Assembly . here , the trial against the President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro &apos; was planned to continue working on October 27th , should continue to continue the block@@ age of the referendum on the am@@ t@@ sen@@ th@@ bles@@ hooting . &quot;

&quot; on Twitter , pictures that tell about disputes , as well as reports of repression and failure . &quot;
&quot; especially large waves , the news of pol@@ zei@@ gen@@ ous repression in the central city of Marac@@ ay . &quot;
there the prot@@ esters went back to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves in front of the police and armed pro@@ pon@@ ents of the government .
&quot; hours later , they were able to leave the cathedral again , but the protests went on . &quot;
&quot; in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators were trying to stop police forces , including this woman in the An@@ den@@ state T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira : &quot;
&quot; the women in T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira do not carry any redness because you could see something else , what many nation@@ alists do not have ! &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , an Info@@ graphic shows the round which forms the scale of repression per day : &quot;
thus the dictatorship has suppres@@ sed the country .
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for an amalg@@ amation process - this was now proved in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the street .
My@@ t@@ ek Media Lab@@ s to do this :
Nicol@@ Ã¡s and Di@@ os@@ d@@ ado pret@@ end that 1 % of the sig@@ natur@@ es are fal@@ si@@ fied .
here is your Am@@ t@@ sen@@ th@@ bles@@ hooting !
on the road !
&quot; others evaluate these protests as a further step in the fight against a government that has undertaken a little bit against the devast@@ ating economic crisis , and rather than dealing with critical voices : &quot;
they have taken us so much - but also the fear !
mar@@ ches getting more and more of frequency and intensity .
&quot; some ven@@ z@@ ol@@ ans reported the media , they are too hungry to participate in one strike , rather than to work or buy . &quot;

&quot; this is an adap@@ tive version of an interview of Al@@ ejo GÃ³@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was released on 23 August 2016 on d@@ Ã­a a d@@ Ã­a , a Argent@@ inian land . &quot;
the interview was translated into English and published here with friendly permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to see the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ inian city CÃ³rdoba . &quot;
in the meantime adult man said Qui@@ j@@ ano now in the context of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ ber@@ a process in the province of CÃ³rdoba against his father .
&quot; in the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were examined , committed during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not been looking for his life .
&quot; starting with the BÃ¼r@@ de , the same name as his father to carry up to the brutal sp@@ ouses in prison La Per@@ la , he observed enough in the age of 15 , he has suffered enough . &quot;
&quot; 34 years , he retained the family environment for himself . &quot;
in the situation then I believed that was in order .
I felt like a secret .
&quot; as a child of 15 years , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father . &quot;
&quot; at that time , I was not able to realize that my father was a th@@ ief , Fol@@ terer and mur@@ derer . &quot;
&quot; Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was G@@ end@@ arm@@ chair . during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship of 1974 until 1983 , a time of state treas@@ ury , his father was born from 1976 to 1978 dep@@ uty com@@ mander of intelligence agencies 141 in prison La Per@@ la . &quot;

&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ anos son , a man who had experienced the extent of the atro@@ cities that he had seen as a boy , and who said before a federal court against his own father . &quot;
&quot; his story shows how great power has a parent in his child , and how this child chose a path of salvation . &quot;
from the Spor@@ hall to the military base
&quot; when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I was made friends with a boy , the martial arts . &quot;
all familiar him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and some days later he showed me a black @-@ white photo and asked me to identify my friend about it .
he said :
&quot; you are an ark , you have inspired you with one of the ERP . &quot;
pass merely that they don &apos;t have you one day and I must save you .
&quot; the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ Ã©r@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ an@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - revolution@@ aries of the Revolution@@ ary Labour Party - the military arm of the Revolution@@ ary Labour Party in Argentina . &quot;
&quot; therefore he offered me to go back to the sports hall . some days later , he took me to work on the military base . &quot;
he said to me ; I would be secret .
&quot; I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be ok . for so , my Father had taken me . &quot;
&quot; on the military base , I had to destroy papers which had heard of the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , prop@@ ag@@ and@@ amat@@ erial , books , just everything . &quot;

&apos;@@ da dr@@ ex@@ es the prisoners are tor@@ tured &quot;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la - all in 1976 .
during the first time last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
&quot; when he took me the second time , he command@@ ed me to get off . he led me to a bar@@ ac@@ ke , in the cars , furniture , television , refriger@@ ators - just everything possible . &quot;
all of them was stolen .
&quot; he gave me a little into a ceiling p@@ addle and f@@ aint to wear it for car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a great cl@@ ump in silver . &quot;
&quot; on that day I went to the other end of the Bar@@ ac@@ ke , where the stolen paintings were dropped , and held me with a guard . &quot;
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
there the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
&quot; I sp@@ ed in , and saw a Li@@ ege that were tor@@ tured on man . &quot;
it looked like a field @-@ bed and metal @-@ feathers .
later I found out that they fortified the end of a cab@@ al . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was captiv@@ ated there .
&quot; they rarely en@@ gros@@ sing a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , p@@ oured him with water and save him a cargo of 220 Volt in the gen@@ itals . &quot;

the Gest@@ ank there in it was f@@ oul ... like a dirty win@@ dle .
&quot; years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room . &quot;
I realized the smell immediately and I realized it was clear that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a person can do another so much sor@@ row ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I knew that these people were killed &quot;
&quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he carried me to the entrance of La cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were captiv@@ ated with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and were t@@ opped . &quot;
&quot; he spoke to &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ Ã³@@ pez , a civilians who was also charged in the process ) and I used the opportunity to take a look at La cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
in the background I saw a number of mat@@ tresses on which naked people were captiv@@ ated with the face down - all were at hands and feet .
close to the entr@@ en@@ ched people still on the mat@@ tresses .
&quot; when my father noted that I saw for the prisoners , he said , &quot; What gu@@ ck@@ est thou so , Ar@@ sch@@ loch ? &quot;
&quot; I did , Why did you otherwise brought me ? &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and were killed and buried by soldiers .
I know that my father told me at home .
&quot; beside La cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices . &quot;
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero there a man struck and t@@ opped .
&quot; ( according to the survi@@ vor@@ s of the civilian is Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also charged at La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ ber@@ a Process , the students of Ra@@ Ãº@@ l Mat@@ ina Mol@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; the following video performs Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , the manager of the memorial La Per@@ la , through the former folding chambers . &quot;
&quot; the way in which you came here is also the way , on which the kidn@@ apped came here . &quot;
&quot; if you look at the map , see that they took about this path and then were tor@@ tured for the first time . &quot;
here their names have changed and they were given as part of the process of dismis@@ sal a number assigned .
&quot; when they survived torture , the prisoners were cast into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the arrangement of above came that they should be moved . &quot;
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the sho@@ ots of men and the dis@@ appearance of their cor@@ p@@ ses in most cases .
the &apos; War &apos;
my father brought all kinds of stolen things at home .
&quot; at that time in the age I had no idea what the &quot; &quot; war &quot; &quot; - as they knew it was . &quot;
&quot; but when I was later in the military - I was in the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie - it was clear to me that war was accused of a b@@ aj@@ on@@ et or perhaps the military characters that one has fought for an enemy . &quot;

&quot; but if you go into a house and the fridge , the record player , clothing , paintings , money ... sti@@ cking , then that is not a war , but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
this is theft .
&quot; I have always asked me how my Father , the leader of security forces , was able to participate in this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I don &apos;t understand it simply .
&quot; I was also officers at the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie , and I would never like to enter into a house , and to ste@@ al everything in it . &quot;
I don &apos;t understand how my Father could do this .
&quot; once he called me a crime and I rep@@ lied , and thou that thou sh@@ ou@@ ld@@ est cars on the road ? &quot;
you are not a crime ?
&quot; he explo@@ ded before W@@ ut , struck me and cri@@ ed : &quot;
&quot; if you go so far , then I will find you and bring you smoothly . &quot;
we do not need one another !
that was my father .
I have no only good memory of him .
&quot; when I said in the process , I showed a photo from that time , on which I carried out a jack@@ et and a wheelchair swe@@ ater from w@@ ool . both had my father from La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he still brought clothes home . &quot;
&quot; at that time I accused the defence , a fellow van@@ ity with this crime . I res@@ ist , no problem , they can lay me to the burden of what they wanted . &quot;
I was anyway there to pl@@ edges .
&apos;@@ the dis@@ appearance of the body is the last ab@@ omin@@ able act &apos;
&quot; now , where I am older , I find Reu@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; I have children . if you have only children once , we recognize the value of a life . &quot;
one develops on and recogni@@ zes that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
&quot; good , you did so during the dictatorship of men . but what the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ? &quot;
why children are kidn@@ apped ?
&quot; one day my father brought a girl with his house , whose mother was killed . &quot;
&quot; she was like our pet , almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl . &quot;
&quot; I always asked me the question : you were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
they could have just put them into prison .
&quot; I appreciate it was simply decided to kill these people , but what their cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ? &quot;
&quot; had these people not even families , which one could pass their dying rem@@ n@@ ants ? &quot;
the dis@@ appearance of the body is the last ab@@ omin@@ able act that can be done for man .
&quot; my father told me when democracy was introduced again , they took machines to eliminate the mor@@ tal rem@@ n@@ ants of the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were sho@@ cked and somewhere dispos@@ ed - no idea where . &quot; &quot; you will never find something , &quot; &quot; My Father . &quot;
but something remains of course always .
&quot; I have seen how you killed man ! &apos;
only to get it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just told the truth about 20 crime - including my father .
&quot; the thought , showing my Father , was born during a conversation , when he was under house arrest . &quot;
&quot; I made him van@@ guard because of all of the atro@@ cities , which I had to experience . &quot;
&quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; I don &apos;t know . I have no one killed . &quot;
&quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly and asked me , for the whole covered patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings , &quot; which they alleg@@ edly defended themselves . &quot;
then I cri@@ ed :
how can you tell me what to tell me ?
I have seen how you killed humans !
you have committed horrible crimes and you have forced me to play as a child .
he ref@@ uted only &quot; Na then forgive me . &quot;
this is exactly what I did .
in 2010 I re@@ funds the first ad .
I was finally recognized that he was a criminal .
nobody can blame me that I have been taken before . I finally have said against my own Father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest before the end of the process .

&quot; a translation error makes older people in Kyoto &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful driving driving &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the sign with the translation error at a centre in Kyoto , where one can extend its leader . &quot;
the photo has been distributed in social media .
processing of the original pictures of Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; in the Japanese town of Kyoto , customers became a newly opened centre in which one can pro@@ long its leader , in the last month witnesses a very special translation . &quot;
&quot; on a sign the Japanese word of a block was translated , but the &quot; older mot@@ orists &quot; means , but maybe even with mal@@ icious back@@ sliding &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as a &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the false translation was to be read from 1 to 20 September on electronic advertisements in the entrance area and in the building itself .
&quot; processing of the original pictures of Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was often shared within the social media . &quot;
&quot; the mistake was to the transl@@ ator Julian Hol@@ mes , a inhabitants of Ky@@ ot@@ os , who was attentive to the local newspaper . &quot;
the daily newspaper Kyoto Shim@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; this is an ins@@ ult to older people and in an international city like Kyoto simply unacceptable , &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot;
&quot; the faul@@ ty English translation was initially removed . the name &quot; &quot; drivers &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropriate name &quot; &quot; El@@ der drivers &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the police of the pre@@ fecture , ap@@ olog@@ ised for the translation errors . furthermore , it stated that the error was already contained in the text they had received from transl@@ ators and that the translation was not tested upon their correctness before it was published . &quot;
a blog@@ ger reported as follows on the excuse :
&quot; we sincerely are sorry that older people felt by the insufficient correction ( the translation ) of our part , &quot; said the police . &quot;
the Japanese online news @-@ cast news set out a little exec@@ utable with the phenomenon of the &quot; terrible &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; the word &quot; terrible &quot; was refused as an adequate description of older drivers . according to the police the proportion of older mot@@ orists are involved in accidents , but quite cause for concern . &quot;
&quot; in Kyoto , for example , in 2005 1,@@ 41 of a total of 19.@@ 460 Un@@ sei@@ zur@@ es of seniors . this corresponds to a percentage of 10 % . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , the seniors of the 1.8@@ 03 was caused by a total of 11.@@ 850 accidents . &quot;
&quot; thus , their share rose to 17,@@ 7 % . &quot;
&quot; while the number of accidents has fallen overall , the proportion of seniors caused in the same period has risen in the same period . &quot;
&quot; the non @-@ mentioned re@@ por@@ ter put in the published version of the article comments to light , which show which prejudi@@ ces are some Japanese apparently against older drivers : &quot;
&quot; the article on Yahoo on the translation errors , the following comments received : &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; ) about not the reality ? &quot;
&quot; - &quot; How faul@@ ty is the translation not at all , or ? &quot;
- &quot; I don &apos;t find that this is a real translation error .
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so common in all Asia
translation errors are widely used in Japan and Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a real foundations for these bizarre mistakes in English .

the reasons for the wide distribution of transl@@ ators are mani@@ fold .
&quot; for example , you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the starting text and to transfer an active language skills to transfer him into the target language . &quot;
&quot; the latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is in case of native language . in general , the conviction that transl@@ ators in the target language - not in the language language - native language should be . &quot;
&quot; in this case , a French speakers should be translated into French translation from English - not from French in English . &quot;
photo of Flick@@ r @-@ User Karl Bar@@ on .
&quot; many Japanese companies do not employ workers with English as mother tongue , the translations into English . this may seem to learn comprehen@@ sible for the over@@ set , cost reasons or the relatively small number of English native speakers , the Japanese . &quot;
&quot; some companies who do not have any foreign employees , translations are still being employed persons . then , the Japanese staff , whose English knowledge is made to be the best , as the transl@@ ator - no matter how good or bad his voice knowledge really are . &quot;
photo of Flick@@ r @-@ User Karl Bar@@ on .
machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
&quot; the wor@@ r@@ alled and r@@ aff@@ able propositions , which emerge by machine translations , show that this technique can still be replaced by no human transl@@ ators . this is true for some languages . &quot;
&quot; some of the most sel@@ fish English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the r@@ aff@@ ection@@ ate prints , which often uses T @-@ shirts or po@@ ckets , are used only for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or not understood either . &quot;
photo of Flick@@ r @-@ User Joseph Br@@ ent .
&quot; translation errors may be acceptable as jewelry still acceptable or at least harmless . but by large companies or by the government , which have the means to ensure higher standards , you can expect more careful translation . &quot;
&quot; in the future , the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a serious source for its translations . &quot;
Venezuela : protests and customs measures on the Internet and television

&quot; on Friday morning , April 7th , mel@@ ted ven@@ ian Internet users , that they could not have access to the Online Sender Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay . &quot;

&quot; the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated version of a report of Kur@@ tural , which is published by Global Vo@@ ices , with friendly permission of the authors . &quot;
&quot; the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ elas que &apos; ( &quot; F@@ ight cows , exp@@ iry schools &quot; ) who is edited by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America and re@@ published . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ enga lived eight years in a household , in which they did not work together with the family who lived there , eat . &quot;
&quot; shortly before their studies degree at the University she returned to the house again , and heard , as the owner of the house rejo@@ iced with pride about them . &quot; she is like a daughter for us . &quot;
&quot; that has become something , &quot; she said . &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ enga was never treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she became ten years old , she began to work as cri@@ cket for the family . as Cri@@ ad@@ itas , one referred to in Paraguay is the more than 46.@@ 000 boys and girls who are forced to work to school . &quot;
&quot; the business is quite simple : a large family with little money passes their min@@ il@@ old son or her min@@ il@@ old daughter to another , abundant family . in exchange , the child receives food , a training and a roof over the head . &quot;
&quot; however , what is not mentioned here is that the children must afford to pay countless days of house@@ work , which can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all this within the context of a contract you cannot stand up . &quot;
&quot; this is known as cri@@ mp &apos;s practice in Paraguay , due to participation and acceptance by large sections of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organizations . &quot;
&quot; after completing her studies , Al@@ var@@ enga worked a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of the boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; she spoke with Cri@@ ad@@ itas , especially young girls , are affected by the practice of cri@@ tique - sam@@ pled witness , resear@@ ched and p@@ ran@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; she tried to name things in the name , as the feeling of gratitude that is vacc@@ inated the cri@@ tic itas , guaranteed in general still silent . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ enga . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , the family , who are her daughter in the faith that they will complete their training to improve their position in society and make something out of itself &quot; &quot; to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family that takes up the girl with their faith and justi@@ fies its exploitation with faith that they would not get a chance that otherwise no training would receive , and maybe even star@@ ving . &quot;
the victims of Cri@@ me
&quot; if the girl is mis@@ ed , his family will experience only many years later . &quot;
sometimes they never experience them .
&quot; in January 2016 , the so far was relatively un@@ familiar phenomenon which takes place in the secret in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , but a face . &quot;
&quot; when Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n was placed in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº in hospital , her body showed traces of fier@@ ce blo@@ ws . shortly afterwards she died . &quot;
she was 14 years old .
she was cri@@ ad@@ ita in the household of the former Mil@@ ar@@ ran@@ ean Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ ejo which works as official in the inhabitants of the population .
&quot; Mar@@ Ã­n lived in her house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ Ã­a , a small place with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometres east of the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 Fer@@ rei@@ ra suggested as long as a stick on Mar@@ Ã­n , until they suffered fatal injury . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
some days later the media reported about the incident .
they stressed that the mur@@ dered child was a cri@@ cket .
organizations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made deep in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ish society the cri@@ ed practice of cri@@ tique responsible for the death of the girl .
it highlighted the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came to protest and demanded that there will be no further Carolina &apos; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widely used in the social media .
&quot; in Paraguay are more cows than children registered , &quot; said Tina Al@@ var@@ enga . &quot;
without papers it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
&quot; without official documents it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live . &quot;
the neighbours of the married and almost 60 civil society organisations called for a trained study of the case .
they want Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ ejo for the murder of the girl who was sentenced to 30 years imprisonment .
&quot; if the case comes before judgment , the case of Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n could be rich@@ es - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay is a case of cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go to court . &quot;
the daily life of a cri@@ cket
the Cri@@ ad@@ itas will not only be exploited as labour force ; they also live isolated from other girls at their age .
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ enga was ten years old when his father worked , I had to register and lost her father his work . &quot;
&quot; your brothers now had to work all and started to sell on the street , or on the market sweets to earn money . &quot;
but they all went on to school .
only Tina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ on in the capital As@@ unci@@ on .
in the house of her employer Al@@ var@@ enga worked between four and six hours every day .
&quot; in doing so , she had to share the time so that you still have time to learn . &quot;
she stood up at five o &apos;clock every morning and prepared the breakfast for their employer .
&quot; for example , puri@@ fying them the fridge , p@@ ave the living room , polished the furniture and des@@ erted the ground . &quot;
&quot; when the school was at the end , she went back home and had time to learn . &quot;
&quot; the more she was finished with learning , the more free time she had . &quot;
but also this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employer .
&quot; Al@@ var@@ enga says she had never been hungry , but was also not un@@ bound@@ ed . &quot; I was allowed to catch more books from the library of the landlord as a meal from the refrigerator . &quot;
&quot; the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party which was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 . &quot;

he tried to persu@@ ade them to convince the reports of the official media on the regime of the dict@@ ator .
&quot; he held them for intelligent , but was not held with her . &quot; the landlord had found someone who spoke , while he spoke about politics , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t allowed me to visit my family , because they were the opinion that I would learn there again &quot; bad habit . &quot; so they said that Al@@ var@@ enga belongs to the indigenous group of Guar@@ an@@ Ã­ , home to their native language Guar@@ an@@ Ã­ . &quot;
&quot; they feared their Lord , that they had the formation that they had made their way to lose . &quot;
&quot; however , it was totally clear that they had paid for everything they had been paid by them , with their hard work . &quot;
&quot; also in the school Al@@ var@@ enga is discrimin@@ ated . &quot; one thing , about which almost never been spoken , are har@@ ass@@ ment and the sli@@ ders that are exposed to the school . &quot;
&quot; because the other children of parents have , recognize them immediately that anyone who has no parents , has a cri@@ cket . &quot;
I was able to invite anyone to my home . I had no friends in school or in the neighborhood .
&quot; in my youth , at the time where friend@@ ships arise , I felt particularly clear that I belonged to any group . &quot;
&quot; the isolation was the worst of all , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ enga . &quot;
the Society cheap the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group , in which one can show actu@@ ality for cleaning personnel and children &apos;s ma@@ ids in Paraguay . &quot;
the administr@@ ator of the group is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a town of As@@ unci@@ on in the district of As@@ unci@@ on . &quot;
hello ! I am looking for a small companion for my little daughter who plays in the morning and in the afternoon with her .
to learn .
please mel@@ ed you .
&quot; starting from Monday , if possible . &quot;
the ad got five &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the village Ã@@ em@@ by wrote that she would have had a hot @-@ year girl and gave her telephone number .
&quot; another woman who also came from Ã@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; wrote it . &quot;
&quot; in the third comment was written by &quot; a girl from the inland , that would like to work . &quot;
then the fi@@ denti@@ als presented in the display once again :
&quot; dear girl@@ friends , I found a found . I see if it works with her . &quot;
&quot; thanks , I write again when something is . &quot;
the business was completed .
in the Pro@@ log to the report Cri@@ ad@@ itas , Â¿ H@@ asta cu@@ Ã¡n@@ do ? &quot;
&quot; ( Cri@@ ad@@ itas , how long still ? ) , a collection of witness , former Cri@@ ad@@ itas , writes or@@ ti@@ z : &quot;
&quot; in the course of our history we managed to dis@@ assemble systems such as slavery , Cu@@ Ã±@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the early history of Paraguay ) , the Con@@ qu@@ ist@@ ad@@ ores , the women of Guar@@ an@@ Ã­ had to be considered ) and the native population of Men@@ s@@ Ãº ( which took part in a system of slavery from which they become easy victims for abuse and exploitation . &quot;
the social inequality in Paraguay and the show of power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as cri@@ mp &apos;s phenomenon .
legislation to register Egyptian users of social media to register with government
picture of Pix@@ el@@ ay changes from Global Vo@@ ices .
published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
sixty Egyptian Par@@ li@@ ament@@ ary parliament@@ arians have recently voted a bill for &quot; regul@@ ators with respect to the use and utility of social networks . &quot;
&quot; if he is accepted by the Parliament , user will need to register to users and users of social media in Egypt with a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the law would then be set up a place , which is com@@ promised to give citizens a permission to give social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months of acceptance of the law , user will need to register to users and users on the site of the site with their proper names and personnel numbers to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; if it is dre@@ amed of doing this , that could be a penalty of up to six months in prison or a money . &quot;
&quot; the bill , which consists of six Par@@ agr@@ arians , and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defined social media as &quot; each application that runs via the Internet and is used to communicate with others through voice , video , and text . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear how the law is being en@@ forced if there is no indication of how Egyptian authorities cannot place the user &apos;s user . unclear is how they do not register the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not able to address the regulation on the level of social media companies .
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , Parliament of parliament and promot@@ er of the legislation , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a user name and a password to come through fire@@ wall , the Facebook blocked . &quot;
&quot; this could mean that Egypt is planning to establish a fire@@ wall at national level around Facebook . because of those , it would be required for the Egyptians and Egyptians to be able to access their identity . &quot;
&quot; however , it is not known that such plans are made . &quot;
experts on site are scep@@ tical regarding the technical feasi@@ bility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research T@@ echnolog@@ ist ( in German &quot; &quot; conduc@@ tive scientists &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
&quot; I am greatly interested in the technical capacities and understanding , neither authority in Egypt regarding things that have to do with technology . &quot;
&quot; in my opinion , they imagine that same as they are able to control the physical public and private spaces it could also be done online . &quot;
&quot; if I take them seriously , then this means that they are set up a strong surveillance system to exchange citizens who request a licence or not . and this means a rever@@ ent system to monitor the activities of the people and also to lead them to a court process . &quot;
this is not by no means realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; to be adopted as law , the draft must first be discussed at the legislative Parliament and the constitutional committees before it comes to the plenary debate . &quot;
&quot; whether his acceptance and enforcement is successful or not , the draft is to be maxim@@ ized with a pro @-@ military mind within the parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ised and assured that no devi@@ ation is present on the image surface , says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;
&quot; last year , the parliament@@ arians of Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ ha@@ wy proposed a legislative situation against cy@@ ber crime in which a lifetime sentence for those intended to be found guilty to thre@@ aten the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; protest to protest . &quot; &quot;

&quot; this contribution from To@@ dd Reu@@ bold , published in the original at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that deals with international environmental protection solutions . this article will be published here as part of an agreement to content sharing . &quot;
high up in the mountains of Kur@@ dist@@ an in the northeast of Iraq work the Ti@@ ersch@@ utz@@ er H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza and her team of scientists of the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq to protect the spiritual Persian leop@@ ards .
&quot; a sub@@ type of the larger family of leop@@ ards that goes through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian Leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . overall , it is between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are due to Wil@@ der@@ ei , the loss and the frag@@ mentation of their habitat and as they are always less pre@@ y . &quot;
why is this particular kind of leop@@ ards so important ?
&quot; as R@@ aza shows in the video , &quot; the Persian Leopard is the only remaining boot@@ y in the Kur@@ dish ecos@@ ystem &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecos@@ ystem also depends that a large rob@@ ber is present . &quot;
&quot; the chance to see a Persian Leop@@ ards really in the free wild way is low and goes against zero . as the team in the video , that she shows a recording of a large cat at the camera , breaks R@@ aza into pure joy . &quot;
&quot; as a trained Bi@@ olog@@ in shows R@@ aza passionate , a different side of their country , which consists not only of war and conflict . &quot;
it has been involved in field studies for six years to wild animals and in educational programs of Nature Iraq .
it has been a member of IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group and is committed to that protective zones for wild animals in the Kur@@ dist@@ an area .

&quot; in early March 2017 , documented in the North East Japanese daily Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o , the progress made in recent six years to rebuild the life of those who had been hit by the &quot; Trinity catastrophe &quot; &quot; of March 2011 . a violent earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima had triggered the disaster . &quot;
&quot; the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung has its headquarters in S@@ end@@ ai , which is in the pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . the pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was a et@@ y@@ pre@@ fecture of Japan on the northeast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami . &quot;
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring bo@@ ilers of Fu@@ kus@@ hima and Iv@@ ate were forced to disappear all the coastal cities of the map .
&quot; even this was the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima a nuclear accident , already alone , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes . &quot;
the Special report of the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o shows from local view which progress has been reached six years to rebuild the lives of the local resident .
the detailed report of the newspaper contains both statistics of the Japanese re@@ building Authority and survey results of those affected by themselves .
&quot; apartment building in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and Iv@@ ate
&quot; the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned spare @-@ houses ( or in a solo , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were finished in the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and Iw@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures could draw Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , here , 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed . &quot;
&quot; Iw@@ ate has 75 percent of such houses finished , while at Fu@@ kus@@ hima with 70 percent of the final light . &quot;
&quot; at least six years after the catastrophe , evac@@ u@@ ated by base accommodation ( or in a , cas@@ ets@@ u ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in final spare parts . &quot;
after the triple @-@ fold catastrophe almost 80 000 people were forced to live in accommodation facilities .
&quot; in December 2016 , 36 000 people lived from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and Iv@@ ate in such containers . &quot;
&quot; nearly 40 percent of the year 2011 evac@@ u@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima still live in emergency accommodation , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was successful . more than 75 percent of the evac@@ u@@ ated , which was settled after the disaster in Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ wald , were populated in final houses . &quot;
&quot; for Iv@@ ate , the number is here at 34 percent . &quot;
the state of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ fecture
&quot; as the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o paper was able to determine 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools which have been affected by the un@@ happiness , their doors can be opened up to December 2016 , which makes almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ fecture . &quot;
&quot; six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ fecture is far more difficult . &quot;
&quot; while nearly 100 percent of the fishing har@@ bours at Iv@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now back in operation , in Fu@@ kus@@ hima only 30 percent of the fisher@@ y har@@ bours its operation . &quot;
&quot; the ts@@ un@@ ami and the atom@@ iz@@ er of the atomic accident , have moved in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agricultural large @-@ scale . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 percent of the A@@ cker@@ country in Iv@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed old A@@ cker@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of nuclear , because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares are destroyed by Fu@@ kus@@ hima disaster in the &quot; &quot; nuclear zone &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has largely recovered , but even here Fu@@ kus@@ hima still remains back . &quot;
&quot; the tourist office in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and Iw@@ ates are more than 90 percent at the same stand , just as before the un@@ happiness . Fu@@ kus@@ hima can be found here only 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ newspaper also reports that since disaster was almost half of the coastal people , it &apos;s more difficult to earn their living . &quot;
is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
&quot; in order to determine a total picture , the newspaper led numerous surveys among the native population and among the evac@@ u@@ ated by . she asked them about the status of re@@ building and also how their recep@@ tion@@ ists have changed to the ts@@ un@@ ami risk . &quot;
in the introduction of the article explains the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung :
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o led a survey conducted by the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the native population in experience .
&quot; the survey brought that 8@@ 3.1 % of the local residents , measures taken to be prepared to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is . &quot;
&quot; however , 55.@@ 9 percent of the respon@@ dents find that still not enough in terms of disasters prevention has been done . &quot;
&quot; as it stands for those who had to be evac@@ u@@ ated from the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima &quot;
&quot; in its output to the anniversary of the earthquake , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung also has directed its attention to the situation of evac@@ u@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ hima had not only had to experience the enormous earthquake and devast@@ ating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima was also a witness of the worst , cat@@ astroph@@ ism , atom@@ iz@@ ers , the Japan ever had . &quot;
&quot; from 160 000 evac@@ uation of Fu@@ kus@@ hima were published almost 63 000 people in areas outside the pre@@ fecture . &quot;
&quot; early 2016 was somewhat more than 23 000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; after the state of 2017 , still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hima outside their home pre@@ fecture . &quot;
&quot; in the cat@@ astroph@@ ism , most of the evac@@ u@@ ated areas are still over 50 years old . they have to return in real containers , because the efforts for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Iv@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima have to compete with massive construction projects . this is part of the Olympic Games that will be held in Tokyo by 2020 . &quot;
the world is small : our Pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
&quot; when one encounters people from other countries that speak a different language , the differences seem to be greater than the simil@@ arities . &quot;
&quot; after a while , one often recognis@@ es that one more links than it seems at first sight . &quot;
&quot; these global connections are important as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces to expand our perspectives , and remember that the world ultimately is very small . &quot;
&quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look at exactly these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we treat themes that often get less attention in coverage than they deserve . &quot;
&quot; we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices Members , who remember a moment in which she felt very strongly linked with someone over language and country boundaries . &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ te Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the simil@@ arities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ ite , such as the love of music worked for Iranian culture ; Viol@@ eta Camar@@ asa speaks about the time , where she worked with people from all over the world ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences which he has collected in a small village in Madagascar . &quot;

a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered this week into the Inten@@ sive station : last Friday gave him a police officers during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with a stroke against the head . nation@@ wide took part millions of demonstr@@ ators in a protest against austerity .
&quot; Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , studied the social sciences at the Bundes@@ univers@@ itÃ¤t Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s , has suffered a sk@@ ull @-@ shepherd &apos;s trau@@ ma and several fresh@@ ness . &quot;
doctors op@@ ted him this Saturday and now put it into an artificial com@@ a .
his condition is regarded as critical .
&quot; the local image journalist Lu@@ iz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which quickly spread themselves in Brazil within a few days . &quot;
&quot; on the images there is also the face of the police officers , who identified with a stroke . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o . &quot;
&quot; after the incident , the military police officers in the Brazilian state Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o have been sus@@ pen@@ ed until the conclusion of the investigation of the incident occurring on the active service . &quot;
the pictures show the police officers in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with his stroke on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra ( Photos : Lu@@ iz da Luz ) .
&quot; would land a police officers on a prot@@ esters and land on the intensive care station , his face would be seen six months on TV and the whole oppression would be justified . &quot;
&quot; the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ ne@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , shared by Lu@@ iz da Luz , distributed by Lu@@ iz da Luz , in which one sees like Mat@@ eus by the police officers , and several san@@ itation were attacked shortly afterwards . &quot;
&quot; another video with the same scenes , but from a different perspective is also recorded in social networks . &quot;
in the below clip you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
&quot; for the family of Mat@@ eus who lives in another federal state , Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazilian re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 euro ) , in order to stay a part of the cost of medical treatment and to stay in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia while he is in hospital . &quot;

on Facebook Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s in memory :
&quot; Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s experiences a wave of political force : here , the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me Irish was killed in secondary school , because he has been attacked the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . and now we have been attacked the very sad case by Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who has been attacked by a polic@@ emen , who has been attacked with a stroke . &quot;
police gri@@ ps
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s was not the only state in Brazil where Friday was brutal police officers came against prot@@ esters .
polic@@ emen sat at protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had built a stage for speakers , rubber and sad@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; the representative Fl@@ avi@@ o Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police via l@@ oud@@ speakers to refrain from violence against demonstr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country . &quot;
&quot; once again , the Brazilian media street prot@@ rac@@ ed by having the focus on a different , unexpected prot@@ agon@@ ists : a window . &quot;
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported specifically about a cerem@@ onial glass window to make use of a photo their title pages illustr@@ ative .
&quot; on the contrary , the O Glob@@ o preferred a title story with a brand built in the brand . &quot;
&quot; there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason , more about a broken window disc than about the protests of thousands of people who serve the defence of a special cause . &quot;
&quot; this one has to recognize , if one is strictly opposed to any form of affairs . &quot;
&quot; also here the term &quot; &quot; Vand@@ alism &quot; &quot; receives a absur@@ di@@ ous meaning , and the typical non @-@ violence of the military police are derived through head@@ lines with the title &quot; demonstr@@ ators on con@@ front@@ ational relationship with the police &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the in@@ duced villages in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Ã@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso close to the doors of the law of Ã@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso in all Cuba the doors ( Foto : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the Municip@@ ality of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cub@@ an province of May@@ ab@@ que , is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar@@ mill - regardless of that there is no n@@ enn@@ able sugar @-@ harv@@ ested on site . &quot;
it is two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane factories were laid .
&quot; after the awakening the sugar industry stood still in the region , and the factory lost after and after its installations , until only the smells of steel and concrete remained . &quot;
about 272 workers had to find themselves new .
some are rare the work .
&quot; other res@@ ig@@ ni@@ fied and s@@ add@@ ling daily to the factories , which still crus@@ hed . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an , which is open every day at 4 : 00 am in the morning , the crisis in the sugar industry does not smoke its sleep . &quot;
&quot; he heard that in the east of the sugar cane factories , which have been in operation after a long in@@ active time , because they have been preserved . &quot;
that was something that he did not expect .
&quot; N@@ ene is exactly heard that in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich would be obtained the sugar cane factory , but the promise was not kept . &quot;
&quot; the sugar industry has already been resist@@ ed the pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , the low market prices , the in@@ effic@@ ien@@ cies , the poor administrative decisions and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , the production was 1,6 million tons of sugar , less than the 1910 produced . &quot;
&quot; the message would have been a motive for a few decades ago for the country , but the bad harvest have already been a novel@@ ty anymore . &quot;
why was the Cub@@ an sugar@@ s ?
the old train stations of the community had already seen better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically out@@ dated , and hardly competitive they were un@@ sustainable for the country . &quot;
the initial idea was to focus production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tonnes . &quot;
they left only the factories that can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 euros ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
&quot; the motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar plant@@ ations , and the sugar rise in the world market . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the sugar price rose from about a decade ago . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 to 2025 the price of un@@ refined sugar between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pounds remain , according to the 2016 &quot; &quot; Agricultural Information &quot; &quot; of the OECD and the FAO , the Agricultural and Food Organization of the United Nations . &quot;
&quot; if the current production of 2001 would reach the level of 2001 ( 3,@@ 6 million tons ) , the commodity export would manage about 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; today the first words of the Cub@@ an President F@@ ide@@ l Castro came into history during his speech on October 21 , 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
&quot; from there , the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry . &quot;
&quot; in the following years the stand@@ still came from a total of 98 sugar@@ s , over 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further training . &quot;
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Arl@@ Ã©e Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto PÃ©@@ rez worked since 1967 in the factory .
&quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , about the closing of the factory , the word he is repeated on most , &quot; fraud . &quot;

first Nations young people use Hip Hop to express themselves and get its own culture
recording of a song by &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy scar@@ rows First nation .
photo uses permission of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an .
&quot; people of the First Nations communities across Canada are dealing with topics , which are important for them . they do this by Hip Hop , thanks to a number of hiking workshops . &quot;
&quot; as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an @-@ Tour since 2014 , since 2014 workshop participants bring mobile audio studios directly to schools and youth centres in order to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live appearances . &quot;
the original workshops were headed by the ped@@ ago@@ gues David Ho@@ dges which lives in Montreal and worked in North @-@ Quebec with ten C@@ ree communities and then worked together with the C@@ ree Hip Hop @-@ hop @-@ Group The North@@ stars .
&quot; the workshop continues to increase the young participants in discussions as &quot; cultural identity , language , discussion , love , self acceptance , or whatever it comes to mind . &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the main actors .
&quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winn@@ eb@@ ago in the U.S. state Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ yo@@ o tells us in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , the Highway of the Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of the tears , &quot; in which almost two dozen people were killed or mur@@ dered by almost two dozen young women . &quot;
the cases were largely un@@ explained .
&quot; the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka C@@ ree First Nation uses the mot@@ if of a video player to convey , how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs , despite the influences of globalisation . &quot;
&quot; many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , though the young people did not always control the languages of the First Nations . &quot;
&quot; in the following song , that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i C@@ ree First Nation have been recorded , the chor@@ us is sung to C@@ ree . &quot;
the young people involved got a little help from Gary Jol@@ ly from the North@@ stars Hip Hop @-@ Group who gave them a st@@ rop@@ he in the dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay C@@ ree .
&quot; on the Fac@@ ebook@@ page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an , the st@@ rop@@ he is at your disposal , as a translation into English , which is translated into German here : &quot;
sometimes I feel as if nobody would ever be interested in myself
but I try to go on earth for my days
&quot; that is the day , where you will get our cry &quot;
because we have lost our way in life as a youth
but I believe that we will rise to one day
I don &apos;t want to see how to live a bad life
this is how they can grow and approach our youth
&quot; so , they can do that , what they are determined by the Creator . &quot;

in Japan you can see almost every restaurant plastic dishes .
&quot; to show potential customers , which is exactly on the menu , are located near the entrance sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( for walks of a , &quot; &quot; plastic models of the dishes &quot; ) of any food , which is served in this restaurant . &quot;
customers look at these plastic dishes and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
&quot; in the to@@ ki@@ y district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a variety of these small companies that manufacture the German fil@@ mm@@ akers Wim Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago . &quot;
&quot; for most of Japan these plastic dishes are so usually that they don &apos;t even fix them once more . a new trend , however , it turns into show@@ y cell accessories and other gad@@ gets . &quot;
&quot; with Nav@@ er Mat@@ ome , the blog@@ ger published series of social media links and photos , which show this unusual tw@@ ist with the sho@@ ku@@ hin @-@ pur@@ u . &quot;
&quot; now in the special sale : new with plastic sty@@ led cell phone rings , as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ yu Kauf@@ haus . &quot;
&quot; many of these artificial foods have been turned to kit@@ eline , as in this case , cooling boards : &quot;
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ hin cool@@ ers mag@@ net for a new exhibition in Tokyo .
the new boom of the Essen@@ ces is becoming more and more complex .
in this case a col@@ ais@@ en @-@ don ( a popular fri@@ ght bowl with seafood ) turned into a cell phone .
we have found a good use for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lol ) we found a good use as a mobile phone .
we have also manufactured this part for the exhibition in Tokyo .
and here is an apple that ret@@ ains your mobile phone :
&quot; designed to watch out like an apple , with a candle for mobile phone , this is already a great design . &quot;
and that is only the beginning of an increasing flight .
&quot; some phone t@@ apes and mobile phone @-@ designers allow you to manufacture your own artwork . in this case i@@ kur@@ a or salmon are used , a popular T@@ opping that is served with white rice . &quot;
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
&quot; is there someone who would say : &quot; Wow , cool , now I can dict@@ ate my mobile phone with salmon ? &quot;
I think I will probably be the Only .
&quot; this interest in plastic court can also take a less appe@@ tizing form to surprise , for example colleagues or family members . &quot;
our latest mobile phone rings has the shape of mel@@ ting ice .
&quot; in addition , there are also travel balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , ear@@ rings and hand@@ y@@ bands from dried salmon . &quot;
&quot; further sk@@ ur@@ ri@@ le plastic dishes can be found at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Nav@@ er Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter at the has@@ ht@@ ag # , there is in a place of walks . &quot;
&quot; if you would like to know more about the origin of this trends , then this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , dedicated to the popularity of the restaurant industry . &quot;
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually produced .
a Mexican project tells the stories of the survi@@ vor@@ s of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the fight against drug dealers . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; in reports in@@ - and foreign media about the famous &quot; struggle against drug trading &quot; in Mexico , the suspic@@ ion and sol@@ dered regularly occurs only in statistics . however , they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy , which brings this struggle with itself . &quot;
&quot; the coverage of drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ Ã¡n , the chief of Sin@@ alo@@ a @-@ Kart@@ ell , conducted the stories of the victims of the conflict completely in the background . &quot;
&quot; on the day after a violent incident , there is hardly any one look at the grape or the commun@@ es that have learned to live with pain . &quot;
&quot; we stand behind every body , behind each bone , behind each bone , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wo@@ unds might never heal . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the Mexican @-@ based portal Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico the digital project &quot; &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; with drug trading live &quot; &quot; ) to give these victims one voice should give the struggle between the criminal authorities and cart@@ els . &quot;
animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico describes the project so :
organised crime leaves us not only to fear our lives .
the effects are far more profound .
&quot; for example , if business close , because they are threatened by drug retailers and all municipalities have to drive many kilometers to buy something like milk . &quot;
pain of victims
a video with the title &quot; vi@@ das que cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; how fear life changed &quot; ) tells exactly these stories .
&quot; a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father , who married every weekend of gra@@ ves after his son . &quot;
&quot; or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ Ã­@@ guez , who lost in just one day her father , their four brothers , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ew . &quot;
&quot; Pri@@ est : &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves today again for the task we have put , go and go to gra@@ ves , after the people we loved to seek . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Contr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Contr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 as he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electrical business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on October 13th he left the house .
&quot; on October 15th he should be back again , but he never came back . Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it is very hard for me , because I am alone with three children who need a training . &quot;
&quot; there is also my mother , which is also here with me . &quot;
at the moment it has no income .
&quot; you are standing the insurance of my Father , but that does not get paid , because they require a ster@@ ery . &quot;
where should we get there ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vi@@ vir con el nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; we do not only have to show the faces of those who fear itself . we must show the international community of conflicts , the br@@ ittle and the state . &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high risk @-@ areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reading of Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the federal state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in Central Mexican . &quot;
&quot; your contribution remind us that violence should never be considered to be normal , no matter what type of it occurs : &quot;
now I know the disease and Sens@@ ory journ@@ alism I have been doing now for some years now .
I come past every day and see the cover pages with images which actually only come from a textbook for crimin@@ ology or from ac@@ claimed specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
&quot; sometimes I feel as if I am the fl@@ avor@@ ful , the sho@@ vel or sad . it appears as a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to this body once . &quot;
I cannot be equal to this or consider it as normal .
she writes further :
&quot; no , it is not normal that my 10 @-@ year C@@ ousin thinks he will be ( German : drug dealers ) if it is great . and it is also not normal that people listen to the &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; of the offen@@ ders if they go through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me , that &apos;s why they would have lost those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that they have happened to them too . &quot;
I see our weakness if stories about mere numbers in a statisti@@ c .
&quot; the in@@ som@@ nia of the people is incredibly good for me , if the death of six people and the dis@@ appearances of 43 students were justified in a neigh@@ b@@ ort so that they were . &quot;
&quot; I think they are trying to in@@ scri@@ be that they are spar@@ ed by such trag@@ e@@ dies , if they are not touching and silent . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the post &quot; Four months Er@@ press@@ ors in the main town district : as a family had covered with dr@@ ones , until they had destroyed money from their business until the end , not only the business was destroyed , but also their family apart . &quot;
you think of everything you have lost and how many people can change your whole life in just a few days .
&quot; pain that doesn &apos;t go , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes back again , if you are alone . &quot;
habits have changed , phone numbers too . &quot;
just contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the more we are removed from each other , the better . &quot;
it included their report with words :
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , because they don &apos;t know when they will cause you or kill you . &quot;
&quot; I asked myself in these terrible days , if wines would dis@@ solve my profound feelings , but the answers is no , because I have forgotten how to cri@@ es . I must learn to live with pain . &quot;
&quot; the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ Ã©r@@ rez Vega published the post &quot; &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez : one of violence referred to . &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions like : who takes care of the child of a mixed woman and a man who was killed by organised crime ?
how is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
&quot; he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents take care of them . &quot;
&quot; br@@ yan is a Wa@@ ise and he tells you had to teach yourself how to make a egg coo@@ ks , tor@@ till@@ as warm and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies which makes with him . this is his name for the preparation of the flush with water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he tells of the nine s@@ cars on his left leg - one for every year &apos;s life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for all the life of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
&quot; when he was five years old , one told him that his mother disappeared . &quot;
&quot; but this was not the day , in which his childhood ended . &quot;
&quot; his childhood has been over two years earlier , when he saw only a few blocks from his home , who saw bloody suffering from his father , who was shot by armed men from a passing car . &quot;
&quot; when br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez looked like this : &quot;
br@@ yan was born in 2006 as violence by organised crime and the struggle against the existing social problems in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez in 2006 .
&quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of governments for public safety and government of the United States . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 alone , the prosec@@ utor of the Prosec@@ utor of 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to the inc@@ ision 8,5 Mor@@ den per day . &quot;
&quot; these are just a few of the hundred thousand stories , which leaves organised crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country . &quot;
only a few stories are still living in the face of new head@@ lines . but this project reminds us of those that we are not allowed to forget .
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ en@@ a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; , &quot; Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico 2015 launched the data journ@@ alism project nar@@ co@@ data , whose aim is to present the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trading , which has tor@@ mented the country in the last four decades . &quot;
when a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; &quot; of Flick@@ r @-@ User Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ strÃ¶m ( CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ ARN@@ ING : this post and the sides to which he linked , contain images , on which violence is represented . &quot;
&quot; the fact check is important in one moment , in which it is about to lift up a ru@@ m@@ ation or fal@@ si@@ fy a f@@ ake . &quot;
&quot; but what happened after the first time the first time has appeared ? content in social media , no matter whether true or un@@ true , t@@ ends to exist . &quot;
let &apos;s take this photo of a terrible accident in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) .
&quot; since its first release , it was mis@@ leading to prevent trag@@ e@@ dies , which actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this false cop@@ ing of image and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; fal@@ scher context &quot; in the termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dr@@ aft News - deny not the fact that there is plenty of careful reporting about events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
it raises questions about our desire for pictures to News .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
&quot; in 2010 , a petrol station covered the place S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , ki@@ pp@@ ie around and explo@@ ded . thereby , 230 people came to live . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war , Africa has neglected two largest country for years and thus managed . the streets in the region have become dangerous paths full of stroke , which were difficult to drive . &quot;
&quot; typically , the tank @-@ carriage fell to the victim . &quot;
&quot; administration representatives described a fire@@ ball , the du@@ ous houses covered including a movie near , which was full of people who was vi@@ vid the soccer world . &quot;
houses mixed and plated cor@@ p@@ ses in the streets scattered .
many people were burned to un@@ mistak@@ able .
&quot; a picture with the title &quot; This is Nigeria &quot; . &quot; from the Im@@ g@@ ur @-@ User My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12 January 2015 multiple photos of the incident constitute the gr@@ en@@ ous scenes of this day . &quot;
above is an example .
&quot; it features rows of engra@@ ved body , which are on the floor , while people look at them . &quot;
but here the story does not find their end .
&quot; over the years the same photo has been raised several times on social media , blogs and other platforms , but not related to trag@@ e@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what not happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 fighters of Bok@@ o Har@@ am the remote villages B@@ aga and Dor@@ o Go@@ won .
ey@@ e@@ witnesses reported dramatically of atro@@ cities before they had to fl@@ ee .
houses and shops were burned down and cor@@ rid@@ ors were burned in streets and cer@@ eal .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were mass@@ ac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; but the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; no one remained back to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; said a inhabitants on Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; many were broken , shot or burned . &quot;
&quot; only from satellite images , the follow @-@ up could be displayed . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the attack was also un@@ explained , but the army base in B@@ aga was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt at Bok@@ o Har@@ am , Land to win ( examples from the year 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot;
&quot; and here , the picture of the DR Congo turned back to be seen as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack : &quot;
this is Nigeria .
a mass@@ acre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
you are not Charlie .
you are dead .
&quot; in fact , this ab@@ used use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of mis@@ ten@@ ders ; Africa Check has documented immigration regulations to Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
in all of these cases the picture was taken as a cover for mass@@ acres .
&quot; yet another step further bring personal comments such as this example , the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in relation to supply arguments . &quot;
the picture of S@@ ange also came in conjunction with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a flash message , published by the United Nations , those who were able to fl@@ ee the blo@@ ws , rape and several t@@ aves , some by burning . &quot;
&quot; while others reported by the violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya reported Po@@ sts , like the following on which these descriptions have brought together with photos from the DR Congo : &quot;
&quot; this picture comes from an sau@@ di @-@ Arab world @-@ hand side , the 2012 mis@@ led , the President My@@ an@@ mar@@ s Th@@ a Being would have said , mon@@ ks and politicians would have been involved in the ass@@ ass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she used the picture from the DR Congo to all@@ evi@@ ate this information . &quot;
&quot; the original contribution to the least on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here . &quot;
&quot; other news organisations , the AF@@ P as their source , had also mis@@ diagnosed this statement , but had not associated with the image from the DR Congo . &quot;
the worldwide reach fal@@ sely data
traces of this wrong sounds are back to 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; using a &quot; &quot; returned picture search &quot; &quot; you can see how far information can exceed borders . &quot;
a revers@@ ed image search with the search@@ engine ink has found under 18,@@ 8 billion images ( date of 3 May 2017 ) 344 images found which are very similar to the previous image from the DR Congo .
&quot; they come from a mix@@ er private pages , platforms social media and community as well as national publications and are in many different languages like English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot;
&quot; some have for@@ warded wrong reports , others tried to ent@@ om@@ fy the f@@ eit@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; we have used examples for the ab@@ used use and associated with the respective countries , based on which side they were published . thus , we want to be more evident than through the language alone . &quot;
&quot; from the countries listed below ( which were also linked in some cases ) , several examples of abuse use can be used . &quot;
some cases that can now be split up yet completely ( on the map in orange ) :
map : News Fr@@ ames .
cartoon by false coupl@@ ings of the image from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
&quot; the orange @-@ made countries indicate pages or server , over the examples of counter@@ f@@ eit@@ ing or fal@@ seh@@ oods are still available . &quot;
&quot; the countries in Grau are examples , according to the met@@ ad@@ ata and information that are available via Tin@@ Eye , probably also counter@@ feit det@@ ectors . &quot;
&quot; as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) . &quot;
&quot; in Burma , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( directed at Alg@@ erian and interested Arabs ) as part of a Th@@ reads to the &quot; war of Budd@@ hist@@ s against Muslims . &quot;

&quot; Malaysia offers two extreme example of an ab@@ used use of the image from the DR Congo , with one hand a T@@ we@@ et , the sympathy opposite the Nig@@ erian mass@@ acre , and on the other hand the attempt to become a blog@@ gers , the asser@@ ting , as the photos used by it ab@@ used . &quot;

&quot; the government of Myanmar published an jud@@ gement on what they came as &quot; un@@ inten@@ tional news and photos , the international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings with regard to Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this jud@@ gement which is published exclusively in English , also contains references to counter@@ feit images of sc@@ af@@ folding boxes , used sp@@ ate Spe@@ ech and used by extrem@@ ist groups to set forth that Muslim Budd@@ hist@@ s kill and ander@@ ing ( what is often used by bur@@ mes@@ an nation@@ alists ) . &quot;

&quot; this post that directed itself to the members of the Russian Orthodox community , clearly indicates that the picture of the DR Congo is NOT to kill the Christians . &quot;
&quot; Saudi @-@ Arabia , 2012 / 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this after@@ glow , asser@@ ted that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein Being in 2012 have been given that mon@@ ks and politicians have been involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims , and brought the story to the picture . &quot;
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the image continues to be included .
&quot; Spain , 2015 / 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this article was published by 2014 on students , published by Bok@@ o Har@@ am , published by the Catholic side of An@@ Ã¡l@@ is@@ is Digital , has explicitly declared that the picture was not derived from the k@@ ill@@ ings but it claims that there is a &quot; similar d@@ schi@@ hadi@@ st attack &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when the picture later in connection with the mass@@ acre of Bok@@ o Har@@ am of 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to res@@ ist that there were connections to Nigeria . &quot;

&quot; the picture of the DR Congo is equipped with this t@@ wit@@ ter@@ has@@ ht@@ ag , and delet@@ es a discussion among Muslims after the mass@@ acre of Bok@@ o Har@@ am 2015 and the B@@ ags on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to achieve that their communities took these events , the mut@@ u@@ ity in the name of Islam , a greater attention . &quot;
&quot; United States , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; the picture was taken as proof for the mass@@ acre of Bok@@ o Har@@ am 2015 ( and more than 9.@@ 300 Male ret@@ we@@ es ) . but the messages that were associated with this , have been interven@@ ed in no religious context . &quot;
&quot; instead , the aim was to draw attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media reporting compensation compared to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
Vietnam ( Tunisi@@ an ) , 2014 . &quot;
&quot; after a message that alleg@@ edly been written by a &quot; &quot; P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ erian mass@@ acre , translated it discussion as this here in Vietnam and explained it to fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot;
&quot; from the message , in which the picture was derived from the DR Congo , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ iner Mission@@ aries and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; there are other confirmed examples of a faul@@ ty use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;
&quot; other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and pages in the following countries ( on the cap in Grau ) In@@ Eye also points out , but are no longer fully trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China . &quot;
( data entries with URLs and time / dat@@ ed@@ c@@ ach@@ et exist on the web cra@@ w@@ ler and se@@ aling them via picture dat@@ at@@ ames in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslim . )
&quot; in all of these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original un@@ gl@@ asting of 2010 , the image ultimately carries a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible . &quot;
frames and images
there are two powerful topics or frames ( fr@@ ame@@ dic@@ ations ) who focus these po@@ ckets . the first frame is focused on religion .
the photo was used in relation to larger discussions on silence in connection with the ass@@ ass@@ ination of Christians by Muslims or - for the defence of Muslims - the ass@@ ass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as through Budd@@ hist@@ s .
a second fr@@ aming uses the image to discuss how a African life is under@@ rated in comparison to a European or French life .
&quot; religion understand and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth to examine how images in connection with these efforts will be used . &quot;
&quot; however , a deeper question is what happens if readers cannot give this pictures any longer . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are tens of people who have uns@@ acci@@ dentally share the water around a tragedy . &quot;
&quot; suggest that mood of mis@@ - and mis@@ information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and decor@@ ates it the real crest of what actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and in Myanmar ? &quot;
the spread of violent images was already deb@@ ated in detail ( here for example ) .
an argument is that the back of images of a ref@@ us@@ al is coming to recognize the tragedy . sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves .
&quot; at the same time , concern that violent pictures and spect@@ ators are des@@ ensi@@ tizing and give them the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , who sought to act as violent media to help others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there is a lot of violent represent@@ ations in the news media , fact is fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reports . &quot;
&quot; T@@ echn@@ ologists experiment , because with algorithms to assist the fight against &quot; &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; . &quot; you will be able to think about situation in which a picture does something suggest , which actually is also dis@@ solved by the context or on completely ab@@ used manner . &quot;
&quot; however , an investigation of fal@@ sely vie@@ wers should also take into account as internationally as internationally . &quot;

the &quot; Un@@ transl@@ atable &quot; blog revealed the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy S@@ imm@@ ons uses according to CC BY @-@ N@@ D 2.0 license .
a blog with the name Un@@ transl@@ atable atable ( e.g. d@@ t. un@@ re@@ plac@@ eable ) attempts to offer language excited a selection of words from around the world which are difficult or not at all .
such words are available in every language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these im@@ plac@@ eable words are already well known today ( such as the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others who are rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ m@@ esa ) .
but all res@@ ist stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly every attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; a word or expression is not enough , why a complete explanation and sometimes something context is required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word . &quot;
these unique words have already been collected for a long time in an online list .
&quot; most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and Lingu@@ ine is by &quot; Un@@ transl@@ atable &quot; Steven Bird decided to concentrate on small languages . &quot;
in the blog you can find words from the Mw@@ ot@@ al language of V@@ anu@@ at@@ u as follows :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; &quot; - Bem@@ Ã¼@@ n you to receive your parents in recognition of how to try you in your younger years . &quot;
&quot; and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language , which are spoken in parts of Brazil as follows : &quot;
k@@ w@@ adi - The convenience or la@@ zin@@ ess that makes you feel after you have arous@@ ed cold days in the sun .
in Bir@@ ds own words from his blog About :
&quot; they de@@ ed other cultures , un@@ spoiled other mind@@ set and ar@@ ouse our new@@ gi@@ er@@ de . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you can influence the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page still want to publish more of these &quot; &quot; irre@@ plac@@ eable &quot; &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are . &quot;
&quot; Red@@ ner of the &quot; Treasure Langu@@ ages &quot; , &quot; which are very appreciated by the transl@@ ator , are invited to upload their favorite side here . &quot;

how Sri Lanka is dealing with the worst fl@@ ut@@ disaster of the decade
the island of Sri Lanka is at the moment the worst high @-@ water and natural disaster in this decade .
&quot; triggered by the mon@@ soon , normally by the end of May , the rivers of Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , N@@ il@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya entered into 15 districts in the south and west of the country . &quot;
&quot; according to an opinion of the cat@@ astrop@@ hic district of Sri Lanka , May 28 , 2017 , 126 people were killed and barely hundreds of people are missing because of the floods and mud . &quot;
more than 400 000 people have been affected by the last Friday ( 26 May ) and about 100 000 people were brought to 304 safe place of residence .
&quot; the rains left on Saturday ( 27th of May ) , and the waterfalls in some areas went slowly . &quot;
health and hygiene conditions of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected area and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the extent of the bottle of disaster :
high water in Ta@@ wal@@ ama City with water resistance of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am Ame@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et supply regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the has@@ ht@@ ag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the catastrophe .
Sri Lan@@ kas fatal Fl@@ utes wor@@ sen the Den@@ gu@@ ef@@ i@@ eb@@ aut rise , war@@ ns the Children , after other rainy season are already on the way . &quot;

&quot; the air force has five planes for b@@ ail@@ out actions , and another five are made for transportation of st@@ abling for those in their floo@@ ded villages . &quot;
also various organizations and start @-@ ups have prepared themselves to help .
Facebook pages like Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tory in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Rel@@ ief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on high water situation and humanitarian assistance .
&quot; if any search and b@@ ail@@ ments dr@@ ones need for their operations , please call the number 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 . &quot;

&quot; please call them the number 07@@ 77@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 07@@ 7@@ 78@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 , if animals need help in this area . &quot;
&quot; the Tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f @-@ App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their site data with the help of the app , so that the cat@@ alogues is informed . &quot;
&quot; last year after the catastrophe of the Tro@@ pical Medicine Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me led a &quot; &quot; high water &quot; &quot; button , which allowed it to give users a car to pick up assistance and donations . these were then passed on to the s@@ ri@@ lan@@ c@@ lical cross . &quot;
&quot; they led a &quot; &quot; SOS &quot; &quot; button that had more than a thousand requests and 150 successful boat rel@@ ying actions for the high water and Er@@ dr@@ ut@@ sche @-@ closed people . &quot;
&quot; the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lan@@ kas , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , resident in need for security and help aid . &quot;
&quot; this has prevented the loss of further human lives , whereby the population of Sri Lan@@ kas are now the long way to restoration of norm@@ ality . &quot;
Muslims that you cannot see
the Women &apos;s March on 21 January 2017 in San Francisco .
photo of Sah@@ ar Hab@@ ib G@@ ha@@ zi .
&quot; use Reg@@ .@@ Dam@@ as in January , I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neigh@@ bor , and love his girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; I trust her four year old daughter , she trust me her children ; she is my rock in the fire . &quot;
in the one minute we call for the rights of women .
in the next sk@@ andi@@ ze we are rights for trans@@ gender .
&quot; we are in a sea of rain @-@ men and people , some keep the iconic image of a woman with head@@ scar@@ f high , bound up from a American flag , other sk@@ andi@@ ze slo@@ gans against Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; my girlfriend look at me and says : &quot; &quot; these things do not concern yourself , or ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslim ? &quot; , &quot; I ask . &quot;
I have already led this conversation .
&quot; people with whom I work or people who know me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built up in their performance . &quot;
it cl@@ ori@@ ze me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all the same .
we practi@@ se our religion differently .
&quot; we identify with it to be a Muslim , to different kind of art . but somehow we shall all be put into the same Muslim drawer . &quot;
&quot; this drawer is so well designed in our collective imagination so as soon as Muslims , which as I do not fit there , un@@ mus@@ li@@ zed . &quot;
ab@@ mus@@ li@@ zed
I do not stand alone .
&quot; this is even done to the poet , whose poetry is selling in America : Rum@@ i . &quot;
which images come in mind when you think of it ?
love ?
peace ?
as J@@ al@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now he was a orthodo@@ x@@ er Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
&quot; Islam , the Quran and the Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the centre of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; but in the Western vision the religion was deleted from Rum@@ is , as well as the most popular translations of its poetry . &quot;
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a big part of the history of 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another one is in the reduction images of Muslims ; Western books have been colon@@ ized for centuries for centuries .
this temp@@ ting language is determined by the dark man who you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the disposable Palestinian @-@ American scientists Edward S@@ aid sm@@ ashed the story behind these pictures .
but these images continue to be released today .
&quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continues to stand . &quot;
&quot; I have worked for thirteen years in the news industry for thirteen years , and I have seen how this powerful , failed scar@@ let our News@@ fe@@ eds domin@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; this Fo@@ ols is over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed the reality , which in the last three decades nine Muslim women have led their countries , while the US could not even choose their first female presidential race . &quot;
&quot; this fo@@ ols fails to acknowledge that when French , Muslim women are prevented from being forced to wear their head @-@ to@@ wel in public buildings and su@@ cking su@@ di Arab , Muslim women by their government to cover their entire body , these are both sides of the same coin . &quot;
a powerful group exercises its &quot; control &quot; to the &quot; Other &quot; .
&quot; this strong Nar@@ rati@@ v weak@@ ens Muslim women , the movements for change . &quot;
it looks at that the first Muslim prayers were spoken of the American soil of Afri@@ kan@@ ers who were killed here with slave ships .
it delet@@ es the existence of Qu@@ eer Muslim .
&quot; this Fo@@ ols has engaged our collective imagination , so deep and faul@@ ty occupied that often Si@@ kh men and children become a destination of an@@ tim@@ li@@ ous attacks and sli@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; thanks to these stories , which we tell and because of the way we share it is Islam@@ opho@@ bia today not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; other . &quot; &quot;
one of the 1.9 billion include
&quot; in the news industry , we do more than just stories to tell that are based on facts . &quot;
or on alternative facts .
we also create Nar@@ r@@ ative that help us understand the world .
and my industry is striking to capture the Nar@@ rati@@ v of 1.7 billion .
and here we failed where seven million Muslims constitute the highest degree of &quot; diverse &quot; religious group in America .
more than one third of the entire Muslim population are African Americans .
&quot; six of 10 American Muslims belong to the immigrants of the first generation , which come from 77 countries . &quot;
the parents of the author in 1976 in New York .
use approved .
four decades ago I came to live in New York four decades ago to live their American dream .
&quot; my mother placed her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scrapers of New York . sky@@ scrapers were made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan . &quot;
&quot; at that time , when Khan was re@@ v@@ ented the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were unbeliev@@ ing Muslims and Americans . &quot;
but now I am a um@@ ph@@ oned Muslim and American ?
&quot; sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t say a por@@ k recipes , I say - instead of my mus@@ li@@ ous recipes , or my hand@@ tr@@ ash@@ boards , which all Muslims carry in themselves - &quot; from respect to P@@ epp@@ a W@@ utz . &quot;
&quot; I jo@@ kes , we do not carry all T@@ ash@@ ans with us . &quot;
&quot; we must also be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; or to be chosen almost always for additional security services at the airport . &quot;
&quot; there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who seek to fight widely spread lies across Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies are produced on the current volume of a well @-@ created Islam@@ ist machine with back@@ ers , Th@@ ink tanks and experts for mis@@ information which is our already faul@@ ty image of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of the nature , in which we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is more than just a stran@@ ger that gives a woman the head@@ scar@@ f . &quot;
&quot; or as the start@@ ling map of attacks on mos@@ ques in the whole USA , see below . &quot;

Islam@@ opho@@ bia in its ugly forms att@@ acking our affili@@ ation .
&quot; it att@@ acking our identity that is so far , versatile and multi@@ lay@@ ered that it can impossible to fit into a drawer . &quot;

use approved .
I want to explain that .
&quot; I was born as Muslim , but a Muslim was born only then in my imagination , when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a Pres@@ by@@ tery church in New York . &quot;
&quot; if social scientist describe the true life , they refer to the following terms : faith , behaviour and belonging . &quot;
&quot; my mus@@ li@@ ous faith and behavior may not always be visible , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; maybe my girlfriend , my neighbour I would see my rock in the fire that I am Muslim when they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our homes . &quot;
she would see the sole ritual with my daughter when I revol@@ ve her in my arms and her the Arabic verses to protect the Quran and the Q@@ ul@@ s .
each of them repeat three times .
&quot; I ask that it is protected from the evil one , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see . &quot;
&quot; my mus@@ li@@ ous faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always a part of my shadow . &quot;
&quot; the grand@@ mother of the author , when she wins a Ik@@ eb@@ ana competition in Kar@@ achi , with her sisters at some point in the 1960s . &quot;
use approved .
belonging to my grand@@ mother is the image of my grand@@ mother mat@@ ern@@ al with her sisters ; how they gain a competition for the art of flowers in Kar@@ achi .
&quot; it is the picture of you that I slept in this moment , when I close my eyes : Nano , surrounded by their ful@@ ings and un@@ finished paintings , a book with a hundred and four@@ teen chapters , which they can almost completely dec@@ eive . &quot;
&quot; to be Muslim means to speak the prayers , which they had said to speak , if I have a bad day . &quot;
&quot; Muslim is to be , how she brought me to relate to God : Allah Mi@@ an what God means , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a people that was founded - over centuries - by a &quot; Empire &quot; colonial , which founded a company with the name Ven@@ erable Bri@@ tic Ost@@ ini@@ dien @-@ Komp@@ anie , it has a deep meaning , God , my only Lord . &quot;
the author in 1987 with her grandfather .
use approved .
&quot; membership means to rise up and to hear that men do not cry , but at the same time to see that my deliber@@ ate grandfather cri@@ es . &quot;
&quot; Spl@@ it@@ rin , while he writes books on modern Islam and about the independence of Kash@@ mir , crying N@@ ana Ja@@ an un@@ um@@ wo@@ unds around his family in India &apos;s conquered family , that was not allowed to close his arms in half a century . &quot;
&quot; belonging to know that there are millions of Kurds and Palestinians , whose families , as with my grandfather , of col@@ oni@@ alists were scattered , who shared the Muslim world as at stake . &quot;
&quot; Muslims have to be aware that in the last two centuries Europeans have all up to four Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that the first a@@ erial bombar@@ d@@ ment of history was rejected in a century above a Muslim country . &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grand@@ mother , an intimate , k@@ ash@@ mir@@ rors of the British empire , was referred to as &quot; dangerous &quot; since he led the first mosque in England . &quot;
&quot; even before there were planes he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever was , and pre@@ ached the radical word of love , peace and social justice . &quot;
the Word of Islam .

&quot; to my Muslim tribe of the 1,@@ 7 billion , we are deeply rooted in our unforgettable tribe ; our un@@ disturbed history . &quot;
&quot; it means remember@@ ing that four@@ teen years ago the most powerful military in the world , with troops , spread over every continent apart from the Antarc@@ tic , were distributed in Iraq to chase out mass destruction , which did not exist . &quot;
it means knowing that more than half a million mis@@ aker buried beneath the ruins of the war .
an American Muslim means to know that the self @-@ language rate has risen since 2001 by over 32 percent in 2001 .
&quot; it means knowing that if a tragedy comes in the US , and the susp@@ ects a Muslim name bears the story of four times more than a story with a white attacks . &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that four hundred years ago the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called by a liber@@ ated black slaves with the name of Bil@@ al . &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that two hundred years ago , an African Islam@@ ist called Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ l@@ aved and brought into this country . &quot;
it means that Mal@@ col@@ m X will call an American hero .
it is the warmth that I sen@@ sing as humans the airports are crowded to fight against the Muslim B@@ an .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand for our dreams and if we say black life .
&quot; a Americans to be a Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ erin , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Muslim and a journalist who fail to fail the har@@ dest inter@@ se@@ duc@@ ality of our with multiple bonds , but to fail to communicate with others . &quot;
&quot; the Nar@@ rati@@ v of 1,@@ 7 billion has more possibilities than a mag@@ ician , but is represented in the reduction of &quot; &quot; we &quot; against &quot; they . &quot; &quot;
&quot; his mother is to be a mother , to make me care of my child and all Muslim children , well @-@ knowing that powerful and privileged people on this doub@@ eness will build structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia is based in the Muslim government , which started President Bush and extended under President Obama . &quot;
it exists in constant monitoring of mos@@ ques .
&quot; it consists in the immigration , which takes five years old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
&quot; it exists in a country that closes its borders towards people from just the countries , which bom@@ bed it bom@@ bed . &quot;
&quot; it is a false and neb@@ ul@@ ous &quot; &quot; No @-@ Fly @-@ list , &quot; which takes largely Arabs and Muslims into the spot@@ light . &quot;
&quot; these are the wars , which we are leading and the bom@@ bs we cast on Muslim countries . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of those we do not tell , we are here today . &quot;
&quot; in a study with the title Asc@@ ent of Man , scientists of North@@ western University participants showed a scientific image and b@@ ate them , groups on a scale of 1 to 100 with regard to evolution . &quot;
Muslims received the s@@ light@@ est score .
con@@ vers@@ ations that we have to lead
we are too deep dar@@ ing to enth@@ r@@ ise the Muslim or the &quot; other . &quot;
&quot; we are decades back , recognizing the roots of our fears and the faul@@ ty and dangerous im@@ prints , which we fail in our news editorial activity . &quot;
&quot; at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry , who tried to grasp our frequently with bonds and forget history . &quot;
&quot; Pod@@ cast See Some@@ thing , S@@ ay Some@@ thing from Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the Pod@@ cast # Good@@ Muslim League ; Sap@@ elo Square on black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Sch@@ ust@@ ers Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative , multip@@ li@@ ous authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the Pak@@ ist@@ anian , Muslim Super@@ hero@@ ine - all this makes me hope . &quot;

coll@@ age of the author .
&quot; but I am concerned about this difficult global point of view , where we are in . &quot;
and that moment has consequences that go beyond 1.7 billion .
&quot; there is one reason for the conspir@@ acy the@@ orists , which existed in the dark corners of the internet , now the White House lead . &quot;
they have grown exp@@ on@@ entially because they have made Muslims to &quot; others &quot; .
&quot; there is another group that has grown exp@@ on@@ entially by creating the &quot; &quot; other &quot; . &quot; &quot;
a few years ago it had not yet given them ; now they master large areas in Syria and Iraq .
&quot; I am concerned about realities and history , which I was not aware of how I was as old now , as I was now my daughter , but who made me to an un@@ avoidable Muslim . &quot;
things I have left here like a bread track in my speech .
&quot; things that might aw@@ aken memories , because in all the inter@@ connect@@ edness that makes our humanity a story , where someone is made to another &quot; &quot; others &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , Con@@ vers@@ ations will be held at the 8th annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
&quot; why do I tell this here with this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who has shown us how wars are led and people affected by the &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; in the public idea , four decades himself scientist the scientist of Stan@@ ford . &quot;
&quot; we have to put ourselves more comfortable questions according to the role of this , conscious and un@@ aware the &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; so as it was my girlfriend and I did in rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the occupation we have won a new future , while he already bom@@ bed countries and &quot; other common &quot; men bombar@@ ded far beyond the visible and invisible 1,@@ 7 billion . &quot;

can there be a possibility here and now despite a language barrier with someone in connection ?
&quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Initiative Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) , the proceeds of stories in their original language is a possible answer to it . &quot;
&quot; global Vo@@ ices reported in front of a different initiative of Steven Bird , the in@@ estim@@ able blog . &quot;
&quot; however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written ground , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language variety of major cities . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oak@@ land , in the United States where T@@ LS has already been conducted since 2015 events , the risk that small and not quite so small languages will not be passed on to the children there . &quot;
for the creators of the project are :
&quot; the mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided if we are able to manage the diversity - safe spaces , in which inhabitants do not have to forget who they are to be . &quot;
&quot; while listening is often associated with it , &quot; &quot; forced these events instead &quot; &quot; listening to appreciate , to feel embarrass@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; in this format , stor@@ yt@@ eller reports their story first in their own language before and translate them into English . &quot;
&quot; even if the participants are not professional stor@@ yt@@ ellers , their devotion and their representation is that the audi@@ ences to it . &quot;
&quot; they call you laugh and emotions , as if the language is no longer a barrier . &quot;
&quot; the following video shows for example a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ ellers R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ates also takes the opportunity to explain the customs of nar@@ rati@@ os for their country . &quot;
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the f@@ abel of the bun@@ ny and the P@@ avian in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
&quot; after having asked the meaning of his hand , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked to speak to an audience who does not understand your language ? &quot; with a broad ridge , he shares his sense of inclusi@@ veness : &quot;
you have heard !
you were attentive ...
they were very with me !
&quot; so far , the events of Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling have taken place in three cities , and the organizers hope to expand this . all who are inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS in order to arrange their own stor@@ yt@@ eller . &quot;
Puerto Rico calls for US revival in the national debt
&quot; with the aim of a re @-@ examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , involved in 72 million US dollars , participating in the capital Capit@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went up to Plaza de Col@@ Ã³n in the old town of San Ju@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; it was called by the group &quot; &quot; Fr@@ ente Ci@@ ud@@ ad@@ ano p@@ or la Audit@@ or@@ Ã­a de la D@@ eu@@ da &quot; ( Citizens ) for the Neur@@ or@@ Ã­a de la Ri@@ cos . &quot;
the inter@@ c@@ essors of the re @-@ determination of debts also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their call :
&quot; the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos demands that politicians , ben@@ ches and government agencies responsible for debts are responsible for their corrupt . &quot;
&quot; we call for a financial examination and a mission Committee without personal interests in public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions , which has been in favour of the economy . &quot;
we will pres@@ st and suppres@@ sed .
&quot; the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos refuse to pay a debt , which is not their . &quot;
we will not choose between education and health .
our pension@@ ers will not be found with decl@@ ining profitability .
we demand immediate measures .
the island - not in the state @-@ of @-@ established territory of the USA - is suffering from a severe financial crisis .
&quot; therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Center for New Economy , &quot; constitutes a rule @-@ independent non @-@ profit organization without party membership with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , a law on responsibility as an alternative to existing state @-@ state . &quot;
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis in Puerto Ri@@ cos demands a wide restructuring of state infrastructure .

&quot; the Syrian @-@ Palestinian Web@@ Develop@@ er Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over one year . &quot;
but he is not forgotten .
&quot; more than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives continued the campaign for his freedom and remember the contributions he has made for an open network . &quot;
&quot; at this year &apos;s re : publi@@ ca , the annual conference dedicated to digital culture , which is focused in Berlin devoted to an event of the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign . &quot;
&quot; MÃ©@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ Ã¼h@@ ling , chair@@ ing books from the book C@@ ost of Freedom : a Coll@@ ective In@@ quiry ( The cost of freedom : a collective bar@@ gaining ) . &quot;
&quot; the book that has been published last year and is available to license @-@ free , contains a number of approaches that deal with free culture in the face of oppression . &quot;
it is a hom@@ age to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it is said :
&quot; this book would like to discuss how moves for free knowledge and what the real costs are , with which this is connected . &quot;
&quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge , have linked site to the fo@@ g who surrounds our News@@ fe@@ eds and to create some sense from our various experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , who has borro@@ wed beloved and filmed Internet volunteers , who has been arrested in Syria since March 15 , 2012 . &quot;
&quot; his name was cancelled out of the directory of the A@@ dra prison , where he sat on 3 October 2015 . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have no information about his current state or location . &quot;
&quot; the introductory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and family a voice that would push for his release and want to know him back in his normal life , and in freedom immediately . &quot;
&quot; to see how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us have to start to think about their own dest@@ in@@ ates , acts and decisions . &quot;
why are we here today ?
what did we have chosen ?
what have we abandoned in this process of timeless extreme beliefs ?
the web developers for open source and digital activity has been in cust@@ ody Syrian government authorities since March 2012 .
&quot; in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was born from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution to an unknown place . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and Ombud@@ sper@@ son N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the &quot; military police officers had taken on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; written instruction from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi reported , she was contacted by persons on 12 November 2015 , who presented herself as the insi@@ der @-@ Assad government and put it in knowledge from an alleged wave of death against her husband . &quot;
but his place of residence and state remain unknown .
&quot; a pioneer of the Creative Commons involved in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in gaining access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , T@@ echn@@ ologist and at the moment over@@ written the head of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project , the Bass@@ el founded , writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
perhaps none of Bas@@ sels cultural prot@@ otypes fores@@ aw as the work that he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras .
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the immobili@@ zer of numerous civili@@ zations and here merge Greek @-@ Roman architectural types with hi@@ esi@@ red traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; b@@ ass@@ el could then not know that ten years after having started working with this work , the IS was all about to em@@ bo@@ died this architecture that is not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world . &quot;
&quot; this strip in the digital archae@@ ology and the conservation has created a time @-@ capsule , which will be inv@@ alu@@ able for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future . &quot;
&quot; typically , Bass@@ el was not able to complete this project until now . &quot;
&quot; N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi has also contributed to the book , and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison : &quot;
&quot; I have spent my whole life to dream of freedom , and b@@ ass@@ el taught me to embrace her . &quot;
I am overwhel@@ med when I called his name .
&quot; Bass@@ el brought me English at , even when he was in cust@@ ody . &quot;
&quot; I learned to read English well , writing and speak English . &quot;
&quot; he has always shared his knowledge with each one who asked . he taught other incar@@ cer@@ ated , English to write and speak . &quot;
&quot; Bass@@ a gave me the door to the technology open . he taught me , both computers and smartphones . &quot;
he brought me the Internet .
&quot; he also brought together other in@@ quired , as they use computers , at least theoretically , without having actually held one in their hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a Pro@@ mis@@ se , which she wrote in the years 2012 until 2015 her husband , when he was in cust@@ ody . &quot;
Bass@@ el and N@@ oura have worked together in the book for a long time .
&quot; she cri@@ ed the lyrics to him when she visited him , and he transferred them out of the Arabic into English . &quot;
the book is license @-@ free .

Bas@@ sels &apos;s history is not unique in Syria .
&quot; since the beginning of the protest against the regime Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime , according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian network for human rights ) has disappeared more than 5,000 people . &quot;
those who were arrested or disappeared under violence through the regime were tor@@ tured or even executed .
&quot; since 2011 , according to the international human rights organization Am@@ nest@@ y International has died at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Sy@@ rer in prison . &quot;
the stories of many other people are unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el .
we reiter@@ ate our demand today in hope that we must do this for the last time .
Mos@@ ambi@@ que : indic@@ ted Director after corruption and resign@@ ed again on previous post
&quot; Moz@@ ambi@@ que re@@ acted with anger in a corruption , in which a government member returned after half of his sentence on the workplace of the state apparatus , at which the corruption was committed . &quot;
&quot; this is the Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison along with four other def@@ endants in 54 million Me@@ tik@@ al ( approximately 800 000 Euros ) for 22 years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; the money emig@@ rated from public funds from Moz@@ ambi@@ que airports , whose Council Cam@@ b@@ aza between 2005 and 2008 . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 for good guidance and immediately asked his res@@ etting into the company , which happened on 19 April then . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with an opinion of the General Secretary @-@ Bar of the Republic , which meant the request , there would be no doubt for Cam@@ b@@ aza , again his old post , as the company has no discipl@@ in@@ arity according to his cust@@ ody . &quot;
&quot; however , many inhabitants do not welcome the action well . &quot;
&quot; the Centre for Public integrity ( Centro de Int@@ egri@@ da@@ de P@@ Ãº@@ bli@@ ca , a local institution dedicated to public transparency , condemned into an interview with Deutsche Welle the decision of the company to resume the director : &quot;
&quot; represents the lack of transparency in the fight against corruption and is clear the lack of transparency and is even a return to the efforts of our legal system , so the C@@ IP . &quot;
what we take note is that the company should lead to a lack of discipline against the ref@@ illed negoti@@ ators .
&quot; however , the firm appears to be and promp@@ ted no reasonable legal steps for the application of the appropriate functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ Ã­@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the mos@@ aic social media , re@@ jects this behavior as well as regards the case as &quot; &quot; resist@@ ed &quot; &quot; : &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ b@@ aza would be a pro@@ fic@@ i@@ ent type , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and has a half off . &quot;
&quot; he could last paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could give advice and his image . &quot;
&quot; but since he is in@@ competent , he has agreed to be rein@@ t@@ ted to the company that he helped damage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza will be happy to pay for his silence . &quot;
resistance !
&quot; Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Moz@@ ambi@@ que and Student of political science in Brazil , says the director no mor@@ ality : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza is rewarded by the state because he in@@ anim@@ ate it , I can not believe someone in such a way that the state has already been so massive . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza is lacking to return to mor@@ ality and serve the state * he had already served a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead it only serves himself the state . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza used the state , as a hand it became an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself , this man has become tired , the pre @-@ loaded and ultimately sentenced to a long prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; honestly speaking , I don &apos;t know why this man was rewarded so . &quot;
&quot; Franc@@ ey Ze@@ Ãº@@ te preferred to remind the Prime Minister of Mos@@ ambi@@ que , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , remember@@ ing that a th@@ ief is in prison . &quot;
&quot; Di@@ eves are part of the prison of Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el and will not only be remembered as the first independent president , but also as a sharp , s@@ lic@@ ed and - side by saying - proph@@ etic speakers . &quot;
&quot; one of his most famous oral represent@@ ations was when he confirmed that &quot; an ambitious person is capable of ensuring the f@@ ather@@ land for its ambitions , its own individual interest to sell . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ora said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if a ambitious person changes that it is not that way . he changes the tac@@ tic , but he does not change from his ambitions . &quot;
an ambitious person is criminal . &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also changing :
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he sat 10 years and came free . &quot;
&quot; and today he sets him the company , with which he filed , again under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ OM@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - Ñ@@ Î±@@ Show ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) 12 May 2017

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and c@@ ens@@ ored many users
&quot; the Bur@@ mes@@ an word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &quot; means &quot; K@@ ich@@ er@@ erb@@ se or Sp@@ age . &quot; &quot;
photo of San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Wikipedia Commons , Creative Commons Attri@@ bution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ ported &quot;
&quot; according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the known Social Network took their po@@ sts out of the net , because it included the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; although about the origin of the word still is discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin , or generally used as adj@@ ective . &quot;
&quot; Facebook c@@ ens@@ ored the word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; or a demonstration ( in bur@@ mes@@ an letters ) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma during the social network . &quot;
in recent years the rise of radical nation@@ alistic movements of the word has given an extremely ab@@ worth@@ less cl@@ ot@@ ation .
&quot; in particular , it is a word that mostly used by Ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as a speech against Muslims , which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company has c@@ ens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform . &quot;
&quot; Kal@@ ar &apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; may be associated with racism today , but the word itself is calling not automatically as a speech of hate . &quot;
&quot; the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that also Po@@ sts , in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts expressed in the purpose of its purpose . &quot;
&quot; moreover , there are several bur@@ mes@@ an words with different mean@@ ings which have the same letter as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , chair is written on Bur@@ mes@@ an also &apos; Kal@@ ar ht@@ a@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters , as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &apos; ( Sp@@ age ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar o@@ at &apos; ( Kam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the Fac@@ ebook@@ ally used A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at declared the various mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
a post of my friends was deleted today because he contained the Word of Kal@@ ar .
&quot; however , he asked his friends in the spiritual way , if they knew how he could left his back pain , as he made a word play . &quot;
the sentence ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the Fr@@ age@@ word ( la ) on Bur@@ mes@@ an - resem@@ bles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were several reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
&quot; Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is the opinion that they reduce Hass@@ an radi@@ ant nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook analy@@ tic must be analyzed before all the Po@@ sts are extingu@@ ished in suspic@@ ion , racism . &quot;
Facebook delet@@ es the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it fil@@ tered the word automatically .
automation is not to understand what you give to Fac@@ ility .
what it should do is to analyse the post and control it by checking the following words .
&quot; for example &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &quot; &quot; ( age ) . &quot;
&quot; the good is that this dirty nation@@ alists , spread the Hass@@ an , a pretty good lesson . &quot;
&quot; now it is time to circum@@ c@@ ision its nation@@ alism .
&quot; while the action may send a strong signal to all , the Hass@@ ing language , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long . &quot;
&quot; the experience of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ chat have proven that the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of stroke is often a cat@@ - and mouse game , whereby users can simply start social networks to express a new word or alternative sp@@ elling of the zen@@ ed word to express their views . &quot;
&quot; the author A@@ ung My@@ ung described how Facebook began to delete his poker players as he wanted to share his friends only , that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; of the social network is banned : &quot;
&quot; when I was attentive to this new directive of Facebook , I made a post to share my Facebook friends that the Word is locked . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically , my post office was removed from Facebook and I was prohibited the Li@@ ken , post and parts of content for 24 hours , because the post &quot; Facebook community standards was not met . &quot;
&quot; Facebook has a large number of Po@@ sts from people who have no negative intentions , or simply trying to show their opinions against the Hass@@ an radi@@ al nation@@ alists . &quot;
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed who has nothing to do with Hass@@ an :
mail without hate speech from Facebook .
&quot; in the post office , the author shared his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad . &quot;
&quot; Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have more to do before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ mes@@ an Internet Community to ask for advice : &quot;
&quot; Facebook likes a prosp@@ erous intention to reduce racism in Burma through their platform , but it does not work . &quot;
such words come to zen@@ ge only even more hat@@ red within the different communities .
it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have banned as &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; her@@ sen@@ curr@@ y &quot; .
even when they found that they have made mistakes they tried not to correct the fal@@ seh@@ ent Po@@ sts .
&quot; if they had only slightly more respect for the 15 million benefits they would have a big sales , this would be great . &quot;
fac@@ ebook automatic c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship has been provided for a lot of ridi@@ cu@@ le among users .
&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users can now be funny via Facebook and write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of Hass@@ an , to see if their po@@ sts are taken from the grid . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook Po@@ sts , which have no hate speech , but nevertheless they were removed : &quot;
with permission .
the Bur@@ mes@@ an Text is &apos; I want to sit on a chair and watch an inheritance curr@@ y and an Indian film .
&quot; only to try out whether Facebook contains the post , which contains the Word of Kal@@ ar . &quot;
screens@@ hot with permission .
&quot; the post b@@ ail &quot; If you are a doctor , do you heal people ? &quot;
screens@@ hot with permission .
&quot; over the past five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have used to develop social networks to expand their voices and their influence . &quot;
&quot; among other things , hate speech is said to heat the violence in the communities in Myanmar , especially in Rak@@ h@@ ine , where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hist@@ s have forced thousands to escape . &quot;
&quot; Facebook has been for his failure to bring forth the wu@@ er@@ ased Hass@@ an on his bur@@ mes@@ an sites under control , cri@@ tici@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; but instead of simply putting the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have better running to learn more on context than in code of concentrated initiatives and learned from them . &quot;

the children &apos;s before is illeg@@ ally illegal in Trin@@ id@@ ad and Tob@@ ago now .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament adopted by the country unanim@@ ously decided that this practice must offer , so that the prot@@ ection@@ able age is now at 18 . &quot;
&quot; prior to this change of the spouse and mus@@ li@@ ous religious communities in practice , and in May 2016 there came to a large public appearance . back then said brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mahar@@ aja , the leader of the various religious groups of the country , that the state does not inter@@ fere with the state that the state does not inter@@ fere with the maturity . &quot;
&quot; this happened , regardless of the fact that Trin@@ id@@ ad and Tob@@ ago is an contractual partner of the UN child labour market , the min@@ ors of age , every person under the age of 18 is defined . &quot;
&quot; statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who were already married , in Trin@@ id@@ ad and Tob@@ ago 2.8 percent , and with 18 were 8,@@ 1 percent . &quot;
&quot; 2011 confirmed the statistics of the country , that from 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 . &quot;
&quot; online petition and social media movements , the stri@@ ves were to establish laws on the nursery , followed at the foot and looked great support . undoubtedly hal@@ ting them to bring this outcome . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , not everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; a Hin@@ du guide such as had no concerns , the critics of children &apos;s marriage to say , they should take care of their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition dispos@@ ed for tensions in this actually un@@ complicated thing , and some point came upon whether the opposition would not agree with the law . &quot;
&quot; but in the beginning of 2017 , the draft force was decided against the children &apos;s before - despite four sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent , who could be discussed in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , so that he would make a simple majority to take him into the law . &quot;
&quot; now , only the President of the country has to agree and announce the law . &quot;
&quot; one of the sen@@ ators of the country gave on Facebook a status update , which re@@ post @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ ag@@ ram again : &quot;
Mr. Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against child@@ birth was decided in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives with 35 votes for this and no one against them .
&quot; after having decided previously in the Senate , the draft can now become the law . &quot;
the majority of the social @-@ media user was enth@@ r@@ alled because the laws of the children were finally changed .
&quot; Facebook @-@ member Lov@@ ell Francis , who spoke an minist@@ erial office in the Department of Education , said : &quot;

&quot; but a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aja , the Secretary @-@ General of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du organisation of the country . &quot;
&quot; in months ago Mahar@@ aja has announced his intention to take judicial steps , the law should be adopted , and he seems to rede@@ em his promise . &quot;
&quot; during the General @-@ General Paris Al ra@@ wi , a pro@@ pon@@ ent of the law , meant , it may be right@@ ful when Mahar@@ aja wants to proceed against the law , most of the social media users , you would address the debate differently . &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ rell proposed :
&quot; dear Sat , if we , instead of discussing the discussion so generally , in a way that the state would be able to talk about that the state , our daughters , that it may be of great , hard @-@ hard men that are likely to be used , ab@@ used , if you are ready to continue the discussion ? &quot;
or do you believe it is not a problem ?
&quot; but whether it comes to a judicial procedure against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places around the world where children are legal within various grad@@ ations , or continue the norm , although there are laws that they are under@@ mine . &quot;

&quot; by mir@@ rors of web pages , Turkish users can look at Wikipedia content again . &quot;
&quot; the English @-@ language Wikipedia site was represented on 18 January 2012 , opposing the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A Copyright law in the USA , internationally dil@@ uted . &quot;
created by Wikipedia ( CC BY @-@ SA 3.0 )
since over a month now Turkey un@@ ra@@ vel@@ s the popular and on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based in@@ cyclop@@ edia Wikipedia .
&quot; day by day becomes clear , how important the platform for users is to find helpful and reliable information . &quot;
both students and re@@ por@@ ter and fans of TV series wo@@ ke up against the blocking .
&quot; although many techniques of techniques used to use it , re@@ use tools for block web sites ( an current article from the New York Times reported that Turkey has the third largest VP@@ N prevalence of the world ) , most of the ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category . &quot;
&quot; although Turkey has posted article from Wikipedia , such as recently published in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University has been held , find regular block@@ ages of the Internet since 2007 , after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted . &quot;
&quot; after China , Turkey is the most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship from Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; while the platform remains closed , there are several mir@@ ror@@ sites ( pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and often be updated ) . &quot;
&quot; a solution came from the IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) as the platform of all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centralized pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( so machine calcul@@ ator ) , which does not base itself on the system of domain names and thus making a complete c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship . &quot;
the content is available in spite of any legal pro@@ hibition .
in a blog@@ post IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
&quot; after we heard the news ( about the block@@ age of Wikipedia ) , we put everything to put snap@@ shots from Wikipedia on the IP@@ FS platform . thus , the possibility to read the contents of de@@ centralized and distributed way . &quot;
&quot; this can help users to see at least all Wikipedia content , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ loo@@ t themselves . &quot;
&quot; IP@@ FS was also given that this step is independent of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is just about screen@@ shots and no Live@@ versions of the website . &quot;
&quot; however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to handle the sperm . &quot;
&quot; Cr@@ istian Con@@ son@@ ni from Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , a visit from Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can use to produce similar Mir@@ ror@@ pages when in the particular country Wikipedia is blocked . &quot;
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices member as well as employee in the Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; Pod@@ cast :
&quot; it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy @-@ address , a mirror . &quot;
&quot; one attacks on another URL , which is not the original one . that what you see then is from Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; essentially , the server dire@@ cts the request to the right Wikipedia page so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia even if these are locked in Turkey . &quot;
&quot; this is done by a server , which is not in Turkey . &quot;
a Nep@@ alese Wild@@ animal photographer uses his camera to be attentive to the need for nature conservation

with permission .
&quot; Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos that he looked around , never satisfied . they were bl@@ ur@@ red with poorly positioned moti@@ fs and well @-@ balanced colours . &quot;
the motiv@@ ating him to carry him a camera in itself and try to understand the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
&quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar tried to bring her to the international stage at the age of 28 years . &quot;
&quot; and his hom@@ etown directly next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offering it the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to Nep@@ alese wildlife . &quot;
he described on Facebook how it helps him the first @-@ class situation in his work :
&quot; I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could there be better for a passionate wild @-@ photographer ! ! &quot;
&quot; I walked straight at home when suddenly Navar@@ re ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father , that at the bank of the Rap@@ ti river would be a leop@@ ard . &quot;
the river dam@@ m is just a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I turned with my camera and was in a few minutes there .
&quot; my Father had observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the Leopard was there and I immediately began to cr@@ ush pictures ! &quot;
&quot; Sag@@ ar seeks cooperation with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition of Nep@@ alese nature , and want to deep@@ en understanding that wild animals are not as terrible as they look . &quot;
&quot; and he should know it , for he arose tig@@ ers already from face to face . &quot;
a tiger can not be dis@@ rupt from the opinion of the sheep ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
&quot; I was also home because of the darkness on the way home , when suddenly the king of the bow was published immediately , we see you immediately and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al @-@ trees ! &quot;
&quot; to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar the logo &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit . : I cli@@ cked for environmental protection ) on his photos . &quot;
&quot; however , his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ alese nature and wildlife is not always easy . &quot;
&quot; he waited for 22 days long , and mostly in a tent in order to make in Bar@@ dia National Park records from Ot@@ tern . up to 12 days it lasted until he was able to photograph a tiger and live six to seven days for the perfect picture of birds that live near the tourist information . &quot;

&quot; this entry was posted by Kay@@ ona@@ az Kaly@@ an@@ wal@@ a , and originally appeared on Video Volunte@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community organisation from India . &quot;
a revised version was published here as part of a Content @-@ Shar@@ ing Convention again .
&quot; in many parts of India , women avoid having the utmost care to speak the name of her husband , or even of older men in the family . &quot;
instead they use a prono@@ uns or say &quot; Father of my child . &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and Ut@@ t@@ ar Pr@@ ad@@ esh give women to respect the husband &apos;s social pressure , as well as the fear of the consequences they should be the norm to abuse this practice . &quot;
&quot; last year Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was condemned from the Indian state of O@@ la@@ a , by a head@@ quarter , and rejected by her family and the village of the village after having raised a prisoner relative . &quot;
&quot; the tradition of their wives also do not call on the name , is also common among men . however , they have far fewer conc@@ e@@ eis@@ ances to fear , if at all , they should not agree on this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health personnel as well as house@@ wives , a unique club , and became quickly become the main theme of the city . &quot;
it is a place only for them alone in which they can discuss and discuss the int@@ ric@@ acies of the patri@@ arch@@ ate .
&quot; as one of 56 clubs that exists in 13 Indian states , it is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al which is operated by the Community Video Volunte@@ ers and advocates the elimination of the patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera , such as children &apos;s warming up to the exile of H@@ IV@@ - and AIDS , and guides these clubs . &quot;
they reported how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and have made them at the same time the amb@@ ass@@ esses of change .
&quot; the first video that showed the Roh@@ ini in their discussion , was of women who do not name her sp@@ ouses . &quot;
she decided on this issue because she wanted to open the conversation about the patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves .
&quot; to speak the name of their hus@@ band@@ men is not loud to speak , a bread is maintained and has never been questioned . &quot;
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition testi@@ fied that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
&quot; a woman who does not hold this , is regarded as sne@@ ak@@ y as a woman without mor@@ ality . &quot;
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never made thoughts of this discussion up to this discussion .
&quot; at the beginning of Roh@@ ini , the Roh@@ ini wanted to have never been called on behalf of her husband and try to go home , as it runs . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband still weigh long after the video was finished .
&quot; Pr@@ ak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said , I should name him from now on his name . &quot;
with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage Roh@@ ini started its first discussion .
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; &quot; before . some believed it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women . &quot;
at the beginning of the round the Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in Ut@@ t@@ ar Pr@@ ad@@ esh .
&quot; after the video projection , the women were trying to get discussion with a practice . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked every participant in the name of her husband with different emotions - happy , angry , sad , aff@@ ection@@ ate and so on . &quot;
&quot; then she asked them all , &quot; If we cannot say the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us how they want , meaning that they do not respect us ? &quot;
should it not be equal ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married since 30 years and this was the first day to whom they brought the name of their hus@@ band@@ men on their lips , &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about the Bre@@ aks of a centuries @-@ old tradition , in which married women may never speak the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot;
Roh@@ ini tells :
&quot; a woman was so shy that during the whole exercise , only before himself , a different decided to leave the whole of frustration against him and his family by passing it . &quot;
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; even in the adren@@ alin @-@ exchange rate , with an ur@@ old bro@@ ker decided , the women that they would actually try to call their sp@@ ouses in the name . &quot;
and they kept their word .
in the next days Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas they put in the head : his wife could not stop his name to say his name .
another club member chose to do it during the dinner outside the whole family .
&quot; when her mother @-@ in @-@ law she was rigi@@ d , she was afraid and said that there was an error . &quot;
&quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said , I will do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant in was less understanding and the situation art@@ ed in violence .
&quot; Roh@@ ini reports as women have tried to stop other practices , such as tr@@ ap of the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot on the forehead , which shows the Eh@@ est@@ atus : &quot;
why do women have to show that they are married ?
&quot; I said to my husband , that I would carry the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot when he was doing it too . &quot;
he laughs and I heard it to carry him .
&quot; the other women have not completely c@@ eased to c@@ eased , but my , they are now in a better position to choose himself , not to bear it in some days . &quot;
&quot; for many women , the discussion is a safe place where they can exchange opinions and objectives . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip to each discussion . &quot;
usually we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; I don &apos;t want to make the women make sure who could hear what could hear , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; during the past few months , they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes ; they danced and spoke about things that they had never had thought before . &quot;
Roh@@ ini said :
&quot; I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I also have over some things , for example like our identi@@ ties to our hus@@ bands , have never been so honest . &quot;
&quot; it feels great to say certain things , no matter how small they occur . &quot;
in a discussion round we talked about the concept of honor and how it is related to clothes .
some women in the group have carried only Sar@@ is since their marriage .
&quot; for most is the okay , but some wanted a sal@@ ine @-@ Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a p@@ ants , they have not dre@@ amed . &quot;
&quot; after a lot of arguments and discussion on the mer@@ its of own kl@@ ace , mor@@ als linked to the Sar@@ is and much more , bl@@ ug@@ ged Roh@@ ini her own couple of cur@@ t@@ as ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) in a discussion round , so that women could carry them . &quot;
&quot; next they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can carry je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is certain that they will create it . &quot;
&quot; to the question whether in the five months since its first discussion , Roh@@ ini confirmed that things are slowly coming into the roles : &quot;
we have done so far only small steps .
&quot; some women tried it a few times , but then heard again to say the name of her spouse . &quot;
&quot; some , included me , make it still , but only if they are alone and no other family members are included . &quot;
&quot; just one or two will continue to say the name of her husband , just one or two women now wearing Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their forehead . &quot;
women in the discussion will know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the fe@@ eder to find more freedom of movement or their own car@@ eers - at the end of a difficult to navigate .
&quot; by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot;
how Roh@@ ini explained :
each of us is a victim of the patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am also .
but this club gives each one of us the confidence that something will change .
&quot; and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when each woman goes in the club , and other people about what we talk about , and what we do . &quot;
we are all sitting in the same boat .

&quot; another group , the aim of ass@@ ass@@ ination for obsc@@ ure purposes is , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; this led to this , that the UN 2016 conducted a mission in the South African country to investigate these practice . &quot;

this story was originally published on 8 July 2017 in Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version is published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
&quot; the case of the endo@@ wed Chinese disco Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has attracted attention to the international community , after his lawyer had been announced at the end of June he had been delivered to the hospital for liver cancer in the final stages . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ u was sentenced to 11 years in prison on the draft of the Charter 08 , a Mani@@ fes@@ to which was involved in the democratic reforms in China . &quot;
he was awarded for his work in 2010 with the Nobel Peace Prize .
&quot; the State Department in China has called Li@@ us case as &quot; &quot; internal matter &quot; &quot; and tells a speaker , he did not require it as &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot;
&quot; yet China continues to receive views from the international community , the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , release or permit him treatment abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely eliminated . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has sum@@ mar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
united nations
&quot; Zei@@ de R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the Hoch@@ kom@@ miss@@ ary of the United Nations for Human Rights , met the case of Li@@ u at the end of June . &quot;
&quot; however , a spokes@@ man sent it to comment whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to enable Li@@ u in foreign countries . &quot;
Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ Ã¸r@@ ge Br@@ ing have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
&quot; the relationship between China and Norway came into Sto@@ cks , after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian Government sets out that this is ultimately nothing to do with the decision . &quot;
&quot; the diplomatic relations were continued only in December last year . only in June , Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon ride after China , since the exports have been largely blocked since 2010 . &quot;
&quot; after the message had spread that Li@@ u was serious , the Nobel Committee brought its hope for a unconditional release for the expression and lu@@ d Li@@ u , to take its price in Oslo . &quot;
&quot; due to his det@@ ention , he was not able to stand his prize . &quot;
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
&quot; on July 6 , the European Parliament adopted a decision to liber@@ ate with China , Li@@ u and his wife to free from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support , where he wants . &quot;
&quot; the leaders of the EU , Federica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , called for the release of Li@@ us , as in a statement on June 30 , 2009 : &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we expect to raise all restrictions from Mr. Li@@ us wives , as well as family members . &quot;
&quot; they shall meet all the visits , who wish to receive and receive them , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world . &quot;
USA
&quot; U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad shared with that the Americans &quot; wish him , that he has the opportunity for the treatment abroad , in this respect it was with his recovery . &quot;
&quot; a speech of the U.S. Embassy in China , Mary Beth Poll@@ ey , announced the message agency AF@@ P on 27 June , that the message sent the Chinese authorities to release not only Li@@ u , but also his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from her house arrest . &quot;
&quot; the call of the US Embassy moved an angry response from China to himself , with the utter@@ ance of the State of State that &quot; no country has the right to turn into an epic and ir@@ responsible remarks about Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
b@@ oll@@ ey shared with that China should offer the couple :
&quot; protection and freedom , such as travel of travel and access to the medical care of its choice , to which they have used according to Chinese Constitution and legal system as well as international obligations . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Mer@@ kl@@ ey and Ted Cruz introduced a decision in Congress to release the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife uncondi@@ tionally . &quot;
&quot; I urge China to release the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o uncondi@@ tionally , so that he can enter into a proper medical treatment . http : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o &quot;
Germany
&quot; the German government spokes@@ person Steff@@ en Sei@@ bert wrote on 3 July , Berlin hope that Li@@ u &quot; all get the medical support that he needs &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot;
the Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G@@ 20 Summit in Hamburg .
&quot; previously reported diplomatic sources in Beijing the news agency Reu@@ ters that China had great concerns , whether the vor@@ tex might be over@@ sh@@ ado@@ wing for Li@@ u the visit to Hamburg . &quot;
Canada
&quot; on June 28 , the Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um China requested to provide adequate medical care and to give it the opportunity to worry about himself from his family . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ us An@@ attorney told AF@@ P previously , that Li@@ us Woman , Li@@ u X@@ ia could visit him every day , but the police always monitors the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to contact someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact . &quot;
Mc@@ Call@@ um tells you :
&quot; Canada calls China to release his international human rights compul@@ sory , including free speech , to maintain and release the rights of these rights . &quot;
France
&quot; France &apos;s State Department called for China in a declaration on 29 June , Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons : &quot;
&quot; all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receive all treatments which he , regardless where , needs . furthermore , his wife and family have contact to him . &quot;
&quot; although the new@@ s@@ eller France Info already reported that the French government Li@@ u would welcome in the country , the State Department announced that there will be no further information whether France will be able to record it . &quot;
Taiwan
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of the festive affairs in Taiwan called on 27 June to release Li@@ u and to show a greater tolerance to those who have a peaceful means to push political reforms and democratic development . &quot;
&quot; the Tai@@ w@@ anese legisl@@ ator of Yu Me@@ i @-@ nu from the ruling Democratic Pro@@ gress Party called on to allow China to treat the cran@@ ks intellectual li@@ u , to be treated in Taiwan . &quot;
Dalai Lama
&quot; the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed herself in a statement on 28 June around Li@@ u , and gave that many have asked him to pray for li@@ us well being . &quot;
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; it is my faith that the initiatives which he took and was strictly pun@@ ished for which he had managed to build a harmon@@ ious , stable and af@@ flu@@ ent China , which in turn had contributed to a peaceful world . &quot;
&quot; I felt personally and encouraged me , when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the Charter 08 signed , which stands for democracy , freedom and the rule of law in China . &quot;
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .

is Singapore a city or country ?
&quot; the question may appear sil@@ ly , as Singapore is recognized at the international level as an independent state . &quot;
but according to the judiciary Minister K. Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am should be considered Singapore as a city .
this observation has triggered a debate in the blog@@ osph@@ ere .
&quot; during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the New York State Association of the State of New York , the Ministers agreed that many people are cri@@ tici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore , because it is compared to Singapore with other countries . &quot;
he support that Singapore should be considered as a city .
no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy ...
this is where most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; the blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the judicial minister , &quot; &quot; logic to rot@@ ate &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot;
&quot; and then , after all our efforts and effort to create this valuable land , we hear that we are not a country . &quot;
&quot; it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the beginning of a escape from the responsibilities , a must . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , then country is it then ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons caused by Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am was not very no@@ bel : it def@@ enders an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system from Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of what he appeared un@@ wei@@ rd un@@ democr@@ atically . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently guided by a party . &quot;
these cities are democr@@ atically .
&quot; once you reach the core point of the theme , the good old cor@@ es emerg@@ es from the author@@ itarian rulers , who pres@@ ided Democrats , leave the twi@@ sted logic , since it adap@@ ts better to their power . &quot;
&quot; in the last week , the answers to his American guests were given to our press , our Ju@@ dic@@ ative , our political system really non @-@ answers . &quot;
corresponding questions tar@@ den@@ er with non @-@ answers rational style .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am to illustrate his opinion because they did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to sw@@ allow .
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , but a city is to which country belongs to our city ... &quot;
&quot; in short , I understand nothing . &quot;
&quot; I would be very grateful if our value K Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am would take the effort to clear that point , unless he was paid high in order to be part of the government of the city Singapore . &quot;
&quot; by trying on his comments on his blog , he points to the critics that one should begin to read the full statement of the conference to better understand the context of the statements of Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ in , according to which Singapore is a city and no land . &quot;
read the in@@ scription .
&quot; when he said that Singapore is more a &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; than a country , &quot; &quot; explained why elections in Singapore is so un@@ equal , even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot;
he worked in Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party to win ? ) .
&quot; when he said , Singapore is not a country , &quot; he obviously meant not meant in this sense ! &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his disappointment about Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am , who is as leaders of a her@@ an@@ growing generation , such a pol@@ em@@ ic statement . &quot;
I am about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore has said to be very playful ...
&quot; at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Gar@@ de , what I expect - I do not agree with them or not , but this is another thing . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am , a member of the new generation of political leaders from Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes that he is defended . &quot;
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review zer@@ zes the weakness of Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ ams arguments :
&quot; has Mr Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am &quot; &quot; good &quot; &quot; or was it a defi@@ ant transl@@ ator ? &quot;
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , we only be viewed as an independent and sovereign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , on which country go back the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore ? &quot;
&quot; Singapore is unique , it is equally country and city . &quot;
&quot; as he plays an important role within the government , the statements of Mr Shan@@ m@@ ug@@ am is of serious significance . &quot;
&quot; why do the city of Singapur make their military service , they defend only their city but not their country ? &quot;
who need to pay our Prime Minister invo@@ ices ?
what is the value of our pink recruitment ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; the magazine Jour@@ ney of a Dec@@ ade to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore is and always a city : &quot;
&quot; I did not say , what I said ... &quot;
this sentence seems to have anno@@ yed a lot of fun . ...
nobody ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; defense of the country especially &quot; &quot; etc . , but that is not quite true . &quot;
we should rather talk about the defense of the city .
the myth of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Fl@@ anders
screens@@ hot of a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices recently asked his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your residence or home country ?
&quot; your answers will be published here as part of a continuous series , with the ru@@ m@@ ors of certain parts of the world , and another fac@@ et is to be shown . &quot;
&quot; the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
&quot; the question which is most asked me in Japan , is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; no , I am sorry , &quot; &quot; I answered . &quot; &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; &quot; since 1994 I live up and back in Japan . &quot;
&quot; depending on the situation the conversation takes place , it is regarded as polite , interest in his inter@@ vie@@ we@@ es by showing personal questions . &quot;
&quot; then the standard answering said : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice hockey , nature . &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans cook maybe internally from anger , if they are held for Americans , but don &apos;t distur@@ b it . &quot;
&quot; for someone who does not know itself , there is little that distingu@@ ishes us Can@@ adi@@ ans from Americans . &quot;
this is one of the reasons why so many can@@ adi@@ ans have a Canadian flag well visible on their back@@ pack when they travel .
all love Can@@ adi@@ ans .
Americans in contrast ... .
&quot; it was that way I began to travel around the world 20 years ago - in front of Donald Tru@@ mp , before the invasion of Iraq and the 11th of September . &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always worn small map@@ le leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care system !
with us there is no weapons !
gender equality in Canada have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
&quot; all seem to think , Canada is so great . &quot;
we are polite .
we obviously say very often &quot; sorry . &quot;
Canada is also regarded as the toler@@ ant country against ethnic groups .
we are not like these types south of the border .
we Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate .
&quot; first , I have many American friends , which I admired . &quot;
there would be nothing to me if you would like to change Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
there are also some problems with the stamp . &quot;
&quot; firstly : &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; to be called &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; is basically to be pointed out - like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle , but portable un@@ important figure N@@ ed Fl@@ anders from &quot; The Simp@@ son &quot; ( who has one &apos;s own Canadian twin ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada is really a nation full of people like N@@ ed Fl@@ anders , this would be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; no personality has . &quot;
&quot; there are no corners and edges , nothing , where you can encounter . &quot;
&quot; harmless , be in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and un@@ interesting to be and no attention to deserve . &quot;
&quot; this can be something good if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , distant from the things that happen around one . &quot;
&quot; I would even begin to say , say that the desire to be free , and alone , a leading edge of the Can@@ adi@@ ans . &quot;
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
&quot; what are listed as &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy . &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans do not often talk about the fence with neighbours .
&quot; we lack the warm , open kindness which I connect with my American friends . &quot;
fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) J@@ ustin Tru@@ de@@ au the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada straight to sexy .
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ odi@@ zed Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
&quot; one in Thailand famous pop @-@ band released a music video which the Jun@@ ta par@@ odi@@ zed , which in 2014 have the power to restore and restore the civil government , continues to restore the country . &quot;
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells of which rules he makes his girlfriend .
&quot; although not expressly political , the music video is indirectly related to the continued military su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of the Jun@@ ta . &quot;
the band was praised by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video of the song was an amazing success .
&quot; only within the first three days , this was issued on Facebook @-@ loaded video 1.@@ 254 times and received 8,@@ 800 Li@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; last month , even the Charlie @-@ Chap@@ lin @-@ Video &quot; &quot; The dict@@ ator was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists received the public to look at this video . &quot;
&quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , in@@ particular about how it beh@@ aves with the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule . &quot;
&quot; take a look at the videos of the video , which in some of the political issues relate to Thailand in the past three years . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; might refer to the dr@@ ak@@ onian section 44 of the provisional Constitution , which is granted the chief command of the He@@ eres absolute decision @-@ making of important national issues . &quot;
&quot; 11 . rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the &quot; &quot; Adjust@@ ing program &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other persons who are regarded by the Jun@@ ta as critics . &quot;
&quot; the image above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose v@@ age and un@@ clear rules are often used by the authorities to endor@@ sed activists and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , a new unit was established in the army , super@@ vised by online content and persons , to which the monarchy is thrown , and prosec@@ uted the monarchy . &quot;
Thailand is a stri@@ k@@ le set against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ est@@ ant ) .
on 20 May 2014 in Thailand the war was right .
two days later it came to a coup of the army .
&quot; one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to be prosec@@ uted , is their decision expensive sub@@ boats to buy even though safety experts they war@@ ned that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax fraud . &quot;
&quot; in the video , even as people are thrown into a black stock , before one brings them into an inter@@ ruption camp , another problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists are sitting in prison , because they supposedly have caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and Internet users will have long adhesi@@ on , they should off@@ end the monarchy . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile the te@@ aser of the songs members of the band performed the Sal@@ ut of &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by coup opponents during protests in 2014 . &quot;
life continues to be in the ruins of the Gei@@ ster@@ st cities in the eastern f@@ antasi@@ es .

&quot; the post @-@ war society recovered only very slowly in East @-@ east Asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al . &quot;
&quot; it has passed over 20 years since the Georgian @-@ ab@@ arian war has been officially ended , but its s@@ cars are still heavily visible in this part of the Republic . &quot;
the abandoned villages of the northern District in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al display distinctive pictures .
&quot; villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ ht@@ a , Poly@@ ana and Khar@@ chil@@ ava are in the carbon basin of Ab@@ ch@@ Asia . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , Ab@@ f@@ antasi@@ es , Geor@@ gi@@ ers and Armen@@ ians lived and worked in the area together . &quot;
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
today the largest part of Russians and Ab@@ ch@@ ases are living in the area .
such settlements are also called vul@@ va @-@ cities .
&quot; in the post @-@ war period more than 10.000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people living in this spirit . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al characteristic .
&quot; since 2011 , the total population of 16@@ ,000 people amo@@ unted to over a decade after over a decade . &quot;
1989 about 43.@@ 000 people lived in this district .

&quot; &quot; &quot; it all is a consequence of the war &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the empty five @-@ story blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 60s , who are called &quot; Chr@@ usch@@ ek@@ u@@ kow@@ kas are symbolic of the decline and the devast@@ ation of the region . &quot;
the buildings are falling and very rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a local older man .
he starts a conversation and it is finding it hard to finish this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it all is a consequence of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot;
it is still unique . &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
&quot; there was common centers , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens who are all of the community . &quot;
now there are only paved road with infl@@ atable splend@@ or buildings .
people who once lived at this place and their contribution to the central plan of the Soviet Union have already abandoned the district .
in the Gei@@ ster@@ stadt D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha live approximately fifty inhabitants .
&quot; about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar . &quot;
&quot; the ch@@ amo@@ ch@@ ow@@ kas , which are still one or two families , one can recognize in the balconies , where laundry is dried . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house . &quot;
&quot; when they discover me with the camera in the hand , they move away immediately . &quot;
&quot; our mother hath banned us to let us photograph us , &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; she has just forbidden to us , that &apos;s all . &quot;
the girl whis@@ per@@ ed her girlfriend little to and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence industry ( cultivation of agricultural products for the own needs ) such as cattle farming and vegetables .
it is difficult to come about the rounds .
&quot; the district administration provides free candles , and bread to the villages in winter . &quot;

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build Zu@@ c@@ chini &quot;
about ten years ago an older woman moved with the name Gal@@ ina ( or a@@ unt G@@ alya as it is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
&quot; despite their oldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina does not live in front of Ab@@ f@@ antasi@@ es to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ f@@ antasi@@ es . &quot;
Gal@@ ina wants to take no financial assistance from her daughter and insist that they were supported by her young children .
Gal@@ inas monthly monthly r@@ ents are just nine dollars .
&quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot;
a@@ unt G@@ alya tells that she and other vill@@ agers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building .
&quot; if holidays are , we are visiting us . &quot;
but we cannot do this - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot;
&quot; while she tells her story , a younger neighbour appears on the balcony . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ asch@@ a , &quot; is calling T@@ ante G@@ alya &quot; . &quot; they said , we could build Zu@@ c@@ chini . &quot;
I already prepared the floor .
&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build Zu@@ c@@ chini . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything , &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as conversation in Nat@@ asch@@ a has lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ asch@@ a was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she is reminded of the village just before the war .
&quot; despite the relative , which live in central Russian , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the land of Ab@@ ch@@ Asia was just gone ) , they did not have the chance to leave it . &quot;

&quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative det@@ er@@ pillars in Ab@@ ch@@ Asia ) .
&quot; we want to build a house there , but that will still take something &quot; &quot; explains it . &quot;
Nat@@ asch@@ a receives for every child approximately $ 9 child money .
her husband works in the Kohl@@ eng@@ ru@@ be .
the young family has its own farm .
&quot; near the house where Nat@@ asch@@ as kinder@@ garten was once , they hold pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chickens . &quot;
&quot; it tells that it was first a very fright@@ ening situation , when many people were leaving the village after the war . &quot;
but in the course of time they lost their amendment .

&quot; &quot; &quot; we have no fear of the dark road or the few people . &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
&quot; in fact , it has something to do with lo@@ oting . &quot;
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived as they were right .
I remember every day as the city and the war once were .
&quot; when our conversation comes to the end , a little boy is passing by us . &quot;
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hidden .
a ball flies from the window and another boy j@@ agt him back .
&quot; he plays with the ball , who went down the hill . &quot;
a group of children now pursu@@ es the ball .
&quot; while they run , some of them throw stones on the exp@@ iry building . &quot;
these ruins are a part of their childhood that care for ignorance in their lives .
you do not know it differently .

&quot; I visited one of these places in the Mexican City of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he is located at the border to Guatemala . &quot;
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
&quot; it is headed by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican , a small woman with a cor@@ als @-@ pink Bri@@ ll@@ en@@ gest@@ ell and gold @-@ coloured chain rings in Ted@@ dy @-@ style . &quot;
she is called Concepci@@ Ã³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless they know many of the names of Mama Africa .
&quot; this nickname is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) became a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tian , who are on the journey . &quot;
the hotel has no charm whatsoever .
&quot; for approximately 2.50 dollars the night sleep in simple rooms , with table , cru@@ m@@ bling walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a cage .
there is no sign@@ post to the hotel - nevertheless there are hundreds of African and ha@@ tian migrants here .
&quot; sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez , people come to full small buses and from the upper part of the coast to call it : &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot;
where are you mom Africa ? . &quot;
&quot; at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez has received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some have even slept out on boxes . &quot;
it does not want to decline anyone .
&quot; she also helps them and brings them to hospital when they are sick , they buy drugs that they can not pay them , they mass@@ aged them with a bal@@ sam made by the long journey of de@@ pl@@ eted feet . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , is recently arrived . &quot;
I asked him if M@@ um Africa is a reasonable nickname for Mrs Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family Sebasti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i who has a yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ ee ) qui@@ ert with Concepci@@ Ã³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .

&quot; yes , yes , &quot; reply with a smile . &quot; I really feel that it adap@@ ts to her , as African women are very nice women . &quot;
very aff@@ ection@@ ate .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
&quot; Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister , who hopes to reach Boston to Boston , to find her husband and the three children . &quot;
&quot; they have lived in Brazil , however , it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to make normal a first stop in South America and then move towards north . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard from other directions of Mama Africa . &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is a familiar name on the track &quot; &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
he tells that the Hai@@ tian and the Afri@@ cans often go along the track and that the Afri@@ cans already speak to W@@ hat@@ s@@ app by Mrs Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
&quot; like many of his travel guides , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil before and has worked as a construction workers on the construction of the Olympic Games and the football World Championship . &quot;
&quot; when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he started his journey into the United States . &quot;
&quot; he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sold SI@@ M cards to save the necessary money , to purchase the B@@ usti@@ cket to Ti@@ juana . &quot;
I ask him if he will contact his wife Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez in the future .
&quot; mom Africa is our mother and we never let them go back , &quot; &quot; reply smiling . &quot; we will always stay in contact . &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells her guests often send text messages if they have gone to gr@@ ading them or to report her about the course of her journey .
she explains that their Christian faith in the drive of her work is .
&quot; she does not know much about Africa , but their guests have brought her together to prepare chickens like in Ghana . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but it is not the only funk for the migrants that travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula . &quot;
at the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
&quot; this winter , Valencia and his family were recorded in their small house . &quot;
he is polic@@ eman and has established that the B@@ usti@@ ckets are sold to numerous African migrants too expensive .
&quot; he has begun to help them to get a reasonable price , then he has offered them his house for a dollar night . &quot;
&quot; at the moment 25 people are there , mainly Hai@@ ti@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; some sleeping on blankets on the ground , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a kitchen outside . &quot;
Valencia explains that he knows what the guests will go through .
&quot; I have lived in the United States , he tells . &quot; I have experienced what they experience . &quot;
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s why I give them my support .
&quot; after having lived for three years , he was transferred to a raid on his work place from the United States . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants who travels through Tap@@ ach@@ ula , comes from Central America , other inhabitants also open the doors of their houses for them . &quot;
JosÃ© Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ Ã©@@ n@@ dez tells me that he had fled to people in Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to be black@@ ma@@ iled from him without having a plan .
&quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for accommodation and a well @-@ known , an all @-@ one @-@ educ@@ ator , has offered him its roof . &quot;
&quot; a few months later the family lives still there , and tries to decide where the next steps should go . &quot;
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests .
in the courses the travelers are looking for their teleph@@ ones .
&quot; a mini@@ bus has arrived today and has 20 new guests , a majority of Somalia . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic because of those who have gone . &quot;
&quot; like a proud mother , she pet@@ ed her album with numerous photos . &quot;
&quot; there are one of her daughter with African hair @-@ genuine , which you made a customer in , some photos of their grand@@ children and many travellers more , boy and Old . &quot;
she laughs sad@@ dened , while she puts it briefly before . &quot;
&quot; Ya se fu@@ eron , &quot; repeated it every time . &quot; you have already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang inhabitants are forced to install on their phones to install a surveillance app .
&quot; a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang from Twitter @-@ users , doubles or double . &quot;
&quot; the residents of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minorities region in the West China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their phones . &quot;
&quot; on July 10 , the mobile user in the Ti@@ an@@ shan district of the city of Uru@@ m@@ qi introduced a cell phone , in which it indicates the District Government named J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web cleaning &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in the message , the app is said to have access to terrorist information . &quot;
&quot; however , the public authorities use the app for more than the fight against terrorism . &quot;
&quot; according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h Women in the autonomous I@@ li Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ fecture , because it was installed shortly after they had installed the app , messages with a private We@@ chat group . &quot;
&quot; in the message of the police , the app has to determine the sources and distribution paths of terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ w@@ angs website describes the app as follows :
&quot; J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ ph@@ er@@ u Tel@@ ecom . &quot;
&quot; the main function is the block@@ ers porno@@ graphic websites , by online sc@@ am , Tro@@ jan@@ ers and ph@@ ishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online , and to control their own home network . &quot;
this app with the fil@@ tering for min@@ ors should help the children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in a variety of ways .
&quot; for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; state actors or even h@@ acker can manipul@@ ate the home network of a person to manipul@@ ate or ste@@ al from it . &quot;
this introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
&quot; during the news about digital c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in China mostly focus on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south , the reality is very often d@@ ull for those who live in remote , fright@@ ened ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; to rest and limit dis@@ cont@@ ent@@ ment in the conflict @-@ areas , the authorities often arrange extreme z@@ ens@@ es and surveillance measures as well as rout@@ in@@ em@@ ental Internet de@@ activ@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; the media based on Twitter @-@ based Media Out@@ let &quot; Images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( double ) , a solo ) , published photographs by a check@@ point where polic@@ emen showed the residents op@@ tionally , whether they had installed the surveillance app . &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification calls for the people to install the app within 10 days .
&quot; if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , it could be det@@ ained up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a set@@ back for the technological development .
&quot; you have forced the people to use devices , which are intended for elderly people . &quot;
this is a form of cap@@ tivity through the rest of the air @-@ awakening technology .
we are back in ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( or female ) , a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , from which indicates that the software can lift the passwords request of a Windows operating system and thus receives unlimited access to the computer &apos;s hard drive . &quot;
after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang Computer and phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang will become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
&quot; the provisions in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may have a response to the instructions of the City of Party , to minimize the dissem@@ ination of illegal content . &quot;
&quot; all government branches , authorities and the party connected institutions including universities and research institutions are oblig@@ ated to follow the instructions of Cyber@@ security office in operation of their computer and communication devices . &quot;
&quot; a current report by Freedom House , an American human rights organisation , also mentioned this new monitoring methods : &quot;
&quot; in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Uru@@ m@@ qi - a regulation with the directive to all residents and entrepreneurs , until 1 August , their &quot; personal ID cards , phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards . &quot;
&quot; the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos , however , this action is infring@@ ing the personal rights of Uru@@ m@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants , and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole range of other possible exp@@ ir@@ ation , including those that relate to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot;
sleep or death ; part 1 : everything sh@@ ears to death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

&quot; this is the first of six reports in series &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane was depic@@ ted his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot;
&quot; far away from our blue , virtual world you look at and stell@@ est that you &apos;re all alone in one place where everything has disappeared . &quot;
&quot; everything has gradually solved , and un@@ v@@ eils a truth that is clearly recognizable from the inside and outside . &quot;
one that makes her name all honour .
one that has moved into a list of feelings and expres@@ sions that no met@@ aph@@ ors allow .
&quot; but if you get the reality back again and you are behind the scenes - beyond the actor , the beautiful scenes and the performers - transform itself the characters in beings from meat and blood , and all sh@@ ears to death . &quot;
&quot; all doubts solve themselves into smoke and you will be aware of your existence , even if the earth are caught on the axis of the un@@ hei@@ r . you will be sure that you are caught between the walls , that your parents , and in front of them your grand@@ parents , stone to build stone . &quot;
&quot; they have been arrested me and my Father in three times , but it still didn &apos;t allow me to be &quot; &quot; my lesson &quot; , &quot; as the manager of the security , it form@@ ulated - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot;
he presented his power over us by proof of even the simpl@@ est concepts that we know .
&quot; five teenagers were bitten by a peaceful protests , such as discomfort from the beautiful garden of our revolution . &quot;
&quot; it turned out to make the city the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; scre@@ ams . &quot;
&quot; all the city districts , only my own not . &quot;
&quot; for the first time it was silent , rainy , at the wrong time , even if I did not meet high demands on a town which is up to the arter@@ ies with state safety organisms and their compli@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; in the third night , things had a bit cal@@ med after the power supply in the quarter had to work . &quot;
&quot; I broke the silence , by going several times &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; from my pet . &quot;
I heard my voice through the silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends were brave enough to gather together .
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , true friends joined me ; we made us a great picture that my expectations fully filled and filled . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment you are aware that you are be@@ aming the spirit from the lamp , but it simply is not interested in the righteous . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my father , &quot; &quot; makes you ready , we meet with the military security building . &quot;
he laid down .
&quot; then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can go down - nothing can give you your voice back , after you did all the way up to the office of the security service out of the body . &quot;
I came there .
the Ober@@ st Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there as I now also .
&quot; the Ober@@ st Gh@@ ass@@ an starts to speak , &quot; &quot; let me hear how you cry &apos;@@ ahu , or you are only cour@@ ageous enough to cry out if we are not in the vicinity . &quot;
his h@@ asser@@ tive eyes turned out to me .
&quot; and you mo@@ urn thee what to look into the eyes , and not on the ground ! &quot;
what I did then have nothing to do with courage .
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood before this building . &quot;
&quot; perhaps it was on my tor@@ y@@ ness , van@@ ity , and perhaps in the revolution . &quot;
&quot; I was so sure of my job , when I said , &quot; I had not thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot;
&quot; and I think I have never stopped to look into the eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the shortest conversation , which could have such fat@@ ale consequences for me , and yet I regret not a word of what I said . &quot;
&quot; is him in sol@@ it@@ ary , and his father equal to them . &quot;
&quot; his father immediately with it . &quot;
the cliffs of this decrease in the nose is up to me today in the nose .
&quot; he became a &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; , &quot; a se@@ el@@ ian torture , which I was exposed to months . &quot;
I am kno@@ w@@ down the farm .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with myself .
&quot; then again through the farm and into the second office , which leads through a course to the single cells . &quot;
I give myself all the details exactly before I super@@ vise the room .
&quot; different from otherwise , they probably have shared a larger cell . &quot;
&quot; I have to share it with just one another prisoner , and must immediately set me without waiting for their permission . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes they felt like a whole life , the official the cell left , and I laid back on an old @-@ proven communication method : with the f@@ ist against the wall . &quot;
I learned that my cell @-@ fin was a &quot; Er@@ sth@@ el@@ ling &quot; was .
&quot; after a long hes@@ itation , he answered me finally . &quot;
&quot; apparently , in no one of the surrounding cells was a rep@@ utable man middle age , who sees me similar and called &quot; &quot; doctor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the perfect darkness , don &apos;t let me know @-@ marked facial als , and doctors are not here ; we are all just numbers . &quot;
&quot; maybe someone , whose voice is similar to my sounds ? &quot;
all the answers are some of his existence .
perhaps he was moved to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will immediately hear .
&quot; the investig@@ ators had in@@ sured , they would let him free when I stay . &quot;
LÃ¼@@ g@@ ner .
&quot; I would like to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to exp@@ el all these cro@@ ws , which lab@@ ours in the garden of my head . &quot;
&quot; from the distance , I hear it still &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it must be about 10 am in the evening ; always at this time the scre@@ ams , every day . &quot;
the door opens .
&quot; I was always convinced that black is the colour of comprehen@@ sion , until I saw the yellow light that gave us the Gre@@ ys in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; Donn@@ er &quot; , &quot; bac@@ on to 13 S@@ ure of the Quran ) . &quot;
they are here to be heard .
&quot; this was the secret to protect the state of safety before us and to prevent the tra@@ itor , and to prevent terrorists in the al@@ wi@@ tic dial@@ ect - so , they played their con@@ fes@@ sions show and betra@@ yed the narrow field of view of their world view . &quot;
&quot; here is not a house , which is here is not a land ; it is a cur@@ se to call it co@@ existence to transform the crimin@@ als of their sound in a hero . &quot;
&quot; I super@@ vise the hear@@ ings and tre@@ ad on Abu I@@ mad , a sl@@ ender , and stupid man ; at least He will come to me . &quot;
&quot; he begins a &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , &quot; despite the face expres@@ sions , &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life than you can tap into this day and to protest on demonstrations that will soon be an end . &quot;
I rep@@ lied .
I used it acc@@ ust@@ omed to answer .
I can really no longer say when ins@@ ults and blo@@ ws after a friendly conversation for me became an ordinary communication tool .
when and how it happened was un@@ important .
&quot; any voice in me told me that I had to get used to be pun@@ ished , although I had done nothing to earn this punishment . &quot;
at punishment in all its diversity .
its command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls it lovingly &quot; con@@ fes@@ sion . &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube which probably comes from the clo@@ aken .
your Hen@@ ker Gi@@ Å¼y@@ cko to your scre@@ ams .
&quot; give him the pleasure , you cannot measure you with him and you cannot hold your scre@@ aming . &quot;
&quot; my scri@@ be fell or not yet enough , so they used the pipe by a cable . &quot;
&quot; at my first hand , I asked me if the issu@@ ers had worked earlier as a gar@@ bage dump or if that was one of the normal working equipment . &quot;
&quot; they had fled four cable to each other , to present ourselves from their sight , great invention of a huge cable . &quot;
&quot; within one hour , three of them are confused , while I was still standing in the series . &quot;
&quot; I had lost any feeling in my body - and my voice , so I heard to cry out . &quot;
the exec@@ ution@@ er marked the cooling and found not even a favor of it so that he looked up as a neigh@@ bor to an electric loaded run@@ off .
flow through my entire body enough to supply my whole quarter .
&quot; my semi @-@ naked body , the out@@ stretched on the ground was the perfect electricity conductor . &quot;
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back again .
after two terrible hours he decided he had fulfilled his duty for this night .
it must have been so at midnight .
&quot; I decided to sleep myself again , we say that was my only option . &quot;
&quot; some hours left , which came to me as minutes . &quot;
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; the door opens and the morning fills the room &quot; .@@ R@@ aus , with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fic@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; I rep@@ lied with the voice of an un@@ fold young people : &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father has to worry about fear@@ lessly . &quot;
&quot; be quiet and be@@ away you , you will be moved . &quot;
this was new .
otherwise they had always been released .
where do they lead me ? !
&quot; the j@@ ord@@ al Rap@@ per Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b re@@ es over the rights of the LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , free expression and resistance &quot;
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b spends the bulk of his time inside , he sh@@ red@@ ded to his screen , time to his computer , and again to his couch . &quot;
but what one can rely on is a cigarette between his fingers or his ni@@ cot@@ ine lips .
&quot; he lives in the top of his family house , which had been part of them since 1967 ; the year in which Israel was completed his occupation of the West Bank , and H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs were forced to escape from their village in Palestine in which she lived as fel@@ ah@@ y@@ een ( about : Far@@ mer ) . &quot;
&quot; for six years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who faces the conservative majority and inter@@ viewed their old opinions on gender roles , sexuality and freedom of expression by art and Rap@@ music . &quot;
&quot; with his music that often sets up with themes such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , but also calls for the core of the whole Arab world . all these issues do not only find in his hom@@ etown Am@@ man Rel@@ ev@@ ance but also in cities that wealthy from Damascus in Syria up to San@@ aa in Yemen . &quot;
&quot; with his 25 years H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees himself as someone who is not restricted in his mind , and he may feel according to his own statement by people who suffer the devast@@ ating consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if he does not open it openly , he defeated an extra incl@@ ination against the US foreign policy . &quot;
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by author .
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b doesn &apos;t believe that his compassion for those who try to do in war areas , anything with his identity as &quot; Palestinian escape of the second generation &quot; - so he himself was born , even if he was born in Jordan , and has never been in Palestine . &quot;
&quot; I do not think of my own living conditions so , &quot; says H@@ d@@ ai@@ b . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; I think that because I am a man , while he sho@@ cked in water off the Nes@@ cafÃ© in two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan ; in this time it is provided for Muslims , from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the j@@ ord@@ al law also states that the public consumption of food during the Ram@@ adan is illegal .
&quot; obviously , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weakness for it to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee on a sen@@ ing hot jun@@ c@@ ag has little to do with protest against Islam . &quot;
&quot; basically , the beats of hot coffee and the sw@@ ades of the K@@ ent cigarette in the nose primarily speak of freedom . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , Jordan is like a prison in the open sky , especially when you thro@@ ws a look into the neighbouring countries . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is easy to avoid basic things - as in the public during the Ram@@ adan &apos;s water - to not land in prison . &quot;
&quot; recently , the Ministry of Jord@@ anian has announced an appearance of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , already for the second time . &quot;
&quot; some MPs , which support the Islamic Action Front - the j@@ ord@@ anic branch of the Muslim Br@@ otherhood - argu@@ ed that the sexual orientation of hom@@ os@@ ex@@ ual fron@@ tier Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o , contradi@@ cts the cultural and traditional norms of the country , and the main reason for the concert . &quot;
&quot; the MP and former press conference in the Islamic coalition D@@ IMA Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N , that the concert was said &quot; &quot; because of the sexual orientation of the sc@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; in addition , many claim the commitment of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world may be dangerous activ@@ ism , which represents the old @-@ proven legitimacy of author@@ itarian regimes in the entire region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la the j@@ ord@@ al people as &quot; &quot; progressive suppor@@ ter of human rights &quot; , &quot; which continue to work &quot; for an intellectual and cultural plur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; this statement may probably not be simply sei@@ zed rh@@ et@@ oric , but actually a more evident cryst@@ alli@@ ed reality in Jordan reflect that in H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs work clearly appears . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b traditional sex @-@ tern@@ or@@ men to Lei@@ be , he formed his vision of the fate of Arab women , who made pre@@ y sex . &quot;
&quot; the picture shows the skel@@ eton of a apparently crus@@ hed unknown wife , whose arms and legs are up to the corners of the canvas . &quot;
&quot; it is surrounded by a red lake , perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives through their hands they should trust . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , the number of &apos; Ehr@@ en@@ mor@@ de &apos; has risen in Jordan - the in@@ official outside . &quot;
&quot; according to her climax , the number of hon@@ orary mor@@ de in 2016 reached its peak ; however , the Jordan is still lacking the institutional infrastructure is missing to support the women who tried to support the victims of murder or domestic violence . &quot;
&quot; according to a law on fighting corruption from the year 1954 , women who are exposed to danger in@@ tra @-@ family violence , and for their release is often a years of anger , and the guarantee of the family is necessary that the woman will happen nothing . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs music enjoys great popularity and is known for it , also not to be back on topics , which in his country has long as tab@@ ern@@ acle . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b cont@@ est@@ ly that his work is political , but it is that he cannot separate his music , the full explicit approach to sexuality , freedom and expression , not of politics . &quot;
&quot; I come from the Middle East , Man . &quot;
&quot; I was rede@@ emed policy , &quot; he says . &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b takes the question of the Palestinian identity .
&quot; in &quot; &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; &quot; and in &quot; &quot; G@@ har@@ e@@ eb &quot; &quot; is the focus on poverty . &quot;
&quot; the list of songs that are political , can be moved to the core . &quot;
&quot; in March 2016 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b released a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated many times :
&quot; you are free , and every other is it too . &quot;
&quot; in the further course of the song H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a kind of market , on which one can get what you want &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ faith , sp@@ eter@@ o- or homosexu@@ ality . &quot;
he noticed that hardly someone speaks in Jordan over the rights of gay and les@@ bi@@ ans and that comments on the equality of LGB@@ T@@ Q + -@@ individuals were still heavily c@@ ens@@ ored .
&quot; in 2014 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b conducted an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ ian Onlin@@ e@@ Program Ro@@ ya , in order to remember that his comments were ens@@ ored from the context , distor@@ ted his opinion . &quot;
&quot; on Youtube it was up@@ loaded without cuts , but it was only a processed version , &quot; says he . &quot;
&quot; today , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is open to the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that intoler@@ ance towards homosexu@@ als do not un@@ lock the Islam . &quot;
&quot; he mentioned Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the eighth century , who has remained in memory thanks to his hom@@ o@@ erotic poems . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks themselves : if Abu Nu@@ what would work later on behalf of the Cali@@ ph , in the eighth century could write openly about homosexu@@ ality , why can Jord@@ an@@ ir that not ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , so H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled . &quot;
&quot; in the H@@ ash@@ em@@ i@@ tic Kingdom , there is nothing new that the government attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are brought to silence . &quot;
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , took place in January 2017 , took place several former governmental office and members of the teacher @-@ association with the justi@@ fication , they would have cri@@ tici@@ zed on comments in social media , which expressed deep in the country with the deeply rooted in the country . &quot;
&quot; in view of this , the concert H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs should say only the tip of the ic@@ eberg - the real challenge is to effect a structural change in the next generation of the Jordan River . &quot;
&quot; for him progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la has now turned into a gig , but the path of progress - it looks for slow , printed and inner changes . it is certain that these changes occur from day to day at the heart of the j@@ ord@@ an society . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , also , from an Arab world without intervention from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he not only dreams of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem , and Damascus , but also of it . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region is bound by music , art and literature of genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bom@@ bs , spreading uni@@ tions , and on artificial nature . at least , he hopes that . &quot;
&quot; until it is as far as it is , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b will continue , and thus also res@@ ist . &quot;

Neb@@ o in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the three largest festivals in Japan .
this great , extravag@@ ant warri@@ ors are so fantastic ! ! ! &quot;
there are numerous theories concerning the origin of the neb@@ uta Festivals .
&quot; we suspected that it is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of To@@ ho@@ kus . another theory has been enriched over a thousand years and come from a time , in the armies of the West Japan in the northeast , to force the Indi@@ gen@@ ous inhabitants of the region to force the dam@@ sel . &quot;
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we could pick up a few great seats , so we have a great view . &quot;
you can only imagine how big these parts are ...
&quot; a community center in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , hosted a two months exhibition to W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally . &quot;
I have been looking for the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en once a long time : two mar@@ riages are straight to see .
&quot; nevertheless , for many people who take the journey to A@@ om@@ ori , the neb@@ uta Festival is the only True - and still a stunning way to spend his summer : &quot;
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and I looked at the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 meter high ban@@ quet was incredible .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !

&quot; rarely , external appearance and body care were as important as in this story , as they help the Peru@@ vian youth from crime and to promote a legitimate profession like the hair@@ style . &quot;
&quot; El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us important harbour , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean in the vicinity of the historic center of Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where stre@@ aming and illegal drugs are daily . &quot;
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 per cent of the population of this region did not feel secure .
&quot; at the same time , Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men . &quot;
&quot; the trend , appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sports@@ men such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( Brazil ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( Brazil ) , has led to ever more norm@@ alities in the experienced hands of hairdres@@ sers who can make these elaborate hair@@ styles . &quot;
&quot; the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles that go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity , even has an annual event inspired to compete in the competition of the hair@@ s &quot; Bat@@ alla de Barber@@ os , &quot; which has been held since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; there are experts from each other , to show who some of them can create the ec@@ cent@@ ric l@@ ooks , as one can see in the following video ( more videos about current competitions are available on the public Facebook Profile Bat@@ alla de Barber@@ os ) . &quot;
&quot; educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ az@@ ar Bon@@ dy , located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to convince young people to get their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and instead of bad advice on a hair@@ dressing art that allows them to find work . &quot;
&quot; motivated by this activity and the possibilities have seen doz@@ ens of young people that they can take a profession , who is currently in fashion . &quot;
&quot; the school offered a special training workshop in March , and reported on some of their successes : &quot;
&quot; in 1995 we were the only professional school in the community and the district , where we are very proud , because of love for the children we have built this educational community . &quot;
Colombia : love @-@ letter to Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ak@@ aha

&quot; the following article is the revised version of the paper &quot; &quot; Send message to Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ak@@ aha , &quot; which has published the International Online Magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot;
this entry is published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love @-@ letters to people who we know ?
&quot; is it not yet a lot more important to people who feel outside , affection . &quot;
exactly this question went to the two young Colom@@ bian activists of Leonardo P@@ Ã¡r@@ rag@@ a by the Stiftung Bog@@ ot@@ ene and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os by the Young @-@ Youth Foundation no longer of the head and inspir@@ ational it to the campaign Cart@@ as p@@ or la Recon@@ ci@@ li@@ aciÃ³n ( letters to reconciliation ) that young people are encouraged to write guer@@ ri@@ lla letters .
&quot; only recently , her country was a place of historical event and they wanted to contribute to their part , after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace agreement with the guer@@ ri@@ lla bend F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary armed armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; international was the submission of the peace agreement as so significant , that the Colom@@ bian President JosÃ© Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize . &quot;
but in front of the Colom@@ bian people there is still a long way until one can speak of real reconciliation and peace .
&quot; guer@@ ri@@ lla warfare that have lived for many years in illegal bearings , were exposed to war rh@@ et@@ oric , and around the clock , and around the clock , must now be integrated into the life as an civilians . &quot;
&quot; the Colom@@ bian society in turn , who had acc@@ ust@@ omed to life in constant fear and in some cases where they had acc@@ ust@@ omed to guer@@ ri@@ lla warfare , they must take part in their ranks and support them in building a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cr@@ istian were convinced that the young Kolum@@ bi@@ ans had joined together and would help in the integration process .
&quot; and exactly this did they also : until now , thousands of young people have written letters - love @-@ ships to former guer@@ ri@@ lla war to welcome them back in society . &quot;
&quot; the goal of the campaign are 6@@ 900 letters , one for any former guer@@ ri@@ lla warfare , which should then be handed over personally . &quot;
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
&quot; the idea for letters to reconciliation was born on the world summit of the Nobel Peace Prize winner , which was held in February 2017 in Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ . there were Leonardo and Cr@@ istian the opportunity to talk briefly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ ar@@ th@@ i , the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize . &quot;
&quot; this explained that we love the people we love , on Valent@@ ine &apos;s day of love @-@ letter , but those forgotten that they need much needed . &quot;
&quot; he was planning , he told us to share his love with people in this year , the most urgent promise . &quot;
&quot; thus , the plan to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC , who can now find their place in society and establish a new life . &quot; the letters are being prepared to make disco@@ urses of a war history to a common history of peace . &quot;
&quot; so far , more than 2000 letters have been collected within the framework of the campaign . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities of Kolum@@ bi@@ ens , like Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ Ã­n , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ . &quot;
I never thought that someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over on 19 March in one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o Region .
&quot; a group of 40 students from the University of J@@ aver@@ iana in Cal@@ i , two members of the Municip@@ al administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo by the Stiftung Bog@@ ot@@ Art traveled in the camp to get the letters personally . &quot;
the members of the F@@ ARC presented herself as they had done before to have the commands of their leaders .
&quot; but this time they received no prec@@ epts , but the letters of shelter of people from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a very mobile moment for all involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings can be run in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and all that is in @-@ between , and the policy @-@ president Manuela Jim@@ Ã©@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later . &quot;
Sandra Par@@ ra , a employee of the governor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable experience so : &quot;
&quot; after we had passed the letters , led me a former fighter through the camp of the Gu@@ er@@ illa fighters . &quot;
&quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; &quot; ( a kind of hut , in which the guer@@ ri@@ cks live ) , I saw a guer@@ ri@@ ator who wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid of responding , because beside him on the bed there was a M@@ GL @-@ Gran@@ at@@ ter , a deadly weapon in the thorn @-@ sheep . &quot;
&quot; and I said it anyway , and said , &quot; &quot; hello , what do they do ? &quot; he answered , &quot; I answered a letter that has written to me . &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; never in my life someone has written something so nice , so I answered it . &quot; &quot; I suddenly got the tears over the che@@ eks . &quot;
I saw him very firm and set me next to the gran@@ ulates .
&quot; perhaps he was also the p@@ ity , I was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter , and wanted to help him to write this letter . &quot;
&quot; the man told me more about his life . he never had anything else from life than war . himself , the only way to keep him and his six brothers in front of the hunger p@@ to@@ d . &quot; I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes . &quot;
but now I know that there is a society there that is waiting for us with open arms .
&quot; until now , I just learned how I have to deal with weapons . &quot;
&quot; but now where peace is reig@@ ns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
&quot; to the clo@@ cking , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC came to a discussion . &quot;
the students were all raised when war prev@@ ailed and the F@@ ARC already in hiding .
&quot; therefore the leaders of the F@@ ARC the history of the organization , their ideals , and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; &quot; many years ago , we have seen how the social injustice from the state to the whole Colom@@ bian people , we can contribute to shaping the society in this country . &quot;
&quot; for a goal of this size order it is worth to overcome all the obstacles , &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot;
Manuela was impressed :
&quot; to hear these people who had never found in@@ hearing , and acknowledge that the people that I often saw as mon@@ ster and even hate , even people with beautiful feelings that were turned through their living conditions and their environment was very painful for me . &quot;
&quot; the reality , in which the country lives , does hurt . &quot;
&quot; but it ro@@ ast@@ ed me that all men - also those who have killed and so much damage , we can teach us and a smile and a hug . &quot;
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
&quot; Gust@@ avo Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez , the com@@ mander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ Ã­o de Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Arch@@ bishop of the city of Cal@@ i , the following letter : &quot;
&quot; the Kolum@@ bi@@ an@@ ern was made , that after the dr@@ ar@@ ming peace would reign . &quot;
but this is not the case .
&quot; as long as it gives inequality , hunger and lack of education , healthcare and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are ready to grasp the weapons and to protest for their rights . and this is also completely justified ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; from the F@@ ARC , we are now putting peace to a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; therefore , we call all def@@ enders of peace - regardless of which race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and bring victims , as we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence , will face many difficulties . &quot;
&quot; on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them . &quot;

&quot; it follows the translation of an article , which was written by uns@@ rem partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ mak@@ su@@ mo@@ wa and published its first release on the OC Media . &quot;
&quot; hom@@ os@@ ex@@ ual and que@@ ens people who live in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region , are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and ext@@ or@@ tion . &quot;
with terror activists have experienced the reporting of the last months on the persecution of pregnant men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; but the threat , which depends on the dor@@ ous LGB@@ T@@ Q community , is not only about overnight . &quot;
&quot; OC Media had the opportunity to speak with an trans@@ sexual wife from Gros@@ ny , who shared some of their experiences with us and talked about what is happening in the republic . &quot;
&quot; the LGB@@ T@@ Q @-@ law in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has conquered the international head@@ lines prior to several months ago , after reports have been published , torture and killing of qu@@ eer men in the republic . &quot;
&quot; the first report was published by the journalist Elena Mil@@ ash@@ ina in the No@@ wa@@ ja Gas@@ eta ; she cast a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities , the suspected que@@ ens men celebrations , and they put them into secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun . &quot;
&quot; they have brought a mon@@ ster to the world &quot;
&quot; Sabrina , a trans@@ lady , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there . &quot;
&quot; even since their childhood , she felt that she was a woman in reality . &quot;
&quot; when they became growing , it became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , why she moved to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after a group of Ch@@ et@@ ches had experienced their land @-@ wife , the hunt was opened on Sabrina . &quot;
&quot; out of fear for her life , she moved to the USA in the end . &quot;
Sabrina : I was working as a volunteer assistant in a human rights organization .
one day I told me that someone took my help .
&quot; it was a friend of Dag@@ est@@ an , a trans@@ lady who st@@ alled into difficulties . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took them without hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help her , made someone from whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread them anywhere on the internet , with my telephone number and a picture of mine . he sent them to his ch@@ echn@@ ya friends , with following message : &quot; then there is no men more in Ch@@ echn@@ ya who can eliminate these shame ? &quot;
then the photos of my documents made the round of my W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
I was attacked on 10 October 2015 .
&quot; when I was doing just a few shopping m@@ oths from the seat of my car , I heard a men &apos;s voice : &quot; &quot; here is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot;
&quot; when I revol@@ ved , I felt something in my body , but I did nothing hurt . &quot;
&quot; then I heard one sentence , but this time in Che@@ chen : &quot; how long do you want to honor the family yet , you fl@@ our ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
&quot; I just know that there was a young man , no 30 years old . &quot;
then I lost the consciousness and aw@@ oke in the hospital again .
apparently some women had gotten everything and started to cry out .
the man was fled .
the women had called an ambulance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two keywords in my right pul@@ mon@@ ary arms .
OC Media : in what nursing homes were you placed - in the men or women of women ?
&quot; Sabrina : my documents are out@@ dated , there is still my male name dr@@ on ; but the doctor arose and placed me to the women . &quot;
I am very grateful for this .
&quot; when I read his name for the first time in his office for the first time , I got to do it with the fear ; it was a Muslim name , a k@@ au@@ cas@@ ic name . &quot;
but he turned out to be a good man .
I am grateful for him that he is respectful with me .
I spent more than one month in the hospital .
last February I got threats .
&quot; they called me , wrote me - Related , stran@@ gers , some completely unknown . &quot;
this was the beginning of a night@@ club .
my family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives .
the required to return to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that it was all a lie .
&quot; they asked absurd demands : some told me , I am going to prove it by clicking on the roads and say that I had not changed my sex in Gros@@ ny and say that I had not changed my sex , that everything was only bad , and Photoshop . &quot;
I have KÃ¶r@@ b@@ chen@@ size C - what could I say on television ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sabrina : it is still hard for her .
some older people once again spoke my mother on the street .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; They have brought a mon@@ ster to the world that has not only damaged your family , but the whole of the Republic . &quot;
&quot; we cannot sti@@ r you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot;
my mother became too much and she lay down a stri@@ ck around the neck .
fortunately the neighbours came and saved them .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later under the window a car with un@@ covered window wash@@ ers and a number plate with a 95 dr@@ on .
&quot; after it happened for the third time , it was clear to me that there was a little lazy . &quot;
my human rights @-@ friends over@@ tested the number of numbers - it turned out that I was persec@@ uted .
OC Media : how did you fled ?
Sabrina : with the help of activists .
&quot; for safety reasons , I do not want to give their name to the name , but I will say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with their help I left the country , but then something un@@ credi@@ ble . &quot;
I can still not understand how it could be .
just before leaving Moscow I bought a new SI@@ M card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
&quot; I bought it , without sign up without filling out , without anything . &quot;
I broke my old SI@@ M card and cast them into the tr@@ ash .
arrived and checks in the hotel .
the number was on a stran@@ ger .
I put the SI@@ M card into my mobile phone .
&quot; at the moment I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t think about , you warmer in security , just because you have left the country ? &quot;
&quot; our people already know , in which hotel you do . you even know your room number . &quot;
&quot; only to prove it , it is the number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine ? !
this was indeed my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sabrina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; however , we do not talk about the gender equality , but this is a tab@@ u@@ topic . &quot;
some traditionally cas@@ c@@ asi@@ an elements I carry in me still .
so much I wish to do this se@@ perate barrier I can not overcome .
&quot; I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt them . &quot;
&quot; when we chat with a camera , I actually give me effort to watch how the person reminds them from their past - so to my male form . &quot;
but this is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
&quot; what do your friends do , those who have stayed there ? &quot;
Sabrina : I have submitted a report in Washington last week .
for the needed I took up @-@ to @-@ date information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; I spoke with someone , the one and a half months in Ar@@ gun . &quot;
&quot; he told that during the Ram@@ adan were no man arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he didn &apos;t closed a new wave . &quot;
most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives .
&quot; so I mean , they probably invite the relatives to take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end demand a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honour &quot; have experienced by blood Gen@@ ug@@ ment . &quot;
OC Media : are even more pregnant women det@@ ained in this secrecy ?
Sabrina : a familiar with me says it would not be very many .
&quot; if , then above all those who have no rich relatives , or those of their relatives were dropped to place Kad@@ y@@ rows in court . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they are stored there , so that they can present them later than terrorists . &quot;
&quot; say : should they be brought about , you will show their bodies on television and claim , they would have attacked either any village or a military base . &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; as if these people did not simply disappear , but targeted , to radi@@ cal@@ ze . &quot;
OC Media : is this now just a mut@@ ation or do you have a source of this information ?
Sabrina : I just got someone who was det@@ ained in Ar@@ gun .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard has grown .
there has been nothing new of them .
they simply have taken them .
&quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was themselves to be taken as these people . &quot;
&quot; until now they were not presented as band@@ its , but there were no reports yet . we suggest that such actions are quite possible . &quot;
why would you not have allowed these people to shave ?
&quot; do you know whether these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation , already in the past ? &quot;
Sabrina : I have always carried my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
&quot; I think already before 2003 I was already known all over the world , when I lived there - and I never had any problems . &quot;
in the Ernst !
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 when the sh@@ aria was considered , I never had problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , at that time it was much safer than now . &quot;
&quot; Russia was originally intended to lead us to the &quot; civil@@ isation &quot; , but finally , has thrown back to the St@@ one@@ age . &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sch@@ aria law ?
Sabrina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were dressed ; I had colored eyelashes , carried Tu@@ be@@ je@@ ans and short T@@ ops . &quot;
the safety of the sh@@ aria has never had a hair bent on me .
&quot; before the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people as met me . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several ben@@ ches stood , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people met there . &quot;
we have never been poll@@ uted .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a Rede@@ mption : Khar@@ da ma Khar@@ da . that is said : &quot; Sp@@ af@@ rot is not about the un@@ mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
they often say to children when the sick are funny .
&quot; OC Media : so they simply have their eyes closed before you , because they believed , you be sick ? &quot;
Sabrina : yes .
&quot; they have never denied me , never j@@ agt , and never be@@ aten . &quot;
OC Media : how long did this waste time stopped ?
Sabrina : for so long until Kad@@ y@@ row came to the plan .
&quot; as he was appointed Minister of Prime Minister , he began to speak on TV about mor@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; he spoke not about us by se , but primarily on the behavior of women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , one could sense how the people in the city started to change . &quot;
&quot; who had been ri@@ fied , and had suffered before you at once with suspic@@ ion . &quot;
in the time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; but every time I came back home , I was able to feel like the situation in the Republic is steadily deteri@@ or@@ ated . &quot;
OC Media : what activity do you do now ?
Sabrina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t conden@@ sed much - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the USA is not much .
&quot; apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; at present , I am responsible for 15 Muslim women . &quot;
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we organise teac@@ ups , meetings , I take a companion to get them to hospital and help them to get Essen@@ ti@@ des . &quot;
I don &apos;t have long a cent for it .
I discovered these people themselves when I displ@@ aced my escape .
I am Muslim and wants to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sabrina : this is al@@ bern .
&quot; so , nature , that has nothing to do with religion at all . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly the same as Tsch@@ etsch@@ ene , who want to make you with foam in front of the mouth , that there are no sle@@ eves with them . &quot;
&quot; the Dag@@ est@@ ans have which , the cab@@ ar@@ din@@ ers have which , the Russians also have which ; on the entire planet there is - but not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; I come from there , so it is unpleasant to hear what to hear . &quot;
there are so many men from Cau@@ cas@@ us .
&quot; many of them - practicing Muslims , who go into the mosque , and during the Ram@@ adan , live with men together . &quot;
&quot; you know many think about transi@@ tional identity to men who love men , and they believe that man changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but this is a trust@@ ee . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different kinds of feeling to be accurate , different life settings . &quot;
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not ash@@ amed of my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
&quot; I &apos;m sorry that I &apos;m here so personally , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago . &quot;
and I am not at all sad - I just know that I am now myself .

&quot; the Ah@@ w@@ azi Centre for Human Rights announces that this month several others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab B@@ ani Tam@@ im - hung around . &quot;
&quot; their stories have a thing in common : there were all family members , who felt thanks to the persecution of the Iranian government , hel@@ pl@@ ess and in@@ capable of going to live their families and to a safe work . &quot;
Arab A@@ azi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot;
&quot; the region , which is located in a large part of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi community , was sh@@ aken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult to deny their living standards . &quot;
&quot; in a century ago , the Arabic Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ahl@@ avi monarchy took over power and made 1925 major efforts to finish the ethnic autonomy in the whole of Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest in Iran in the coming oil and gas fields , as well as some of the most significant and most valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite these valuable resources , the regional economy develops only slowly , and the native population get only little of this wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often the victim of untreated illnesses , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation . &quot;
the Iranian regime denied the Ah@@ w@@ azi Arabs systematically jobs in local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry . &quot;
&quot; the government also built a variety of roofs , built water from Arab areas in the Persian areas where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m lie . &quot;
these roofs have led only to wor@@ sen@@ ing the devast@@ ation in the region through dry devast@@ ation and destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and pal@@ m@@ trees industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ zi youth rose to 81 % .
&quot; N@@ OUR Moh@@ ammed P@@ ur , the Iranian General Director for Co@@ operative , Work and Social Wel@@ fare , announces that 5 % of Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is who finished a work that finished elementary school , 55 % a further school and 45 % have university degrees . &quot;
a systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance .
&quot; Kar@@ im Doh@@ im@@ i , an Iranian an@@ azi human rights activ@@ ist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices , that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist racial discrimination , &quot; a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of self @-@ mor@@ ants among the young Ah@@ w@@ azi men . &quot;
&quot; Doh@@ im@@ i said that particularly unemployment has become worse , because of this , a combination of a high number of in Ah@@ wa@@ z is new an@@ coming ethnic Per@@ sians and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the creation process : &quot;
&quot; since Func@@ tion@@ aries and institutions do not prefer Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi will be passed away from access to work opportunities in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs , and to force them to earn their livel@@ i@@ hoods outside their home ancestors . &quot;
&quot; there are people who had to change their suburbs and surname in order to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ w@@ azi , since even Arab names will not be toler@@ ated , because the speaking of the Arab language or the h@@ agen arab@@ ic clothes . &quot;
&quot; given the given circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi must end@@ ure the human rights activ@@ ist alarm , before the situation is explosive . &quot;
it remains to be seen whether the world is consuming and taking note of it .
the main reason for su@@ ic@@ ide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and su@@ ic@@ ide is avoidable .

&quot; the following article is a working version of the opinion , which was published by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the website Af@@ ro@@ f@@ Ã©@@ min@@ as . the article was the subject of several discussions , in which many different positions were expressed . &quot;
you can read in the comments below the original text .
&quot; when I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , many women - especially white women who call themselves as inter@@ se@@ wage femin@@ ists - with frustration . &quot;
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even lay good through scientific and social arguments against me why I should be femin@@ ist and why we generally should be all femin@@ ist * inside .
&quot; for example , that women still earn less money in spite of the same education than men . &quot;
that women still stand under str@@ ingent observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their body .
that violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
&quot; or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women live sooner or later in various areas of life to a smooth ceiling , and that discrimination on the basis of sex still moves through the many different countries and fai@@ ths . &quot;
all of this is conscious of me and known .
I am convinced that I am di@@ mm@@ ed twice and thre@@ ef@@ old .
I am a black woman .
&quot; yet , if I &apos;m talking to skin colour , on black CIS women , on black CIS women , on black women in the LGB@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the Dias@@ pora , when I talked about what kind of we have physically , se@@ el@@ ic and verbal abuse have been silent , both in and outside the femin@@ ist movement , to mention many white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ c@@ tion@@ ists femin@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; but we all agree that women - all women - come together to show &quot; their voices and &quot; K@@ umb@@ aya , my lord &apos;s &quot; to sing &quot; to achieve equality ( some ) of women . &quot;
&quot; but they don &apos;t want to talk about sexu@@ alised violence as an institution@@ alized form of racial , which we are exposed to black women on two times . &quot;
&quot; or that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ es , and origin of origin deserve less than white men and women . &quot;
that black girls and girls are referred to as a white girl because of obvious integration problems .
&quot; or that women are exposed in black spheres and women with a migration background , domestic violence and violence suffer from a partnership , as white women . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , I want that all women , all men and all men do not have any skin color the same rights ; on the other hand , I am not able to join the white woman in whose center the white woman stands , which refuse to consider both the gender and the skin colour of a person . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m exhausted and will no longer fight for my membership in a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ oriented sp@@ ill , who has repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women . &quot;
&quot; so@@ jour@@ ner said 18@@ 51 in her speech : &quot; &quot; I am not a woman ? &quot; &quot; and I refuse to sustain an ideology in which the black woman is a serious and margin@@ alised essence . &quot;
&quot; I refuse to ex@@ clude me group@@ ings , which also absor@@ b through cultural ex@@ propri@@ ation of our customs and customs , to drive their eg@@ oc@@ ent@@ ric program . &quot;
&quot; I will no longer try to lay white women the importance of excessive skin of skin color and sex . because some of them will continue to be the meaning of black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women are trying to reward the better . &quot;
&quot; although the inter@@ se@@ wage femin@@ ism was founded to give women different levels of heart , and down from the white femin@@ ism , is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in his name . &quot;
&quot; I refer it before , to tie myself fully and completely from femin@@ ism , which was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman in life , instead of preparing myself for a white @-@ femin@@ ist paradi@@ gm that is so stub@@ born as a novel phenomenon being celebrated . &quot;
&quot; now , it is more important than ever that we define black women for our own ideas and enter into the spheres that we are created for us . &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , author of Afri@@ c@@ ana wom@@ anism : Rec@@ la@@ im@@ ing ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : how we can defend ourselves in that way , in which they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , physical , physical and even the spiritual elements can be re@@ vered that the black woman . &quot;
&quot; although some white and interactive femin@@ ists will immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion after they read these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of femin@@ ist movement by which the black woman is affected . &quot;
&quot; in a wom@@ an@@ ist environment , I can lift black women and women of other cultures , because in this paradi@@ gm I existed . &quot;
I will be recognized as part of this paradi@@ gm because of my dark skin and to my existence as a part of this paradi@@ gm .
&quot; I , a black woman , can blo@@ om in an environment in which my life was neither passed , nor ignored . &quot;
p@@ addle against the pollution : the Mission of a man to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations
&quot; this contribution from To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reported in particular about international efforts to solve environmental problems . &quot;
&quot; as part of a Content @-@ Shar@@ ing agreement , this article will be released here again . &quot;
&quot; over the past 7 years Nab@@ il Mus@@ a traveled in the past 7 years - mostly with Surf@@ board or can@@ oe - with a special concern due to the Kur@@ dist@@ an region in Iraq . its mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations . &quot;
in this documentary about Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a who explains us his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on its church .
&quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river which we had lost when I was a child , &quot; tells Mus@@ a . &quot;
&quot; scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of reser@@ vo@@ irs , the pollution and the un@@ controlled development , lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the Non @-@ governmental organization Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance - who protect themselves and working towards protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the video Mus@@ a sums up the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; &quot; if we had no water any more , how would we survive ? &quot;
&quot; this video was produced for En@@ sia by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , one in Er@@ bil , produced in Iraq and multi@@ medi@@ al journalist , produced , filmed and edited . &quot;
&quot; the focus of their work lies on le@@ aded , little resp@@ ectable sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of co@@ oper@@ atively vide@@ ography and new multi@@ medi@@ al techniques , with whose help oppressed communities to tell their stories in their way . &quot;
Paragu@@ ays Women and her harder fight against violence

&quot; the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated and processed version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; the article belongs to the series # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ jer ( # soft @-@ type ) , which reports about the threads of women in Paraguay . &quot;
most names have been changed to protect the persons affected .
&quot; a police com@@ miss@@ ary said A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez , that they had nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , its ex@@ ams which had become violent against violent . &quot;
&quot; since the end of her relationship was a little time passed and the police said , her statement would be put to the acts , but more could not be done . &quot;
&quot; as another woman Bal@@ bu@@ ena showed for distr@@ acts , useful also the acute display of A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez nothing . &quot;
a few days later the second lady moved their ad .
breaking the devil @-@ circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; if women have to refund an indication , they generally receive no support from the state . &quot;
&quot; in many cases , women are also dependent on the men who mis@@ use it . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence , at all in the criminal law enforcement authorities . &quot;
&quot; content 1 beats and Statisti@@ cal 2 im@@ visible mis@@ acts and a legal system , which nothing sub@@ ordinate @-@ 3 Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , lack of conversion and statistics &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to determine how many women are really mis@@ sive , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez , research for gen@@ ders on Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aciÃ³n y E@@ studios , a social scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; there are different data and reports , which do not even indicate the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; however , the figures available are extremely alar@@ ming . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , at the District State Department 9@@ 600 ads went on account of domestic violence . at 70 % of it there was violence against women . &quot;
86 % of the ads in the police came from women .
there were more than 5000 ads due to domestic violence in the peace of peace . also here 86 % of the ads came from women .
&quot; in the ads 40 % of women said that they have been physically tense , 55 % of women spoke of mental failure . &quot;
but these statistics show not the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
&quot; according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ al women &apos;s minist@@ ries , Ana Bai@@ ardi are also displayed only a few of these crimes . &quot; to any woman who re@@ funded in Paraguay because of psych@@ ic failure , 9 women who do not do this . &quot;
&quot; to any woman who re@@ funded because of physical distr@@ action , two women , who do not do this , &quot; explained it at the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; because of women &apos;s genocide in Paraguay is not an own criminal off@@ ee , the criminal enforcement authorities cannot be adequately documented how many women are ass@@ ass@@ ass@@ inated every year by their current or former partners . &quot;
&quot; only until August 2016 , journalists were at least 12 cases of femin@@ ic@@ ide in the country alone . &quot;
the coordin@@ ator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases in which women were mur@@ dered by their current or former partners .
&quot; according to their estimates in Paraguay every ten days a woman die , due to violence through men . &quot;

&quot; invisible missions , and a legal system that does not take &quot;
&quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ Ã­@@ te@@ z was the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she called his name for all of her former friends . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning she didn &apos;t want to do this , but then after . this should be rep@@ ented for ever . &quot;
&quot; today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos . but for two years , she carried the psych@@ ic violence in turn - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most severely recognizable : &quot;
I never thought that I would have been a victim of abuse .
&quot; if I read earlier about it , I always thought that women are going to be mis@@ sive because they dec@@ eive themselves of violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that I would never happen .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on the missions through Carlos Vera .
&quot; without name , she wrote contributions on Facebook , in which they described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during their two @-@ year relationship , and told how he had isolated them . &quot;
&quot; many people rep@@ lied to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rh@@ et@@ or@@ ically , whether he ever raised the hand against them , and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of failure . &quot;
&quot; other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana , why they had fallen by Carlos so long and did not left him in the past . &quot;
it seemed almost as they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least have a certain debt to blame .
&quot; Victoria San@@ tos that did not come from Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner is mis@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te CRE@@ O ( &quot; &quot; I believe you &quot; &quot; ) that consists of women all in any way victims of abuse . &quot;
&quot; in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other . &quot;
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vict@@ ori@@ as case everything started with psych@@ ic failure .
&quot; her wealthy partners , it was finally even to convince them that it was worth@@ less . &quot;
then he started to beat her .
&quot; Vict@@ ori@@ as advertisements for the authorities stayed without a result and also from their relatives , she received no support . &quot;
&quot; she conducted a trial against her former partners who developed into an in@@ scr@@ utable legal struggle between Paraguay and their home country , in which it mainly grew by money , power and the influence of their former partner . &quot;
Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach to lack of implementation
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good , but not applied . &quot;
&quot; the ad &apos;s ad is a way full of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judiciary , &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN Organisation for Women in Paraguay , also sees great problems when applying the laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , a bill was discussed in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Parliament , which was known under the has@@ ht@@ ag # Por@@ Ell@@ as ( # Prin@@ c@@ ate ) . &quot;
&quot; this has@@ ht@@ ag and the movement # Ni@@ un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # non @-@ in@@ less ) are part of a campaign on Twitter , which is supported by Am@@ nest@@ y International . &quot;
&quot; the original form of the law sees before , Fem@@ izi@@ d to explain to a stand@@ alone crime continu@@ ance and to be tough@@ er as it is already in the neighboring countries Argentina and Bolivia . &quot;
&quot; so the Legisl@@ ative text was changed in some points to also win the MPs for the law who feared that the path for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions shall be banned in principle , and pun@@ ished with up to five years in prison . &quot;
&quot; the original bill provided , most of the ( bureaucr@@ atic and economic ) procedures that have to carry out the victims of violence at present themselves , if they just need to refund and receive secure accommodation , the state . &quot;
&quot; Ech@@ au@@ ri argu@@ ed that the law is not effective , if the leg@@ is@@ lat@@ ors do not have sufficient financial resources available to it : &quot;
in Paraguay is seen as part of inter@@ human relationships .
&quot; here , a re@@ think must take place where violence is no longer considered to be something Nor@@ mal . &quot;
&quot; in the face of these facts , the offen@@ ders makes itself guilty , and contributes to the perpet@@ rators . &quot;
&quot; we have to refund so long , to abuse no more than normal . &quot;
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Senate . previously , parts of the law had been altered but there was a passage between the partners in cases of domestic violence for reconciliation . &quot;
the opinions about the changes go apart .
the section on reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity for the ag@@ gres@@ sor to attack his sacrifice .
&quot; the string of words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law is regarded as great retreat . &quot;
&quot; this article is the abbrevi@@ ated and processed version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; the article belongs to the series # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ jer ( # soft @-@ type ) , which reports about the threads of women in Paraguay . &quot;

independent media in O@@ man continues to be exposed to ban on a newspaper in O@@ man .
&quot; this website was locked due to a decision of the Information Ministry of Information &quot; &quot; is locked up on the homepage of the ver@@ ted newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; more than one year ago , the om@@ anic authorities have joined the independent arab@@ ic newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of their reporting about corruption in the sult@@ an . &quot;
&quot; You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison , where he is prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and put in court , but later they came back . &quot;
&quot; O@@ man has been governed by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us ib@@ n S@@ aid , who came to power after he had his father , S@@ aid ib@@ n T@@ aim@@ ur , by a state of state . &quot;
&quot; since then , he dressed , next to his role as the single Sultan , the most important minist@@ ries in the country : Prime Minister , Defence Minister , Minister of Defence , Minister of Foreign Minister for planning and President of the Central Bank . &quot;
&quot; the rule of sult@@ ans is characterized by the beh@@ aving efforts of security forces , especially domestic intelligence , including freedom of freedom , limiting and human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blog@@ gers and other activists , to in@@ timi@@ d and det@@ ained . &quot;
&quot; the authorities limit peaceful and legitimate activities in human rights systematically and hin@@ ders citizens , even activists , to express their views on public affairs concerning the country such as corruption in authorities and institutions , both online and offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , her closure , and the det@@ ention three of their editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country . &quot;
&quot; Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper since its foundation 2007 was reported on corruption in O@@ man ( an absolute monarchy ) , until they were banned by the authorities in August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i , Editor @-@ in @-@ Chief of Az@@ am@@ n , firm , after written in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 , it was published on corruption in the judiciary and interference by high @-@ level officials in judicial decisions . &quot;
&quot; in the report , government accused , judge of the Supreme Court in O@@ man was put under pressure to up@@ lift a judgment in an inheritance . &quot;
&quot; the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n of 26 July 2016 , with a report on the front page with the heading : &quot; &quot; high @-@ level parties bind hands of justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , Member of the Board Committee , issued by the ISS before the Special Department and was arrested upon his arrival by the security forces . &quot;
on 9 August 2016 the ISS took place the Deputy @-@ chief editor You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j who had joined Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is arrest as chief editor .
&quot; the newspaper was closed on an in@@ definite period after the information given the statement given that &quot; &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper on any way , including online , from 9 August 2016 prohibited . &quot;
on 26 September 2016 the first trial in Mas@@ kat took place in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i . &quot;
the Court condemned the three journalists to pris@@ ons and ord@@ ained the final closing of the newspaper .
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both condemned among other things because of the disorder of public order , &quot; mis@@ use of the Internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining of the prestige of the state . &quot; &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was also found guilty of the violation of an audience and found guilty for guilty .
al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years old prison quarters and borro@@ wed in the amount of 3000 om@@ anic Ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . moreover a year &apos;s professional work was directed against the two journalists .
al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year in prison and a prison sentence in the amount of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 2600 US dollars ) after making use of a information network to spread the public order .
&quot; for Al @-@ Abr@@ i , a deposit was set in the amount of 5000 om@@ anic Ri@@ al ( 13 000 US dollars ) and was released on 22 August 2016 prior to judgment . &quot;
&quot; the Ap@@ pe@@ al Court said Al @-@ Abr@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but condemned Al @-@ Ha@@ j to a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i to six months in prison . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i was released on 10 April 2017 in exile of his sixth prison sentence . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still being released in prison where he det@@ ained his prison sentence .
&quot; the Ap@@ pe@@ al Court also highlighted the resolution of the Information Department , the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; despite the decision of the Court , Az@@ am@@ n again , the paper remains suspended as an attack by the om@@ ic government . &quot;
&quot; on January 8 , the information panel made a statement by which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the information is personally signed a further statement in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and with what the ministers appeared to be a further time against the decision of the working court . &quot;
the constant closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the paper are not the only cases where in O@@ man has been viol@@ ated the freedom of the press .
&quot; for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine Mo@@ w@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to set its operation . &quot;
&quot; due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the det@@ ention of the journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ an@@ ical authorities are still not ready to end up the extensive violation of press freedom . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf of Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the om@@ an authorities to : &quot;
1 . You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j promptly and uncondi@@ tionally release ;
&quot; 2 . a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , so that their journalists can follow their work ; &quot;
to protect the freedom of freedom in the country and
&quot; 4 . under all circumstances to ensure that human rights def@@ enders , and journalists in O@@ man are un@@ law@@ ful rights , and without fear of precau@@ tions , including judicial sli@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; the Golf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization , the human rights def@@ enders ( also independent journalists , Blog@@ ger , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf @-@ Region and in the adjacent states to gather peaceful , support and protection to them . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ conc@@ eptions
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ or 2016 in Zambia , figure is carried out with its consent . &quot;
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media . this is a growing area that addresses the most urgent needs of the continent .
&quot; for the need for a place of medical research , there are two reasons : for a lack in the supply of global health care many medicines and vaccines that cover the special medical need on the African continent . &quot;
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis and mal@@ aria have serious consequences in the poorest countries as elsewhere , and lack of investment for research on these diseases through the pharmaceutical companies are a big problem . &quot;
&quot; secondly , research , which will be carried out by African scientists to build their own research capacity in Africa . a major role of science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve for the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ or is director of the Center for research on infectious diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR@@ Z ) . &quot;
&quot; he grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epide@@ mic first gra@@ ving impact on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Zambia for studying in the United States , first in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania on HIV virus , he decided to go back home to assist the sam@@ b@@ ish health system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. Warri@@ or discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understanding of the media about this research . &quot;
( disclaimer : Dr. Warri@@ or speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ or R@@ W : at the moment the focus of my work on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ b@@ ish national programme for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
&quot; furthermore , I just get a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ ogen@@ s . &quot;
G@@ V : what are your opinion about the important current scientists in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
R@@ W : there is no basic research . we only have solutions to have developed the wo@@ o .
&quot; this must change , otherwise we will always remain recip@@ ients instead of being creators . &quot;
&quot; the solutions we get are often used in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use it here . &quot;
G@@ V : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
R@@ W : from the US and Europe .
the projects will vary differently .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who come back or go here , because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot;
G@@ V : how is the research infrastructure ?
which obstacles are available in your routine research work that you did not have ?
&quot; R@@ W : the basic infrastructure does not correspond to the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money , continuous supply of electricity , water and internet . &quot;
&quot; laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries . &quot;
G@@ V : how is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
&quot; R@@ W : there are already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods . &quot;
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; G@@ V : how large is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it concentrate , and how can we support development ? &quot;
R@@ W : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
&quot; there is need for special scientific education , starting at any age . &quot;
&quot; social sciences , computer sciences , big data , research of space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly . &quot;
G@@ V : can you describe the pros and cons of life as scientists in Africa across Western countries based on your experience ?
&quot; R@@ W : often it is the limited speed , things to do , and the direct access to scientific expertise , which represent the challenges here . &quot;
&quot; the system that magazines make articles accessible only against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; &quot; ) , limited the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot;
&quot; from the US to India : how &quot; open source &quot; plant seed producers will change global food production
&quot; this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the En@@ si@@ a.com site , a magazine that reports solutions for environmental problems worldwide . &quot;
Frank Mor@@ ton has been bred in the USA for the 1980s .
&quot; his company offers 114 sorts , such as Out@@ red@@ geous , the first plant that was cultivated by NASA @-@ A@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space and consumed . &quot;
&quot; almost 20 years , Mor@@ ton work has only been carried out by his own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question of how many sal@@ sts can get it , limits . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he found that more and more sal@@ ads have been patented , and that he could not keep them further on the breeding . &quot;
&quot; patents g@@ alt@@ ed not only for individual varieties , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , a special Rot@@ or , or Green leaves . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , more and more such patents have been log@@ ged in more and more plants such as cer@@ eals or cardboard boxes . due to this trends the plant bree@@ ders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and expertise on food security for the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as a passionate representatives of a mill@@ en@@ nia tradition , Mor@@ ton still salad gre@@ ed , he now needs to become more and more restrictions on it . &quot;
&quot; it is , as if a river would lie in a river rock , for which I have to get her@@ d@@ elling . &quot;
&quot; so we have to do that now , but it is a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think that these patents go on sal@@ ads too far . &quot;
&quot; and if they stand before judgment , no one can hold a new sal@@ at@@ sor@@ ption , because all features are already patented , and tries to breed those features that he wants . &quot;
&quot; however , it is very careful and endeav@@ or to use , no material to use that is protected as intellectual property . &quot;
he has also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the US and everywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; open source &quot; breeding ) .
astr@@ on@@ au@@ ts of the International Space station ISS red RÃ¶@@ mer@@ sal@@ at of Sor@@ ted Out@@ red@@ night in the &quot; glas@@ sh@@ outing &quot; of the station bred and eaten . there will be tested whether plants in space are cultivated .

&quot; it is not a coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT sector , and not from the area of plant breeding . &quot;
&quot; the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( Initiative for &quot; Open Source &quot; -@@ seed ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software , which provide alternatives to copy@@ right@@ ed software . &quot;
&quot; it was called into life to ensure that some plant species and -@@ gene are not being protected as intellectual property , and so for plant bree@@ ders are permanently usable . &quot;
&quot; in the framework of the initiative , in short Os@@ si , the US bree@@ ders can also commit that others may be used by them seed . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed , and do not sell it . &quot; open source &quot; &quot; bree@@ ders allow others to breed , to breed , and not immediately disc@@ usses - two aspects that are prohibited by many plant pat@@ ente , or prescribed by plant . &quot;
doz@@ ens of bree@@ ders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014 .
lower prospects
&quot; for the em@@ eri@@ zed professor of the University of Wis@@ cons@@ in @-@ Ma@@ dison and Os@@ si coun@@ cill@@ or , Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are in control of the seed and the opportunity to breed new plants as well as for environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control over the nutrition system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eder would try to not use the latter not or only little by their seed with natural resistance . &quot;
clo@@ pp@@ enburg stressed that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement does not work with gene@@ tically modified plants .
&quot; all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , cor@@ n , gene@@ tically modified or not , from ecological farming or not . &quot; to purchase our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over the target market , such as it is offered on peasant markets , should also know that the way is bred as such as vegetables . &quot;
nutritional sovereign without seeds is not possible . &quot;
&quot; the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed initiative commit themselves to provide others their seeds , which means that their actions are in contrast , seed and plant characteristics . &quot;

&quot; Os@@ si supporters argu@@ ed that the future of food supply is je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed , as the available gen@@ pool due to the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights based on plant material , which is therefore always available , un@@ law@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; Claire Lu@@ by , Executive director of the Os@@ si , has engaged in her doctoral work with genetic variation in car@@ r@@ ots and their availability . she found out that about one third of all cart@@ els features as intellectual property is protected either not at all or only available . &quot;
&quot; for other plants there are such estimates not yet , but experts like Lu@@ by susp@@ ect that mass @-@ built plants like wheat is patented as a salad or car@@ r@@ ots . &quot;
a question of view
&quot; plants are so instruc@@ ted that they have targeted characteristics - from such , by which their taste or colour improves up to such , due to which they with@@ stand in certain environments prosp@@ er and threats such as p@@ ests or diseases . &quot;
opponents of patents on plant characteristics point out that the available plant material for bree@@ ders increased by more and more patents . genetic diversity is now unnecessary than ever since the changed conditions through climate change are much worse prior to climate change .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ Spe@@ aker Car@@ ly S@@ ca@@ du@@ to , that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ tos activities . with a total of four gen@@ oci@@ des and cooperation with institutions such as the Agricultural Ministry of Economic Affairs . &quot;
&quot; however , it contradi@@ cts the view that intellectual property other bre@@ eder ger@@ ators , since &quot; patents and the protection of plant vari@@ et@@ als innovation promote &quot; . &quot; a patent is basically taken a plan that can be exp@@ ired once the patent is exp@@ ired . &quot;
often these directions help others to come with another method for the same result .
&quot; thus , such protection inhi@@ bits innovations not , but promotes them to be provided by the public more material and know @-@ how . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ ton sees the different : 20 years to wait , until a patent flow , there is certainly no innovations . &quot;
&quot; and if you are waiting for so long waiting to grow to plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , one would have lost the struggle already . &quot;
&quot; the main argument for Mor@@ ton is , however , that genetic resources are always a general public and should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant bree@@ ders have neither the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ ary incentives are not attractive to us . &quot;
we want farmers to make their work easier .
&quot; this is what drives us , and it will be impossible if we can &apos;t continue to use the best and most recent genetic resources . &quot;
&quot; altogether Mor@@ ton is dis@@ rup@@ tive to the concept of itself , plant peculi@@ arities : &quot; we do not really create the characteristics themselves . &quot;
&quot; the plants make them themselves off and as bre@@ eder , we finally have no idea how plants do this . &quot;
a secret of nature . &quot;
&quot; for Carol Dep@@ pe , plant bree@@ ders in the US @-@ State Oregon and Os@@ si coun@@ cill@@ or , there is still another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; who has bred a sor@@ ting , bred his own values into them . &quot;
&quot; who believes in industrial agriculture with large cour@@ ty@@ ards and mon@@ oc@@ ultur@@ ists , for their cultivation of her@@ bi@@ al Her@@ bi@@ zi@@ de , are bred in his varieties of this concept of agriculture . &quot;
my concept is exactly ind@@ ented . &quot;
&quot; while some medium @-@ sized enterprises ( such , moving on international markets , but less than Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents create , create the most smaller seed company , even without patents they reject the patented or they don &apos;t stop it for too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both is the case . &quot;
the independent plant bree@@ ders Frank Mor@@ ton is searching in his breeding garden sal@@ ads .
photo by Karen Mor@@ ton .
&quot; Mor@@ ton is also the view that bre@@ eder by the A@@ void of plant pat@@ ent@@ ders : &quot; it looks like me with my efforts to produce new , stronger than companies that are patented . &quot;
&quot; I need a constant new material for my catalogue , as I know that my competitors is to sell my sorts into a couple of years ago , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; with a patent one is protected 20 years before competition , which makes it quite pretty easy . &quot;
&quot; while the US seem to be a leader in the &quot; open source &quot; breeding , but the concept has grown rapidly around the world . &quot;
&quot; in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , an &quot; open source &quot; plant breeding program works along with farmers , and helps them to breed new varieties , meet specific requirements . &quot;
&quot; it also supports them to come to &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; and sell their own . &quot;
&quot; the German Organisation Agre@@ co@@ l is working on an &quot; open source &quot; license , which ultimately is a formal and legally binding form of the Os@@ si commitment for bree@@ ders in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; ( regulations for the breeding differ from country to country , present because of the Os@@ si commitment is not simply one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . ) &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of November 2016 , the Ex@@ am@@ ics of the European Union , the European Commission , declares that conventional plants were not pat@@ ent@@ able . so that she speaks against the present practice of the European Pat@@ ent@@ i , which uses patents in conventional plants . &quot;
&quot; however , a statement is still not a law ; now it is part of the governments of the Member States to implement this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os hosted a conference on &quot; open source &quot; plant seed systems in Ethiopia , on the farmers , operators of plant breeding and seed company from all over East Africa to learn something about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards pat@@ enting seeds . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for hi@@ v@@ os &apos; program for &quot; open source &quot; plant seed systems , that the organisation is currently a global alliance for &quot; open source &quot; plant breeding systems &quot; for the planning next year of the official start signal . &quot;
&quot; a merger of environmental protection and development group groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international Non@@ profit development organization US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database of seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the future of eating - a bond and from aid organizations such as the w@@ k Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - a report that farmers have to contribute to plant seed , ensuring a stable supply of foods can be ensured . &quot;
&quot; in the report , the importance of a diverse , local supply with seeds for sustainable food systems stressed - a connection , by the Lu@@ by of Os@@ si hopes that soon more people will be recognized . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has mainly been respected , where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role , so Lu@@ by . &quot; we are trying to climb the people that are still more behind their food . &quot;

human rights organization and blog are the latest goals of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in Egypt
still lock the Egyptian authorities content on the internet .
&quot; this time , it was the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a column . &quot;
&quot; on the weekend around the 05.@@ August , the Egyptian government has documented the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ H@@ RI ) , documented in the human rights ab@@ uses in Egypt and the Arab world . &quot;
&quot; August the network published an opinion on Facebook , in which it critic@@ ised the Egyptian authorities for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information continues - despite this attack and aband@@ on@@ ment of the Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities , who continue to aband@@ on the rights and human rights in the Arab world , so it has never been so important to overcome these goals and do not admit it . we insist that our task is to fulfill our task . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ H@@ RI is considered to be the first zen@@ ed website of a human rights organization in Egypt , after the authorities reported more than two months 21 websites , Arabic @-@ speaking issue of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the origin@@ ating network of al J@@ aze@@ era because of the alleged &quot; support of terrorism &quot; . &quot; &quot;
# Egypt : first human rights organisation of the wave of the site of the site to the victims . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language https : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ D@@ S@@ 5@@ K
besides AN@@ H@@ RI also consists of the Kolum@@ ni@@ sts and Human Rights research scientist Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada no access more in Egypt .
&quot; Zi@@ ada used his blog for the spread of colum@@ ni@@ sts and articles , which he is not accessible for in Egypt and media . &quot;
&quot; now the blog was used to handle the z@@ ens@@ ur@@ apparatus of the Egyptian government , even the goal of an attack . &quot;
&quot; blog@@ ger , who is housed in the blog of Zi@@ adas blog , on the other hand is more accessible . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in cap@@ tivity , after he reported in December 2013 by Egyptian vulner@@ abilities and recorded a video , such as the police force physical violence against two students . &quot;
his article is mainly about politics and human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada is to the blocking by the government and refl@@ ecting what this means for him : &quot;
&quot; the blogs to sper@@ ren is very old , however , in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi priority ; and even if the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world , so it is for two reasons for me : &quot;
&quot; 1 ) It has succeeded to convey to give me the feeling of a si@@ ege @-@ board ; an arrest , a attempted murder , un@@ loading at the national Security Council , the blocking blogs as well as any other website , for which I worked . &quot;
&quot; 2 ) You have proven that I was not in vain . in other words , my words have no influence even if only on a small audience . &quot;
I want to mention that this blog was a archive for me .
&quot; first , I used it to the post of articles , to handle the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship . &quot;
&quot; however , after they have locked him , and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the mu@@ ff@@ ers go the way up to the end .
&quot; according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ eses and Ex@@ pression ( AF@@ TE ) sper@@ r@@ alled Egyptian authorities from May 24th to 06@@ th August 133 websites . this took technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provider ( ISP ) , e.g. Orange , Vod@@ af@@ one and E@@ tis@@ al@@ at . &quot;
&quot; AF@@ TE documented also the blocking of vendors , which was possible through the removal of boarding or@@ ship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( VP@@ N@@ s ) &quot;
AF@@ TE reported in her research :
&quot; on Monday , 12 . June we are showing how the blocking of websites that offer VP@@ N@@ s began . &quot;
such practice indicates the intention of the government to continue to block contents and have access to the Egyptian user .
&quot; the situation will additionally wor@@ sen that the ten@@ ure choices are taken behind closed doors , thus the Egyptian population has no legal basis which they can proceed against these actions . &quot;
now the question : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and whom will it be next attack ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants argue .

&quot; day for day newspaper newspapers report in Brazil with glo@@ omy head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home to numerous Post@@ card motives . &quot;
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old were shot in school , &quot; &quot; Every@@ one second day is mur@@ dered a police officers in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; Di@@ eves smo@@ ked pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , nav@@ y and air@@ planes to Rio . &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation the ant@@ al@@ tw@@ elle in Rio has been the highest point for 10 years .
&quot; the Brazilian government of Global Justice , called for the United Nations , including the United Nations . &quot;
reports such as these are daily and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; for detailed reporting on violence in Rio known newspaper &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; was published on 16 August the editorial article &quot; This is not normal , &quot; in which they announced a new section called &quot; War in Rio &quot; . &quot; &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now published there .
the motives for their decision explained the newspaper so :
&quot; extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every big city on the world like murder , Rau@@ b , sex , etc . everything , however , is published by the civili@@ zed standard and what only happened in Rio . ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal ! &quot;
&quot; this is the only alternative , so that we do not close our eyes in front of the atro@@ city . &quot;
&quot; in a four @-@ minute video that was divided on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ Ã¡@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the chief editor of the newspaper that this decision was not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure : &quot;
extra is probably the only newspaper in the whole world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that does not realize the war at all .
&quot; in the same video a journalist of the newspaper , that it is referred to the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 8@@ 43 areas , which is controlled by criminal organizations . &quot;
in the editorial article the newspaper writes :
&quot; we are aware that a war exchange rate , if it is distor@@ ted that it can also be used , cru@@ ising the police which only sho@@ ots and then ask questions to waste . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose aim is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the m@@ af@@ ia and its partners . &quot;
would the term &quot; war &quot; more than they are useful ?
&quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Bra@@ sil argu@@ ed the journalist Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , on the contrary , the violence as a &quot; war &quot; . &quot; this is their opinion a justi@@ fication of the failed security policy by the media and could make it compl@@ aining responsibility in police to account . &quot;
this is not war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and worse planning - as extra in the analysis of the military income in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education and historical and self @-@ counter@@ ing negl@@ ect of public service . &quot;
the memory : the federal state Rio de Janeiro is greater than its capital .

&quot; Rio de Janeiro is called &quot; &quot; the most violent place in Brazil , &quot; according to Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia , &quot; 22 of the 30 non @-@ violent cities in Brazil lie according to statistics of 2015 in the north and north @-@ east of the country . these are the most current data . &quot;
none of these cities is located in the federal state Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; if we look at the M@@ ord@@ rates per federal state , is located Rio to Square 16 , &quot; writes them . &quot;
&quot; extra belongs to the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company of South America , which stressed , such as Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia , has repeatedly stressed the security policy of the state . &quot;
&quot; these security policies also belonged to the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ Ã­@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the federal state Rio in 2003 , whose aim is to conquer by using a massive police force a Fav@@ ela and to provide a unit permanently there . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , this was actually led to a withdrawal of violent death . for some years , the U@@ PP has actually meant for several reports about Shi@@ kan@@ en and repres@@ sions against poor communities who actually should protect the newly created police unit , increasingly under circum@@ stance . &quot;
&quot; on its Facebook page , the journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux from one of his articles from 2010 , in which he explains why violence in Rio does not determine the &quot; &quot; civil war &quot; &quot; by the Geneva Convention . &quot;
he writes :
&quot; in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war draws also serious consequences for the people . &quot;
&quot; for this is demanding the state that are typical of a war . this includes the penetration into the territory of an &quot; enemy , &quot; in which a civil war is an un@@ sharp point in the countryside and for the object for &quot; coll@@ ateral damages &quot; and &quot; ver@@ ded balls . &quot; &quot;
&quot; war to or her , fact is that the inhabitants of the Fav@@ elas in Rio still suffer . &quot;
&quot; a week it is now that the police took the mountain with the Fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho , to keep the death of a polic@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of all this violence , this pre@@ y head@@ lines also made an orch@@ ard died as a result of nuts , which had consolidated the police out of a helic@@ opter . &quot;

&quot; since 2013 , this by rebels have been controlled controlled areas outside of Damascus under si@@ ege which led inhabitants on local , or through tunn@@ elling and check@@ points . &quot;
the block@@ age block@@ ade are traditional foods such as meat un@@ att@@ ain@@ able for large parts of the population .
&quot; as a counter @-@ scale , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and academ@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , as they can plant their own mushrooms as &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da and run the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
&quot; mushrooms do not belong to the conventional , in Syria @-@ planted foods and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine . however , it makes it an attractive food source for many inhabitants of the besieg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the direc@@ ting of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P : &quot;
&quot; we decided to cultivation of fung@@ i because they have a high nutritional value similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices , that has been fighting for three years , this project was known and op@@ ted its relief that it gains more and more &apos; to famili@@ arity . &quot;
&quot; to collect money for the initiative , in consultation with the NGO Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ seam@@ da the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do . &quot;
&quot; it is planned to give 125 families knowledge to the pl@@ anting of mushrooms , such as Dr. Lei@@ la about Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of its expected goal of around 12.@@ 700 â¬ , but will continue to gather donations to Can@@ Do . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is dependent on generators , which keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and the humidity in 80 % . &quot;
&quot; because of fuel , local fuel are used locally from plastic materials to supply the generators with the necessary energy . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices , that they began with the &quot; production of distribution from the regions base &quot; &quot; before they tested their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot;
&quot; then they planted a small mush@@ room farm in a tub . as this , they used a bigger winding . and so on . &quot;
&quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; faculty for the region . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months they have distributed mushrooms throughout the Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge .
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to bring people the fung@@ al @-@ breeding of various reasons &quot; : break of si@@ ege . &quot;
providing a new food source in the market .
&quot; spread a culture of self @-@ suff@@ iciency ( such as paper , tea , coffee tables , cardboard , etc ) to the extraction of new foods . &quot;
&quot; creation of new jobs , especially for women working home . &quot;
creating new jobs for people with disabilities that are tied to their homes .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; we hope to spread this idea around the world , so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and the ventilation is visible . &quot;
we want our experience to be inspired in crisis areas and we can help humanity .

Portuguese is calling for justice for the victims of fr@@ ame@@ works of 2017
&quot; several hundred people protest on 21 October in many districts of the district of Portugal and called for justice for the victims of fires , which occurred in the week before the north of Portugal . &quot;
&quot; two @-@ two people died , and about 70 were viol@@ ated as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the government &apos;s last week out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days a stat@@ ute . &quot;
&quot; fires were also registered in the region of G@@ ali@@ zi@@ en in Spain , where there were 4 T@@ ote . &quot;
&quot; it was estimated that there were more than 500 fire@@ bur@@ sts , spread in the northern and central regions of the country and around 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages reached . &quot;
&quot; in June occurred at Pedr@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o Grande a similar tragedy , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 wo@@ unded . &quot;
&quot; according to the European fores@@ try system , which monitors the forest area by satellite recordings , alone 2017 in Portugal approximately 500,000 hectares of forest burned - an area of the size of the district Lisbon . &quot;
so that you can make a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .

the fores@@ ee@@ able tragedy
the goal of the protests of Saturday was the demand for better pre@@ ven@@ tive and brand@@ ing measures by the state .
people asked why the civil protection was not able to fill the extent of the tragedy as much as possible .
JoÃ£o So@@ ver@@ al from the Bund der farmers from Portugal explained the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
after Pedr@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o streets and villages for everything and nothing was evac@@ u@@ ated .
&quot; this Sunday they did not nowhere , there are stupid reports of open roads that were enclosed by fire . &quot;
&quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy could happen in June as the streets were very late . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , buildings in car@@ r@@ arities are depos@@ ited with a high risk of fire risk . &quot;
&quot; a broad proposal to the whale shar@@ k , which the government had declined in 2003 and 2005 , was indic@@ ted by the municipalities which saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment . &quot;
&quot; the government led a Lock@@ ation of the law led by case of case permitted if the applicant had a means of self @-@ protection , so that it was an open back@@ door , so that everything could be built , JoÃ£o Sor@@ val is further expanding in the same article of the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the environmental organization Quer@@ cus made pointed out that large areas with eu@@ cal@@ yp@@ tus , trees made of slightly inflamm@@ able wood , as in a devil @-@ circle , according to fires of this kind . &quot;
&quot; these problems come to these problems that the website of civil defence of Portugal on 15 and 16 October , considered to be resident information or tried to contact anatom@@ y , offline . &quot;
&quot; it was a private initiative , which supply the population with information : it uses its own civil protection data using the application fo@@ g@@ .@@ pt and inform@@ ing the population in real time about the location and the spread of fires . &quot;
&quot; the project was launched in 2015 by the developers JoÃ£o P@@ ina in order to simplify the work of fire bri@@ g@@ ade and was assumed at this fat@@ eful weekend in October so out that the servers persec@@ uted the 40@@ 0.000 users who followed the fr@@ ame@@ works , however , the site were more than half a million en@@ cro@@ ach@@ ments . &quot;

in one night in the autumn 1994 the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban .
&quot; two years ago , a terrible civil war had broken between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ ed@@ in group@@ ings which had conquered the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus Afghanistan was a country of terror and despair . &quot;
&quot; at this time A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year boy , who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central El@@ gh@@ an@@ istan for the last time with his family at dinner . &quot;
&quot; even if his mother didn &apos;t say it back then , she knew that she would no longer see her son for a long time - maybe even more . &quot;
in the morning the boy should break up .
his un@@ cle would pick him up and bring him to the sl@@ ender .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the Hez@@ b of Hez@@ b @-@ e @-@ W@@ ah@@ dat had just been mur@@ dered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara felt suddenly . &quot;
the Taliban was ever closer to her hat@@ red on Haz@@ ara &apos;s Taliban .
many Haz@@ ara settled the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape A@@ shar@@ k found himself again in Pakistan .
a few years he worked in a co@@ leg@@ ru@@ b . the work was heavy and made it sick .
&quot; then he took what was left of his small sal@@ ary , and went into Iran . once again he found himself in a foreign country with other refugees and to@@ wed s@@ acks with mort@@ ar , the he@@ avier than he himself to earn their living . &quot;
&quot; then , as today , the life of Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran was characterised by misery and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really hard , in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we were living in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived on the building site , which we also worked . &quot;
&quot; there was no services there and no heating . we paid n@@ ylon in front of the open windows , so that we were not refres@@ hed at night . &quot;
&quot; after four years , A@@ shar@@ k left his life without papers in Iran and made up for travel to Europe . &quot;
&quot; when the dangerous crossing at the sea , he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and str@@ and@@ ete on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island . &quot;
&quot; after the Greek authorities had refused its asylum application , A@@ shar@@ k came to Italy . &quot;
&quot; some time was A@@ shar@@ k homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church who shared twice the day of food to aid . &quot;
&quot; it is true that Italy due to relatively high loading quot@@ as is a sort of second chance for exp@@ ired asylum seek@@ ers . it is , however , that the conditions , the asylum seek@@ ers in the country have been disast@@ rous . &quot;
&quot; the human rights organisation of Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system is suffering from a general lack of transparency . &quot;
&quot; the vast majority of the asylum seek@@ ers is housed in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; special performance centers &quot; . &quot; this is an impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot;
&quot; according to it@@ alian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be assigned a record centre once they have officially launched an application on asylum , which can still move to the registration of the asylum . &quot;
&quot; until then , people who don &apos;t have a money for accommodation , either on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the street . &quot;
so it was ast@@ o@@ af .
but his un@@ think@@ able lifesty@@ les helped to rid himself from these conditions soon .
&quot; after spending several years in the construction of construction , A@@ shar@@ k tasted its entire savings into the establishment of a youth hostel in Venice . &quot;
this was so good that he opened after a while still a second hostel and a beak .
A@@ shar@@ k Bar@@ atis success story is now the theme of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director A@@ min W@@ ah@@ id@@ i .
&quot; the film was awarded the Venice City Award , the 2017 for the first time in 2017 . &quot;

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
&quot; much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to the official estimates , approximately 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
&quot; for many of them , the country is a transi@@ tional solution on the way to other European countries . &quot;
&quot; during the last few years some of the Afgh@@ ans created companies , including cutting shops , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some af@@ gh@@ anian restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ mad@@ i had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience , in which the wa@@ iters and the kitchen personnel largely come from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the menu of the restaurant tells us through the various af@@ gh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes the history of their trip to Italy . &quot;
the Afgh@@ an ent@@ repr@@ en@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Padua das restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizzeria Kab@@ ul@@ og@@ na in Bologna and a Sus@@ hi Restaurant in Rome .
&quot; however , A@@ shar@@ ehol@@ s destinations are far enough about the Italian taste and retail outlets and aim to the country , which he had to leave as a teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; where a risk is , are also possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
&quot; I never forget my land , and I cannot live happy if I know that my people suffer . &quot;
&quot; I am planning a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country , especially for women . &quot;
they represent half of society and have to get the same possibilities as everyone else .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af for@@ ged for@@ ged plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can sell packaging and conservation techniques . &quot; in this way they can sell their harvest rate on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; the development of successful entrepreneurs was a journey through uncertainty and doubts , but at the end stand stability and prosperity . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af did this journey itself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .

&quot; the Egyptian parliament checks a draft legislation , which shows that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration at a government agency . &quot;
&quot; users would need to use to use social networks within six months , within six months after the authority of the authority under specification of its full name , as well as its publication number . &quot;
anyone dre@@ aming this step could be sentenced to six months of imprisonment or the det@@ ector of a pen@@ al code .
&quot; the law , which was applied by the sixth parliamentary members , is currently under legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and shall be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
May the other member of parliament voted for a bill in the tough@@ er pen@@ alties for the ins@@ ult of the President or by a high officials .
&quot; under Egyptian law , the ins@@ ult of the president as well as state institutions are already prosec@@ uted . under the legislative regime there would be such an act with pris@@ ons and wall@@ papers , such as legal experts in Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot;
&quot; if the law should be adopted , this can mean up to three years imprisonment for the condemned . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate where the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years . &quot;
&quot; an striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ id ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) which was arrested on 13 August 2013 , when he demonstrated against demonstr@@ ators , which demonstrated against the military coup who demonstrated against the elected President Moh@@ ammed Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan waited for as more than 700 protest participants , who were arrested in det@@ ention at the same incident , four years in det@@ ention to an inc@@ ub@@ ation date . &quot;
&quot; recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed on 20 May , because the prison instructions according to human rights groups went to bringing the def@@ endants from prison in the court room . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree on the head@@ lamp of e.g. weapon collection , illeg@@ ally assembly , murder and attempted murder . &quot;
in another case a criminal Court said in G@@ iza the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Barb@@ ary . they were charged for their coverage of pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat lock on the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo .
&quot; the dish also reduced the pen@@ alties of the journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , which were also arrested in the previously mentioned pre @-@ incident , from 25 years to 5 years . &quot;
tun@@ es@@ ischer activists to through @-@ sear@@ ched documents
&quot; May we Tunisi@@ an authorities six hours with the arrest of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , which is co @-@ founder of independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at as well as the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy project . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia has been mainly in@@ war@@ ned by the President of the Republic , which is expressly supported by the President of the Republic , according to the Plan , by the dict@@ ator of the dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of the corruption sei@@ zed officers officers , provided that all unnecessary funds will return . &quot;
&quot; the document published on 21 April on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at published document , thro@@ ws a light on how the prepar@@ atory plans for the support of the law@@ suit . &quot;
Ben G@@ har@@ bia passed the nom@@ ination of his sources under specification of articles 11 of the Tunisi@@ an press co@@ dex@@ es which journalists have the right to protect their sources .
&quot; nevertheless , he joined in Tunis at the District Court in Tunis on May 09 . May as a witness in the case . &quot;
will China comp@@ el the users of social media to submit their ID .
&quot; according to new regulations of the Information Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , users of social media need permission to write or share information in social media . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the registration will also be stated that the registration has to be required with the full re@@ ellen name . &quot;
analy@@ st susp@@ ect that this is to be achieved through the elimination of anonymous comments in sub @-@ versions within the social networks . it is still unclear how the authorities will apply these rules .
Chinese ret@@ ailer suggested in social media to enforce these regulations only sel@@ ective in order to protect citizens &apos; journ@@ alism and its independence .

&quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or fo@@ amed We@@ chat , to register in the state government as &quot; organizer of the information spread . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this name is part of a law from 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government performs a list of online services that will organize the &quot; publication of the information &quot; and to force them for the removal of content and to force it on request for the suspension of user data . &quot;

&quot; it is the first time Turkey has blocked the website completely blocked , in addition to the fact that China is one of the few countries worldwide where access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot;

&quot; following this week , the government is located in the midst of a specific consultation with regard to increased monitoring activities , the Internet service provider would comp@@ ose to monitor the communications services in real time and de@@ code the data encrypted . &quot;
&quot; the government has cons@@ ulted telecommunications companies and intelligence services relating to the proposal , however , has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside . &quot;
