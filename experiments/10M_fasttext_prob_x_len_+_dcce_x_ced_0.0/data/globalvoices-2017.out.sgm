<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love of America is tremendous.</seg>
<seg id="4">"as many of my generation I grew up with American films, American authors have been read and operated by American authors."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly due to an American film journalist."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, who covered with the help of Julia Roberts as Jura-Stued the Moravian-coed conspiracy of an oil-magnates that were the top federal court with judges who were interested."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"free to Method Man," I was as if this is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"and the year, which I lived in Arizona, had only strengthened my admiration for the US."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I said," "America is the only country where I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting, you can always be that you are, and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people."</seg>
<seg id="11">I even wrote a very shamanic lovemaking letter about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much was written about xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">"the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me, as he goes with his bottlenders."</seg>
<seg id="15">"he never stops up with his opinion on the mountain, as you are so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="16">"he says exactly what he thinks, like a former colleague, and explains openly his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, AfroAmerican and women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, people responded to his statements and voted for him."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the 13 million voices, which he won at the Republican presidential elections, was the highest number, which has ever reached from the party."</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">"who are the Americans who support these bigotte a person, I asked myself?"</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not bring Trump and his voters with the people I met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">"as for example my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalist who takes people from all over the world, a deep scanous man with which I could talk about Islam and his past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"also called Trumps's worldview, not by Peter Bhatia, the current editor of" Cincinnati Inquirer "." "</seg>
<seg id="24">"Bhatia and I met with our common love for basketball, and we spent many hours to watch the" Phoenix Suns "" in the game. "</seg>
<seg id="25">"Trumps Intolerance also stands in contrast to the generosity that I lived on Sandy Bahr, who fights their lives for the environment and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me as their son."</seg>
<seg id="26">"she adapts to the commitment of Kristi Kappes, who always helped with a lot of patience and grace to me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of the American life."</seg>
<seg id="27">"then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors who helped me a lot with my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values they embodied in deepened my love of America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"during the Trump's path to the nomination Republican presidential data, they offered me a stop and the counterpart to its restricted vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule."</seg>
<seg id="31">"on 8 November 2016, more than 50 million Americans, mostly White, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt towards non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the discussion with the idea that people voted for Trump, because they shared either its racism and fanaticism, because they were willing to overlooked these things, broke me almost the heart."</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the Trump-voters as rassists.</seg>
<seg id="34">"to arrange the people, one of my friends, is exactly what we led to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and respectful and indicates an inability to understand those who act in a different way and thinking.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows the people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not considered.</seg>
<seg id="37">"could it be that these voters are, of which most knows, for Trump voted, because they want to attract control over a country that she has disappointed?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, they might want to say that they are still important in this America?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who commented the cruel decision to watch a man who look down with contempt on those who look differently from him."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this" Whitelash "(Anm.).: as much as" boelongation of the White against all other ethnies ";" word from white in terms of white and whiplash, as much means as Schleudersad), as it was the great Van Jones, exactly which America has made so great. "</seg>

<seg id="44">"with the choice Donald Trumps, however, is a huge part of the white America of this promise and says: to hell with manifold, religious freedom and the whole concept of pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="45">"in America after 9 / 11, the white man is back on the herds, they say."</seg>
<seg id="46">"with all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who had fallen in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election."</seg>
<seg id="47">"on a manifestation for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would have my son, captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan. "</seg>

<seg id="98">"this post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, published a magazine that specifically reported on international, practical solutions for environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="99">Re-release occurs during an agreement with Global Voices for common use of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">"in West Africa was then known that this ship had already operated in liberated waters illegal fishing, before it was looking for the other coast of Africa."</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were accordingly up accordingly and little geneives to welcome a legislative brecher of this kind in their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comoros, Mozambique and the Seychelles mobilised himself against the ship. they lingered him, one of their ports and refuse to give him a fishing sign."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" Ursuddenly was the prime minister surrounded by countries that you simply deny all everything "," reminds of Benedict Kiilu, a leader of the Kenyan Fisheries. he is part of a team that discovered the ship's ship and followed. "</seg>
<seg id="104">"in 2013, the ship was driven out of the waters of the region: it was not succeeded to catch the fishes."</seg>
<seg id="105">"ultimately, it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, due to looting of fish stocks."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the core of this initiative, which protects criminal practices, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NRO Stop Illegal Fishing (Illegale Fisheries)."</seg>
<seg id="107">"the members of this network are beside Somalia and Madagascar, the six countries that had expelled the prime minister out of their waters."</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "we have eight countries that are like-minded and work together. they exchange information and stand together where it comes to illegal fishing," "says Tony Long, Head of the Pew Charitable Trusts project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support."</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is regulated by definition: what is caught is hidden is hidden because of it is extremely difficult to absorb. this is the illegal fisheries a leading cause of overfishing regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">"by intentional disregard to existing laws, through which certain habitats and species are to be protected, the illegal fishing ecosystems can harm the illegal fishing ecosystems."</seg>
<seg id="111">"but while actions against illegal fishing were hindered by bureaucratic hurdles and also by the snail-empo, with the information between individual countries, so the actions of these activities occurred in real time, with traceable to FISH-i's digital communication platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"here the individual countries can share with each other, for example lists of existing licences, news to suspicious activities or details that you have noticed during a port speculate or learn."</seg>
<seg id="113">"Fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very attentive, when they are at the open sea, by means of satellite data."</seg>
<seg id="114">"this allows the authorities to mark the authorities, vessels which fish in bottomed areas - about such that suggest a ship his filmed fish on the way to other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"in the Idealincident, such surveys can show whether the participating vessels have a fishing licence, where they were on the way and possibly also whether they have a penal code."</seg>
<seg id="116">"countries that are against illegal fishing, may refuse the adoption of such ships in its ports. what does the ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to pay off penalties, as in the case of Prime Minister."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "it's then about significant financial losses for the owner, meaning that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="118">"and that is what we want to achieve", "says Per Erik Bergh, leading Director of NFDS Africa. this latter is a consultant company dedicated to the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">"the already mentioned platform was created to attract 20 million USD in lost turnover, which will lose eight members of the network HISH-i every year due to the illegal fishermen, which penetrate into East African waters."</seg>
<seg id="121">East-Africa has one of the most productive tuna fish farms that lead to the region of commercial fishing from around the world. among those also those illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">"such practices include events as the sailing under false flag, counterfeit Licpapiere, specification of phantasies, the fish protected species and the fish in conservation areas."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" they often use the lack of international cooperation and make the weaknesses of a non-controlled control system, "says Long." "earlier a ship could be illegally fishing and a country could then say" You dared not walk my harbour. "</seg>
<seg id="124">"but another country could say 'Comm to me'." "and exactly this legale hatch tries to close FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">"since its inception, FISH-i was involved in more than 30 studies of suspects ships."</seg>
<seg id="127">It has revealed criminal networks to spread counterfeit licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that were tracked several fraudulent identities and found fledged ships and found.</seg>
<seg id="128">"due to its cooperation with Interpol, the international authority to combat crime, FISH-i can share information on illegal fishing over large distances."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" some of our investigations carry us quite far into the networks of organised crime, "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="130">"it builds a system that can help FISH-i, digested ships precise."</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo with friendly permission of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">"fish-i's satellite system, which is always further developed, helps the illegal ships also helps to hide."</seg>
<seg id="133">"" the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position, "" says Duncan Copeland, Chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO, which also deals with fishing data and FISH-i technical support. "</seg>
<seg id="134">"some of the ships turn off for example their automatic identification systems, which they can no longer be used by satellites."</seg>
<seg id="135">"therefore, Copeland helps to build a system that connects various information levels. it aims to help FISH-i to find criminal vessels with greater precision."</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team African nations can actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of the NGOs SkyTruth, believes that."</seg>
<seg id="139">"recently, skytruth has opened up with Google and the marine protection organisation Oceana the platform Global Fishing Watch: a platform that provides satellite data and by means that the position of every single traceable vessel can be displayed worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "work together with neighbours to get a better picture of what where does - this results simply meaning," "he says." "here is a chance for countries to unite and to join their resources."</seg>
<seg id="141">"we should do this on a global level." "Pew Charitable trusts has a similar project to run in which a global system permissible the persecution of ships."</seg>
<seg id="142">"there are signs that FISH-i's activities are not only criminals, but they are also hooked."</seg>
<seg id="143">"ships that have previously been confiscated without licence and hardly expected to reckon with consequences, they know that they are observed."</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i participating countries now have a 33% increase in fishing sales, since fishing boats in more licenses."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after FISH-i Somalia had helped Greko 1, Greko 1 found the inspectors on board skeppia, whose use is forbidden."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo with friendly permission of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"other countries also notice these successes." "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries", "says Kiilu." "in West Africa, several hundred million dollars will disappear annually by illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="148">"in 2015 six countries joined the West Africa Task Force. they are now fighting for illegal fishing, according to the same model as FISH-i." "With security is the aim of leaving more such initiatives and structures in other regions," says Copeland. "</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently, FISH-i's youngest member states could report his first big triumph: in October it was Greko 1, a ship that was under false flag, and not only was the ship without a license and were used sluggnets, which are now prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship was also penetrated in bottomed waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "with the take of measures against Greko 1, which go a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing," "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="151">"for FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time the evidence that such special, collaborative approach to protect the oceans actually works in the entire world ocean. Emma Bryce is a freelance journalist and lives in London. there is a topic on environment, technology and nutrition."</seg>

<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian Parliamentary parliamentarians have recently voted a bill for "regulators with respect to the use and utility of social networks."</seg>
<seg id="503">"if he is accepted by the Parliament, user will need to register to users and users of social media in Egypt with a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="504">"on the basis of the law would then be set up a place, which is compromised to give citizens a permission to give social media."</seg>
<seg id="505">"within six months of acceptance of the law, user will need to register to users and users on the site of the site with their proper names and personnel numbers to use social networks."</seg>
<seg id="506">"if it is dreamed of doing this, that could be a penalty of up to six months in prison or a money."</seg>
<seg id="507">"the bill, which consists of six Paragrarians, and in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defined social media as" each application that runs via the Internet and is used to communicate with others through voice, video, and text. "</seg>
<seg id="508">"it is unclear how the law is being enforced if there is no indication of how Egyptian authorities cannot place the user's user. unclear is how they do not register the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not able to address the regulation on the level of social media companies.</seg>
<seg id="509">"Riyad Abdul Sattar, Parliament of parliament and promoter of the legislation, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users and users received a user name and a password to come through firewall, the Facebook blocked."</seg>
<seg id="510">"this could mean that Egypt is planning to establish a firewall at national level around Facebook. because of those, it would be required for the Egyptians and Egyptians to be able to access their identity."</seg>
<seg id="511">"however, it is not known that such plans are made."</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts on site are sceptical regarding the technical feasibility of the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="513">"Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technologist (in German" "conductive scientists") of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, in German "Egyptian Initiative for personal rights"), told Global Voices: "</seg>
<seg id="514">"I am greatly interested in the technical capacities and understanding, neither authority in Egypt regarding things that have to do with technology."</seg>
<seg id="515">"in my opinion, they imagine that same as they are able to control the physical public and private spaces it could also be done online."</seg>
<seg id="516">"if I take them seriously, then this means that they are set up a strong surveillance system to exchange citizens who request a licence or not. and this means a reverent system to monitor the activities of the people and also to lead them to a court process."</seg>
<seg id="517">This is not by no means realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="518">"to be adopted as law, the draft must first be discussed at the legislative Parliament and the constitutional committees before it comes to the plenary debate."</seg>
<seg id="519">"whether his acceptance and enforcement is successful or not, the draft is to be maximized with a pro-military mind within the parliament, in whose sense the control is maximised and assured that no deviation is present on the image surface, says Raoof."</seg>

<seg id="544">"in early March 2017, documented in the North East Japanese daily Kahoku Shimpo, the progress made in recent six years to rebuild the life of those who had been hit by the" Trinity catastrophe "" of March 2011. a violent earthquake, a tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima had triggered the disaster. "</seg>
<seg id="545">"the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung has its headquarters in Sendai, which is in the prefecture of Miyagi. the prefecture of Miyagi was a etyprefecture of Japan on the northeast, which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami."</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring boilers of Fukushima and Ivate were forced to disappear all the coastal cities of the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">"even this was the prefecture of Fukushima a nuclear accident, already alone, 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes."</seg>
<seg id="548">The Special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows from local view which progress has been reached six years to rebuild the lives of the local resident.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper contains both statistics of the Japanese rebuilding Authority and survey results of those affected by themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">"apartment building in Fukushima, Miyagi and Ivate</seg>
<seg id="551">"the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned spare-houses (or in a solo, saigai kouei juutaku) were finished in the prefecture of Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate."</seg>
<seg id="552">"the biggest success among the three prefectures could draw Miyagi, here, 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed."</seg>
<seg id="553">"Iwate has 75 percent of such houses finished, while at Fukushima with 70 percent of the final light."</seg>
<seg id="554">"at least six years after the catastrophe, evacuated by base accommodation (or in a, casetsu juutaku) in final spare parts."</seg>
<seg id="555">After the triple-fold catastrophe almost 80 000 people were forced to live in accommodation facilities.</seg>
<seg id="556">"in December 2016, 36 000 people lived from Miyagi, Fukushima and Ivate in such containers."</seg>
<seg id="557">"nearly 40 percent of the year 2011 evacuated from Fukushima still live in emergency accommodation, whereas Miyagi was successful. more than 75 percent of the evacuated, which was settled after the disaster in Behelfswald, were populated in final houses."</seg>
<seg id="558">"for Ivate, the number is here at 34 percent."</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three affected prefecture</seg>
<seg id="560">"as the Kahoku Shimpo paper was able to determine 1074 of 1100 schools which have been affected by the unhappiness, their doors can be opened up to December 2016, which makes almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="561">"six years later, the industrial reconstruction in the three prefecture is far more difficult."</seg>
<seg id="562">"while nearly 100 percent of the fishing harbours at Ivate and Miyagi are now back in operation, in Fukushima only 30 percent of the fishery harbours its operation."</seg>
<seg id="563">"the tsunami and the atomizer of the atomic accident, have moved in the three prefectures of agricultural large-scale."</seg>
<seg id="564">"Miyagi was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural land, with only 66 percent of the Ackercountry in Ivate and less than 50 percent destroyed old Ackerland in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="565">"it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of nuclear, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares are destroyed by Fukushima disaster in the" "nuclear zone". ""</seg>
<seg id="566">"in two of the three prefectures, tourism has largely recovered, but even here Fukushima still remains back."</seg>
<seg id="567">"the tourist office in Miyagi and Iwates are more than 90 percent at the same stand, just as before the unhappiness. Fukushima can be found here only 75 percent."</seg>
<seg id="568">"however, the Kahoku Shimpo-newspaper also reports that since disaster was almost half of the coastal people, it's more difficult to earn their living."</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">"in order to determine a total picture, the newspaper led numerous surveys among the native population and among the evacuated by. she asked them about the status of rebuilding and also how their receptionists have changed to the tsunami risk."</seg>
<seg id="571">In the introduction of the article explains the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo led a survey conducted by the tsunami awareness among the native population in experience.</seg>
<seg id="573">"the survey brought that 83.1% of the local residents, measures taken to be prepared to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis."</seg>
<seg id="574">"however, 55.9 percent of the respondents find that still not enough in terms of disasters prevention has been done."</seg>
<seg id="575">"as it stands for those who had to be evacuated from the prefecture of Fukushima"</seg>
<seg id="576">"in its output to the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung also has directed its attention to the situation of evacuated from Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="577">"Fukushima had not only had to experience the enormous earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, the prefecture of Fukushima was also a witness of the worst, catastrophism, atomizers, the Japan ever had."</seg>
<seg id="578">"from 160 000 evacuation of Fukushima were published almost 63 000 people in areas outside the prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="579">"early 2016 was somewhat more than 23 000 people, back to Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="580">"after the state of 2017, still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside their home prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="581">"in the catastrophism, most of the evacuated areas are still over 50 years old. they have to return in real containers, because the efforts for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Ivate and Fukushima have to compete with massive construction projects. this is part of the Olympic Games that will be held in Tokyo by 2020."</seg>

<seg id="692">"people of the First Nations communities across Canada are dealing with topics, which are important for them. they do this by Hip Hop, thanks to a number of hiking workshops."</seg>
<seg id="693">"as part of the N'we Jinan-Tour since 2014, since 2014 workshop participants bring mobile audio studios directly to schools and youth centres in order to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live appearances."</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were headed by the pedagogues David Hodges which lives in Montreal and worked in North-Quebec with ten Cree communities and then worked together with the Cree Hip Hop-hop-Group The Northstars.</seg>
<seg id="695">"the workshop continues to increase the young participants in discussions as" cultural identity, language, discussion, love, self acceptance, or whatever it comes to mind. "</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">"because the workshops were so popular, the team worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in the U.S. state Nebraska."</seg>
<seg id="698">"this video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak'yoo tells us in the area of the tribe of the Kitsumkalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, the Highway of the Highway 16, also called" Highway of the tears, "in which almost two dozen people were killed or murdered by almost two dozen young women."</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely unexplained.</seg>
<seg id="700">"the next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video player to convey, how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs, despite the influences of globalisation."</seg>
<seg id="701">"many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, though the young people did not always control the languages of the First Nations."</seg>
<seg id="702">"in the following song, that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation have been recorded, the chorus is sung to Cree."</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved got a little help from Gary Jolly from the Northstars Hip Hop-Group who gave them a strophe in the dialect Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">"on the Facebookpage of N'we Jinan, the strophe is at your disposal, as a translation into English, which is translated into German here:"</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel as if nobody would ever be interested in myself</seg>

<seg id="750">"the coverage of drug bosses such as El Chapo Guzmán, the chief of Sinaloa-Kartell, conducted the stories of the victims of the conflict completely in the background."</seg>
<seg id="751">"on the day after a violent incident, there is hardly any one look at the grape or the communes that have learned to live with pain."</seg>
<seg id="752">"we stand behind every body, behind each bone, behind each bone, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds might never heal."</seg>
<seg id="753">"therefore, the Mexican-based portal Animal Político the digital project" "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" "(German:" "with drug trading live" ") to give these victims one voice should give the struggle between the criminal authorities and cartels."</seg>

<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprender a vivir con el narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">"we do not only have to show the faces of those who fear itself. we must show the international community of conflicts, the brittle and the state."</seg>

<seg id="783">I cannot be equal to this or consider it as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She writes further:</seg>
<seg id="785">"no, it is not normal that my 10-year Cousin thinks he will be (German: drug dealers) if it is great. and it is also not normal that people listen to the" heroism "of the offenders if they go through the streets."</seg>
<seg id="786">"for me, that's why they would have lost those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that they have happened to them too."</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness if stories about mere numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"the insomnia of the people is incredibly good for me, if the death of six people and the disappearances of 43 students were justified in a neighbort so that they were."</seg>

<seg id="1534">"some, included me, make it still, but only if they are alone and no other family members are included."</seg>
<seg id="1535">"just one or two will continue to say the name of her husband, just one or two women now wearing Zinnoberred on their forehead."</seg>

<seg id="1898">"on the way of migrants that Europe or Latin America cross, certain places are known for their hospitality."</seg>
<seg id="1899">"I visited one of these places in the Mexican City of Tapachula, he is located at the border to Guatemala."</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">"it is headed by a 59- year-old Mexican, a small woman with a corals-pink Brillengestell and gold-coloured chain rings in Teddy-style."</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless they know many of the names of Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">"this nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) became a destination for Africans and Haitian, who are on the journey."</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm whatsoever.</seg>
<seg id="1905">"for approximately 2.50 dollars the night sleep in simple rooms, with table, crumbling walls and beds made of metal."</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no signpost to the hotel - nevertheless there are hundreds of African and hatian migrants here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">"sometimes, Mrs. Ramírez, people come to full small buses and from the upper part of the coast to call it:" Mama Africa! "</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you mom Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">"at the moment it is rather quiet, but this year Ramírez has received 200 guests at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"there are only 24 rooms, some have even slept out on boxes."</seg>
<seg id="1912">It does not want to decline anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">"she also helps them and brings them to hospital when they are sick, they buy drugs that they can not pay them, they massaged them with a balsam made by the long journey of depleted feet."</seg>
<seg id="1914">"Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, is recently arrived."</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mum Africa is a reasonable nickname for Mrs Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The family Sebastiao (with her daughter Merrui who has a yoghuree) quiert with Concepción González Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>

<seg id="1919">"yes, yes," reply with a smile. "I really feel that it adapts to her, as African women are very nice women."</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very affectionate.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">"Sebastiao travels with his sister, who hopes to reach Boston to Boston, to find her husband and the three children."</seg>
<seg id="1924">"they have lived in Brazil, however, it is for some Africans who are on the way to the United States to make normal a first stop in South America and then move towards north."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"the family had heard from other directions of Mama Africa." "Mama Africa is a familiar name on the track" "explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti."</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that the Haitian and the Africans often go along the track and that the Africans already speak to Whatsapp by Mrs Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">"like many of his travel guides, Michelet lived in Brazil before and has worked as a construction workers on the construction of the Olympic Games and the football World Championship."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"when the Brazilian economy was weaker, he started his journey into the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1929">"he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sold SIM cards to save the necessary money, to purchase the Busticket to Tijuana."</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will contact his wife Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"mom Africa is our mother and we never let them go back," "reply smiling." we will always stay in contact. "</seg>
<seg id="1932">Ms. Ramírez tells her guests often send text messages if they have gone to grading them or to report her about the course of her journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that their Christian faith in the drive of her work is.</seg>
<seg id="1934">"she does not know much about Africa, but their guests have brought her together to prepare chickens like in Ghana."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"Ms. Ramírez is perhaps very well known here, but it is not the only funk for the migrants that travel through Tapachula."</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">"this winter, Valencia and his family were recorded in their small house."</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is policeman and has established that the Bustickets are sold to numerous African migrants too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">"he has begun to help them to get a reasonable price, then he has offered them his house for a dollar night."</seg>
<seg id="1940">"at the moment 25 people are there, mainly Haitians."</seg>
<seg id="1941">"some sleeping on blankets on the ground, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a kitchen outside."</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valencia explains that he knows what the guests will go through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I have lived in the United States, he tells." I have experienced what they experience. "</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others do not help. that's why I give them my support.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"after having lived for three years, he was transferred to a raid on his work place from the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"the majority of migrants who travels through Tapachula, comes from Central America, other inhabitants also open the doors of their houses for them."</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he had fled to people in Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to be blackmailed from him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"in Tapachula he asked for accommodation and a well-known, an all-one-educator, has offered him its roof."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"a few months later the family lives still there, and tries to decide where the next steps should go."</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the courses the travelers are looking for their telephones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">"a minibus has arrived today and has 20 new guests, a majority of Somalia."</seg>
<seg id="1954">"Ms. Ramírez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic because of those who have gone."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"like a proud mother, she peted her album with numerous photos."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"there are one of her daughter with African hair-genuine, which you made a customer in, some photos of their grandchildren and many travellers more, boy and Old."</seg>

<seg id="1964">"however, the public authorities use the app for more than the fight against terrorism."</seg>

<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">"during the news about digital censorship in China mostly focus on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south, the reality is very often dull for those who live in remote, frightened ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet."</seg>

<seg id="1979">"if you are detected at a checkpoint with a device without this software, it could be detained up to 10 days."</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for the technological development.</seg>

<seg id="2064">At punishment in all its diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2065">Its command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2066">He calls it lovingly "confession."</seg>
<seg id="2067">It starts with a plastic tube which probably comes from the cloaken.</seg>

<seg id="2072">"they had fled four cable to each other, to present ourselves from their sight, great invention of a huge cable."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"within one hour, three of them are confused, while I was still standing in the series."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"I had lost any feeling in my body - and my voice, so I heard to cry out."</seg>
<seg id="2075">The executioner marked the cooling and found not even a favor of it so that he looked up as a neighbor to an electric loaded runoff.</seg>

<seg id="2079">After two terrible hours he decided he had fulfilled his duty for this night.</seg>
<seg id="2080">It must have been so at midnight.</seg>
<seg id="2081">"I decided to sleep myself again, we say that was my only option."</seg>
<seg id="2082">"some hours left, which came to me as minutes."</seg>

<seg id="2090">"the jordal Rapper Emsallam Hdaib rees over the rights of the LGBTQ + community, free expression and resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">"the photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"Emsallam Hdaib spends the bulk of his time inside, he shredded to his screen, time to his computer, and again to his couch."</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what one can rely on is a cigarette between his fingers or his nicotine lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">"he lives in the top of his family house, which had been part of them since 1967; the year in which Israel was completed his occupation of the West Bank, and Hdaibs were forced to escape from their village in Palestine in which she lived as felahyeen (about: Farmer)."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"for six years, Hdaib has been a passionate activist who faces the conservative majority and interviewed their old opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression by art and Rapmusic."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"with his music that often sets up with themes such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, but also calls for the core of the whole Arab world. all these issues do not only find in his hometown Amman Relevance but also in cities that wealthy from Damascus in Syria up to Sanaa in Yemen."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"with his 25 years Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not restricted in his mind, and he may feel according to his own statement by people who suffer the devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"even if he does not open it openly, he defeated an extra inclination against the US foreign policy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"Hdaib doesn't believe that his compassion for those who try to do in war areas, anything with his identity as" Palestinian escape of the second generation "- so he himself was born, even if he was born in Jordan, and has never been in Palestine."</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I do not think of my own living conditions so," says Hdaib. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">"then he adds:" "I think that because I am a man, while he shocked in water off the Nescafé in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; in this time it is provided for Muslims, from sunrise to sunset."</seg>
<seg id="2105">The jordal law also states that the public consumption of food during the Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">"obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness for it to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee on a sening hot juncag has little to do with protest against Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2107">"basically, the beats of hot coffee and the swades of the Kent cigarette in the nose primarily speak of freedom."</seg>
<seg id="2108">"sometimes, Jordan is like a prison in the open sky, especially when you throws a look into the neighbouring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"therefore, it is easy to avoid basic things - as in the public during the Ramadan's water - to not land in prison."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently, the Ministry of Jordanian has announced an appearance of the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"some MPs, which support the Islamic Action Front - the jordanic branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of homosexual frontier Hamed Sinno, contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country, and the main reason for the concert."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"the MP and former press conference in the Islamic coalition DIMA Tahboub said in an interview with CNN, that the concert was said" "because of the sexual orientation of the scary."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"in addition, many claim the commitment of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world may be dangerous activism, which represents the old-proven legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the entire region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement Mashrou'Leila the jordal people as" "progressive supporter of human rights", "which continue to work" for an intellectual and cultural pluralism. "</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement may probably not be simply seized rhetoric, but actually a more evident crystallied reality in Jordan reflect that in Hdaibs work clearly appears."</seg>
<seg id="2116">"in 2016 Hdaib traditional sex-ternormen to Leibe, he formed his vision of the fate of Arab women, who made prey sex."</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the picture shows the skeleton of a apparently crushed unknown wife, whose arms and legs are up to the corners of the canvas."</seg>
<seg id="2118">"it is surrounded by a red lake, perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives through their hands they should trust."</seg>
<seg id="2119">"over the past few years, the number of 'Ehrenmorde' has risen in Jordan - the inofficial outside."</seg>
<seg id="2120">"according to her climax, the number of honorary morde in 2016 reached its peak; however, the Jordan is still lacking the institutional infrastructure is missing to support the women who tried to support the victims of murder or domestic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a law on fighting corruption from the year 1954, women who are exposed to danger intra-family violence, and for their release is often a years of anger, and the guarantee of the family is necessary that the woman will happen nothing."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"Hdaibs music enjoys great popularity and is known for it, also not to be back on topics, which in his country has long as tabernacle."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib contestly that his work is political, but it is that he cannot separate his music, the full explicit approach to sexuality, freedom and expression, not of politics."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, Man."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"I was redeemed policy," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed" Hdaib takes the question of the Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"in" "Lawla al 3aib" "and in" "Ghareeb" "is the focus on poverty."</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the list of songs that are political, can be moved to the core."</seg>
<seg id="2129">"in March 2016 Hdaib released a song with the title" Santandano. "</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated many times:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and every other is it too."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market, on which one can get what you want" - be it faith or non-faith, spetero- or homosexuality. "</seg>
<seg id="2133">He noticed that hardly someone speaks in Jordan over the rights of gay and lesbians and that comments on the equality of LGBTQ + -individuals were still heavily censored.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014 Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular jordian OnlineProgram Roya, in order to remember that his comments were ensored from the context, distorted his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but it was only a processed version," says he. "</seg>
<seg id="2136">"today, Hdaib is open to the Arab LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance towards homosexuals do not unlock the Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentioned Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, who has remained in memory thanks to his homoerotic poems."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib asks themselves: if Abu Nuwhat would work later on behalf of the Caliph, in the eighth century could write openly about homosexuality, why can Jordanir that not?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"in the Hashemitic Kingdom, there is nothing new that the government attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are brought to silence."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, took place in January 2017, took place several former governmental office and members of the teacher-association with the justification, they would have criticized on comments in social media, which expressed deep in the country with the deeply rooted in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"in view of this, the concert Hdaibs should say only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to effect a structural change in the next generation of the Jordan River."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"for him progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan, Mashrou'Leila has now turned into a gig, but the path of progress - it looks for slow, printed and inner changes. it is certain that these changes occur from day to day at the heart of the jordan society."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"ultimately, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, also, from an Arab world without intervention from abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he not only dreams of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem, and Damascus, but also of it."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"perhaps the region is bound by music, art and literature of genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, spreading unitions, and on artificial nature. at least, he hopes that."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"until it is as far as it is, Hdaib will continue, and thus also resist."</seg>

<seg id="2181">"the following article is the revised version of the paper" "Send message to Guerillakaha," which has published the International Online Magazine Tea After Twelve. "</seg>
<seg id="2182">This entry is published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love-letters to people who we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">"is it not yet a lot more important to people who feel outside, affection."</seg>
<seg id="2185">Exactly this question went to the two young Colombian activists of Leonardo Párraga by the Stiftung Bogotene and Cristian Palacios by the Young-Youth Foundation no longer of the head and inspirational it to the campaign Cartas por la Reconciliación (letters to reconciliation) that young people are encouraged to write guerrilla letters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">"only recently, her country was a place of historical event and they wanted to contribute to their part, after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had concluded a peace agreement with the guerrilla bend FARC (German: revolutionary armed armed conflict in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"international was the submission of the peace agreement as so significant, that the Colombian President José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize."</seg>
<seg id="2188">But in front of the Colombian people there is still a long way until one can speak of real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">"guerrilla warfare that have lived for many years in illegal bearings, were exposed to war rhetoric, and around the clock, and around the clock, must now be integrated into the life as an civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"the Colombian society in turn, who had accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases where they had accustomed to guerrilla warfare, they must take part in their ranks and support them in building a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Kolumbians had joined together and would help in the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">"and exactly this did they also: until now, thousands of young people have written letters - love-ships to former guerrilla war to welcome them back in society."</seg>
<seg id="2193">"the goal of the campaign are 6900 letters, one for any former guerrilla warfare, which should then be handed over personally."</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">"the idea for letters to reconciliation was born on the world summit of the Nobel Peace Prize winner, which was held in February 2017 in Bogotá. there were Leonardo and Cristian the opportunity to talk briefly with Kailash Satyarthi, the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"this explained that we love the people we love, on Valentine's day of love-letter, but those forgotten that they need much needed."</seg>
<seg id="2197">"he was planning, he told us to share his love with people in this year, the most urgent promise."</seg>
<seg id="2198">"thus, the plan to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC, who can now find their place in society and establish a new life." the letters are being prepared to make discourses of a war history to a common history of peace. "</seg>
<seg id="2199">"so far, more than 2000 letters have been collected within the framework of the campaign."</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major cities of Kolumbiens, like Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá."</seg>
<seg id="2201">I never thought that someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over on 19 March in one of the UN camps in the Caldono Region.</seg>
<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the Municipal administration of Cali and Leonardo by the Stiftung BogotArt traveled in the camp to get the letters personally."</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC presented herself as they had done before to have the commands of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">"but this time they received no precepts, but the letters of shelter of people from all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it was a very mobile moment for all involved." it's incredible how many different feelings can be run in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and all that is in-between, and the policy-president Manuela Jiménez Avila later. "</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a employee of the governor of the province of Valle del Cauca described this unforgettable experience so: "</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after we had passed the letters, led me a former fighter through the camp of the Guerilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I saw in one of the" "Cambuches" "(a kind of hut, in which the guerricks live), I saw a guerriator who wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I was afraid of responding, because beside him on the bed there was a MGL-Granatter, a deadly weapon in the thorn-sheep."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"and I said it anyway, and said," "hello, what do they do?" he answered, "I answered a letter that has written to me."</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"never in my life someone has written something so nice, so I answered it." "I suddenly got the tears over the cheeks."</seg>
<seg id="2214">I saw him very firm and set me next to the granulates.</seg>
<seg id="2215">"perhaps he was also the pity, I was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter, and wanted to help him to write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">"the man told me more about his life. he never had anything else from life than war. himself, the only way to keep him and his six brothers in front of the hunger ptod." I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes. "</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society there that is waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">"until now, I just learned how I have to deal with weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now where peace is reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">"to the clocking, students and some leaders of the FARC came to a discussion."</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all raised when war prevailed and the FARC already in hiding.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"therefore the leaders of the FARC the history of the organization, their ideals, and gave insight into their views on the peace process:" "many years ago, we have seen how the social injustice from the state to the whole Colombian people, we can contribute to shaping the society in this country."</seg>
<seg id="2224">"for a goal of this size order it is worth to overcome all the obstacles," "said one of them."</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"to hear these people who had never found inhearing, and acknowledge that the people that I often saw as monster and even hate, even people with beautiful feelings that were turned through their living conditions and their environment was very painful for me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">"the reality, in which the country lives, does hurt."</seg>
<seg id="2228">"but it roasted me that all men - also those who have killed and so much damage, we can teach us and a smile and a hug."</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"Gustavo González, the commander of the camp in Caldono Cauca, wrote for example Darío de Jesús Monsalve, the Archbishop of the city of Cali, the following letter:"</seg>
<seg id="2231">"the Kolumbianern was made, that after the drarming peace would reign."</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"as long as it gives inequality, hunger and lack of education, healthcare and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are ready to grasp the weapons and to protest for their rights. and this is also completely justified (...)."</seg>
<seg id="2234">"from the FARC, we are now putting peace to a policy without weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"therefore, we call all defenders of peace - regardless of which race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"we give you our word, make our contribution and bring victims, as we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence, will face many difficulties."</seg>
<seg id="2237">"on our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them."</seg>

<seg id="2280">"they called me, wrote me - Related, strangers, some completely unknown."</seg>
<seg id="2281">This was the beginning of a nightclub.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The required to return to Chechnya to prove that it was all a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">"they asked absurd demands: some told me, I am going to prove it by clicking on the roads and say that I had not changed my sex in Grosny and say that I had not changed my sex, that everything was only bad, and Photoshop."</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have Körbchensize C - what could I say on television?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it is still hard for her.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older people once again spoke my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"they said to her," They have brought a monster to the world that has not only damaged your family, but the whole of the Republic. "</seg>
<seg id="2290">"we cannot stir you because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here."</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother became too much and she lay down a strick around the neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Fortunately the neighbours came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later under the window a car with uncovered window washers and a number plate with a 95 dron.</seg>
<seg id="2295">"after it happened for the third time, it was clear to me that there was a little lazy."</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights-friends overtested the number of numbers - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you fled?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">"for safety reasons, I do not want to give their name to the name, but I will say that I remember them all; they really helped me."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"with their help I left the country, but then something uncredible."</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Just before leaving Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"I bought it, without sign up without filling out, without anything."</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and cast them into the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checks in the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"at the moment I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message:" "you don't think about, you warmer in security, just because you have left the country?"</seg>
<seg id="2309">"our people already know, in which hotel you do. you even know your room number."</seg>
<seg id="2310">"only to prove it, it is the number 115."</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was indeed my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"however, we do not talk about the gender equality, but this is a tabutopic."</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditionally cascasian elements I carry in me still.</seg>
<seg id="2317">So much I wish to do this seperate barrier I can not overcome.</seg>
<seg id="2318">"I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to hurt them."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"when we chat with a camera, I actually give me effort to watch how the person reminds them from their past - so to my male form."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But this is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">"what do your friends do, those who have stayed there?"</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I have submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For the needed I took up-to-date information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">"I spoke with someone, the one and a half months in Argun."</seg>
<seg id="2326">"he told that during the Ramadan were no man arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he didn't closed a new wave."</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"so I mean, they probably invite the relatives to take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end demand a proof that the so-called" honour "have experienced by blood Genugment."</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are even more pregnant women detained in this secrecy?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a familiar with me says it would not be very many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">"if, then above all those who have no rich relatives, or those of their relatives were dropped to place Kadyrows in court."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"as far as I know, they are stored there, so that they can present them later than terrorists."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"say: should they be brought about, you will show their bodies on television and claim, they would have attacked either any village or a military base."</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"as if these people did not simply disappear, but targeted, to radicalze."</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this now just a mutation or do you have a source of this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just got someone who was detained in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard has grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new of them.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply have taken them.</seg>
<seg id="2341">"and this so-called Lord, this person was themselves to be taken as these people."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"until now they were not presented as bandits, but there were no reports yet. we suggest that such actions are quite possible."</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why would you not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">"do you know whether these persecutions and kidnappings of people who belong to a so-called" non-traditional "orientation, already in the past?"</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I have always carried my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">"I think already before 2003 I was already known all over the world, when I lived there - and I never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2348">In the Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">"even from 1998 to 1999 when the sharia was considered, I never had problems."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"on the contrary, at that time it was much safer than now."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"Russia was originally intended to lead us to the" civilisation ", but finally, has thrown back to the Stoneage."</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Scharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were dressed; I had colored eyelashes, carried Tubejeans and short Tops. "</seg>
<seg id="2354">The safety of the sharia has never had a hair bent on me.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"before the Russian theatre in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people as met me."</seg>
<seg id="2356">"it was a small place where several benches stood, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people met there."</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been polluted.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a Redemption: Kharda ma Kharda. that is said: "Spafrot is not about the unmisfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">They often say to children when the sick are funny.</seg>
<seg id="2360">"OC Media: so they simply have their eyes closed before you, because they believed, you be sick?"</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">"they have never denied me, never jagt, and never beaten."</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this waste time stopped?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: for so long until Kadyrow came to the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">"as he was appointed Minister of Prime Minister, he began to speak on TV about morality."</seg>
<seg id="2366">"he spoke not about us by se, but primarily on the behavior of women."</seg>
<seg id="2367">"nevertheless, one could sense how the people in the city started to change."</seg>
<seg id="2368">"who had been rified, and had suffered before you at once with suspicion."</seg>
<seg id="2369">In the time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">"but every time I came back home, I was able to feel like the situation in the Republic is steadily deteriorated."</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you do now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't condensed much - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the USA is not much.</seg>
<seg id="2374">"apart from that, I am still active as an activist."</seg>
<seg id="2375">"at present, I am responsible for 15 Muslim women."</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"we organise teacups, meetings, I take a companion to get them to hospital and help them to get Essentides."</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't have long a cent for it.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people themselves when I displaced my escape.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslim and wants to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: this is albern.</seg>
<seg id="2383">"so, nature, that has nothing to do with religion at all."</seg>
<seg id="2384">"this is exactly the same as Tschetschene, who want to make you with foam in front of the mouth, that there are no sleeves with them."</seg>
<seg id="2385">"the Dagestans have which, the cabardiners have which, the Russians also have which; on the entire planet there is - but not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">"I come from there, so it is unpleasant to hear what to hear."</seg>
<seg id="2387">There are so many men from Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">"many of them - practicing Muslims, who go into the mosque, and during the Ramadan, live with men together."</seg>
<seg id="2389">"you know many think about transitional identity to men who love men, and they believe that man changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but this is a trustee."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"these are two different things - two different kinds of feeling to be accurate, different life settings."</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"I'm sorry that I'm here so personally, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago."</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not at all sad - I just know that I am now myself.</seg>

<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">"when I say that I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women who call themselves as intersewage feminists - with frustration."</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even lay good through scientific and social arguments against me why I should be feminist and why we generally should be all feminist * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for example, that women still earn less money in spite of the same education than men."</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women still stand under stringent observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their body.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women live sooner or later in various areas of life to a smooth ceiling, and that discrimination on the basis of sex still moves through the many different countries and faiths."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is conscious of me and known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced that I am dimmed twice and threefold.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">"yet, if I'm talking to skin colour, on black CIS women, on black CIS women, on black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women from the Diaspora, when I talked about what kind of we have physically, seelic and verbal abuse have been silent, both in and outside the feminist movement, to mention many white feminists and white interctionists feminists."</seg>
<seg id="2448">"but we all agree that women - all women - come together to show" their voices and "Kumbaya, my lord's" to sing "to achieve equality (some) of women."</seg>
<seg id="2449">"but they don't want to talk about sexualised violence as an institutionalized form of racial, which we are exposed to black women on two times."</seg>
<seg id="2450">"or that black women and women of other ethnies, and origin of origin deserve less than white men and women."</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls are referred to as a white girl because of obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">"or that women are exposed in black spheres and women with a migration background, domestic violence and violence suffer from a partnership, as white women."</seg>
<seg id="2453">"on the one hand, I want that all women, all men and all men do not have any skin color the same rights; on the other hand, I am not able to join the white woman in whose center the white woman stands, which refuse to consider both the gender and the skin colour of a person."</seg>
<seg id="2454">"I'm exhausted and will no longer fight for my membership in a white-feminist-oriented spill, who has repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women."</seg>
<seg id="2455">"sojourner said 1851 in her speech:" "I am not a woman?" "and I refuse to sustain an ideology in which the black woman is a serious and marginalised essence."</seg>
<seg id="2456">"I refuse to exclude me groupings, which also absorb through cultural expropriation of our customs and customs, to drive their egocentric program."</seg>
<seg id="2457">"I will no longer try to lay white women the importance of excessive skin of skin color and sex. because some of them will continue to be the meaning of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women are trying to reward the better."</seg>
<seg id="2458">"although the intersewage feminism was founded to give women different levels of heart, and down from the white feminism, is still the word" feminism "in his name."</seg>
<seg id="2459">"I refer it before, to tie myself fully and completely from feminism, which was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman in life, instead of preparing myself for a white-feminist paradigm that is so stubborn as a novel phenomenon being celebrated."</seg>

<seg id="2463">"in a womanist environment, I can lift black women and women of other cultures, because in this paradigm I existed."</seg>
<seg id="2464">I will be recognized as part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and to my existence as a part of this paradigm.</seg>

<seg id="2628">"this article by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the Ensia.com site, a magazine that reports solutions for environmental problems worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been bred in the USA for the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"his company offers 114 sorts, such as Outredgeous, the first plant that was cultivated by NASA-Astronauts in space and consumed."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"almost 20 years, Morton work has only been carried out by his own ingenuity and the question of how many salsts can get it, limits."</seg>
<seg id="2632">"but at the beginning of the 2000s, he found that more and more salads have been patented, and that he could not keep them further on the breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2633">"patents galted not only for individual varieties, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, a special Rotor, or Green leaves."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"over the past few years, more and more such patents have been logged in more and more plants such as cereals or cardboard boxes. due to this trends the plant breeders, environmentalists and expertise on food security for the future of food production."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as a passionate representatives of a millennia tradition, Morton still salad greed, he now needs to become more and more restrictions on it."</seg>
<seg id="2636">"it is, as if a river would lie in a river rock, for which I have to get herdelling."</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we have to do that now, but it is a break with the breeding tradition," he says. "I think that these patents go on salads too far."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and if they stand before judgment, no one can hold a new salatsorption, because all features are already patented, and tries to breed those features that he wants."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, it is very careful and endeavor to use, no material to use that is protected as intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">He has also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the US and everywhere in the world: open source Breeding ("open source" breeding).</seg>

<seg id="2643">"it is not a coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT sector, and not from the area of plant breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2644">"the Open Source Seed Initiative (Initiative for" Open Source "-seed) can be inspired by the movement for free" open source "software, which provide alternatives to copyrighted software."</seg>
<seg id="2645">"it was called into life to ensure that some plant species and -gene are not being protected as intellectual property, and so for plant breeders are permanently usable."</seg>
<seg id="2646">"in the framework of the initiative, in short Ossi, the US breeders can also commit that others may be used by them seed."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed, and do not sell it." open source "" breeders allow others to breed, to breed, and not immediately discusses - two aspects that are prohibited by many plant patente, or prescribed by plant. "</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Lower prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">"for the emerized professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi councillor, Jack Kloppenburg are in control of the seed and the opportunity to breed new plants as well as for environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over the nutrition system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeder would try to not use the latter not or only little by their seed with natural resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2652">Cloppenburg stressed that the "open-source" movement does not work with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, corn, genetically modified or not, from ecological farming or not." to purchase our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over the target market, such as it is offered on peasant markets, should also know that the way is bred as such as vegetables.

<seg id="2654">Nutritional sovereign without seeds is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">"the members of the Open Source Seed initiative commit themselves to provide others their seeds, which means that their actions are in contrast, seed and plant characteristics."</seg>

<seg id="2657">"Ossi supporters argued that the future of food supply is jeopardized, as the available genpool due to the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights based on plant material, which is therefore always available, unlawful."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, Executive director of the Ossi, has engaged in her doctoral work with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about one third of all cartels features as intellectual property is protected either not at all or only available."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"for other plants there are such estimates not yet, but experts like Luby suspect that mass-built plants like wheat is patented as a salad or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">"plants are so instructed that they have targeted characteristics - from such, by which their taste or colour improves up to such, due to which they withstand in certain environments prosper and threats such as pests or diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant characteristics point out that the available plant material for breeders increased by more and more patents. genetic diversity is now unnecessary than ever since the changed conditions through climate change are much worse prior to climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an e-mail, Monsanto-Speaker Carly Scaduto, that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsantos activities. with a total of four genocides and cooperation with institutions such as the Agricultural Ministry of Economic Affairs."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"however, it contradicts the view that intellectual property other breeder gerators, since" patents and the protection of plant varietals innovation promote "." a patent is basically taken a plan that can be expired once the patent is expired. "</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these directions help others to come with another method for the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"thus, such protection inhibits innovations not, but promotes them to be provided by the public more material and know-how."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"Morton sees the different: 20 years to wait, until a patent flow, there is certainly no innovations."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"and if you are waiting for so long waiting to grow to plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, one would have lost the struggle already."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"the main argument for Morton is, however, that genetic resources are always a general public and should continue to remain:" independent plant breeders have neither the time nor the money for such formalities, and monary incentives are not attractive to us. "</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"this is what drives us, and it will be impossible if we can't continue to use the best and most recent genetic resources."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"altogether Morton is disruptive to the concept of itself, plant peculiarities:" we do not really create the characteristics themselves. "</seg>
<seg id="2673">"the plants make them themselves off and as breeder, we finally have no idea how plants do this."</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol Deppe, plant breeders in the US-State Oregon and Ossi councillor, there is still another important aspect of plant breeding:" who has bred a sorting, bred his own values into them. "</seg>
<seg id="2676">"who believes in industrial agriculture with large courtyards and monoculturists, for their cultivation of herbial Herbizide, are bred in his varieties of this concept of agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is exactly indented. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some medium-sized enterprises (such, moving on international markets, but less than Monsanto are) patents create, create the most smaller seed company, even without patents they reject the patented or they don't stop it for too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case."</seg>

<seg id="2681">"Morton is also the view that breeder by the Avoid of plant patentders:" it looks like me with my efforts to produce new, stronger than companies that are patented. "</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I need a constant new material for my catalogue, as I know that my competitors is to sell my sorts into a couple of years ago," "he says." "with a patent one is protected 20 years before competition, which makes it quite pretty easy."</seg>
<seg id="2683">"while the US seem to be a leader in the" open source "breeding, but the concept has grown rapidly around the world."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (" Centre for Sustainable Agriculture "), which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources, an" open source "plant breeding program works along with farmers, and helps them to breed new varieties, meet specific requirements."</seg>
<seg id="2685">"it also supports them to come to" "open source" "and sell their own."</seg>
<seg id="2686">"the German Organisation Agrecol is working on an" open source "license, which ultimately is a formal and legally binding form of the Ossi commitment for breeders in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2687">"(regulations for the breeding differ from country to country, present because of the Ossi commitment is not simply one to one in Europe or other parts of the world.)"</seg>
<seg id="2688">"at the beginning of November 2016, the Examics of the European Union, the European Commission, declares that conventional plants were not patentable. so that she speaks against the present practice of the European Patenti, which uses patents in conventional plants."</seg>

<seg id="2726">"ANHRI is considered to be the first zened website of a human rights organization in Egypt, after the authorities reported more than two months 21 websites, Arabic-speaking issue of Huffington Post and the originating network of al Jazeera because of the alleged" support of terrorism "."

<seg id="2729">"Ziada used his blog for the spread of columnists and articles, which he is not accessible for in Egypt and media."</seg>
<seg id="2730">"now the blog was used to handle the zensurapparatus of the Egyptian government, even the goal of an attack."</seg>
<seg id="2731">"blogger, who is housed in the blog of Ziadas blog, on the other hand is more accessible."</seg>
<seg id="2732">"Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity, after he reported in December 2013 by Egyptian vulnerabilities and recorded a video, such as the police force physical violence against two students."</seg>
<seg id="2733">His article is mainly about politics and human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">"in a Facebook comment, Ziada is to the blocking by the government and reflecting what this means for him:"</seg>
<seg id="2735">"the blogs to sperren is very old, however, in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi priority; and even if the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world, so it is for two reasons for me:"</seg>
<seg id="2736">"1) It has succeeded to convey to give me the feeling of a siege-board; an arrest, a attempted murder, unloading at the national Security Council, the blocking blogs as well as any other website, for which I worked."</seg>
<seg id="2737">"2) You have proven that I was not in vain. in other words, my words have no influence even if only on a small audience."</seg>
<seg id="2738">I want to mention that this blog was a archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">"first, I used it to the post of articles, to handle the censorship."</seg>
<seg id="2740">"however, after they have locked him, and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog."</seg>
<seg id="2741">The muffers go the way up to the end.</seg>

<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">"on Monday, 12. June we are showing how the blocking of websites that offer VPNs began."</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practice indicates the intention of the government to continue to block contents and have access to the Egyptian user.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"the situation will additionally worsen that the tenure choices are taken behind closed doors, thus the Egyptian population has no legal basis which they can proceed against these actions."</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the censorship and whom will it be next attack?</seg>

<seg id="2770">Would the term "war" more than they are useful?</seg>
<seg id="2771">"in an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil argued the journalist Cecília Oliveira, on the contrary, the violence as a" war "." this is their opinion a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it complaining responsibility in police to account.
