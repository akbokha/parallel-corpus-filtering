this is James R@@ isen .
you might know him because he won as New York Times @-@ Repor@@ ter the Pul@@ itzer Prize .
&quot; long before someone had heard of Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book in which he published spectacular that the N@@ SA illeg@@ ally heard the Ph@@ ones of Americans . &quot;
but it is another chapter which should leave a permanent impression .
&quot; in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence surgery , where the CIA is literally dr@@ afts for an atomic bom@@ b . &quot;
&quot; if the crazy sounds , read it . &quot;
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who the chapters have not coinci@@ ded ?
the U.S. government .
&quot; nearly 10 years , the government has established against ill@@ ings and called him to call his alleged sources . &quot;
&quot; on this turn , he became a symbol for the pattern of the government , wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lo@@ wers and to pun@@ ish journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to the first Constitutional Treaty , the media has the right to publish their secret information . &quot;
&quot; but it is impossible to apply this law when media does not get this information , and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave ones . &quot;
&quot; so when the government was killed at R@@ isen , he did something that many brave por@@ ters had already done before him : he refused , and said that he would rather go to prison . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 he lived , so with the risk to go to prison . &quot;
&quot; but then , only days before the process , something extraordinary . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , though they were years for years that it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government were dropped . &quot;
the reason : in time of electronic monitoring the re@@ por@@ ters and springs can be hide less .
&quot; instead of moving and conc@@ ise the statements , this could also do its digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; and so , the issu@@ ers , without his consent , his phone wis@@ ely hosted , &quot;
&quot; just like his e @-@ mail data , financial and banking information , its credit , and even irrit@@ ation with the list of its flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Ster@@ ling , a CIA wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lo@@ wers and Ris@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is only one of many cases . &quot;
&quot; President Obama promised to protect wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lo@@ wers , but instead , Justice has do@@ omed more than all U.S. governments in front of him . &quot;
&quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government is too much dependent on their work as secret . &quot;
&quot; since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of that a wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lo@@ wers went to a journalist . &quot;
&quot; so we set the press work on the game that should be protected by the first Constitutional Treaty , because the government has increasingly got more possibilities to sp@@ y all . &quot;
&quot; but just as technology of the government allowed to handle the rights of re@@ por@@ ters , the press can use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; and indeed they can take it from the moment in which they contact , rather than in retro@@ spect , in the witness . &quot;
&quot; today , there are communication software that had not yet been written as a canopy &apos;s book and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls . &quot;
&quot; such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source issue for wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lo@@ wers , which was originally developed by the Internet of Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation , where I have been working , further developed . &quot;
&quot; instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news site , just like the Washington Post here . &quot;
&quot; there you can upload documents to upload or send documents , as in any ordinary contact form . &quot;
&quot; these are then encrypted and stored on a server , to which only the respective news agency has access . &quot;
&quot; so the government cannot find more information secre@@ tly , and many of the information they would require , would not be available from the start . &quot;
&quot; Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole , to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , governments around the world develop new es@@ pion@@ age technologies that je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze us all . &quot;
&quot; it is important to us to ensure that not only technology @-@ den@@ omin@@ ator such as Edward Snow@@ den have a way to protect ini@@ quity . it is just as important that we protect the next wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lo@@ wers , &quot;
&quot; the report on ab@@ norm@@ alities in the supply of soldiers is hum@@ ble and of crowded hospitals . or the next environmental workers , the alarm on the se@@ w water of Fl@@ int proposes . or a Wall@@ street insi@@ der that war@@ ned us before the next financial crisis . &quot;
&quot; at least , these technologies have not only been made for those who want to impose crimes but to protect our full constitutional rights . &quot;
thanks .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 the biggest data on the story was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; has been hidden &#91; the &#93; &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; &#93; &#91; ... &#93; &#91; us &#93; Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness to make a statement . &#93; this week we were told by messages about a le@@ ak of 11 million documents of the law firm Mos@@ o Fon@@ sec@@ a .
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax hav@@ ens .
&quot; we will get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers to companies such as Mos@@ bags Fon@@ sec@@ a go and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up ? &quot;
&quot; we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages , such as the whole system works as it works . &quot;
this has already led to the first very direct consequences .
Islands Prime Minister has resign@@ ed .
also there are reports that a exile of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator B@@ asch@@ ar al @-@ Assad wall@@ et companies in tax hav@@ ens .
&quot; it is asser@@ ted that a track of 2 billion US dollar leads to Russia President Vladimir Putin , over a close friend from children &apos;s days , a famous cel@@ lists . &quot;
&quot; now there will be a lot of ri@@ cher people and others to wait for the next release , and the next un@@ covered documents . &quot;
now that sounds like the plot of an agency ski@@ ers or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham test .
&quot; it seems crying from you , ordinary people . &quot;
why should we handle what ?
&quot; but the truth is , if the rich and powers are able to hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens and not to pay all their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , streets . &quot;
and this concerns us all .
&quot; for my organization , global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenomen@@ al . &quot;
&quot; in all over the world , media and leading politicians , such as secret tax hav@@ ens are used by a few of them , their assets to hide and wear - something that we have been discussing and conc@@ e@@ eing us for ten years . &quot;
&quot; I think many people will seem very conf@@ using this whole world , and it is difficult to understand how these tax hav@@ ens work . &quot;
I always imagine like a Mat@@ r@@ yo@@ d@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
&quot; so , one company has a company in another company , in another company that makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind this prayer . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult for criminal enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society really what matters is . &quot;
I find it interesting that in the US there is less reports on this matter .
presum@@ ably because there have been no prominent Americans that occurred in this revelations .
&quot; now it is not that there are no enough Americans , who hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; but through the principle , after which this tax hav@@ ens work , Mos@@ tr@@ ance Fon@@ sec@@ a has fewer American customers . &quot;
&quot; if we had a data base from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would have a lot more cases and examples to have the connections to the US . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it is so that you need less information in some US states to provide less information to start a company than to get a libr@@ arian credit card . &quot;
this type of in@@ consistency in the US has allowed employees of school@@ bor@@ ough@@ s to rip school@@ children .
it has allowed to sc@@ ams particularly sus@@ cep@@ tional investors .
it is this kind of behavior that all affects us .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this in practice looks .
how does it work ?
&quot; so , we sent an un@@ covered revival in the offices of 13 lawyers firms in Manhattan . &quot;
&quot; our investig@@ ators gave itself as an African minister who wanted to bring v@@ ap@@ ex money to the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we really sho@@ cked that all up to a lawyer of our teach proposals , how he could transc@@ end his money . &quot;
&quot; these were all prec@@ urs@@ ors . none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course no money was handed over to us . but it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important to consider this not as individuals .
&quot; it is not about a single lawyer , who has under@@ gone the proposals to be submitted . &quot;
it is not a particular leader in a sc@@ andal .
&quot; it is about how the system works , through the corruption , tax evasion , poverty and instability . &quot;
&quot; and to cope with this , we must change the rules . &quot;
we must change the rules to make this kind of behavior .
&quot; this may sound all very tr@@ ap@@ ly sound , as if we could do anything about it ; as if nothing could ever have changed , as if it is always the rich and powerful . &quot;
&quot; but as born Optim@@ ist , I see quite sure that some things have begun to change . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , we have seen lectures at more transparency what the owners of firms are concerned . &quot;
the subject took political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 Summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
&quot; since then , the EU gathered in central tab@@ s at the national level , who really is behind firms in Europe and who is controlled . &quot;
one of the most uncomfortable facts is that the US is lag@@ ging here .
&quot; representatives of both parties have introduced a force in force in both circumstances , but this does not make progress we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how these Panama revelations , this huge insight into the world of tax hav@@ ens , as a means used to ensure greater transparency in the U.S. and globally . &quot;
for us in Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
&quot; we need ordinary people who are angry , if they see how other people can hide their true identity behind the head@@ board . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need executives in the economy which stand up and say : &quot; &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we need leading politicians who recognise the problem and use it , through laws this kind of transparency . &quot;
&quot; together we can end the in@@ transparent , which now makes this kind of tax evasion , corruption and money la@@ undering , finally finish . &quot;
this is the story of how I almost kidn@@ apped and in the trunk of a red Maz@@ el .
&quot; a day after I had completed my design study , I made a back@@ yard . &quot;
a guy in the red Maz@@ da remained and look at my stuff .
he bought one of my works .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip all the country . afterwards he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; where do you s@@ laughter it tonight ? &quot;
&quot; he made the whole thing worse , &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot;
&quot; and I thought : &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what do I now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
&quot; but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he is really planning . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk of a Maz@@ el ! &quot;
this is a small trunk !
&quot; then I heard me , &quot; &quot; I have a bub@@ ble . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; a voice in my head said : &quot; &quot; h , how please ? &quot;
&quot; at night I was then in bed , I star@@ ed up the blank@@ et and thought : &quot; Oh husband ! what have I built up there ? &quot;
a wild rest in my living room .
what if he is crazy ?
&quot; I received such a fear that I rose out of the bed , on ti@@ pped pointed to the door , and my sleep @-@ door . &quot;
but he was not crazy .
we are still in contact .
&quot; the artwork , which he had bought from me , is now in his classroom . he is now teachers . &quot;
it was my first experience as a host . it completely changed my point of view .
&quot; perhaps the people who were sold in childhood as stran@@ gers , actually friends who just waited to be discovered ? &quot;
&quot; to host people on my air mattress , was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattress . &quot;
&quot; we make a time jump , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I am unemployed , almost pl@@ itude , my ro@@ ommate draws out and the rent is increased . &quot;
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all the hotels were fully booked .
&quot; I think creativity can create it , fear in fun . &quot;
&quot; I wrote my best friend and new fellow inhabitants Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I have over@@ lay out how we could earn something about it . our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast @-@ breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk including a mattress and each morning breakfast . &quot;
ha ! &quot;
we created a site and founded so &quot; a@@ erial rat@@ ze and breakfast &quot; &#91; AI@@ R@@ Bed a@@ N@@ d Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air conditioning on wood@@ floors .
they found it super and we too .
&quot; I am sure to decor@@ ate our cheese ham O@@ mel@@ et , completely different because we made it for our guests . &quot;
we touring with them through the whole city . as we had to say our last guest and the door to the castle fell star@@ red Brian and I arrived .
we just discovered that at the same time we find new friends and could pay our rent ?
the things came into rolls .
&quot; my former ro@@ ommate , N@@ ate Br@@ arc@@ zy@@ k , joined us as a developer . &quot;
we wanted to find out if you could make it a business concept .
&quot; we presented to the investors : &quot; &quot; we want to create a site based on the people publicly images of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms , their doors , whose doors are closed when visiting . &quot;
over the internet they can then invite wild people to stay overnight .
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited that the missi@@ le would receive .
but they do not act .
&quot; no one who is even at sol@@ ace , would invest in a shop would be allowed to sleep in apartments of other people . &quot;
why ?
because we have learned as children all that stran@@ gers are dangerous .
&quot; if one has a problem , it is on the things you can get good . we could des@@ ig@@ nen . &quot;
at the Kunst@@ akademie we had learned that design is much more than just look and h@@ ap@@ tics -- it is the overall experience .
&quot; we had learned how to design@@ ate objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust by design , between people who never had previously met . &quot;
can design make such a thing ?
is it possible to create with design confidence ?
&quot; I would like to give you a cost of endurance , which degree of trust we asp@@ ed . &quot;
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort .
thum@@ bs up if you are ready .
take your phone into your hand .
now I would like to un@@ lock your mobile phone .
enter your un@@ lock phone to your left seat .
&quot; this quiet flight from panic , which you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when it is the first time open the door . &quot;
for the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
&quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to keep the mobile phone of a foreig@@ ner in your hands ?
most feel the responsibility .
so also most guests feel when they stay elsewhere .
only for this reason our company can exist .
only sometimes who has actually Al Gor@@ es mobile phone ?
could you tell us on Twitter that he is responsible for president of the President ?
you can now return the phones now .
they have experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I would like to tell you of some discoveries .
what if we have changed a little detail about this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neighbour could only be introduced with his name , if he told where he comes , how his dog or his children are hot ? &quot;
imagine you could have 150 ass@@ es@@ sm@@ ents that all say : &quot; he can really keep very well @-@ err@@ ed hand@@ s@@ ys !
how would you feel then if you would have to leave your phone ?
because a well @-@ known feedback system strengthens the trust is decisive .
at the beginning we made some things wrong .
it was difficult for people to finish negative aspects .
&quot; in the end , we decided to wait until both host and guest had given their b@@ ass@@ es@@ sm@@ ents before we set them online . &quot;
last week we have discovered something new .
&quot; we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how they are about age and home . &quot;
little surprising we trust the people most who are most like .
&quot; the more differences we find , the less we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social occurrence .
you will be exciting when you add the call of a person -- in our case by ass@@ es@@ sm@@ ents .
&quot; if one has fewer than three divisions , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; but , one has more than ten , changes everything . &quot;
a good reputation sti@@ ff@@ in common .
&quot; so , the right design can help us to overcome some of our deep ro@@ oting preferences . &quot;
&quot; in addition , we experienced that trust is dependent on how much you can get from . &quot;
here you can see the reactions to the first news of a guest .
&quot; if one tells a little about how for example &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; , &quot; you do not get an answer . &quot;
&quot; one tells a lot , as for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request is also rather not accepted . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , such as &quot; T@@ olle Art@@ works in your apartment ! I make with my family holiday . &quot;
how can we create it with design to make this degree an openness ?
we use the size of the text box to recommend the right amount of text . we also give advice on which subjects you should write something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; our whole company builds up hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudi@@ ces opposite to foreigners . &quot;
&quot; what we had not reck@@ oned , was the great multitude of people who were more than willing to present these prejudi@@ ces . &quot;
here you can see how many people take our offer .
you can see three things .
&quot; first , : incredibly good luck . &quot;
&quot; second , the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team . &quot;
&quot; third : a need , which was previously not covered . &quot;
for us the business is running very well .
&quot; of course , there are times when not everything goes smoothly . &quot;
there were guests who have celebrated parties or ro@@ omed apartments .
hosts have guests in the rain stand .
at the beginning of the project I have worked on customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
&quot; I stood at the forefront , when trust was broken . &quot;
there is nothing Sch@@ lim@@ mer@@ es than these calls . it does hurt if I just think .
&quot; the disappointment that one ends in the voice of the ru@@ b , and will always be our greatest motivation to continue to improve . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , of the 123 million people had only a fraction of a problem . &quot;
because people trust each other right .
&quot; when trust works , there can be wonder . &quot;
one of our guests made holiday in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host was brought him into hospital .
he even donated blood to the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
perfect house for travelers who are due to sitting activities to heart attack .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
&quot; J@@ avier and Al@@ ej@@ andra are real prot@@ angels who save life , even though they do not know it right . &quot;
&quot; you drive one in your own car into the hospital , when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ yp@@ ass . &quot;
because they don &apos;t want to feel lonely , they bring books past . &quot;
they can even stay longer without calcul@@ ating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
&quot; of course , not every stay is going on . &quot;
but these relations behind the pure money trans@@ action is exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
&quot; when I was for the first time about this term , I asked myself : &quot;
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions together ?
it is about an economic trade .
&quot; but it is now simply called &quot; &quot; ten@@ ders &quot; , &quot; the thing is not fair . &quot;
&quot; Share Economy describes a trade , human relationships promises . &quot;
people lay a part of themselves and that changes everything .
&quot; if one travels nowadays , that is easy to compare with Fast Food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic . &quot;
&quot; what would be , however , if travelling a rich buffet from local impressions would be ? &quot;
&quot; what would be when in every place you visit , a group there would wait to show a group there , to be thoroughly complete and one at a pub tour of which one has never heard before ; &quot;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star cook ?
&quot; nowadays , apartments are designed based on privacy . &quot;
what would be if we would like to share apartments from scratch
how would this look like ?
what would be if cities would accept the thoughts of a common part ?
&quot; I imagine towns that allow us to society and relationships , instead of lon@@ eliness and har@@ dened . &quot;
&quot; in Southern Cor@@ e@@ as capital Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking places that the government were belonging . &quot;
&quot; now residen@@ ces were offered now . students who were looking for a lead , &quot;
&quot; were convey@@ ed to people whose children were raised , In@@ cub@@ ator programs have been launched , &quot;
&quot; to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . about our platform alone , night 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be a guest at a stran@@ ger or even hosts . &quot;
the idea seems to be not so crazy how it was brought to us .
we have not invented the wheel .
hospitality was there before .
there were already similar websites before us .
so why has just our work ?
&quot; apart from luck and timing , we believe that you can find the right design with the components of trust . &quot;
design can help us to overcome deeper prejudi@@ ces .
I find this amazing , &quot;
straight to overwhelming .
I have to contem@@ plate each time when a red Maz@@ da is passing by me .
&quot; of course , we know that design can not solve any problem . &quot;
&quot; but if it could help us , if it had this great influence , I wonder why we can use this design soon . &quot;
thanks .
what do you think if you watch me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
&quot; or suppres@@ sed , a brain @-@ la@@ undering under@@ went , a terrorist leader ? &quot;
or simply a delay in the security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I do not give you blame for your negative impressions .
so the media represent the people who look like me .
a study revealed that 80 % of reporting about Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show : the Americans mean that most would not know Muslims .
probably people do not talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
for all those who have never met a Muslim : it is great to know you .
I say to you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee maker -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream extra . &quot;
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted .
a Mö@@ ller @-@ Fan@@ ati@@ ker@@ in
&quot; and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim . &quot;
&quot; but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not so born . &quot;
I have decided on this .
&quot; when I was 17 years old , I met the decision to ou@@ ten me . &quot;
&quot; no , not as hom@@ os@@ ex@@ ual man , like some of my friends , but as Muslim . I decided to wear the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head@@ gear . &quot;
my femin@@ ist girl@@ friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; why oppressed you yourself ? &quot;
&quot; the Lus@@ tige was : at that time it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , and in contrast to the pressure I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old , to adapt to a perfect and un@@ att@@ ain@@ able beauty ideal . &quot;
I have not just accepted the faith of my parents .
I have been connected to the Quran .
&quot; I read it , thought after , was des@@ perate and credi@@ ble in the end . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was confidence and slow dedication to deep@@ ened with each reading of the cor@@ ans .
the beauty of the rhythm takes me sometimes to the wines .
I recognise myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
&quot; had you ever had the feeling that somebody takes you , you fully understand , and yet somehow loves ? &quot;
it feels like that .
&quot; later I married and began , like all good Egyptians , my career as an engineer . &quot;
&quot; I had later , after my salvation , a child , and lived basically the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American dream . &quot;
then came that horrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; I sat in my kitchen , had at the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; breaking message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; smoke was smoke , planes flo@@ wed in buildings , people ran@@ ged from the buildings . &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my Sho@@ ck changed quickly in rebellion .
why should you do something ?
&quot; I switched to the television channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terrorists &quot; ... &quot; ... in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; ... Ji@@ erb@@ om@@ ys Mec@@ ca ! &quot;
&quot; Oh , my God . &quot;
&quot; it was not only my country attacked , but in the n@@ u turned me the deeds of others from a civil war into a suspic@@ ious . &quot;
the same day we had to go through the Middle West of the United States to move into a new town and begin with the building study .
&quot; I remember how I was speaking -- as we silent -- how deep it went into my seat , and I was afraid to be recognized as Muslims . &quot;
we moved to our apartment in our apartment in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; and then heard , I saw and read the war@@ nings of national Islamic organizations that said , &quot; &quot; be watch@@ ful , &quot; &quot; Sei@@ d cau@@ tious , &quot; &quot; lead in well illuminated areas , &quot; &quot; Ver@@ sam@@ mm@@ elt you not . &quot;
I stayed the whole week inside .
then it was Friday at that week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer .
&quot; and again the war@@ nings : &quot; &quot; not on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage of me .
&quot; the feelings were understand@@ ably harmless and I also heard about attacks on Muslims , or by people that one held for Muslims , to war@@ ped into free . &quot;
there were really brand@@ y on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something felt not right .
&quot; because the people , who had attacked this country , have attacked our country . &quot;
I have defeated the anger of the people to the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to have to explain itself .
I have nothing against questions I love questions .
they are the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; nowadays , we can actually hear people : &quot; &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims . &quot;
when will we get rid of them ? &quot;
some people want Muslims gre@@ ens and mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tum@@ our in the body of the USA .
it only presents the question : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
you know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumor you can be as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor one thinks only under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is false .
&quot; Muslims are like all the other Americans , no tum@@ our in the body of the US , but a vital organ . &quot;
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , terrestrial and Olympi@@ oni@@ ons . &quot;
will the closure of mus@@ k America make safer ?
&quot; perhaps there will be a few parking spaces , but not stop the terror . &quot;
&quot; the regular visit of a mosque leads to people other faith toler@@ ant , and greater civil participation . &quot;
&quot; and like me a leader of the police in the area of Washington , DC recently told , people are actually not radi@@ cal@@ ised in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they are radi@@ cal@@ ised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer .
&quot; in the radic@@ alization process , one has established that he begins online . as a First &#93; the person is cut off from their church , even by their family , so that the person believes that the person believes the true Muslims , and anyone who desp@@ ises their behaviour and ideology , is a tra@@ itor , or of faith . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent radi@@ cal@@ isation , we have to stop the people to go to the mosque . &quot;
some are still claiming that Islam is a non@@ violent religion .
&quot; finally , a group as the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Koran . &quot;
&quot; as Muslim , as mother , as man , I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot;
&quot; but we would add ourselves to their imagination , if you recognize them as representatives of 1,6 billion believers . &quot;
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u Club @-@ Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology reasons for their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
&quot; but if one casts a look at it , she doesn &apos;t drive what they are in their &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that they can see these things into the scrip@@ tures .
an outstanding I@@ mam about me recently told me an amazing story :
&quot; a girl came to him , because she asked himself to join the IS . &quot;
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; he said the problem was exactly the opposite . every cl@@ ergy with whom she had spoken , she brought to the silence , and said her , her wrath , her meaning for the injustice in the world , she would only get into trouble . &quot;
&quot; there was nothing inspired by nothing and something that had given to their anger , she was a main aim for the instrument@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised her a solution . &quot;
this I@@ mam introduced the connection to God and their church again .
&quot; instead of accused them for her hum@@ ility , he showed their constructive paths for a real change in the world . &quot;
&quot; what she learned in the mosque , she used to join the IS . &quot;
this was an insight as the Islam@@ opho@@ bia me and my family concerns .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect every other ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy on our thoughts ?
&quot; a study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show , when we fear , happen at least three things . &quot;
&quot; we accept rather an author@@ itarian governmental system , con@@ form@@ ance and prejudi@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; a study reveals : when one was presented to test persons in which negative about Muslims was reported , they unanim@@ ously reported military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circum@@ c@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not only a ak@@ ade@@ mic problem .
&quot; if you look out when the mood against Muslims upward -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then it happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot;
it happened in advance of the Iraq war and during two elect@@ oral peri@@ ons .
&quot; so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Mos@@ lem @-@ terror , as I expected it . &quot;
&quot; it can actually be a tool for mani@@ p@@ ulation of the public to under@@ cut the foundation of a free society , the rational and well informed citizens . &quot;
the handling of Muslims is an early warning .
&quot; we might feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear sh@@ ines us all . &quot;
&quot; in case of assignment of coll@@ ectiv@@ ism , it is not just about to explain yourself . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both were to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was a sports@@ men .
&quot; he was at the dental faculty , talented , much promising ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would tell me that he was the sweet , dre@@ amed man , whom they knew . &quot;
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was stun@@ ned and said :
&quot; when is from my br@@ otherhood , such a sealed young man has become ? &quot;
&quot; just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne on her brother and his wife , her neigh@@ bor , Cra@@ ig Stephen H@@ icks , she ass@@ ass@@ inated , just as the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was in the afternoon to visit his statements by Muslims on his Facebook page . &quot;
he enjoyed eight times on De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can not only be imm@@ oral but also deadly .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
we went to the mosque or were we safe at home ?
&quot; we pra@@ ising it and for us it was not an easy decision , for it was about what America would like to leave to our children : one that would not control us through fear , or one in which we can exercise our religion freely . &quot;
we decided for the mosque .
&quot; with our son in the children &apos;s seat we drove silent , with high pressure to the mosque . &quot;
&quot; I took him out , went my shoes , went into the prayer sh@@ alle , and what I saw , let me hold . &quot;
the hall was rest@@ less filled .
&quot; then the I@@ mam made an announcement , printed and called our guests , because half of the gathered were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hist@@ s , A@@ thei@@ sts , believers , and non @-@ believers who have come to teach us , but to teach us . &quot;
at this moment I have collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had courage and compassion panic and prejudi@@ ces .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose in the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you go on number safely ?
or will you connect those who mean : we are better than that .
many thanks .
thank you beautiful !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to hit a nerve . &quot;
&quot; but I wonder what you say those who might say that you &apos;re holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a mind with dr@@ au@@ ght , therefore an exception and not the rule are . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say is not dec@@ eive you . I am completely normal .
I am not an exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
&quot; when you look at Muslims around the world , and I did that with the greatest ever performed study on Muslims throughout the world , people want normal things . &quot;
they want prosperity for the family they want to work and they want to live in peace .
so in no respect I am an exception .
&quot; if people seem like an exception to the rule , then often the rule was broken , and they are not the exception to the rule . &quot;
H@@ W : thanks . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
&quot; what began as a platform for craf@@ ting , is just before to become a billion business . &quot;
&quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . possible , this is made in research institutes worldwide . &quot;
&quot; before air @-@ pact into our social consciousness , a aut@@ on@@ ome fleet of air conditioning in the Fra@@ c Centre in France has built a six meter high tower out of 1 500 bricks . some years ago she began to fly with rop@@ es . &quot;
&quot; through attachments , air conditioning high speed and acceler@@ ation on narro@@ west space . &quot;
you can also build self @-@ employed structures .
they have learned to wear bur@@ dens with tur@@ mo@@ il and respond in general on natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our aim is to exceed the limits of Pos@@ sible in the autonomous flight .
&quot; so that a system of aut@@ on@@ om is working , there must be collective @-@ let know where in space the mobile objects are located . &quot;
&quot; in our laboratory at the ETH Zurich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this allows us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tas@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; for today &apos;s Dem@@ os , we use a new loc@@ alization technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , an int@@ eger of our laboratory . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room to determine calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; external commands are available at the highest ec@@ e. e.g. &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; land . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called H@@ eck@@ starter .
&quot; a flight device , which tries to beat two compart@@ ments with a cap . &quot;
&quot; like other star@@ ches , it is efficient in the down@@ wards flight , much more efficient than helic@@ opter in all its variations . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to most star@@ ters , it can fluctu@@ ate and therefore has great benefits when starting and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always a down@@ side . &quot;
a restriction of h@@ eck@@ star@@ ters is that they are sensitive to turbul@@ ence like wind @-@ bows .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the air device doesn &apos;t able to reg@@ ained its optimal position and can be improved the performance by practicing .
okay .
during our research we often provide basic abstr@@ acts issues which are at the core of the matter .
for example : what is the petty @-@ possible number of movable parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons to know the answer to such a question .
helic@@ opter are known as machines with a thousand movements that join forces to hurt you .
decades ago trained pil@@ ots were able to fly remot@@ ely flying devices that had only two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a h@@ edge .
&quot; unfortunately , we discovered that flies with only one works . &quot;
&quot; this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically simpl@@ est remote machine . it was recently invented . &quot;
&quot; it only has a movable part , a prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no brack@@ ets , hing@@ es and cross ru@@ der , no further actu@@ ator or contro@@ l@@ lo@@ ins , only a prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechanical simple , it happens in the inside life very much , so that it can be stable and can move in the room . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorith@@ m of the h@@ eck@@ star@@ ters . to make it clear , I have to throw it right . &quot;
&quot; the lik@@ eli@@ hood to throw it right when I see all , is low , therefore I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening . &quot;
&quot; when the mon@@ osp@@ inner is a practice in sol@@ u@@ ousness , this machine is here , the om@@ ri@@ le with its eight prop@@ ell@@ ors , a practice in abundance . &quot;
what to do with all this over@@ flow ?
they see that it is symmet@@ rical .
that is why it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
&quot; thus , he will receive the great skill , &quot;
&quot; move in space in all directions , no matter what direction he is filmed , or even as he rotating . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the field of inter@@ active rivers from the eight prop@@ ell@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; some is adjustable in models , the rest will be learned directly at the catch . &quot;
let us see that .
&quot; when flying machines are to be part of our daily life , they must be extremely safe and reliable . &quot;
this machine is made up of two separate two @-@ prop@@ eller aircraft .
this turns on the clo@@ ck@@ wise
and the other against the clo@@ ck@@ wise .
&quot; when one builds them , they behave like a high @-@ performance Quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; however , somewhat aw@@ ry -- a engine or prop@@ eller falls off , the electronics or a cordless -- can continue to fly the machine as well . &quot;
we will now demonstrate that we make a half air@@ planes .
the last demonstration is examined synthetic stimul@@ ates .
&quot; the great number of autonomous , co @-@ ordin@@ ated units enables a range of aesthetic expression . &quot;
we took wholesale micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ter -- every single weighs less than one disc bread -- and match it with loc@@ alisation and algorithms .
&quot; each unit white , where in space she is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit . &quot;
hopefully motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine as dr@@ ex@@ ert wants to be a flying lamp at Broadway on Broadway .
&quot; of course , it is difficult to pre@@ di@@ ct the influence of these technology . &quot;
for types like us is the reward in the development and creation of creation .
&quot; it serves as memory , how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it is creative , clever creatures which allows them to form this spectacular way . &quot;
the fact that this technology has such solid commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
many thanks .
&quot; 1.3 billion years ago , in a very distant galax@@ y two black holes are increasingly fast , you turned the mass tri@@ er s@@ uns in a tenth of tens of energy . &quot;
this short moment lit her bright as all the stars together in all galax@@ ies of the whole known universe .
it was a very big boy .
but your energy put it free in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was given into space @-@ time @-@ ge@@ ars itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
&quot; at first , we arrange the events first temporarily . &quot;
1.3 billion years ago it was just multi@@ zel@@ liges life on Earth emerged .
&quot; since then the earth has brought forth a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , sau@@ rier , people and -- God stand by us -- even the internet . &quot;
&quot; about 25 years ago , a group of particularly cour@@ ageous -- R@@ ai Weiss from MIT , K@@ IP Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver , from the Cal@@ Tech -- to search a huge laser det@@ ector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which are about colon@@ ized black holes . &quot;
most held them for crazy .
&quot; but enough people realized it as crazy gen@@ ies , so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea . &quot;
&quot; after decades of development , construction , design and extremely much hard work they built the Det@@ ector LI@@ GO : the laser @-@ Inter@@ fer@@ om@@ eter@@ - gravity @-@ waves observ@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; in follow @-@ up time , the precision of LI@@ GO could be increased considerably , resulting in recognition performance considerably . &quot;
therefore it is now called Advanced LI@@ GO .
&quot; at the beginning of September 2015 , LI@@ GO was launched for a final test run by some minor , stub@@ born problems . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the commissioning of the det@@ ector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two col@@ li@@ ating black holes through the earth . &quot;
you went through you and me
and also through the det@@ ector .
Scott H@@ ugh@@ es : only two moments in my life were emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the departure from my to@@ d@@ kran@@ ken father .
&quot; basically , that was the fruits of my life . &quot;
&quot; all that I had worked , is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott H@@ ugh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been studied gra@@ ined waves from black holes and their by observ@@ at@@ ories such as LI@@ GO measurable signals . but what are gravity waves ? &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a c@@ utter@@ ing in the tissue of space and time .
&quot; when passed the wave , the wave and overall content can be stretched in a direction and into the other side . &quot;
in order to illustrate lectur@@ ers in courses for rel@@ ativ@@ es@@ theory often a properly al@@ ber@@ ing dance .
&quot; stretching and du@@ sting , stretching and dust . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gravity waves are extremely weak , even ridicul@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September , for example , each of us has stretched out the waves at asc@@ end and conc@@ ede . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average person was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; this means 20 N@@ ul@@ ls after the coma , followed by a 1st Dar@@ um , one explained the LI@@ GO employee for crazy . &quot;
&quot; with a five kilometers long laser det@@ ector , and this is already absurd , the length would have to be measured on less than a thousand of the radius of the nuclear weapons . this is gray . &quot;
at the end of his classic text about gravity .
&quot; K@@ IP Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of GO@@ s , the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties in the construction of such det@@ ectors are rap@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; but physi@@ cists are final , and with the support of the public will certainly be overcome all obstacles . &quot;
&quot; Thor@@ ne released this 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot;
&quot; back to LI@@ GO . Scott holds , LI@@ GO is more a ear than an eye . &quot;
I want to explain what this means .
&quot; visible light has a wav@@ el@@ ength , which is much smaller than the things around us : face lifts , the size of your phones . &quot;
this is quite handy . because so you can make a picture or a map of things by taking the one of several points coming around you .
with tones it is different .
audi@@ ble t@@ ints have a wav@@ el@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
&quot; that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to make a picture of things that you particularly mean to you : &quot;
the face of your child about .
&quot; instead , we listen to certain properties such as clay base and height , rhythm and volume , to close the story behind it . &quot;
&quot; now , just Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob , it breaks . &quot;
&quot; drummer Bob , &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we cannot produce simple photos of objects in space .
&quot; but as we pay attention to changes in the am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot;
&quot; at least , for LI@@ GO the reson@@ ate frequencies are in the audi@@ ble section . &quot;
&quot; so when we convert shaft patterns in Sch@@ alle , we can speak the All literally . &quot;
&quot; the gra@@ v@@ itation to listen , can tell us about the coll@@ ision of two black holes , what my colleague Scott has been busy very long . &quot;
&quot; SH : two black , non @-@ rot@@ ary holes , circul@@ ates : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
rot@@ ate the two body very fast , you hear the same circle with an additional clay change . this ends itself to : W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u ! &quot;
&quot; it is a kind of movement , shaped into the wav@@ e@@ form . &quot;
&quot; AA : on 14 . September 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- I heard of the following : &#91; Sur@@ ren@@ der &apos;s usch &#93; J@@ em@@ and , who knows what to hear , this is seen as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 @-@ fat sun mass , which turned around as fast as the sticks of your mix@@ er . &quot;
AA : let &apos;s think about what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the thick body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , revol@@ ve each hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de . &quot;
imagine these forces before .
fantastic .
and we know about it because we heard it .
therein lies the remaining significance of LI@@ GO .
LI@@ GO is a completely new way to explore the Al@@ ls as it has never been possible before .
on this way we can listen to the space and hear the invisible .
much in all we can -- virtually or fundamentally -- not see .
&quot; a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why mas@@ hed star in super @-@ nov@@ ae explo@@ de . &quot;
they are very useful . we have learned a lot about the universe .
&quot; however , the exciting physical processes happen at the core , which lies behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and si@@ lic@@ on . &quot;
we will never go through because these op@@ ak are .
&quot; gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penet@@ rate iron , as if it would be more transparent glass . I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it as the Ur@@ b@@ ang is covered by its own mess@@ enger . &quot;
using gravity waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
&quot; and most importantly : I am optim@@ istic that in all things we have never seen , that we never seen before , and of whom we have never seen any idea . things we just discover by hearing . &quot;
&quot; in fact , LI@@ GO found equal in the first circulation of things that we did not expect . &quot;
&quot; my colleague at MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the LI@@ GO project , says to this topic : me : the kind of stars that emerged black holes , like LI@@ GO them , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe . &quot;
&quot; they are enormous , ancient bodies of prehistoric times . the black holes are the sauce for our archaeological work . &quot;
&quot; LI@@ GO allows us to have a completely different perspective on events in space , on the origin of the stars and ultimately also on how we went out of this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge is now to be as bold as possible .
&quot; thanks to LI@@ GO we know how to build great det@@ ectors , and the noise and circulation of the cosmos . &quot;
we need ideas for new observ@@ at@@ ories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ at@@ ories on Earth and in space .
for what could be nic@@ er than the jungle ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thanks .
a while ago I tried an experiment from .
&quot; one year I would say to all &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; before which I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; whether it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced me to say &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
I wanted to speak to the public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
would I like to be live on TV ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
I wanted to start playing with the spectacle ?
&quot; no , no , no , but yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a crazy thing happened : exactly what to do , w@@ ov@@ or I feared , removal my fear . &quot;
&quot; my fear , speeches to keep , my social fear -- Pu@@ ff , away . &quot;
the power of one word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , my life has changed . &quot;
&quot; yes , changed me . &quot;
&quot; but there was a certain Yes , which my life changed deeply , to an unexpected art . it started with a question of my youngest . &quot;
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the youngest , calls for in@@ explic@@ able reasons all &quot; treasures &quot;
as if they were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; kittens , I need milk for my beak . &quot;
&quot; she asked me once I could play with her , when I was just on the jump . and I said , &quot; yes . &quot; &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
&quot; a new attitude to my family . from there I sw@@ allowed me to play with them once you do so . no matter what I am doing , or where I go , I say always Yes -- every single time . &quot;
&quot; almost . I am not perfect , but I am trying . &quot;
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , on my children , to our family . &quot;
&quot; but it also has an amazing side @-@ effect : only recently , I was actually completely understood that the &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; to play my career with my children . &quot;
I have a true dream job .
I am author . I think things out of bringing you to life .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I create television . I have produced television .
&quot; I do television , in a great style . &quot;
&quot; in this TV season , I am responsible for spending 70 hours of program into the world . &quot;
&quot; four television programs , 70 hours TV . three to four shows are simultaneously in production . &quot;
&quot; each shipment provides hundreds of jobs , which previously did not exist . &quot;
the budget for an episode of a TV channel can be between three and six million dollars .
we say five .
&quot; a new episode all nine days times four shows , so all nine days 20 million dollars television , four TV programs , three episodes : sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours TV , &quot;
350 million dollars for one season .
in America my television series are running each other on Thursday evening .
around the world my series are running in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million spect@@ ators .
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV broad@@ casts are ship@@ ments which I myself create , and not only produced , so I have to find time , really silent , creative time to gather my fans at the camp@@ fire and to tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four television series , 70 hours television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fire that burn around the world . &quot;
do you know who this still makes ?
&quot; no one , therefore I am a Titan . &quot;
dream job .
I would not like to impress you with that .
&quot; I say it , because I know what you think when the word &quot; author falls . &quot;
&quot; I say it to you all of you who work so hard if you do a company , a country or a household , take me seriously if I say I am not only on the computer around you , and it &apos;s true when I say , I understand that it does not work with a dream job . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s all a job , all work , everything reality , all blood , everything swe@@ at -- no tears . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m working a lot , hard and I love it . &quot;
&quot; when I am deep@@ ened into the work , there is no other feeling . &quot;
my work always creates a land out of nothing .
&quot; it is , when asked me troops on a canvas . &quot;
&quot; as noted , one has a high sound , delivered a marathon . &quot;
it feels like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
&quot; it is creative , mechan@@ ically , ti@@ ring and in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ating , funny and cru@@ ising , cruel and sensible , cruel and reasonable . and the best thing about it is the bu@@ zz . &quot;
there is so a change in me when the work is fine .
&quot; a bu@@ zz begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the sums sounds like a busy road , I could always drive on her . &quot;
&quot; many people will take when I tell them the sums , I am writing , that writing my joy . &quot;
understand me not wrong that does it .
&quot; but the sums -- as I began with the television production , when I began to work and work , build , build and co @-@ working , I discovered this thing , this sums , this energy . the bu@@ zz ! &quot;
the sums is more than writing .
the sums is action and activity . the sums is a drug .
the sums is music . the sums is light and air .
the sum is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
&quot; and if you have such a bu@@ zz , then you can not strive differently than after size . &quot;
&quot; the feeling that can not be different to strive for size , no matter what price . &quot;
this is what you call the sums .
or maybe it means a work@@ a@@ holic .
maybe it is called genius .
maybe it is called ego .
maybe it is the fear of failure .
I do not know .
&quot; I just know that I am not for failure , and I just know that I love the sums I love . &quot;
&quot; I will only say to you , I am a Titan , and I know that I will not ask it . &quot;
&quot; to make a clear : the more successful I will , the more episodes , the more hiber@@ nation , the more work there are , the more things I see , the more I write history , the more expectations exist . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to be successful , the more it has to work . &quot;
and what did I say about work ?
&quot; I love work , not true ? &quot;
&quot; the country , which I inherited , the marathon , I walk , the army , the screen , the high sound , the sums , the sums , the sums . &quot;
I like this sums . I love the bu@@ zz .
I need the sums . I am the bu@@ zz .
am I only this sum ?
and then stops the bu@@ zz .
&quot; revised , exagger@@ ated , exagger@@ ated , replaced . &quot;
the sum stops .
now my three daughters are acc@@ ust@@ omed to the truth that her mom is a single work@@ day .
&quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my mom will not be there , but you can write to my F@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; and Emer@@ son says , &quot; Cl@@ ose , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da country . &quot;
it is the children of a tit@@ anium .
you are baby @-@ Tit@@ ans .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the sums were heard . &quot;
the sum of the engine is pet@@ ri@@ fied .
I loved my job no more . the engine was out .
the bu@@ zz came not back .
my sums was broken .
&quot; I made the same things as ever : the same title work , 15 hours @-@ days , through weekends , no rep@@ ent@@ ance , nothing deleg@@ ating , a tit@@ sleeps , does not exist , with all my heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no sums .
in me was silence .
&quot; four television programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four television programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously ... &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
&quot; I was a pre @-@ show @-@ Titan , &quot;
&quot; everything was gray , I just had no fun anymore . &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the bu@@ zz and the sums I was .
&quot; so what do you do if that , what you do , the work you love , suddenly fade ? &quot;
&quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; Heu@@ l you out , sil@@ ly the author Titan . &quot;
&quot; but you know you do it , you do what you do , one loves to be a painter , a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , you just loves another and that gives one of the sums you knew when the bu@@ zz stops , who is one then ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; when the song ends my heart , I can survive in silence ? &quot;
and then my &quot; southern states @-@ wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; is a question .
&quot; I am on the way out , late and she says , &quot; Mama , magic you play ? &quot;
&quot; and I will already say no , when I become aware of two things : &quot;
&quot; first , I must say yes to everything and secondly , they called me not . &quot;
they do not call anyone more &quot; sho@@ oters . &quot;
when does this happen ?
&quot; I p@@ ale , when I am Titan I and my bu@@ zz , and here everything changes before my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says , &quot; Mama , magic you play ? &quot;
&quot; and I say , &quot; yes . &quot; &quot;
this is nothing special .
&quot; we play and her Sist@@ ers come across , we laugh a lot and I read all dramatically from the book &quot; &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops &quot; . &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; but it is outstanding , because my ache and my panic , in lon@@ eliness and in the absence of the sum@@ ing , I cannot do anything except for . &quot;
I am focuss@@ ed .
I am silent .
&quot; the country , which I inherited , the marathon , I walk , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they no longer exist anymore . &quot;
&quot; all that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and mo@@ ist kis@@ ses , z@@ arte voices , wax , and the song , in which there is something to let go , or whatever the girl in &quot; &quot; The Eis@@ lingen &quot; . &quot; &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so short that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something in me is sol@@ ves .
a mental door goes up and an energy path comes in .
&quot; and that is not immediately , but it happens . &quot;
I feel it .
the sums come slowly back .
&quot; no full volume , hardly there , it is silent , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there . &quot;
&quot; not the sums , but a bu@@ zz . &quot;
&quot; and now I feel , when I would know a magical secret . &quot;
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that is all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something that we have forgotten .
&quot; the sums , the labour consumption , the tit@@ anium @-@ sum , this is only the replacement . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am when I am descri@@ bing using ship@@ ments and TV hours and how functioning my brain , then I forgot what the real sums is . &quot;
the bu@@ zz is not a force and it is not working @-@ specific .
it is dependent on the joy .
the real sums is dependent upon the love .
&quot; the sums is the flow , who comes from life . &quot;
true sums is self @-@ confidence and peace .
&quot; the real sums ign@@ ores the pressure of history , the tasks to be done , the expectation and the pressure . &quot;
the real sums is simple and original .
&quot; the real sums is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps whis@@ per@@ ed to me the wrong words , for what God said to me , that I am a Titan I ? &quot;
it is simply Love .
&quot; we all need a bit more love , much more love . &quot;
&quot; once my child wants to play with me , I will say yes . &quot;
&quot; I make this a rule , so that I can free myself as a work@@ a@@ holic of any guilt . &quot;
&quot; it is law , I have no other choice . I have no other choice if I want to hear the sums again . &quot;
&quot; I wish it would be as easy . I am not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
&quot; play not to me , how to work . &quot;
the truth does hurt ;
but I don &apos;t like it to play .
&quot; I am always working , because I love it . &quot;
I prefer to feel at home in the workplace .
&quot; this con@@ fes@@ sion is painful , because what a person would rather work than to be home ? &quot;
&quot; well , I . &quot;
&quot; time honest , I call myself &quot; Titan . &quot;
I have to have problems .
&quot; that I am too relaxed , is none of them . &quot;
&quot; we r@@ asen in the garden around , before and back , round , and forth . &quot;
&quot; we make small dance parties , &quot;
we sing and play Ball .
we cr@@ ush soap @-@ blo@@ ws .
&quot; in doing so , I feel mostly sti@@ ff , absent and confused . &quot;
I always ask for my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
&quot; my children show me how to live , and the sums of the universe met me . &quot;
&quot; I play and play , until I ask myself : why have we ever stopped with the games ? &quot;
you can also say it ! they always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
&quot; maybe you hold me for nai@@ ve , for a meeting room . &quot;
probably you are right but you can do it too !
you have time !
and you also know why ? you are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et @-@ Show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
&quot; my little ones want to play a maximum of 15 minutes with me , up to them , that they want to make something different . &quot;
&quot; it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
after 15 minutes I replaced a Marien@@ k@@ le or K@@ ek .
&quot; and , my teen @-@ daughter whole 15 minutes long with me , I am mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; there are only 15 minutes , more does not need it . &quot;
everyone can bring 15 minutes to the piece even on a bad mood day !
15 minutes on the piece !
&quot; no mobile , no laundry , no distr@@ action . &quot;
&quot; the day is short : dinner , the children are ready . &quot;
but 15 minutes are inside !
&quot; my children are my well @-@ feeling , my world . it does not have to be the children . it is to feel the sums have to feel a place for his soul . &quot;
it is not about playing with your own children . it is about joy .
in general the &quot; play &quot; in general .
get the 15 minutes !
find out what you do well .
find it out and keep it out .
&quot; I am not perfect in it . I fail and I victories . friends meet , books , enjoy the day -- &quot;
&quot; want to play ? &quot; stands for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in the apprenticeship , when I wanted to meet myself more and more . &quot;
15 minutes in the piece why do not get full 15 minutes ?
what can it be wrong ? nothing !
the bu@@ zz came back in my spare time . the bu@@ zz seems to return if I am not working .
working not without playing .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months opens a door , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office . I listen to new ideas . I get back to new ideas . I use it to full ps and love my job again . &quot;
&quot; I like the sums , but I do not love it . &quot;
I do not need it .
I am not the bu@@ zz , the sums is not me ... not anymore . &quot;
&quot; soap , and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends . &quot;
this is my bu@@ zz .
the sums of life .
the sum of love .
&quot; the sums of work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so grateful . &quot;
&quot; I sn@@ ail , that I am a Titan I have never seen a Titan , the journey to Jerusalem . &quot;
I said Yes to less work and to more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functional . my camp@@ fire are still burning .
&quot; the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more clear my head . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the sums . the country , which I fail , the marathon , which I walk , the sums , the sums , the sums , the sums , the sums of life , the sums of life . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this sums , the more this unusual , be@@ aming , naked and new feeling of life in me wide . less Titan -- more I ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel exactly this sums , the more I know who I am . &quot;
I am author . I think things I go to life .
&quot; this belongs to the job , which means to live his dream . &quot;
&quot; this is the dream of this job , &quot;
for a dre@@ am@@ job should be a little dre@@ amy .
I said &apos; Yes &apos; to less work and to more games .
tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; want to play ? &quot;
thanks beautiful .
I am neuro@@ surgery .
like most of my colleagues every day I have to do with human trag@@ e@@ dies .
&quot; I know how to change your life from one second to the other , after a serious stroke or an automobile accident . &quot;
&quot; for us neuro@@ surgeon is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , a very low ability to self @-@ healing . &quot;
&quot; after a severe violation of the central nervous system , patients often have a consistent , serious disability . &quot;
that is probably the reason why I have been working neu@@ ros@@ surg@@ eries .
what is a functioning neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve nerve functions through various surgical interventions .
&quot; surely they have heard of one of the most known , the &quot; deep @-@ terrestrial stimulation . &quot; thereby , one impl@@ anted one electro@@ de deeply in the brain to influence the circuits of the neur@@ ons so that the neurological function is improved . &quot;
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Par@@ kin@@ son &apos;s patients who suffered severe cit@@ ations and heavy pain .
Neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream functional neuro@@ surgeon is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close .
with a little help the brain can help themselves .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was leading Ober@@ physician and worked day and night in the emergency .
often I receive patients with cran@@ ial @-@ shepherd trau@@ ma .
you have to imagine that at sk@@ ul@@ um brain @-@ trau@@ mat@@ a the brain can cry and the sk@@ ull pressure .
&quot; to save life , you have to dimin@@ ish the sk@@ ull pressure . &quot;
&quot; however , one must sometimes remove a part in the brain . &quot;
&quot; instead of throwing the bra@@ ene brain mass , we decided to analyze with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , an bi@@ ologist , to analyze the brain . &quot;
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
&quot; cells of a tissue , can grow , is comparable with quite small children that will be taken out of your families . &quot;
&quot; you have to find the right diet , temperature , moisture and the environments to thri@@ ve . &quot;
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
for many verses there were Jean @-@ François .
this was what he saw under his micro@@ scope .
it was a big surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked like a stem cell culture . with large green cells , which are surrounded by small , un@@ mature cells . &quot;
perhaps you are still aware of the bi@@ ogas @-@ lessons that stem cells are un@@ ri@@ pe cells that can transform themselves into each cell type of the organism .
&quot; the adult brain has tri@@ bal cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small niche of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of brain mass in the OP .
we made a further fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast .
they never die ; they are imm@@ or@@ tal .
but these cells stopped different .
they went up slowly and after a couple of weeks she died even .
&quot; so we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like a stem cell , but was different . &quot;
&quot; we needed long to understand , where they came . &quot;
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells hot Dou@@ bl@@ ec@@ or@@ ine @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our grand@@ parents cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
&quot; at the stage of the fet@@ us , they ensure the cause of the brain . &quot;
but why do they remain with us ?
we do not know that .
&quot; we believe that they take part in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentr@@ ations close to brain injuries . &quot;
but this is not so secure .
but one thing is clear - from these cells we got our stem cells .
&quot; in front of a potential cell of cell , the brain is possible . &quot;
this is what we had to prove .
&quot; so , we decided to develop an experiment . &quot;
&quot; we wanted to see a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ language area , and then the cells have to cultiv@@ ate exactly as it did Jean @-@ François . &quot;
and they afterwards highlight them in order to be able to follow them in the brain .
in the last step we rei@@ m@@ ated them at the de@@ hydr@@ ation of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ ologist transpl@@ ant -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ spl@@ antation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we irrit@@ ate these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we have the same cells in counter@@ feit brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we were able to work with monkey .
&quot; in the first scenario we traveled the cells in a healthy brain , and we observed that they had completely disappeared after a few weeks , as if they were taken back home . the room is already occupied , so they will not disappear there , so they disappear . &quot;
&quot; in the second scenario we put an injury to and rei@@ m@@ pl@@ ed precisely the same cells , and now the cells received -- they washed up to mature neur@@ ons . &quot;
here you see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were ri@@ pped .
&quot; the evidence that they show are these small points . these are the cells that we were in vit@@ ro , in the culture . &quot;
here we could not stop .
help these cells even a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
&quot; so , we practi@@ sed monkeys with a manual de@@ pot . &quot;
they had to take the feed @-@ pell@@ ets of a tray .
they made them very well .
&quot; when they had achieved a stable skill level , we have acquired the hand@@ mot@@ oric cor@@ tex sector . &quot;
&quot; then the monkey were paraly@@ zed , they could no longer move their hand . &quot;
&quot; just as it would happen with people , it &apos;s spont@@ aneously , up to a certain degree , just like after a stroke . &quot;
&quot; the patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover with the help of plasti@@ fic@@ i@@ bra@@ in@@ mechanism . they recover at a certain degree , just as the monkey . &quot;
&quot; when we were sure that the monkey had reached the degree of spontaneous recovery , we impl@@ anted his own cells . &quot;
&quot; on the left side they see the monkeys , which is spont@@ aneously . &quot;
it can bring about 40 % to 50 % of its original power from injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
&quot; now , when we rei@@ m@@ ated the cells , the same monkey , two months after the maturity . &quot;
&quot; I can tell you , that was also very exciting results for us . &quot;
since that time we found a lot more about these cells .
we can free@@ ze them and later use .
&quot; we can use them in other new rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Par@@ kin@@ son . &quot;
but our dream is still always impl@@ ant her to impl@@ ant people .
&quot; I really hope that I can show you soon , how the human brain can show the means to heal themselves . &quot;
many thanks .
&quot; Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , which is wonderful , I am sure that now , several dozen people in the audience , perhaps even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who need it . &quot;
I definitely .
&quot; of course , the question of what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical studies on men . &quot;
&quot; J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results one must fill out about two kilo@@ grams of papers and forms , to pass these kinds of studies . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate etc . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and a nearly professional team . &quot;
BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start the clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future as many years it will take until someone can get into hospital and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : this is difficult to say .
&quot; first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial . &quot;
will it allow us the authority to start it soon ?
then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients .
&quot; it needs a long time to select the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
&quot; after that , one has to apply this to a multi @-@ cent@@ ric study . &quot;
one has to really re@@ confirm that it is useful before you can offer this treatment everybody .
&quot; BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : natural . &quot;
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne thanks for your visit at TED and that you told us about it .
BG : many thanks .
democracy .
&quot; in the West , we in the West make a big mistake to consider it as natural . &quot;
&quot; we do not see democracy as the fragile plant that it is in reality , but as inventory of our society . &quot;
we tend to consider them as an un@@ change@@ able enemy .
we believe that capitalism inev@@ itably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
&quot; Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and its big night in Beijing have no doubt demonstrated that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; indeed , democracy comes with us , in Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , when I re@@ presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was made clear to me as a finance minister in the Euro@@ group -- for me that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- not the austerity programs have to be realized in Greece . &quot;
&quot; at this moment I thought that there might be no better justi@@ fication for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my performances , told me that democracy would be abol@@ ished if they would change anything . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy . &quot;
&quot; I pray that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of an error , we could save the democracy , but that we need a tru@@ thful and def@@ ective democracy . &quot;
&quot; for without democracy our societies are in common , our future d@@ ull and our great , new technologies are wast@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; on the subject of waste , I would like to point out you on an interesting contradiction , which is currently being threatened by our economies . &quot;
I call it the &quot; tw@@ ins summit par@@ adox . &quot;
&quot; a summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the Schul@@ den@@ berg , who thro@@ ws its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we all recognise the Schul@@ den@@ berg , &quot;
but few recognize its scep@@ tre .
&quot; a mountain of un@@ used cash that belongs to the imp@@ ending austerity and concert , however , there are too anxi@@ ous to invest in where it would be productive and income , with which one needs to produce Schul@@ den@@ berg and also all of things could urgently needed , for example &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; over the past 3 months have been invested in the US , in England and in the euro zone 3.4 Bil@@ li@@ on@@ US dollars , in all the prosperity of producing goods , machines , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , cars , and so on and so forth . &quot;
&quot; 3,4 tri@@ llion dollars sounds according to a lot of money until one compar@@ es with the 5.5 Bil@@ li@@ on@@ US dollars , which were at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing did , except the stock market and the real estate prices . &quot;
&quot; thus debt and productive capital constitute the twin summit , which is not al@@ located by the usual market mechanism . &quot;
&quot; the result is stag@@ nat@@ ing wages , more than a quarter of 25 @-@ 54 year @-@ olds in the U.S. , Japan and Europe , and consequently a low demand for investors who would not invest in which they would not be able to kill him , when he would kill him when he will grow , &quot;
&quot; uns@@ ol@@ oll@@ t the circumstances leads , which lead to it that O@@ edi@@ pus is k@@ ills him . &quot;
this is my ha@@ dern with capitalism --
&quot; his extremely mer@@ wen@@ der@@ ic Art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , human talents , and especially all of the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are crucial for saving the Earth . &quot;
is democracy the solution ?
&quot; I think already . but before we continue , what do we understand among democracy ? &quot;
Arist@@ ot@@ el@@ es defined democracy as the social form in which the Free and the poor control the government .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy ended naturally too many --
&quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , it would be an error to min@@ ate the significance of the ath@@ ic democracy due to these terms . &quot;
&quot; the decision on the ath@@ ic democracy was and is that they gave the working arms , and not only the right to freedom of expression , but rather more important and decisive , which they entitled to give them the right to political co@@ determination with equal m@@ oods in questions of the government . &quot;
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not kept for a long time --
&quot; like a candle , which is very light sh@@ ines , she is also fast f@@ aded . &quot;
&quot; however , our liberal liberal democr@@ acies do not have their roots in the ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; but in the Mag@@ na C@@ arta , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution . &quot;
&quot; while Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy had concentrated on the free citizens and the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na C@@ arta , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for ruling powers . &quot;
&quot; the liberal democracy was only possible when a complete separation of politics and economy is possible , and the democratic process in politics was possible , while the economy - thus the world of corporations -- a democratic zone was developed . &quot;
&quot; in our present democr@@ acies since the time , in which this division of politics and economy began , an un@@ her@@ edit@@ ary struggle between the two , and the economy gradually desc@@ ended policy . &quot;
do you wonder why politicians are no longer like earlier ?
it is not in a de@@ generation of their DNA .
&quot; it is because it can be in the government nowadays and nevertheless , it is not in power because the power of politics in the economy is de@@ ed , and the areas are separated . &quot;
I mentioned my ha@@ dern with capitalism .
&quot; if you think about it , it is about as such as a flock of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es , the so @-@ lasting the animals , of which they nour@@ ished , dec@@ im@@ ated that they are star@@ ving at the end . &quot;
&quot; similarly , it is with the economy that the policy rises so far . the power of the corporations grows , political goods is rising , the overall economic demand falls and the managing director of the corporations are too fright@@ ened to invest the cash of their companies . &quot;
&quot; the more successful of capitalism to s@@ ells the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; &#91; the people &#93; from democracy , the higher the Twin Towers , and the greater the waste of human labour @-@ power and prosperity of humanity . &quot;
&quot; if this is true , it is obvious that we have to bring politics and the economy again , and it would be better if the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; control , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot;
so this is not a new idea .
the Marxist left had this idea ahead of 100 years ago and it wasn &apos;t quite fine .
the teaching from the deb@@ acle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only reg@@ ain a position as in the ancient Athens without new kinds of brut@@ ality and wast@@ age .
but there is a solution : creating the poor arms !
capitalism is doing it by replacing Ni@@ ed@@ rig@@ wage employed by automation and robots .
&quot; the problem here is , so long economy and politics are separate areas , automation of the Twin @-@ summit will be higher , the wast@@ ed waste , and social conflicts more deeply , just as it -- already very soon as I think -- in countries such as China will come . &quot;
&quot; so we need to re@@ design the economy and re @-@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and we pay attention to the re@@ united area , otherwise we end the film &quot; matrix &quot; as a documentation appear . &quot;
&quot; the question is not , whether capitalism has brought the technical achievements that it has brought forth , will -- &quot;
&quot; the interesting question is whether capitalism is similar to a D@@ yst@@ ro@@ scopy , similar to the &quot; matrix &quot; , &quot; in which machines serve the people and put their energy into the exploration of the universe , or into a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long talks to the meaning of life . &quot;
I believe we must be optim@@ istic .
&quot; so what does it say , how could it look to have this &quot; star Tre@@ k &quot; &quot; utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; matrix &quot; -@@ like d@@ yst@@ ro@@ scopy ? &quot;
&quot; in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples . &quot;
&quot; in the area of enterprises : ask yourself a capital market prior to which you deserve money , while you work and in which your capital follows you from a job to the next , and the company -- regardless of which one is currently working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company . &quot;
then all income comes from capital and rede@@ em and the concept of wage labor is completely over@@ hau@@ led .
&quot; no distinction between those who belong to the company , but they do not work in it , and employees working there , but no exchange between capital and labour , no major gaps between investment and sp@@ ar , and ultimately no em@@ por@@ rag@@ ing tw@@ ins summit . &quot;
&quot; in the field of global political economy : please make sure that our national currencies would have a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest Sw@@ ans &#93; . &quot;
&quot; continue to be negotiated that the entire world trade in this currency will be tr@@ aded -- we call it &quot; &quot; cosmos &quot; , &quot; in the units of &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; -- and any government pays the sum that is equivalent to the trade deficit or the commercial surplus of the respective country into a common fund . &quot;
&quot; imagine that this fund has invested in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment is r@@ ar . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed in the Bret@@ ton Woods Conference from 1944 .
the problem was that at that time you do not have the technical means to implement it .
&quot; today , we have them , in particular against the background of a re@@ unified policy and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world that I describe to you is liber@@ ated , in which they preferred to privileged people , and Marxist , because they have buried the separation of capital and work in the sleeve of history , and key@@ n@@ esian , global key@@ n@@ esi@@ ans . &quot;
but above all others it is a world where we can imagine real democracy .
will we wake up in such a world
or will we fail to a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ ro@@ scopy ?
the answer depends on how we are making political decisions together .
&quot; it is in our hands , and we do it better democratic . &quot;
thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you descri@@ b@@ able yourself in your biography itself as liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : when something of what I have just said is Marx relevant .
&quot; the reason for the re@@ union of politics and economy ... do not do this , technological development will generate such a massive decline in economic demand , which Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers is called &quot; long term stagn@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; through the transfer of this crisis from a part of the Earth to the next , as we &apos;re currently experiencing , it will not only dest@@ abili@@ ze our democr@@ acies but also the countries whose interest in liber@@ al democracy is low . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is true , Marx is quite relevant , &quot;
&quot; and as Hay@@ ek , that is why I am a liber@@ t@@ ary Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and that &apos;s why I am also completely wir@@ r . &quot;
BG : actually and now we are at ease .
&quot; Y@@ V : if one is not wir@@ r , one does not think enough . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , kind philosoph@@ ical declaration -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein that said this . BG : in your presentation , you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers , you have said very clearly what you think of the view of the West in China . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democr@@ acies we have the beginning of a democracy .
&quot; as I said in my lecture , we have limited the democracy to politics during the area where most of them plays , -- the area of economy -- a fully @-@ free zone . &quot;
&quot; in some respects , if I may say that pro@@ voc@@ ative , China now resem@@ bles the England of the 19th century . &quot;
for -- do you remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- that is an error .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill -- &quot;
&quot; he was particularly skep@@ tical , which affects democratic development . &quot;
&quot; what one can see in China now , resem@@ bles very the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
&quot; now China now throw to do what the West has done in the 19th century , smells from hypo@@ cris@@ y to hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
BG : I am sure that many listen@@ ers curious about your experiences as financial minister of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I found that that comes .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later on the first half @-@ year ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal perspective , and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to make a new start with the eurozone . &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the eurozone , &quot;
&quot; namely , to say goodbye to the self @-@ suff@@ iciency , and the persistent aband@@ on@@ ation that there was a massive susp@@ ect line through the eurozone and continues to massi@@ vely threatened with the development of the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity to be on the basis of the Greek proposal -- by the way , the first proposal was that this denial was revealed . &quot;
&quot; it is correct to do . unfortunately , the powers within the eurozone , within the European group , continues to denial . &quot;
but you know what is coming .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
&quot; if one tries to receive a business system , which is not over@@ viable , through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism it will be able to delay it perhaps a while , but if changes occurs , he happens ab@@ rupt and destructive . &quot;
BG : what changes do you see ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future when we do not change their construction .
BG : do you have made any mistakes in your time as a financial minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- Ern@@ est ...
&quot; if there is a finance minister or any Minister , who claims after 6 months in office , especially in such tense situation , claimed that he did not make any mistake , then this is a dangerous person . &quot;
&quot; of course , I made mistakes . &quot;
the biggest error was to sign the application for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February .
&quot; I felt that there was an honest interest on the sides of the don@@ ors , a common solution . &quot;
but that was not .
&quot; they merely wanted to bring our government to the case , only because they did not want to deal with the inter@@ rup@@ tions caused by the eurozone . &quot;
they did not want to admit that they have been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
there is worse than during the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; none of the tro@@ ika credit@@ ors , who has imposed us this policy , and a &quot; &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive ti@@ ons of talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is facing someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; my greatest fear is that the eurozone is not survived . &quot;
&quot; for if they do not survive , the fre@@ ed fli@@ ers will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot;
&quot; this is not alone for Europe to cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences , but for the entire world economy . &quot;
we are probably the most powerful economy in the world .
&quot; when we allow ourselves to hit the way of a post @-@ modern 1930 , what it appears to me , it will also be unbe@@ ar@@ able for the future of Europeans as well as the non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope that you are wrong in this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for you were at TED . &quot;
Y@@ V : thanks .
&quot; by Roy Price most never heard , although he is likely to be held responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013 . &quot;
&quot; probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for many of you . &quot;
&quot; this goes back to the decision , the Roy lasted three years ago . &quot;
&quot; Roy Price is conduc@@ tivity at Amazon Studios , &quot;
the TV @-@ production facility of Amazon .
&quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has a I@@ gel@@ ato and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; movies , TV , technique , Tac@@ os . &quot;
&quot; Roy has a very important job , because he is responsible for doing the shows and the contents to produce the Amazon . &quot;
&quot; of course , this is a very hard fighting industry . &quot;
there are so many TV series that Roy does not choose any one .
&quot; he must find shows , which are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he must find shows that are on the right side of this curve . &quot;
this curve is the evaluation of over 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB site . the rating is from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this review receive .
&quot; will your show be rated with nine and higher , this is a winner . &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; these are shows how &quot; breaking bath , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows , addi@@ ctive , where , after you have a season , your brain asks , &quot; Where is there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left , here at this end , shows shows how &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ aras &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what goes on at that end of the curve . &quot;
&quot; Roy Price is not concerned to get on the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to submit &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ aras . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he turns out more thoughts on the middle detection , the average television -- the shows , which are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t inspire . &quot;
so he must ensure that he is really on the right side .
&quot; the pressure is present , and of course it is the first time Amazon so something makes , therefore Roy Price doesn &apos;t want to risk . &quot;
he wants successes .
&quot; he needs guaranteed success , so he keeps a contest . &quot;
&quot; he takes many ideas for TV shows and choosing eight candidates for TV shows , then he produced the first episode of each of these shows and presents them online where they can see each free of charge . &quot;
&quot; and if Amazon is out of nothing things , one does it say right ? &quot;
millions of vie@@ wers look at these episodes .
&quot; however , they do not know that they will be observed at the check of these shows . &quot;
you will be observed by Roy and his team who are able to record everything .
&quot; you comprehend how to start the show , when one fails , which parts one can ski@@ ps or once again . &quot;
&quot; you collect millions of data to decide with this data , which show they should produce . &quot;
&quot; in fact , they collect the data , process these and it results in the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com about four Republi@@ can US Sen@@ ators . &quot;
they did this show .
do someone know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many people remember this show because it was not so good . &quot;
&quot; it is only an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7,@@ 4 and Alpha House , at 7,5 -- therefore something on average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked . &quot;
&quot; about at the same time at another company , another manager has placed a top show by data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always searching for this a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it different . &quot;
&quot; instead of holding a contest , he and his team have the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x spect@@ ators , so the reviews that they may give the shows , their shows they like etc . &quot;
then use these data to find out these little details about the spect@@ ators : what shows they like what producers , which actors . &quot;
&quot; when they had all the parts together , they went a wagon and decided not to make a Sit@@ com over four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; house of Cards &quot; . Net@@ fli@@ x thus has hit a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
house of Cards &quot; gets a 9,@@ 1 review on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
&quot; of course , is the question : what happened here ? &quot;
man has two very com@@ missions to diversi@@ fied companies .
they connect with each other and it works great for one of them but not for the other company .
what is it ?
because logic somehow says that it should work with everything .
&quot; when you coll@@ ects millions of data , for a decision that you meet , then you should have a good decision . &quot;
it has 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
you can optim@@ ised it by very powerful computer .
&quot; what you can expect is good TV , or ? &quot;
&quot; if data analysis does not work , then this is something fright@@ ening because we live in a time where we live more and more to meet statistics in order to meet serious decisions , far beyond television . &quot;
knows someone here the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
&quot; nobody . OK , that is even good . &quot;
&quot; multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that nobody in this room will ever come in touch with this software . come in touch , you are in prison . &quot;
&quot; if someone is in prison in the USA and ask for dismis@@ sal , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dismis@@ sal is made or not . &quot;
&quot; just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of decide whether a show will be good or bad , the person will be good or bad . &quot;
&quot; moderate television , 22 minutes , this can be really bad , but more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data , &quot;
not always created the best results . this is not that a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
even the data of sealed firms are still wrong .
&quot; yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Google announced that they can tell through data analysis out@@ breaks of flu , che@@ ating way -- by data analysis of the Google research . &quot;
it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation . success in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked fine , year round year , until it suddenly wasn &apos;t working anymore , &quot;
and no one could say why .
&quot; it just didn &apos;t work , this was again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the magazine &quot; Nature &quot; . &quot; &quot;
even the data diversi@@ fied companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
&quot; despite all these errors , data flow in decisions of life a -- at work , in the law enforcement , in medicine . &quot;
&quot; so , we should rather make sure that data are helpful . &quot;
&quot; I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded gene@@ tics -- an area , in which some very smart people un@@ imagin@@ able many data to make serious decisions , such as the decision for a cancer therapy &quot;
or the development of a drug . over the years I realized some patterns over the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions .
&quot; if you have to solve a complex problem , they do mostly do two things : &quot;
&quot; as a result , you place this problem in its parts , so that you can analyze the items ; as a second , you put the items again to hold a decision . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : apart and get together again . &quot;
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to cr@@ ush a problem and understand its parts . &quot;
they are not suitable to merge the parts again and then come to a decision .
there is another tool and we all possess it : our brain .
&quot; if there is something that is good in which the brain is good , it is parts and pieces come together again , even if the information is incomplete , in order to grasp a good de@@ w -- particularly when it is the brain of a experts . &quot;
&quot; therefore , I believe , Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and mind where they also go in the process . &quot;
&quot; they use data to better understand their public , because they would not have been able to put all these parts again and make it a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; , &quot; this was not in the data . &quot;
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show which meant they went a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon however did this in the wrong way .
&quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first when they hit TV @-@ ideas at first when they chose &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; &quot; as a Show . &quot;
it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; they say to us the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; data are helpful for better choices , but I believe things wrong when data start to control our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how power@@ fully they are , data are just a tool , and not to forget that this device is quite useful . &quot;
many of you will ...
&quot; before there was data , this was the device for decisions . &quot;
many know it .
&quot; it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; . &quot; it is amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or no @-@ question you just need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- exactly here at this moment .
I will end it later with a technology demo .
&quot; so far , I have made some decisions in my life until now I have to listen to the ball . &quot;
&quot; but , as you know of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace it by something a lot of exposure , such as data analysis to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not change the basic building .
&quot; perhaps the ball is wis@@ er and wis@@ er and wis@@ er . ultimately , it is possible to make decisions when we want to reach something extraordinary at the end of the right corner . &quot;
&quot; and I feel this as a very heart@@ ening message that despite the great amount of data still pays out , decisions to meet , an expert in what you do , and risks . &quot;
&quot; because in the end , it is not the data , but the risks , with which you land at the right end of the curve . &quot;
thanks beautiful .
