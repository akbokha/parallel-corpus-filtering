<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won as New York Times-Reporter the Pulitzer Prize.</seg>
<seg id="3">"long before someone had heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacular that the NSA illegally heard the Phones of Americans."</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter which should leave a permanent impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in this he describes a catastrophic US intelligence surgery, where the CIA is literally drafts for an atomic bomb."</seg>
<seg id="6">"if the crazy sounds, read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who the chapters have not coincided?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"nearly 10 years, the government has established against illings and called him to call his alleged sources."</seg>
<seg id="11">"on this turn, he became a symbol for the pattern of the government, whistleblowers and to punish journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to the first Constitutional Treaty, the media has the right to publish their secret information."</seg>
<seg id="13">"but it is impossible to apply this law when media does not get this information, and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave ones."</seg>
<seg id="14">"so when the government was killed at Risen, he did something that many brave porters had already done before him: he refused, and said that he would rather go to prison."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from 2007 to 2015 he lived, so with the risk to go to prison."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, only days before the process, something extraordinary."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, though they were years for years that it would be essential for their case, the demands of the government were dropped."</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in time of electronic monitoring the reporters and springs can be hide less.</seg>
<seg id="19">"instead of moving and concise the statements, this could also do its digital footprints for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"and so, the issuers, without his consent, his phone wisely hosted,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"just like his e-mail data, financial and banking information, its credit, and even irritation with the list of its flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblowers and Risens."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, this is only one of many cases."</seg>
<seg id="24">"President Obama promised to protect whistleblowers, but instead, Justice has doomed more than all U.S. governments in front of him."</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government is too much dependent on their work as secret."</seg>
<seg id="26">"since September 11, almost every article on national security was the result of that a whistleblowers went to a journalist."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so we set the press work on the game that should be protected by the first Constitutional Treaty, because the government has increasingly got more possibilities to spy all."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but just as technology of the government allowed to handle the rights of reporters, the press can use technologies to better protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="29">"and indeed they can take it from the moment in which they contact, rather than in retrospect, in the witness."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today, there are communication software that had not yet been written as a canopy's book and it is much safer than normal e-mails or phone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"such technology is SecureDrop, an open source issue for whistleblowers, which was originally developed by the Internet of Aaron Swartz, and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation, where I have been working, further developed."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news site, just like the Washington Post here."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there you can upload documents to upload or send documents, as in any ordinary contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">"these are then encrypted and stored on a server, to which only the respective news agency has access."</seg>
<seg id="35">"so the government cannot find more information secretly, and many of the information they would require, would not be available from the start."</seg>
<seg id="36">"SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole, to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century."</seg>
<seg id="37">"unfortunately, governments around the world develop new espionage technologies that jeopardize us all."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it is important to us to ensure that not only technology-denominator such as Edward Snowden have a way to protect iniquity. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblowers,"</seg>
<seg id="39">"the report on abnormalities in the supply of soldiers is humble and of crowded hospitals. or the next environmental workers, the alarm on the sew water of Flint proposes. or a Wallstreet insider that warned us before the next financial crisis."</seg>
<seg id="40">"at least, these technologies have not only been made for those who want to impose crimes but to protect our full constitutional rights."</seg>
<seg id="41">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on 3 April 2016 the biggest data on the story was published.] [the "Panama Papers" has been hidden [the] "Panama Papers"] [...] [us] Robert Palmer of Global Witness to make a statement.] this week we were told by messages about a leak of 11 million documents of the law firm Moso Fonseca.</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we will get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers to companies such as Mosbags Fonseca go and say:" okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up? "</seg>
<seg id="45">"we actually see the emails, the exchange of messages, such as the whole system works as it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Islands Prime Minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">Also there are reports that a exile of the brutal Syrian dictator Baschar al-Assad wallet companies in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is asserted that a track of 2 billion US dollar leads to Russia President Vladimir Putin, over a close friend from children's days, a famous cellists."</seg>
<seg id="50">"now there will be a lot of richer people and others to wait for the next release, and the next uncovered documents."</seg>
<seg id="51">Now that sounds like the plot of an agency skiers or a John-Grisham test.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it seems crying from you, ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we handle what?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is, if the rich and powers are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not to pay all their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, streets."</seg>
<seg id="55">And this concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organization, global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"in all over the world, media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens are used by a few of them, their assets to hide and wear - something that we have been discussing and conceeing us for ten years."</seg>
<seg id="58">"I think many people will seem very confusing this whole world, and it is difficult to understand how these tax havens work."</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine like a Matryodkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">"so, one company has a company in another company, in another company that makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind this prayer."</seg>
<seg id="61">"it can be very difficult for criminal enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society really what matters is."</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it interesting that in the US there is less reports on this matter.</seg>
<seg id="63">Presumably because there have been no prominent Americans that occurred in this revelations.</seg>
<seg id="64">"now it is not that there are no enough Americans, who hide their assets in tax havens."</seg>
<seg id="65">"but through the principle, after which this tax havens work, Mostrance Fonseca has fewer American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"if we had a data base from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would have a lot more cases and examples to have the connections to the US."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, it is so that you need less information in some US states to provide less information to start a company than to get a librarian credit card."</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of inconsistency in the US has allowed employees of schoolboroughs to rip schoolchildren.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed to scams particularly susceptional investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that all affects us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this in practice looks.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">"so, we sent an uncovered revival in the offices of 13 lawyers firms in Manhattan."</seg>
<seg id="74">"our investigators gave itself as an African minister who wanted to bring vapex money to the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet."</seg>
<seg id="75">"" "we really shocked that all up to a lawyer of our teach proposals, how he could transcend his money."</seg>
<seg id="76">"these were all precursors. none of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course no money was handed over to us. but it shows the problem with this system."</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as individuals.</seg>
<seg id="78">"it is not about a single lawyer, who has undergone the proposals to be submitted."</seg>
<seg id="79">It is not a particular leader in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">"it is about how the system works, through the corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"and to cope with this, we must change the rules."</seg>
<seg id="82">We must change the rules to make this kind of behavior.</seg>
<seg id="83">"this may sound all very traply sound, as if we could do anything about it; as if nothing could ever have changed, as if it is always the rich and powerful."</seg>
<seg id="84">"but as born Optimist, I see quite sure that some things have begun to change."</seg>
<seg id="85">"over the past few years, we have seen lectures at more transparency what the owners of firms are concerned."</seg>
<seg id="86">The subject took political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 Summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">"since then, the EU gathered in central tabs at the national level, who really is behind firms in Europe and who is controlled."</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the most uncomfortable facts is that the US is lagging here.</seg>
<seg id="89">"representatives of both parties have introduced a force in force in both circumstances, but this does not make progress we would like to see."</seg>
<seg id="90">"we would really like to see how these Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, as a means used to ensure greater transparency in the U.S. and globally."</seg>
<seg id="91">For us in Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">"we need ordinary people who are angry, if they see how other people can hide their true identity behind the headboard."</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need executives in the economy which stand up and say:" "transparency is not good for business." ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"we need leading politicians who recognise the problem and use it, through laws this kind of transparency."</seg>
<seg id="95">"together we can end the intransparent, which now makes this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering, finally finish."</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story of how I almost kidnapped and in the trunk of a red Mazel.</seg>
<seg id="97">"a day after I had completed my design study, I made a backyard."</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda remained and look at my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a road trip all the country. afterwards he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "where do you slaughter it tonight?"</seg>
<seg id="104">"he made the whole thing worse," I don't know yet. "</seg>
<seg id="105">"and I thought:" Oh, man! "</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">"but I just got to know him! he says he would go to the peace corps, but I don't know if he is really planning. I don't want to land in the trunk of a Mazel!"</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">"then I heard me," "I have a bubble. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">"a voice in my head said:" "h, how please?"</seg>
<seg id="113">"at night I was then in bed, I stared up the blanket and thought:" Oh husband! what have I built up there? "</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild rest in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I received such a fear that I rose out of the bed, on tipped pointed to the door, and my sleep-door."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">"the artwork, which he had bought from me, is now in his classroom. he is now teachers."</seg>
<seg id="120">It was my first experience as a host. it completely changed my point of view.</seg>
<seg id="121">"perhaps the people who were sold in childhood as strangers, actually friends who just waited to be discovered?"</seg>
<seg id="122">"to host people on my air mattress, was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattress."</seg>
<seg id="123">"we make a time jump, two years later..."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I am unemployed, almost plitude, my roommate draws out and the rent is increased."</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all the hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">"I think creativity can create it, fear in fun."</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote my best friend and new fellow inhabitants Brian Chesky:" Brian, I have overlay out how we could earn something about it. our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast-breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk including a mattress and each morning breakfast. "</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a site and founded so "aerial ratze and breakfast" [AIRBed aNd Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air conditioning on woodfloors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">"I am sure to decorate our cheese ham Omelet, completely different because we made it for our guests."</seg>
<seg id="133">We touring with them through the whole city. as we had to say our last guest and the door to the castle fell starred Brian and I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="134">We just discovered that at the same time we find new friends and could pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">The things came into rolls.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former roommate, Nate Brarczyk, joined us as a developer."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if you could make it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">"we presented to the investors:" "we want to create a site based on the people publicly images of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms, their doors, whose doors are closed when visiting."</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the internet they can then invite wild people to stay overnight.</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the missile would receive.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they do not act.</seg>
<seg id="143">"no one who is even at solace, would invest in a shop would be allowed to sleep in apartments of other people."</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we have learned as children all that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">"if one has a problem, it is on the things you can get good. we could designen."</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie we had learned that design is much more than just look and haptics -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">"we had learned how to designate objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust by design, between people who never had previously met."</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design make such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create with design confidence?</seg>
<seg id="151">"I would like to give you a cost of endurance, which degree of trust we asped."</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up if you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Enter your unlock phone to your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">"this quiet flight from panic, which you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when it is the first time open the door."</seg>
<seg id="158">For the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">"visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet."</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the mobile phone of a foreigner in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So also most guests feel when they stay elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Only sometimes who has actually Al Gores mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you tell us on Twitter that he is responsible for president of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">They have experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I would like to tell you of some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we have changed a little detail about this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">"what if your neighbour could only be introduced with his name, if he told where he comes, how his dog or his children are hot?"</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you could have 150 assessments that all say: "he can really keep very well-erred handsys!</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel then if you would have to leave your phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-known feedback system strengthens the trust is decisive.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we made some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was difficult for people to finish negative aspects.</seg>
<seg id="175">"in the end, we decided to wait until both host and guest had given their bassessments before we set them online."</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we have discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">"we conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how likely it is that people trust each other, depending on how they are about age and home."</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprising we trust the people most who are most like.</seg>
<seg id="179">"the more differences we find, the less we trust."</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social occurrence.</seg>
<seg id="181">You will be exciting when you add the call of a person -- in our case by assessments.</seg>
<seg id="182">"if one has fewer than three divisions, nothing changes."</seg>
<seg id="183">"but, one has more than ten, changes everything."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation stiffin common.</seg>
<seg id="185">"so, the right design can help us to overcome some of our deep rooting preferences."</seg>
<seg id="186">"in addition, we experienced that trust is dependent on how much you can get from."</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reactions to the first news of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"if one tells a little about how for example" "Hi!", "you do not get an answer."</seg>
<seg id="189">"one tells a lot, as for example:" I have problems with my mother "-- -- the request is also rather not accepted."</seg>
<seg id="190">"so there is an optimal degree of openness, such as" Tolle Artworks in your apartment! I make with my family holiday. "</seg>
<seg id="191">How can we create it with design to make this degree an openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text box to recommend the right amount of text. we also give advice on which subjects you should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">"" "our whole company builds up hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices opposite to foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="194">"what we had not reckoned, was the great multitude of people who were more than willing to present these prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you can see how many people take our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">"first,: incredibly good luck."</seg>
<seg id="198">"second, the tireless work of our team."</seg>
<seg id="199">"third: a need, which was previously not covered."</seg>
<seg id="200">For us the business is running very well.</seg>
<seg id="201">"of course, there are times when not everything goes smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have celebrated parties or roomed apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have guests in the rain stand.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I have worked on customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">"I stood at the forefront, when trust was broken."</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing Schlimmeres than these calls. it does hurt if I just think.</seg>
<seg id="207">"the disappointment that one ends in the voice of the rub, and will always be our greatest motivation to continue to improve."</seg>
<seg id="208">"fortunately, of the 123 million people had only a fraction of a problem."</seg>
<seg id="209">Because people trust each other right.</seg>
<seg id="210">"when trust works, there can be wonder."</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holiday in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host was brought him into hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood to the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">Perfect house for travelers who are due to sitting activities to heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">"Javier and Alejandra are real protangels who save life, even though they do not know it right."</seg>
<seg id="218">"you drive one in your own car into the hospital, when you die, and wait while you get a bypass."</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want to feel lonely, they bring books past. "</seg>
<seg id="220">They can even stay longer without calculating the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">"of course, not every stay is going on."</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money transaction is exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">"when I was for the first time about this term, I asked myself:"</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money transactions together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is about an economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"but it is now simply called" "tenders", "the thing is not fair."</seg>
<seg id="228">"Share Economy describes a trade, human relationships promises."</seg>
<seg id="229">People lay a part of themselves and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">"if one travels nowadays, that is easy to compare with Fast Food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic."</seg>
<seg id="231">"what would be, however, if travelling a rich buffet from local impressions would be?"</seg>
<seg id="232">"what would be when in every place you visit, a group there would wait to show a group there, to be thoroughly complete and one at a pub tour of which one has never heard before;"</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star cook?</seg>
<seg id="234">"nowadays, apartments are designed based on privacy."</seg>
<seg id="235">What would be if we would like to share apartments from scratch</seg>
<seg id="236">How would this look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What would be if cities would accept the thoughts of a common part?</seg>
<seg id="238">"I imagine towns that allow us to society and relationships, instead of loneliness and hardened."</seg>
<seg id="239">"in Southern Coreas capital Seoul, this project has already begun. many parking places that the government were belonging."</seg>
<seg id="240">"now residences were offered now. students who were looking for a lead,"</seg>
<seg id="241">"were conveyed to people whose children were raised, Incubator programs have been launched,"</seg>
<seg id="242">"to finance new start-ups in the Share Economy. about our platform alone, night 785 000 people in 191 countries will be a guest at a stranger or even hosts."</seg>
<seg id="243">The idea seems to be not so crazy how it was brought to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We have not invented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality was there before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were already similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why has just our work?</seg>
<seg id="248">"apart from luck and timing, we believe that you can find the right design with the components of trust."</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us to overcome deeper prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find this amazing, "</seg>
<seg id="251">Straight to overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to contemplate each time when a red Mazda is passing by me.</seg>
<seg id="253">"of course, we know that design can not solve any problem."</seg>
<seg id="254">"but if it could help us, if it had this great influence, I wonder why we can use this design soon."</seg>
<seg id="255">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you watch me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">"or suppressed, a brain-laundering underwent, a terrorist leader?"</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in the security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I do not give you blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media represent the people who look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of reporting about Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans mean that most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people do not talk to their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For all those who have never met a Muslim: it is great to know you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I say to you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">"I am a mother, a coffee maker -- double espresso, with cream extra."</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted.</seg>
<seg id="271">A Möller-Fanatikerin</seg>
<seg id="272">"and I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="273">"but not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not so born."</seg>
<seg id="274">I have decided on this.</seg>
<seg id="275">"when I was 17 years old, I met the decision to outen me."</seg>
<seg id="276">"no, not as homosexual man, like some of my friends, but as Muslim. I decided to wear the Hijab, my headgear."</seg>
<seg id="277">My feminist girlfriends were horrified: "why oppressed you yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">"the Lustige was: at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence, and in contrast to the pressure I felt as 17-year-old, to adapt to a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not just accepted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have been connected to the Quran.</seg>
<seg id="281">"I read it, thought after, was desperate and credible in the end."</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was confidence and slow dedication to deepened with each reading of the corans.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythm takes me sometimes to the wines.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognise myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">"had you ever had the feeling that somebody takes you, you fully understand, and yet somehow loves?"</seg>
<seg id="287">It feels like that.</seg>
<seg id="288">"later I married and began, like all good Egyptians, my career as an engineer."</seg>
<seg id="289">"I had later, after my salvation, a child, and lived basically the" Egyptian-American dream. "</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came that horrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"I sat in my kitchen, had at the end, looked at the screen and saw the word" "breaking message." ""</seg>
<seg id="293">"smoke was smoke, planes flowed in buildings, people ranged from the buildings."</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disorder?</seg>
<seg id="297">My Shock changed quickly in rebellion.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should you do something?</seg>
<seg id="299">"I switched to the television channel and heard:..." Muslim terrorists "..."... in the name of Islam... "..."... Jierbomys Mecca! "</seg>
<seg id="300">"Oh, my God."</seg>
<seg id="301">"it was not only my country attacked, but in the nu turned me the deeds of others from a civil war into a suspicious."</seg>
<seg id="302">The same day we had to go through the Middle West of the United States to move into a new town and begin with the building study.</seg>
<seg id="303">"I remember how I was speaking -- as we silent -- how deep it went into my seat, and I was afraid to be recognized as Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved to our apartment in our apartment in a new city where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">"and then heard, I saw and read the warnings of national Islamic organizations that said," "be watchful," "Seid cautious," "lead in well illuminated areas," "Versammmelt you not."</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week inside.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday at that week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">"and again the warnings:" "not on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive coverage of me.</seg>
<seg id="310">"the feelings were understandably harmless and I also heard about attacks on Muslims, or by people that one held for Muslims, to warped into free."</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really brandy on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something felt not right.</seg>
<seg id="314">"because the people, who had attacked this country, have attacked our country."</seg>
<seg id="315">I have defeated the anger of the people to the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to have to explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing against questions I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">They are the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">"nowadays, we can actually hear people:" "there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we get rid of them? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want Muslims greens and mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumour in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">It only presents the question: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malignant tumor you can be as a whole and a benign tumor one thinks only under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is false.</seg>
<seg id="327">"Muslims are like all the other Americans, no tumour in the body of the US, but a vital organ."</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, terrestrial and Olympionions. "</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of musk America make safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">"perhaps there will be a few parking spaces, but not stop the terror."</seg>
<seg id="332">"the regular visit of a mosque leads to people other faith tolerant, and greater civil participation."</seg>
<seg id="333">"and like me a leader of the police in the area of Washington, DC recently told, people are actually not radicalised in mosques."</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">"in the radicalization process, one has established that he begins online. as a First] the person is cut off from their church, even by their family, so that the person believes that the person believes the true Muslims, and anyone who despises their behaviour and ideology, is a traitor, or of faith."</seg>
<seg id="336">"if we want to prevent radicalisation, we have to stop the people to go to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="337">Some are still claiming that Islam is a nonviolent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">"finally, a group as the IS establishes its brutality with the Koran."</seg>
<seg id="339">"as Muslim, as mother, as man, I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS."</seg>
<seg id="340">"but we would add ourselves to their imagination, if you recognize them as representatives of 1,6 billion believers."</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku Club-Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology reasons for their "Holy Book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"but if one casts a look at it, she doesn't drive what they are in their" Holy Scripture. ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that they can see these things into the scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam about me recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">"a girl came to him, because she asked himself to join the IS."</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">"he said the problem was exactly the opposite. every clergy with whom she had spoken, she brought to the silence, and said her, her wrath, her meaning for the injustice in the world, she would only get into trouble."</seg>
<seg id="350">"there was nothing inspired by nothing and something that had given to their anger, she was a main aim for the instrumentalization by extremists who promised her a solution."</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam introduced the connection to God and their church again.</seg>
<seg id="352">"instead of accused them for her humility, he showed their constructive paths for a real change in the world."</seg>
<seg id="353">"what she learned in the mosque, she used to join the IS."</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight as the Islamophobia me and my family concerns.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect every other?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy on our thoughts?</seg>
<seg id="358">"a study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show, when we fear, happen at least three things."</seg>
<seg id="359">"we accept rather an authoritarian governmental system, conformance and prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="360">"a study reveals: when one was presented to test persons in which negative about Muslims was reported, they unanimously reported military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not only a akademic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">"if you look out when the mood against Muslims upward -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then it happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks."</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in advance of the Iraq war and during two electoral perions.</seg>
<seg id="364">"so Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Moslem-terror, as I expected it."</seg>
<seg id="365">"it can actually be a tool for manipulation of the public to undercut the foundation of a free society, the rational and well informed citizens."</seg>
<seg id="366">The handling of Muslims is an early warning.</seg>
<seg id="367">"we might feel it as the first, but the toxic air of fear shines us all."</seg>
<seg id="368">"in case of assignment of collectivism, it is not just about to explain yourself."</seg>

<seg id="372">"his sister would tell me that he was the sweet, dreamed man, whom they knew."</seg>

<seg id="375">"just a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne on her brother and his wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, she assassinated, just as the sister of Yusor, Razan, who was in the afternoon to visit his statements by Muslims on his Facebook page."</seg>

<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">We went to the mosque or were we safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">"we praising it and for us it was not an easy decision, for it was about what America would like to leave to our children: one that would not control us through fear, or one in which we can exercise our religion freely."</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">"with our son in the children's seat we drove silent, with high pressure to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="384">"I took him out, went my shoes, went into the prayer shalle, and what I saw, let me hold."</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was restless filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">"then the Imam made an announcement, printed and called our guests, because half of the gathered were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, Atheists, believers, and non-believers who have come to teach us, but to teach us."</seg>
<seg id="387">At this moment I have collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had courage and compassion panic and prejudices.</seg>

<seg id="411">You can also build self-employed structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to wear burdens with turmoil and respond in general on natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our aim is to exceed the limits of Possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">"so that a system of autonom is working, there must be collective-let know where in space the mobile objects are located."</seg>
<seg id="416">"in our laboratory at the ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to find objects. this allows us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks."</seg>
<seg id="417">"for today's Demos, we use a new localization technology of Verity Studios, an integer of our laboratory."</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room to determine calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"external commands are available at the highest ece. e.g." "start" "and" "land." ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called Heckstarter.</seg>
<seg id="422">"a flight device, which tries to beat two compartments with a cap."</seg>
<seg id="423">"like other starches, it is efficient in the downwards flight, much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations."</seg>
<seg id="424">"in contrast to most starters, it can fluctuate and therefore has great benefits when starting and landing, and is very versatile."</seg>
<seg id="425">"however, there is always a downside."</seg>
<seg id="426">A restriction of heckstarters is that they are sensitive to turbulence like wind-bows.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the air device doesn't able to regained its optimal position and can be improved the performance by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research we often provide basic abstracts issues which are at the core of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">For example: what is the petty-possible number of movable parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopter are known as machines with a thousand movements that join forces to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago trained pilots were able to fly remotely flying devices that had only two movable parts: a propeller and a hedge.</seg>
<seg id="435">"unfortunately, we discovered that flies with only one works."</seg>
<seg id="436">"this is the monospinner, the mechanically simplest remote machine. it was recently invented."</seg>
<seg id="437">"it only has a movable part, a propeller,"</seg>
<seg id="438">"no brackets, hinges and cross ruder, no further actuator or controlloins, only a propeller."</seg>
<seg id="439">"although it is mechanical simple, it happens in the inside life very much, so that it can be stable and can move in the room."</seg>
<seg id="440">"nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the heckstarters. to make it clear, I have to throw it right."</seg>
<seg id="441">"the likelihood to throw it right when I see all, is low, therefore I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening."</seg>
<seg id="442">"when the monospinner is a practice in soluousness, this machine is here, the omrile with its eight propellors, a practice in abundance."</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this overflow?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why it is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">"thus, he will receive the great skill,"</seg>
<seg id="447">"move in space in all directions, no matter what direction he is filmed, or even as he rotating."</seg>
<seg id="448">"of course, it is complex, mainly in the field of interactive rivers from the eight propellors."</seg>
<seg id="449">"some is adjustable in models, the rest will be learned directly at the catch."</seg>
<seg id="450">Let us see that.</seg>
<seg id="451">"when flying machines are to be part of our daily life, they must be extremely safe and reliable."</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is made up of two separate two-propeller aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">This turns on the clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against the clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">"when one builds them, they behave like a high-performance Quadrocopter."</seg>
<seg id="456">"however, somewhat awry -- a engine or propeller falls off, the electronics or a cordless -- can continue to fly the machine as well."</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate that we make a half airplanes.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration is examined synthetic stimulates.</seg>
<seg id="459">"the great number of autonomous, co-ordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression."</seg>
<seg id="460">We took wholesale micro-quadcopter -- every single weighs less than one disc bread -- and match it with localisation and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">"each unit white, where in space she is and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no upper limit."</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully motivate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine as drexert wants to be a flying lamp at Broadway on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">"of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of these technology."</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us is the reward in the development and creation of creation.</seg>
<seg id="466">"it serves as memory, how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it is creative, clever creatures which allows them to form this spectacular way."</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such solid commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>

<seg id="480">"but enough people realized it as crazy genies, so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea."</seg>

<seg id="482">"in follow-up time, the precision of LIGO could be increased considerably, resulting in recognition performance considerably."</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is now called Advanced LIGO.</seg>

<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the departure from my todkranken father.</seg>
<seg id="491">"basically, that was the fruits of my life."</seg>
<seg id="492">"all that I had worked, is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been studied grained waves from black holes and their by observatories such as LIGO measurable signals. but what are gravity waves?"</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a cuttering in the tissue of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">"when passed the wave, the wave and overall content can be stretched in a direction and into the other side."</seg>
<seg id="495">In order to illustrate lecturers in courses for relativestheory often a properly albering dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dusting, stretching and dust."</seg>
<seg id="497">"the problem is that gravity waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="498">"on 14 September, for example, each of us has stretched out the waves at ascend and concede. the elongation of an average person was 10 high -21."</seg>
<seg id="499">"this means 20 Nulls after the coma, followed by a 1st Darum, one explained the LIGO employee for crazy."</seg>
<seg id="500">"with a five kilometers long laser detector, and this is already absurd, the length would have to be measured on less than a thousand of the radius of the nuclear weapons. this is gray."</seg>

<seg id="502">"KIP Thorne, a co-founder of GOs, the hunt for the waves as follows:" the technical difficulties in the construction of such detectors are raped. "</seg>
<seg id="503">"but physicists are final, and with the support of the public will certainly be overcome all obstacles."</seg>
<seg id="504">"Thorne released this 1973, 42 years before his success."</seg>
<seg id="505">"back to LIGO. Scott holds, LIGO is more a ear than an eye."</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">"visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than the things around us: face lifts, the size of your phones."</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite handy. because so you can make a picture or a map of things by taking the one of several points coming around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">With tones it is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible tints have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">"that is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to make a picture of things that you particularly mean to you:"</seg>
<seg id="512">The face of your child about.</seg>
<seg id="513">"instead, we listen to certain properties such as clay base and height, rhythm and volume, to close the story behind it."</seg>
<seg id="514">"now, just Alice."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob, it breaks."</seg>
<seg id="516">"drummer Bob,"</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot produce simple photos of objects in space.</seg>
<seg id="519">"but as we pay attention to changes in the amplitude and frequency of waves, we can listen to their stories."</seg>
<seg id="520">"at least, for LIGO the resonate frequencies are in the audible section."</seg>
<seg id="521">"so when we convert shaft patterns in Schalle, we can speak the All literally."</seg>
<seg id="522">"the gravitation to listen, can tell us about the collision of two black holes, what my colleague Scott has been busy very long."</seg>
<seg id="523">"SH: two black, non-rotary holes, circulates: wupp!"</seg>
<seg id="524">Rotate the two body very fast, you hear the same circle with an additional clay change. this ends itself to: Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu! "</seg>
<seg id="525">"it is a kind of movement, shaped into the waveform."</seg>
<seg id="526">"AA: on 14. September 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- I heard of the following: [Surrender's usch] Jemand, who knows what to hear, this is seen as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes with 30-fat sun mass, which turned around as fast as the sticks of your mixer."</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's think about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">"two black holes, the thick body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, revolve each hundred times a second before they collide."</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces before.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know about it because we heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the remaining significance of LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="533">LIGO is a completely new way to explore the Alls as it has never been possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to the space and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in all we can -- virtually or fundamentally -- not see.</seg>
<seg id="536">"a supernova, for example. I would like to know why mashed star in super-novae explode."</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we have learned a lot about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">"however, the exciting physical processes happen at the core, which lies behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon."</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never go through because these opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gravitational waves penetrate iron, as if it would be more transparent glass. I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it as the Urbang is covered by its own messenger."</seg>
<seg id="541">Using gravity waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">"and most importantly: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen, that we never seen before, and of whom we have never seen any idea. things we just discover by hearing."</seg>
<seg id="543">"in fact, LIGO found equal in the first circulation of things that we did not expect."</seg>
<seg id="544">"my colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO project, says to this topic: me: the kind of stars that emerged black holes, like LIGO them, are the dinosaurs of the universe."</seg>
<seg id="545">"they are enormous, ancient bodies of prehistoric times. the black holes are the sauce for our archaeological work."</seg>
<seg id="546">"LIGO allows us to have a completely different perspective on events in space, on the origin of the stars and ultimately also on how we went out of this chaos."</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is now to be as bold as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">"thanks to LIGO we know how to build great detectors, and the noise and circulation of the cosmos."</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be nicer than the jungle?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>

<seg id="563">"and a crazy thing happened: exactly what to do, wovor I feared, removal my fear."</seg>
<seg id="564">"my fear, speeches to keep, my social fear -- Puff, away."</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of one word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"" "yes, my life has changed."</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes, changed me."</seg>
<seg id="568">"but there was a certain Yes, which my life changed deeply, to an unexpected art. it started with a question of my youngest."</seg>
<seg id="569">"I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the youngest, calls for inexplicable reasons all" treasures "</seg>

<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">"a new attitude to my family. from there I swallowed me to play with them once you do so. no matter what I am doing, or where I go, I say always Yes -- every single time."</seg>
<seg id="575">"almost. I am not perfect, but I am trying."</seg>
<seg id="576">"it has a magical effect on me, on my children, to our family."</seg>
<seg id="577">"but it also has an amazing side-effect: only recently, I was actually completely understood that the" "Yes" "to play my career with my children."</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a true dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am author. I think things out of bringing you to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create television. I have produced television.</seg>
<seg id="585">"I do television, in a great style."</seg>
<seg id="586">"in this TV season, I am responsible for spending 70 hours of program into the world."</seg>
<seg id="587">"four television programs, 70 hours TV. three to four shows are simultaneously in production."</seg>
<seg id="588">"each shipment provides hundreds of jobs, which previously did not exist."</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV channel can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">We say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">"a new episode all nine days times four shows, so all nine days 20 million dollars television, four TV programs, three episodes: scandal, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours TV,"</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for one season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my television series are running each other on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">Around the world my series are running in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million spectators.</seg>
<seg id="595">"my brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV broadcasts are shipments which I myself create, and not only produced, so I have to find time, really silent, creative time to gather my fans at the campfire and to tell my stories."</seg>
<seg id="596">"four television series, 70 hours television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfire that burn around the world."</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who this still makes?</seg>
<seg id="598">"no one, therefore I am a Titan."</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I would not like to impress you with that.</seg>
<seg id="601">"I say it, because I know what you think when the word" author falls. "</seg>
<seg id="602">"I say it to you all of you who work so hard if you do a company, a country or a household, take me seriously if I say I am not only on the computer around you, and it's true when I say, I understand that it does not work with a dream job."</seg>
<seg id="603">"it's all a job, all work, everything reality, all blood, everything sweat -- no tears."</seg>
<seg id="604">"I'm working a lot, hard and I love it."</seg>
<seg id="605">"when I am deepened into the work, there is no other feeling."</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a land out of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">"it is, when asked me troops on a canvas."</seg>
<seg id="608">"as noted, one has a high sound, delivered a marathon."</seg>
<seg id="609">It feels like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">"it is creative, mechanically, tiring and intoxicating, funny and cruising, cruel and sensible, cruel and reasonable. and the best thing about it is the buzz."</seg>
<seg id="613">There is so a change in me when the work is fine.</seg>
<seg id="614">"a buzz begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the sums sounds like a busy road, I could always drive on her."</seg>
<seg id="615">"many people will take when I tell them the sums, I am writing, that writing my joy."</seg>
<seg id="616">Understand me not wrong that does it.</seg>
<seg id="617">"but the sums -- as I began with the television production, when I began to work and work, build, build and co-working, I discovered this thing, this sums, this energy. the buzz!"</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums is action and activity. the sums is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sums is music. the sums is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The sum is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">"and if you have such a buzz, then you can not strive differently than after size."</seg>
<seg id="623">"the feeling that can not be different to strive for size, no matter what price."</seg>
<seg id="624">This is what you call the sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it means a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Maybe it is called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Maybe it is called ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Maybe it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I do not know.</seg>
<seg id="630">"I just know that I am not for failure, and I just know that I love the sums I love."</seg>
<seg id="631">"I will only say to you, I am a Titan, and I know that I will not ask it."</seg>
<seg id="632">"to make a clear: the more successful I will, the more episodes, the more hibernation, the more work there are, the more things I see, the more I write history, the more expectations exist."</seg>
<seg id="633">"the more I work to be successful, the more it has to work."</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">"I love work, not true?"</seg>
<seg id="636">"the country, which I inherited, the marathon, I walk, the army, the screen, the high sound, the sums, the sums, the sums."</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sums. I love the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only this sum?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then stops the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="641">"revised, exaggerated, exaggerated, replaced."</seg>
<seg id="642">The sum stops.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that her mom is a single workday.</seg>
<seg id="644">"Harper tells people:" my mom will not be there, but you can write to my Fanny. "</seg>
<seg id="645">"and Emerson says," Close, I want to go to Shonda country. "</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of a titanium.</seg>
<seg id="647">You are baby-Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">"they were 12, 3 and 1, when the sums were heard."</seg>
<seg id="649">The sum of the engine is petrified.</seg>
<seg id="650">I loved my job no more. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The buzz came not back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sums was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">"I made the same things as ever: the same title work, 15 hours-days, through weekends, no repentance, nothing delegating, a titsleeps, does not exist, with all my heart, clear eyes, whatever."</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sums.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">"four television programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously, sometimes four."</seg>
<seg id="657">"four television programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously..."</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">"I was a pre-show-Titan,"</seg>
<seg id="660">"everything was gray, I just had no fun anymore."</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the buzz and the sums I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">"so what do you do if that, what you do, the work you love, suddenly fade?"</seg>
<seg id="665">"I know some may think:" "Heul you out, silly the author Titan."</seg>
<seg id="666">"but you know you do it, you do what you do, one loves to be a painter, a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, you just loves another and that gives one of the sums you knew when the buzz stops, who is one then?"</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">"when the song ends my heart, I can survive in silence?"</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern states-waitress" is a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"I am on the way out, late and she says," Mama, magic you play? "</seg>
<seg id="673">"and I will already say no, when I become aware of two things:"</seg>
<seg id="674">"first, I must say yes to everything and secondly, they called me not."</seg>
<seg id="675">They do not call anyone more "shooters."</seg>
<seg id="676">When does this happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">"I pale, when I am Titan I and my buzz, and here everything changes before my own eyes."</seg>
<seg id="678">"and so she says," Mama, magic you play? "</seg>
<seg id="679">"and I say," yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="680">This is nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="681">"we play and her Sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read all dramatically from the book" "Everybody Poops". ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">"but it is outstanding, because my ache and my panic, in loneliness and in the absence of the suming, I cannot do anything except for."</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focussed.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am silent.</seg>
<seg id="686">"the country, which I inherited, the marathon, I walk, the army, the canvas, the high sound - they no longer exist anymore."</seg>
<seg id="687">"all that exists are sticky fingers and moist kisses, zarte voices, wax, and the song, in which there is something to let go, or whatever the girl in" "The Eislingen". ""</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so short that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of work.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me is solves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes up and an energy path comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">"and that is not immediately, but it happens."</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums come slowly back.</seg>
<seg id="698">"no full volume, hardly there, it is silent, hardly audible, but it is there."</seg>
<seg id="699">"not the sums, but a buzz."</seg>
<seg id="700">"and now I feel, when I would know a magical secret."</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that is all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something that we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">"the sums, the labour consumption, the titanium-sum, this is only the replacement."</seg>
<seg id="706">"if I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am when I am describing using shipments and TV hours and how functioning my brain, then I forgot what the real sums is."</seg>
<seg id="707">The buzz is not a force and it is not working-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It is dependent on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sums is dependent upon the love.</seg>
<seg id="710">"the sums is the flow, who comes from life."</seg>
<seg id="711">True sums is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">"the real sums ignores the pressure of history, the tasks to be done, the expectation and the pressure."</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sums is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">"the real sums is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps whispered to me the wrong words, for what God said to me, that I am a Titan I?"</seg>
<seg id="715">It is simply Love.</seg>
<seg id="716">"we all need a bit more love, much more love."</seg>
<seg id="717">"once my child wants to play with me, I will say yes."</seg>
<seg id="718">"I make this a rule, so that I can free myself as a workaholic of any guilt."</seg>
<seg id="719">"it is law, I have no other choice. I have no other choice if I want to hear the sums again."</seg>
<seg id="720">"I wish it would be as easy. I am not good in playing, I don't like it."</seg>
<seg id="721">"play not to me, how to work."</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth does hurt;</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like it to play.</seg>
<seg id="724">"I am always working, because I love it."</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer to feel at home in the workplace.</seg>
<seg id="726">"this confession is painful, because what a person would rather work than to be home?"</seg>
<seg id="727">"well, I."</seg>
<seg id="728">"time honest, I call myself" Titan. "</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>

<seg id="731">"we rasen in the garden around, before and back, round, and forth."</seg>
<seg id="732">"we make small dance parties,"</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play Ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We crush soap-blows.</seg>
<seg id="735">"in doing so, I feel mostly stiff, absent and confused."</seg>
<seg id="736">I always ask for my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">"my children show me how to live, and the sums of the universe met me."</seg>
<seg id="739">"I play and play, until I ask myself: why have we ever stopped with the games?"</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also say it! they always say yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">"maybe you hold me for naive, for a meeting room."</seg>
<seg id="742">Probably you are right but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And you also know why? you are not Rihanna or a Muppet-Show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">"my little ones want to play a maximum of 15 minutes with me, up to them, that they want to make something different."</seg>
<seg id="748">"it is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes."</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes I replaced a Marienkle or Kek.</seg>
<seg id="750">"and, my teen-daughter whole 15 minutes long with me, I am mother of the year."</seg>
<seg id="751">"there are only 15 minutes, more does not need it."</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can bring 15 minutes to the piece even on a bad mood day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes on the piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">"no mobile, no laundry, no distraction."</seg>
<seg id="755">"the day is short: dinner, the children are ready."</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are inside!</seg>
<seg id="757">"my children are my well-feeling, my world. it does not have to be the children. it is to feel the sums have to feel a place for his soul."</seg>
<seg id="758">It is not about playing with your own children. it is about joy.</seg>
<seg id="759">In general the "play" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Get the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you do well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find it out and keep it out.</seg>
<seg id="763">"I am not perfect in it. I fail and I victories. friends meet, books, enjoy the day --"</seg>
<seg id="764">"want to play?" stands for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in the apprenticeship, when I wanted to meet myself more and more. "</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes in the piece why do not get full 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can it be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The buzz came back in my spare time. the buzz seems to return if I am not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working not without playing.</seg>
<seg id="769">"it takes time, but after a few months opens a door, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office. I listen to new ideas. I get back to new ideas. I use it to full ps and love my job again."</seg>
<seg id="770">"I like the sums, but I do not love it."</seg>
<seg id="771">I do not need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the buzz, the sums is not me... not anymore. "</seg>
<seg id="773">"soap, and sticky fingers, dinner with friends."</seg>

<seg id="778">"I snail, that I am a Titan I have never seen a Titan, the journey to Jerusalem."</seg>

<seg id="786">"the more I feel this sums, the more this unusual, beaming, naked and new feeling of life in me wide. less Titan -- more I!"</seg>
<seg id="787">"the more I feel exactly this sums, the more I know who I am."</seg>
<seg id="788">I am author. I think things I go to life.</seg>
<seg id="789">"this belongs to the job, which means to live his dream."</seg>
<seg id="790">"this is the dream of this job,"</seg>
<seg id="791">For a dreamjob should be a little dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">I said 'Yes' to less work and to more games.</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thanks beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues every day I have to do with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">"I know how to change your life from one second to the other, after a serious stroke or an automobile accident."</seg>
<seg id="799">"for us neurosurgeon is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, a very low ability to self-healing."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after a severe violation of the central nervous system, patients often have a consistent, serious disability."</seg>
<seg id="801">That is probably the reason why I have been working neurossurgeries.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functioning neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve nerve functions through various surgical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="804">"surely they have heard of one of the most known, the" deep-terrestrial stimulation. "thereby, one implanted one electrode deeply in the brain to influence the circuits of the neurons so that the neurological function is improved."</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's patients who suffered severe citations and heavy pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation does not mean Neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream functional neurosurgeon is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">With a little help the brain can help themselves.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was leading Oberphysician and worked day and night in the emergency.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I receive patients with cranial-shepherd trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">You have to imagine that at skulum brain-traumata the brain can cry and the skull pressure.</seg>
<seg id="815">"to save life, you have to diminish the skull pressure."</seg>
<seg id="816">"however, one must sometimes remove a part in the brain."</seg>
<seg id="817">"instead of throwing the braene brain mass, we decided to analyze with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, an biologist, to analyze the brain."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">"cells of a tissue, can grow, is comparable with quite small children that will be taken out of your families."</seg>
<seg id="822">"you have to find the right diet, temperature, moisture and the environments to thrive."</seg>
<seg id="823">This is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">For many verses there were Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">This was what he saw under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">It was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked like a stem cell culture. with large green cells, which are surrounded by small, unmature cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you are still aware of the biogas-lessons that stem cells are unripe cells that can transform themselves into each cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain has tribal cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niche of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of brain mass in the OP.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made a further fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die; they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells stopped different.</seg>
<seg id="835">They went up slowly and after a couple of weeks she died even.</seg>
<seg id="836">"so we saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like a stem cell, but was different."</seg>
<seg id="837">"we needed long to understand, where they came."</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells hot Doublecorine-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our grandparents cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">"at the stage of the fetus, they ensure the cause of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they remain with us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">"we believe that they take part in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries."</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so secure.</seg>
<seg id="848">But one thing is clear - from these cells we got our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">"in front of a potential cell of cell, the brain is possible."</seg>
<seg id="850">This is what we had to prove.</seg>
<seg id="851">"so, we decided to develop an experiment."</seg>
<seg id="852">"we wanted to see a piece of brain mass from the non-language area, and then the cells have to cultivate exactly as it did Jean-François."</seg>
<seg id="853">And they afterwards highlight them in order to be able to follow them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step we reimated them at the dehydration of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologist transplant -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we irritate these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we have the same cells in counterfeit brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we were able to work with monkey.</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario we traveled the cells in a healthy brain, and we observed that they had completely disappeared after a few weeks, as if they were taken back home. the room is already occupied, so they will not disappear there, so they disappear."</seg>
<seg id="859">"in the second scenario we put an injury to and reimpled precisely the same cells, and now the cells received -- they washed up to mature neurons."</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were ripped.</seg>
<seg id="862">"the evidence that they show are these small points. these are the cells that we were in vitro, in the culture."</seg>
<seg id="863">Here we could not stop.</seg>
<seg id="864">Help these cells even a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">"so, we practised monkeys with a manual depot."</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take the feed-pellets of a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made them very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">"when they had achieved a stable skill level, we have acquired the handmotoric cortex sector."</seg>
<seg id="869">"then the monkey were paralyzed, they could no longer move their hand."</seg>
<seg id="870">"just as it would happen with people, it's spontaneously, up to a certain degree, just like after a stroke."</seg>
<seg id="871">"the patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover with the help of plastificibrainmechanism. they recover at a certain degree, just as the monkey."</seg>
<seg id="872">"when we were sure that the monkey had reached the degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells."</seg>
<seg id="873">"on the left side they see the monkeys, which is spontaneously."</seg>
<seg id="874">It can bring about 40% to 50% of its original power from injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">"now, when we reimated the cells, the same monkey, two months after the maturity."</seg>
<seg id="877">"I can tell you, that was also very exciting results for us."</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and later use.</seg>
<seg id="880">"we can use them in other new ropathological models, for example in Parkinson."</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still always implant her to implant people.</seg>
<seg id="882">"I really hope that I can show you soon, how the human brain can show the means to heal themselves."</seg>

<seg id="884">"Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, which is wonderful, I am sure that now, several dozen people in the audience, perhaps even the majority, think:" I know someone who need it. "</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">"of course, the question of what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical studies on men."</seg>
<seg id="887">"Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results one must fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms, to pass these kinds of studies."</seg>
<seg id="888">"BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate etc."</seg>
<seg id="889">"JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and a nearly professional team."</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start the clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future as many years it will take until someone can get into hospital and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: this is difficult to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">"first, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial."</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it allow us the authority to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">"it needs a long time to select the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">"after that, one has to apply this to a multi-centric study."</seg>
<seg id="897">One has to really reconfirm that it is useful before you can offer this treatment everybody.</seg>
<seg id="898">"BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: natural."</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne thanks for your visit at TED and that you told us about it.</seg>

<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">"in the West, we in the West make a big mistake to consider it as natural."</seg>
<seg id="903">"we do not see democracy as the fragile plant that it is in reality, but as inventory of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as an unchangeable enemy.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">"Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and its big night in Beijing have no doubt demonstrated that it is quite possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="908">"indeed, democracy comes with us, in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">"at the beginning of the year, when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was made clear to me as a finance minister in the Eurogroup -- for me that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- not the austerity programs have to be realized in Greece."</seg>
<seg id="910">"at this moment I thought that there might be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my performances, told me that democracy would be abolished if they would change anything."</seg>
<seg id="911">"at this point, I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy."</seg>
<seg id="912">"I pray that Lee Kuan Yew believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup of an error, we could save the democracy, but that we need a truthful and defective democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"for without democracy our societies are in common, our future dull and our great, new technologies are wasted."</seg>
<seg id="914">"on the subject of waste, I would like to point out you on an interesting contradiction, which is currently being threatened by our economies."</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "twins summit paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">"a summit is known to you. you know and recognize him as the Schuldenberg, who throws its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="917">"we all recognise the Schuldenberg,"</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize its sceptre.</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of unused cash that belongs to the impending austerity and concert, however, there are too anxious to invest in where it would be productive and income, with which one needs to produce Schuldenberg and also all of things could urgently needed, for example" green "energy."</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"over the past 3 months have been invested in the US, in England and in the euro zone 3.4 BillionUS dollars, in all the prosperity of producing goods, machines, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, cars, and so on and so forth."</seg>
<seg id="922">"3,4 trillion dollars sounds according to a lot of money until one compares with the 5.5 BillionUS dollars, which were at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing did, except the stock market and the real estate prices."</seg>
<seg id="923">"thus debt and productive capital constitute the twin summit, which is not allocated by the usual market mechanism."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of 25-54 year-olds in the U.S., Japan and Europe, and consequently a low demand for investors who would not invest in which they would not be able to kill him, when he would kill him when he will grow,"</seg>
<seg id="925">"unsolollt the circumstances leads, which lead to it that Oedipus is kills him."</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my hadern with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"his extremely merwenderic Art. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, human talents, and especially all of the technologies," green "technologies that are crucial for saving the Earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">"I think already. but before we continue, what do we understand among democracy?"</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristoteles defined democracy as the social form in which the Free and the poor control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy ended naturally too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, foreigners, and of course slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">"however, it would be an error to minate the significance of the athic democracy due to these terms."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the decision on the athic democracy was and is that they gave the working arms, and not only the right to freedom of expression, but rather more important and decisive, which they entitled to give them the right to political codetermination with equal moods in questions of the government."</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy has not kept for a long time --</seg>
<seg id="936">"like a candle, which is very light shines, she is also fast faded."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, our liberal liberal democracies do not have their roots in the ancient Athens,"</seg>
<seg id="938">"but in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while Athenian democracy had concentrated on the free citizens and the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for ruling powers."</seg>
<seg id="940">"the liberal democracy was only possible when a complete separation of politics and economy is possible, and the democratic process in politics was possible, while the economy - thus the world of corporations -- a democratic zone was developed."</seg>
<seg id="941">"in our present democracies since the time, in which this division of politics and economy began, an unhereditary struggle between the two, and the economy gradually descended policy."</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why politicians are no longer like earlier?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not in a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"it is because it can be in the government nowadays and nevertheless, it is not in power because the power of politics in the economy is deed, and the areas are separated."</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hadern with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"if you think about it, it is about as such as a flock of carnivores, the so-lasting the animals, of which they nourished, decimated that they are starving at the end."</seg>
<seg id="947">"similarly, it is with the economy that the policy rises so far. the power of the corporations grows, political goods is rising, the overall economic demand falls and the managing director of the corporations are too frightened to invest the cash of their companies."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the more successful of capitalism to sells the" Demos "[the people] from democracy, the higher the Twin Towers, and the greater the waste of human labour-power and prosperity of humanity."</seg>
<seg id="949">"if this is true, it is obvious that we have to bring politics and the economy again, and it would be better if the" Demos "control, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="950">So this is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea ahead of 100 years ago and it wasn't quite fine.</seg>
<seg id="952">The teaching from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position as in the ancient Athens without new kinds of brutality and wastage.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: creating the poor arms!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism is doing it by replacing Niedrigwage employed by automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem here is, so long economy and politics are separate areas, automation of the Twin-summit will be higher, the wasted waste, and social conflicts more deeply, just as it -- already very soon as I think -- in countries such as China will come."</seg>
<seg id="956">"so we need to redesign the economy and re-unite the areas of economy and politics, and we pay attention to the reunited area, otherwise we end the film" matrix "as a documentation appear."</seg>
<seg id="957">"the question is not, whether capitalism has brought the technical achievements that it has brought forth, will --"</seg>
<seg id="958">"the interesting question is whether capitalism is similar to a Dystroscopy, similar to the" matrix "," in which machines serve the people and put their energy into the exploration of the universe, or into a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians "Agora," in long talks to the meaning of life. "</seg>
<seg id="959">I believe we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">"so what does it say, how could it look to have this" star Trek "" utopia instead of the "matrix" -like dystroscopy? "</seg>
<seg id="961">"in practical implementation, I would like to give you some examples."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the area of enterprises: ask yourself a capital market prior to which you deserve money, while you work and in which your capital follows you from a job to the next, and the company -- regardless of which one is currently working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income comes from capital and redeem and the concept of wage labor is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">"no distinction between those who belong to the company, but they do not work in it, and employees working there, but no exchange between capital and labour, no major gaps between investment and spar, and ultimately no emporraging twins summit."</seg>
<seg id="965">"in the field of global political economy: please make sure that our national currencies would have a freely fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which is issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest Swans]."</seg>
<seg id="966">"continue to be negotiated that the entire world trade in this currency will be traded -- we call it" "cosmos", "in the units of" Cosmos "-- and any government pays the sum that is equivalent to the trade deficit or the commercial surplus of the respective country into a common fund."</seg>
<seg id="967">"imagine that this fund has invested in" green "technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment is rar."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference from 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time you do not have the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"today, we have them, in particular against the background of a reunified policy and economy."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world that I describe to you is liberated, in which they preferred to privileged people, and Marxist, because they have buried the separation of capital and work in the sleeve of history, and keynesian, global keynesians."</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all others it is a world where we can imagine real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we fail to a "matrix" - similar dystroscopy?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we are making political decisions together.</seg>
<seg id="977">"it is in our hands, and we do it better democratic."</seg>
<seg id="978">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describable yourself in your biography itself as libertarian Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: when something of what I have just said is Marx relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">"the reason for the reunion of politics and economy... do not do this, technological development will generate such a massive decline in economic demand, which Larry Summers is called" long term stagnation. ""</seg>
<seg id="984">"through the transfer of this crisis from a part of the Earth to the next, as we're currently experiencing, it will not only destabilize our democracies but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low."</seg>
<seg id="985">"if this analysis is true, Marx is quite relevant,"</seg>
<seg id="986">"and as Hayek, that is why I am a libertary Marxist, and like Keynes, and that's why I am also completely wirr."</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: actually and now we are at ease.</seg>
<seg id="988">"YV: if one is not wirr, one does not think enough."</seg>
<seg id="989">"BG: this is a very Greek, kind philosophical declaration -- YV: actually it was Einstein that said this. BG: in your presentation, you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers, you have said very clearly what you think of the view of the West in China."</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the beginning of a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">"as I said in my lecture, we have limited the democracy to politics during the area where most of them plays, -- the area of economy -- a fully-free zone."</seg>
<seg id="994">"in some respects, if I may say that provocative, China now resembles the England of the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- do you remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- that is an error.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberals, like John Stuart Mill -- "</seg>
<seg id="997">"he was particularly skeptical, which affects democratic development."</seg>
<seg id="998">"what one can see in China now, resembles very the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second."</seg>
<seg id="999">"now China now throw to do what the West has done in the 19th century, smells from hypocrisy to hypocrisy."</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners curious about your experiences as financial minister of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I found that that comes.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later on the first half-year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">"YV: very exciting, from personal perspective, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to make a new start with the eurozone."</seg>
<seg id="1005">"not only Greece, but the eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1006">"namely, to say goodbye to the self-sufficiency, and the persistent abandonation that there was a massive suspect line through the eurozone and continues to massively threatened with the development of the entire European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1007">"we had the opportunity to be on the basis of the Greek proposal -- by the way, the first proposal was that this denial was revealed."</seg>
<seg id="1008">"it is correct to do. unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the European group, continues to denial."</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">"if one tries to receive a business system, which is not overviable, through political will and authoritarianism it will be able to delay it perhaps a while, but if changes occurs, he happens abrupt and destructive."</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you see ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future when we do not change their construction.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: do you have made any mistakes in your time as a financial minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- Ernest...</seg>
<seg id="1017">"if there is a finance minister or any Minister, who claims after 6 months in office, especially in such tense situation, claimed that he did not make any mistake, then this is a dangerous person."</seg>
<seg id="1018">"of course, I made mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest error was to sign the application for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">"I felt that there was an honest interest on the sides of the donors, a common solution."</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not.</seg>
<seg id="1022">"they merely wanted to bring our government to the case, only because they did not want to deal with the interruptions caused by the eurozone."</seg>
<seg id="1023">They did not want to admit that they have been a catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost a third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">There is worse than during the "Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="1026">"none of the troika creditors, who has imposed us this policy, and a" "this was a colossal mistake." ""</seg>

<seg id="1038">"by Roy Price most never heard, although he is likely to be held responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013."</seg>
<seg id="1039">"probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for many of you."</seg>
<seg id="1040">"this goes back to the decision, the Roy lasted three years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1041">"Roy Price is conductivity at Amazon Studios,"</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV-production facility of Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"he is 47 years old, slim, has a Igelato and describes himself on Twitter as" movies, TV, technique, Tacos. "</seg>
<seg id="1044">"Roy has a very important job, because he is responsible for doing the shows and the contents to produce the Amazon."</seg>
<seg id="1045">"of course, this is a very hard fighting industry."</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy does not choose any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">"he must find shows, which are very, very good."</seg>
<seg id="1048">"in other words, he must find shows that are on the right side of this curve."</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the evaluation of over 2500 TV series on the IMDB site. the rating is from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this review receive.</seg>
<seg id="1050">"will your show be rated with nine and higher, this is a winner."</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"these are shows how" breaking bath, "" Game of Thrones, "" The Wire "-- all the shows, addictive, where, after you have a season, your brain asks," Where is there more of these episodes? "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"on the left, here at this end, shows shows how" Toddlers and Tiaras "-- -- that should tell you enough what goes on at that end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1055">"Roy Price is not concerned to get on the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to submit" Toddlers and Tiaras. ""</seg>
<seg id="1056">"he turns out more thoughts on the middle detection, the average television -- the shows, which are neither good nor bad, they simply don't inspire."</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must ensure that he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">"the pressure is present, and of course it is the first time Amazon so something makes, therefore Roy Price doesn't want to risk."</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">"he needs guaranteed success, so he keeps a contest."</seg>
<seg id="1061">"he takes many ideas for TV shows and choosing eight candidates for TV shows, then he produced the first episode of each of these shows and presents them online where they can see each free of charge."</seg>
<seg id="1062">"and if Amazon is out of nothing things, one does it say right?"</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers look at these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">"however, they do not know that they will be observed at the check of these shows."</seg>
<seg id="1065">You will be observed by Roy and his team who are able to record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">"you comprehend how to start the show, when one fails, which parts one can skips or once again."</seg>
<seg id="1067">"you collect millions of data to decide with this data, which show they should produce."</seg>
<seg id="1068">"in fact, they collect the data, process these and it results in the answer, and this is:" Amazon should make a Sitcom about four Republican US Senators. "</seg>
<seg id="1069">They did this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Do someone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"yes," Alpha House, "but it seems that not many people remember this show because it was not so good."</seg>
<seg id="1072">"it is only an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7,4 and Alpha House, at 7,5 -- therefore something on average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked."</seg>
<seg id="1073">"about at the same time at another company, another manager has placed a top show by data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming of Netflix. just like Roy, he is always searching for this a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it different."</seg>
<seg id="1074">"instead of holding a contest, he and his team have the existing data on the Netflix spectators, so the reviews that they may give the shows, their shows they like etc."</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then use these data to find out these little details about the spectators: what shows they like what producers, which actors. "</seg>
<seg id="1076">"when they had all the parts together, they went a wagon and decided not to make a Sitcom over four senators, but a drama series about a senator."</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"yes," house of Cards ". Netflix thus has hit a hit, at least for the first two seasons."</seg>
<seg id="1079">House of Cards "gets a 9,1 review on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">"of course, is the question: what happened here?"</seg>
<seg id="1081">Man has two very commissions to diversified companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect with each other and it works great for one of them but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is it?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow says that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">"when you collects millions of data, for a decision that you meet, then you should have a good decision."</seg>
<seg id="1086">It has 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">You can optimised it by very powerful computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">"what you can expect is good TV, or?"</seg>
<seg id="1089">"if data analysis does not work, then this is something frightening because we live in a time where we live more and more to meet statistics in order to meet serious decisions, far beyond television."</seg>
<seg id="1090">Knows someone here the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">"nobody. OK, that is even good."</seg>
<seg id="1092">"multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that nobody in this room will ever come in touch with this software. come in touch, you are in prison."</seg>
<seg id="1093">"if someone is in prison in the USA and ask for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dismissal is made or not."</seg>
<seg id="1094">"just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of decide whether a show will be good or bad, the person will be good or bad."</seg>
<seg id="1095">"moderate television, 22 minutes, this can be really bad, but more years in prison are worse."</seg>
<seg id="1096">"unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,"</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always created the best results. this is not that a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data of sealed firms are still wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">"yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1100">"in 2009, Google announced that they can tell through data analysis outbreaks of flu, cheating way -- by data analysis of the Google research."</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation. success in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">"it worked fine, year round year, until it suddenly wasn't working anymore,"</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"it just didn't work, this was again a sensation, including the revocation of the publication in the magazine" Nature "." "</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data diversified companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">"despite all these errors, data flow in decisions of life a -- at work, in the law enforcement, in medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1107">"so, we should rather make sure that data are helpful."</seg>
<seg id="1108">"I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area, in which some very smart people unimaginable many data to make serious decisions, such as the decision for a cancer therapy"</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I realized some patterns over the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1110">"if you have to solve a complex problem, they do mostly do two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">"as a result, you place this problem in its parts, so that you can analyze the items; as a second, you put the items again to hold a decision."</seg>
<seg id="1112">"sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: apart and get together again."</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to crush a problem and understand its parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to merge the parts again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool and we all possess it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">"if there is something that is good in which the brain is good, it is parts and pieces come together again, even if the information is incomplete, in order to grasp a good dew -- particularly when it is the brain of a experts."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"therefore, I believe, Netflix was so successful because they used data and mind where they also go in the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"they use data to better understand their public, because they would not have been able to put all these parts again and make it a show like" House of Cards "," this was not in the data. "</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show which meant they went a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon however did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they used data to control all their decisions, first when they hit TV-ideas at first when they chose" "Alpha House" "as a Show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a safe decision because they could always say: "they say to us the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data are helpful for better choices, but I believe things wrong when data start to control our decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerfully they are, data are just a tool, and not to forget that this device is quite useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">"before there was data, this was the device for decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"it is also called" Magic 8 Ball "." it is amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or no-question you just need to shake the ball to get an answer. "most likely" -- exactly here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will end it later with a technology demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">"so far, I have made some decisions in my life until now I have to listen to the ball."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"but, as you know of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace it by something a lot of exposure, such as data analysis to make better decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic building.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"perhaps the ball is wiser and wiser and wiser. ultimately, it is possible to make decisions when we want to reach something extraordinary at the end of the right corner."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I feel this as a very heartening message that despite the great amount of data still pays out, decisions to meet, an expert in what you do, and risks."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"because in the end, it is not the data, but the risks, with which you land at the right end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thanks beautiful.</seg>
