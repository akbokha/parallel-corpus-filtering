Munich 1856 : four cards which change your view of the city
an Ir@@ ren @-@ An@@ st@@ alt which will meet young people today .
&quot; a pit set , where now for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel . &quot;
Klein@@ g@@ ärt@@ ner manage the present cause of farmers .
the oldest official card coin promotes exciting stories to days .
&quot; it is annoying , if maps are not up to date . &quot;
&quot; that knows everyone who had to go up , because the Auto @-@ Nav@@ i took place instead of a revers@@ al road a green meadow . &quot;
&quot; the historical maps of the digital Bayern es At@@ las@@ es , an offer of ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als in Bavaria , is anything but current - but therefore very enlight@@ ening . &quot;
especially when you compare them with current online cards .
then it becomes clear as the towns and communities in the spread @-@ area of the Mün@@ ch@@ ner Merk@@ ur has changed since the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria @-@ Atlas is a spl@@ ay@@ ment that you cannot realize as such .
&quot; in the great review map were performed for cities and municipalities in more detail maps , so @-@ called Ur@@ posi@@ tional sheets . &quot;
these were created according to the state of Bay@@ er@@ ischer administration between 18@@ 10 and 1864 and jump to the first Ver@@ messung .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leaders occupied Bavaria since the spring 1800 during the Second coalition of War with Austria .
Napoleon wished an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographic recording of Bay@@ ers in order - of course for military purposes .
&quot; even if the French troops have moved to the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville from 9 February 18@@ 01 , it was today &apos;s neighbours who created the idea of an area covering Bavaria card . &quot;
&quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max I@@ V. Joseph drove the project ahead , founded the &quot; top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bay@@ erische Council administration . &quot;
the Ur@@ posi@@ a sheet for Munich is from the year 1856 and is like all other on the website of the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Landes@@ bibliothek .
the comparison of fruits / Today is at the example of the provincial capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
&quot; an example of this is sub@@ s@@ end@@ ling , that appears in the map of 1856 still relatively isolated . &quot;
&quot; S@@ end@@ ling was announced 21 years after the map , so 1877 , as Mün@@ ch@@ ner district . &quot;
&quot; today , the shelter of the city is located in the middle of the city . &quot;
&quot; the houses of Unter@@ s@@ end@@ ling focus on 1856 along today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was only named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader of the Bav@@ arian farmer against Austria 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where today the West park is , you can &apos;t see anything but fields - at first glance : the Hin@@ d@@ o@@ omen appears a small dis@@ advant@@ aged card with doz@@ ens lines and numbers : handmade fl@@ ur@@ pieces from the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; urine &quot; &quot; from which the property tax was derived . &quot;
small plots do not occupy farmers today more - but small @-@ gar@@ dener of the plant &quot; Land in Sun . &quot;
a large green area is characterized north of the sub@@ s@@ end@@ ling .
&quot; the Ther@@ es@@ ien@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 was born in the October 19th century , was in the 19th century a meadow - and no concrete form . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine . &quot;
&quot; in the Ur@@ posi@@ tional sheet , one read in the area of today &apos;s A@@ u @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen not only the road name &quot; at Gast@@ eig &quot; or from the hill &quot; On the ventilation &quot; &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ strasse to em@@ bo@@ ve people with ins@@ anity . &quot;
there was 18@@ 58 / 59 the Mün@@ ch@@ ner District series &quot; On the Au@@ er Lü@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; from 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von G@@ ud@@ ges the institution - that psychiat@@ rist , which is associated with the death of King Ludwi@@ gs . &quot;
&quot; he was progressive for his time , and ended for example the Ank@@ kins of the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot;
&quot; he is also prohibited to use the personnel to apply violence against in@@ mates , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , Head of the Museum of Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who has worked for an exhibition with the An@@ st@@ alt . &quot;
&quot; for 280 patients had been first place , later was extended to 500 places . &quot;
at some point this capacity also no longer exist - the reason for the construction of the chal@@ k pen@@ it@@ ary in hair 1905 .
&quot; there has been the Is@@ ar @-@ Am@@ per @-@ Klin@@ gen@@ um Munich @-@ East , one of the largest psy@@ chi@@ atri@@ ces in Germany . &quot;
on the field of former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt we meet young people in Mün@@ ch@@ ner Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um .
the Order war@@ b the building complex 1920 and turned him into a teen@@ ager with training .
&quot; west is the football ground of the T@@ SV in East , eastern residential buildings of the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 we prepared the children &apos;s house &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bosco &quot; &quot; - an architectural approach to the origin of the ren@@ aica , which was destroyed during World War II during the Second World War . &quot;
&quot; the Marien@@ platz was at 1856 as &quot; &quot; main square &quot; , &quot; the department was called &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger alley . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a decisive change brought to the Second World War even in the heart of Munich .
the Bom@@ bs of Al@@ lies in December 1944 many holes in the city center .
a great stayed until today - at the Marien@@ hof .
&quot; the English Institute , small business buildings and a Gru@@ ft@@ kap@@ elle from the Middle Ages were once at the Marien@@ hof , where these days were the pros and the 5th April 2017 of the area for the second S @-@ Bahn track . &quot;
&quot; with the sli@@ der , the old Munich map can be compared to the a@@ erial photograph of today - and the hole in the Marien@@ hof . &quot;
citizenship group released travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association to promote colored people has issued a warning for colored people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i on the basis of discrimin@@ atory policy and rac@@ ist attacks .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory is to enter into force by the state of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which will bring special attention to 28 August 2017 , as a number of frag@@ mentary , racial @-@ based incident occurring recently in the entire state and here , it is said in the position of the group . &quot;
&quot; a recent resign@@ ed law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it difficult to gain discrimination , as well as the criminal authorities of the state , dis@@ proportion@@ ately the group to reveal the journey , the NA@@ AC@@ P . &quot;
they have violations of citizens &apos; rights that happen men .
&quot; they are hal@@ ted because of their skin colour , they are be@@ aten or killed , &quot; said the President of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , the K@@ ansas City Star . &quot;
&quot; we hear complaints in such an incidence , which we have not heard yet . &quot;
it is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the US .
&quot; the group zi@@ pped inci@@ dents such as rac@@ ist decay against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from T@@ ennes@@ see . &quot;
&quot; in fragile circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no more petrol during the journey through the state and was taken into cust@@ ody by the police of Mis@@ sour@@ i , without a crime . &quot;
&quot; the Council also points to a recent report by Mis@@ sour@@ i &apos;s office , which is shown that black drivers are raised in the state 75 percent more often than past@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; said Chapel . &quot;
people must be ready to bring to whether there are Kau@@ ds or to let the relatives know that they travel through the state .
&quot; Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 Hass@@ en@@ ings in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the Hass@@ an @-@ reference programme of the F@@ BI , which marks the state in relation to the number of such violations in the 16th place of the country . &quot;
the travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i Law which would make it more difficult to complain a company because of housing or employment discrimination .
&quot; previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union had published the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ ES ) voy@@ ages for Texas and Arizona , following the states of immigration laws which are committed to susp@@ ending people because of immigration violations , which is contributing to the AC@@ LU to further seg@@ reg@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; voy@@ ages are usually issued by the State Department for other countries , but in recent times , stakeholders have used the measure as a reaction to certain laws and trends within the United States . &quot;
dec@@ aun@@ ching project is elementary
the Fis@@ her@@ acher Wei@@ ler &apos;s project is a success project and will continue in the coming year .
the CD@@ U Par@@ ag@@ or@@ derly Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ovac have created a picture on site .
on the right @-@ mount of the family Schwen@@ de@@ mann met representatives of the Fis@@ her@@ acher CD@@ U @-@ town together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members .
&quot; Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann for first insights into its operation , in which he managed 55 hectares meadows and 40 hectares of forest , supplies 40 milk @-@ cows and as well as many young kittens . &quot;
the &quot; black @-@ milk &quot; is for him the alternative mark@@ eters for the milk of its cows , so Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
at the table of the holiday guests there will be a regional community .
&quot; as he is also the BL@@ H@@ V president of Fisch@@ erb@@ ach , he signed the Wei@@ er@@ aun@@ ching project as &quot; elementary important . &quot; &quot;
I can not manage such steep areas for such steep areas .
&quot; the green space for much work , much m@@ ute will be processed with the engine sound . &quot;
&quot; we have here with the conditions and to fight with the top@@ ography , &quot; stressed Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , he adopted the el@@ astic operation and managed to use this without chemical pesti@@ cides and fertili@@ zers , even if there is no bio @-@ operation . &quot;
&quot; for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; &quot; the Comm@@ une has recognised the importance of the litter project and is pleased with the leader . &quot;
&quot; at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are , farmers had to be supported . &quot;
I hope that the insur@@ rection of the areas could be moved out even a while .
&quot; the greatest treasure we have , are the people working in agriculture and make thoughts on how they continue their operation , &quot; said the mayor . &quot;
farmers are often in criticism for the promotion
&quot; in 2013 , a total of 25 plots were fenced in the year 2013 . &quot;
&quot; the disclosure of this area is 40 hectares , which may not be raised up to at least 2023 . &quot;
&quot; from the overall cost of 71 500 Euro , half of the leaders was funded , a quarter carried out the municipality of Fis@@ her@@ ah . &quot;
&quot; therefore , we left the farmers 12 610 Euro , which they had to invest in 16,@@ 2 kilometres of course . &quot;
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of f@@ ences , &quot; explained Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ovac stressed : &quot; &quot; you do not make a really good job , without farmers and landing . &quot;
also for Peter White stood firm : &quot; here the best food produced . &quot;
Land@@ sc@@ apes ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg allows the state promotion of past@@ ors .
the goal is the disclosure of the Black Forest .
prerequ@@ is@@ ites is the presence of one of the L@@ PR signed .
&quot; in addition , the current area should not be s@@ ep@@ tible ( Hang@@ ing over 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by the insur@@ rection . &quot;
&quot; for the fisher@@ man &apos;s Wei@@ ler project 2018 , there is currently the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build at almost 16 kilometers of fence . &quot;
&quot; the open @-@ level area corresponds to 35 hectares , the cost @-@ effective costs are at more than 112 000 Euros . &quot;
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tru@@ mp takes the Statue of Liberty
the safest sign of a regime Tran@@ sition is when they begin to att@@ acking the statues .
the Americans appreciate this as much as any other - hence the car@@ eless overthrow of Saddam H@@ uss@@ one at the Fir@@ dos square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tru@@ mp regime , knew certainly what he did when he took a symbolic dispute with Jim A@@ co@@ sta of CN@@ N about the proposals of Presidents for the dr@@ astic restriction of legal migration with the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to stay fair , Miller not access the statue itself . &quot;
a hor@@ de of boat @-@ owners and Liberty @-@ impor@@ ters would have noticed it when he did .
&quot; but he laid their significance in particular , and in particular the meaning that it was written , as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , its base was added . &quot;
&quot; when Miller im@@ min@@ ated A@@ co@@ sta : &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to go here on a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that the world is illuminated . &quot;
&quot; the poem , which you relate to which later was added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; Miller is correct , but as he formed it , it is not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is about contemporary reson@@ ance on the record words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state does not only invites any old immigrants , but the anger of the poor : &quot; thy fatigue , your arms , / thy dr@@ unk masses , which then longing , free to breathe , / the el@@ ending waste of your rich co@@ asts . &quot;
&quot; there was never a time when the &quot; &quot; king waste &quot; &quot; was better to see on our screen . &quot;
Miller engaged in liter@@ ary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Tru@@ mp@@ s USA .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural examination : it is indeed a conflict in the significance of America .
Lazarus - and their friends who continued to place their words after their death at the base - did very good that they did a highly @-@ political act .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American Republi@@ can@@ ism by demonstrating in an un@@ used classical image of the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in their poem the female figure is no longer abstract - it has received a voice .
and she gives herself a completely different name : mother of ex@@ iled .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist cou@@ p and a devast@@ ating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
&quot; and just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , the people wanted to move from the right wing for a long time . &quot;
&quot; the great cry of Rus@@ h Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of Johannes of the dec@@ eption for the coming of Tru@@ mp , argu@@ ed that the Statue of Liberty is no one , but rather an early ne@@ o@@ conserv@@ atives that bring the American flame into the reverse world : &quot; Lady Liberty goes forward . &quot;
it is supposed to carry the flow of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world .
F@@ ack@@ el is not supposed to shine with the way into the United States . &quot;
rather unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh here on something stolen .
the significance of the statue is quite and even a question of the point of perception .
&quot; the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus consisted in it to see how they were seen from the de@@ pl@@ uck , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible trips have been seen on the de@@ cks of ships . &quot;
&quot; it is in the tru@@ est sense of seeing the world from the perspective of people , finding the refu@@ ge and a chance to improve their lives . &quot;
their statue talks to them the words of hope and the welcome they must listen .
and of course this is not the perspective that Miller and Tru@@ mp ever want to recognize .
&quot; her F@@ ack@@ el is not supposed to shine with the way , but the hat@@ red , which is the only source of power , ign@@ ite . &quot;
world Championships 2017 : N@@ eil Black lo@@ ys Scottish members of the team of Great Britain
E@@ ili@@ ie Do@@ yle is remin@@ is@@ cent of a time when only two guns were belonging to the team of Great Britain
&quot; the performance director of the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ k@@ ick@@ y cont@@ ingent of the world championship team will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
&quot; a record number of Scottish Ath@@ l@@ eten was selected for London 2017 , which will start Friday . &quot;
&quot; Black believes that &quot; &quot; in Scotland has developed some special &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the UK has to learn something from it . &quot;
&quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it , and we will proceed until we will find it out , &quot; said Black . &quot;
I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type at the street corner .
&quot; whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
&quot; several of the Scottish Ath@@ l@@ eten are medals @-@ candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - which were forced against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m distance , while E@@ ili@@ ie Do@@ yle was elected from the crew to the team captain . &quot;
&quot; E@@ ili@@ dh is rather modest .
&quot; their captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; says Black . &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were sho@@ ot@@ tish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot;
&quot; the passion and the genuine feeling that E@@ ili@@ ie made quite naturally , were great . &quot;
&quot; the Commonwealth of Silver Medal , which is at its fifth world championship in the 400 @-@ m hur@@ dles , says that it is &quot; unbelievable , &quot; that 16 vill@@ i are in the British team . &quot;
&quot; Scotland &apos;s largest total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 . &quot;
the mid@@ stream mu@@ ir leads on this way and has set up five British and two European records in the past year .
&quot; it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 metres . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , which runs 1,500 m is another shot , which one should be included after a great season that were included the victory at the British team tri@@ as and the Anniversary Games . &quot;
Do@@ yle is remin@@ is@@ cent of her first world championship as the only other fl@@ aw in the team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell was .
&quot; the Mann@@ ees captain in says that she is &quot; huge proud &quot; to the fact that many of their land@@ men are not only to the team , but in some cases even with the medals and in the fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; the special thing to be a team captain is in it that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so it was anyway a great honour , but knowing that my team mates voted for me and chose to have something very special for me , &quot; she added . &quot;
&quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the r@@ ots who belong to the team . &quot;
it shows only how far we got .
&quot; and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to rise to po@@ e@@ dies . &quot;
what my speech is concerned as capit@@ ulation ?
&quot; yes , I think it went well . &quot;
just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
&quot; so it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from it , that we are back at the Olympi@@ astadi@@ on . &quot;
&quot; I get a second chance to go there and compete , and it will just be such a great atmosphere there outside . &quot;
blocking of critics about Facebook : add you not to a public post if you cannot bear the hei@@ men of voters .
the father of our land knew something from bad press .
&quot; the Americans loved George Washington , but it didn &apos;t last long until they sm@@ ote him because of all , from inner policy up to its political principles . &quot;
he im@@ min@@ ed in criticism of criticism .
but he did not put his critics in silence .
&quot; for in 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and m@@ ute , we shall take the sheep to battles . &quot;
&quot; that brings me to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry H@@ og@@ an who has to work on it , to be more like Washington . &quot;
Ho@@ gans employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on its official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union promised him this week at the beginning of this week .
&quot; the st@@ ab of the govern@@ ors set the law@@ suit as fri@@ v@@ ol , and the online comment was full of an intercom with &quot; &quot; Na , and ? . &quot;
&quot; it is only fac@@ ebook , &quot; &quot; said many people . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important if it is a type like h@@ og@@ an .
&quot; this is a republi@@ cans governor in a overwhelming democratic state , which is amazing . &quot;
he has the final approval of the 50 Govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a reactionary heat @-@ head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to principles .
he was also very sent to use Facebook as a primary remedy to connect to his voters and to strip his ha@@ iry head after chemotherapy on his side .
&quot; therefore , the block@@ age of persons who come on the side of the Govern@@ ors - which is a public forum , which is officially designated as officially and by employees working with public tax Dollars - need@@ less and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gans spokes@@ man Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse defended the actions of the Govern@@ ors and argu@@ ed that the block@@ age of the comments is nothing more than a moder@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; but it is too easy to use the image of tro@@ ll@@ es or sp@@ amm@@ ers or h@@ asser@@ ted people , which is online the wh@@ ip . &quot;
&quot; the post office spoke to some of the real people , which were blocked by H@@ og@@ an . &quot;
&quot; and these are only real people who speak with their chosen leaders : a teacher , an ent@@ repr@@ en@@ eur and a pastor , no tro@@ lls . &quot;
&quot; they all said that their comments are respectful , thought@@ fully and not prof@@ ited . &quot;
the priest quoted the Bible in his post and app@@ alled to Ho@@ gans Catholic faith .
&quot; lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not h@@ asser@@ ie filled , but she asked for Hass@@ an . &quot;
&quot; I commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate @-@ breaking and other current news , &quot; &quot; wrote them in the commentary section of the post @-@ law &quot; &quot; The Post . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea if a number of people takes place on the same issue , then they are not considered a so @-@ called collective use and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; what the employees of the Govern@@ ors were signed as &quot; &quot; spam attack &quot; , &quot; other probably would be &quot; &quot; inter@@ c@@ ession &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Facebook era makes it simple , cut a message by simply blocked a crime or deleted a negative comment . &quot;
&quot; it is a lot of cleaner than in former times when you have done the same that staff were de@@ sand@@ ed to collect and burn newspapers with critical leadership articles and to burn or demonstr@@ ators , and to silence . &quot;
but that is exactly what happened digit@@ ally .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public official which is cri@@ tici@@ zed for it that he has accused Facebook and other social media .
President Tru@@ mp is operated by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question fell last week in Virginia .
&quot; the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County glori@@ fied the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. District Court James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when she had a voters on her Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; and in K@@ entu@@ cky , governor of the AC@@ ES received a visit from the AC@@ ES because of its use of Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
this should not be as difficult .
at the time Washington tons had a similar effect on the internet .
&quot; the number of newspapers multip@@ lied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous wall@@ et sw@@ allow for his leadership . &quot;
and even at that time Washington had anonymous tro@@ lls .
&quot; the people , the pseud@@ ony@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers who made Washington &apos;s decisions . &quot;
&quot; petition that cri@@ tici@@ zed his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with the UK to critic@@ ised his office , according to the historical documents which were collected by the Online Pap@@ ers of George Washington Project . &quot;
but he has not brought her to silence .
freedom of speech , dis@@ agreements and disco@@ urses belong to the basis of our nation . &quot;
and true leadership means that accept .
Ron@@ an Raf@@ fer@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort at the Renaissance club
&quot; the former Europeans n ° 1 Ron@@ an Raf@@ fer@@ ty will hope for the next three days at home comfort , as the Renaissance club hosted the Scottish Senior Open in the next three days . &quot;
&quot; the Nor@@ di@@ re , who lost next year in the Ar@@ cher@@ field links to final dogs , before it lost against Paul E@@ ales , is associated with the new Australia &apos;s name and acts as a tournament message in the name of the association &apos;s founder and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot;
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he reaches its glory with this event , &quot; said Raf@@ fer@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; players will see this course from his best side , he is in a great condition . &quot;
Jerry made a great job when he set this place .
he is a ei@@ ving pro@@ pon@@ ent of this game and is proud of its performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
&quot; the German E@@ ales is looking forward to defend the championship for the first time , although he won a career in his 32 @-@ year career at the European tour as well as at the European Challenge Tour . &quot;
&quot; it really feels particularly true , &quot; said the in South@@ port , he said . &quot;
&quot; I did not defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open since it was in the year , after I had won them out of the program . &quot;
back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; the memories come back from the last year , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on , last year here . &quot;
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate .
&quot; Gary Or@@ r , who went after his 50@@ th birthday earlier this year the European Senior Tour came back to the action on home . &quot;
this event will be his first sham@@ eful appearance since the Aber@@ de@@ en Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more if you play at home , &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh &amp; nbsp ; &quot;
&quot; you want to make it well , but you also feel this extra pressure . &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf course .
I am glad how it has gone .
&quot; with the trio at the field , the former Masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and the Senior Major Champions Paul Bro@@ adh@@ ur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ inth . &quot;
&quot; Or@@ r and the former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce belong to the six sc@@ ots on the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dru@@ m@@ mond . &quot;
&quot; the entrance is free , the parking lot is £ 5 per car with a terrace and £ 10 per car with two or more in@@ mates . &quot;
all proceeds to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
lower pul@@ mon@@ ary st@@ aves through passi@@ v@@ aul@@ ts
over the past two decades fewer people have died due to passi@@ vity in lung cancer .
the scientists of the University of the University of Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ ke ) conducted in a study .
&quot; according to our estimates a year of 167 lung cancer is attri@@ but@@ able to passi@@ v@@ aul@@ ts , &quot; &quot; said Study Hei@@ ko B@@ echer . &quot;
&quot; as a comparison , he moved to his own study on this subject of 1994 . &quot;
at that time there are still 400 lung cancer for passi@@ vity of passi@@ vity per year in Germany .

Haus@@ sman prove to be very complex
&quot; construction works in the Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &apos; are less in time , &quot; thus the director of the Bau@@ haus Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; in the area of Haus@@ smann , the situation is more complicated than suspected , since the underground is much inter@@ c@@ ept@@ ed , which cannot be noted in the plans . &quot;
&quot; the traffic , which again and again the construction work , represents for the construction up@@ p of the company St@@ ump@@ p a big problem . &quot;
&quot; the ignorance of the mot@@ orists before red lights and se@@ ag@@ it@@ ters is already enormous , &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot;
the road is locked and only the buses are eligible for passage .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z by the company St@@ ump@@ p have been busy with working on the bridge for weeks . &quot;
&quot; the hot days were already very exhau@@ sting .
&quot; but luckily we were supplied by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water , &quot; tells Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z . &quot;
poverty and death in the Indon@@ esian Gold@@ land

it even uses a pot for a pot .
&quot; in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ ent@@ age in the un@@ quiet Indon@@ esian province Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife is normally called a sweet potato - locally as &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace . &quot;
&quot; after half an hour , the c@@ anned ch@@ olle is taken with ei@@ ving , un@@ washed hands and charges . &quot;
Deg@@ ree sits on the mud that - she has no furniture - where they also performs their daily work for example clothes with clou@@ dy water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bu@@ cket in a homeless room serves as a lat@@ ors .
as the youngest of the four wives of their man they were not al@@ located .
Poly@@ gam@@ y is here usual .
&quot; of course , late to work can be dangerous : most of the village men are unemployed , and many are heavy , and there are the soldiers here . &quot;
&quot; no one says it , after 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; says she says . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into the daily life in the highlands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was taken in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,0@@ 26 El@@ ders should vote against the occup@@ ying forces . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement , which extends to the independence of the Dutch rule , turned out quickly against the government of Jak@@ arta , which holds the control of the region and closes foreign journalists or right @-@ observations of it . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , the province officially became divided into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , whereby the independent part of Pap@@ ua @-@ Neu@@ gu@@ ine@@ as was the eastern part of the island . &quot;
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as secluded as it is . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the car .
there are no public transportation .
&quot; the city with approximately 19.@@ 000 inhabitants is composed of wooden houses , which are surrounded by bamboo , and out of Well@@ bl@@ ech@@ et@@ ops that were converted by r@@ ust in different yellow @-@ brown . &quot;
&quot; very few Indon@@ esian have made their journey here , as journalists and practically no foreig@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; before Christian mission@@ aries , the Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans came to a God called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee . &quot;
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wear these clothes , &quot; says Deg@@ ree and points on their bust@@ ling , hand @-@ loving Tur@@ ban , her dar@@ ker shirts and their bright rock . &quot;
&quot; before , we only had sheets on our bodies . &quot;
&quot; Pap@@ ua is the Indon@@ esian province , where 28 % of men live under the poverty line and some of the worst children &apos;s mort@@ ality and alphab@@ eti@@ zation in Asia . &quot;
but it is also Indon@@ esian Gold@@ land .
&quot; the largest and profitable gold mine of the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a strongh@@ old in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort has built gold and copper only in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Pap@@ ua has been valued at the value of estimated 78 billion US dollars . &quot;
&quot; however , these rich@@ es are a source of misery for the Pap@@ ua who assure that Indon@@ esian iens is kept a sti@@ cking presence . &quot;
&quot; a study of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort has paid local dairy and units between 1998 and 2004 nearly 20 million US dollars , including up to 150,000 US dollars at a single officers . &quot;
Pap@@ u@@ anian demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten this golden g@@ ans and will not be treated mer@@ ci@@ pl@@ ess .
&quot; according to the activists , more than 500,000 papers have been killed and thousands have been for@@ ated by the Indon@@ esian military since 1969 , tor@@ tured and det@@ ained . &quot;
mass@@ acres in Pap@@ u@@ as stem cell @-@ rise in 1970 @-@ 12 years were made in accordance with the Asia human rights Commission for genocide .
in the region alone the Indon@@ esian police last year had more than 3.@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; we al@@ ign Every@@ thing &quot; means in a report by the arch@@ dioc@@ ese Bris@@ bane from the year 2016 , in which reports about atro@@ cities of the previous year are , such as un@@ law@@ ful exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electric charges are especially popular - and the brutal ra@@ inf@@ all of peace demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims as each week will happen , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; the bol@@ ts have increased , since Pap@@ u@@ as resources have a influ@@ x of settlers from other parts of Indonesia . &quot;
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demo@@ graphic development is changing , since Muslim economic migrants are changing from the popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i . &quot;

local people fight for you here .
&quot; the migrants have begun to sell chickens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local pap@@ ua for sale , &quot; explains A@@ beth You , a 24 @-@ year pan@@ i@@ ai aqu@@ a local , which moved into the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot;
it has the native Pap@@ ua - the Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; from Pap@@ ua - their market costs .
&quot; the Indon@@ esian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , known in folk and as Jo@@ kow@@ i , spoke during his election campaign in 2014 to address the ine@@ qualities and legal violations in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
the former carp@@ enter 27 of the total 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
&quot; but in Pap@@ ua has changed little , and today the locals feel che@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; our hearts are broken because we voted 2014 for Jo@@ kow@@ i , with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that the justice will be restored , &quot; says You . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai actually suffered two months after Jo@@ kow@@ is Initi@@ ation in October a low point . &quot;
on 7 December 2014 a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas songs in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali as two Indon@@ esian soldiers on a motorcycle by the darkness .
the sc@@ iss@@ ful children told them that they should turn their head@@ lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers took the impetus to her sound and later came back with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers who had dr@@ unk , and sm@@ ote the group with their ro@@ dent , said victims and witnesses . &quot;
then mo@@ ist one of the soldiers into the group of children .
&quot; a child , the 16 @-@ year Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so hard be@@ aten that he fell into the com@@ a . &quot;
a few hours later the building of the nearby government Commission was set up and the things escal@@ ated on the next day .
&quot; about 1,000 young pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered together on a football ground before the local police station and the military service center to demand justice . &quot;
they carried out cerem@@ onial hunting and led the Wa@@ ita dance - in the circle continuously and a bir@@ ch@@ ang im@@ iti@@ sing - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ trunk .
some demonstr@@ ators began to wear stones on police and military post .
&quot; when the mood was heated , the soldiers was sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses had more than three times , she shoot it dead , &quot; says it in an official document of T@@ IME , which has not been released in the local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego Kot@@ o @-@ district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the dro@@ pping danger and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home . &quot;
nobody was listening to the mood .
&quot; when I revol@@ ved , I was suddenly shot in my lin@@ kes hand@@ wr@@ ist , &quot; he said T@@ IME on the veranda of his colorful @-@ painted wood@@ house . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ ame knows still not who has folded , but says that the ball from the rows of the soldiers gathered themselves together . &quot;
&quot; it was over@@ crowded , many shots have been filmed , &quot; adds . &quot;
&quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin was the witness of the sho@@ ots . &quot;
&quot; I burned to him and sought his body to make sure he was , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who like many Indon@@ esian is only one name , the T@@ IME in dark mood . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I have kis@@ sed him .
&quot; the che@@ v@@ ector of the Pap@@ ua Police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said reporting that his officers &quot; want to secure their station &quot; , &quot; because they are attacked . &quot;
&quot; we must defend ourselves if people thre@@ aten to kill ourselves , &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua Police , Commissioner Pud@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many more in@@ ju@@ red . &quot;
the messages about the k@@ ill@@ ings came only on the following day &apos; fil@@ tered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
&quot; three weeks Jo@@ kow@@ y held a passionate speech , in which he expressed sympath@@ ies for the families of the victims and to tackle the historical ab@@ norm@@ alities in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; I would like that this case is immediately resolved , so that in the future it will no longer happen . &quot;
&quot; safety Minister Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 , that he turned out a non @-@ judicial mechanism of consideration of historical violations of human rights violations . &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; most of the injuries have occurred a long time ago .
some were in the 90 @-@ s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ he years .
&quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to address these violations , but there are processes that have to go through , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; then , he made a retreat when he said on 5 June at Jak@@ arta with T@@ IME and said , he did not submit any plans , in Pap@@ ua a complaint mechanism . &quot;
&quot; instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; Wir@@ anto , which was charged the UN for &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; , &quot; said that 11 cases of violations of human rights violations in Pap@@ ua have already been attached , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims took such claims with gri@@ ev@@ ous un@@ believers .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed in the last three years but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that he is still living in fear later .
&quot; I am afraid , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I am afraid of being arrested by the military , have fear that will be shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeti@@ tive that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says that he was cast out of the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military sought after me , &quot; he says . &quot;
the shooting were not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indon@@ esian police on vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood Dei@@ y@@ ai .
&quot; during a confrontation between vill@@ ag@@ ro@@ omm@@ ates and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma that refused to bring an unconscious man to the hospital , died a person and 17 others were wo@@ unded , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , the 24 @-@ year R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was dro@@ wned when he fis@@ her in a nearby river , died on the way to hospital . &quot;
rebuilt vill@@ agers prot@@ ested before the site office of the company .
&quot; the police said that the vill@@ agers stones on officers war@@ ps , who re@@ acted upon it . &quot;
but native people say that the mobile Brig@@ ade ( Indon@@ esian param@@ il@@ it@@ ary police ) began to shoot the amount and a rolls .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be reven@@ ge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year Dom@@ ing@@ gu Badi@@ i , who lived near the hospital and witness , as the last one has been delivered here quickly , so the T@@ IME . &quot;
&quot; I have hidden me two days in my house . &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called to withdraw the Official officers to account and withdraw the mobile Brig@@ ade of police out of the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an accident @-@ cheese for the Indon@@ esian government .
&quot; the lack of sensu@@ al development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the tri@@ bes@@ men Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and Dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ land of Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; many adher@@ ed to the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the Reb@@ u@@ me@@ e , who claims to defend the rights of Pap@@ ua by offering spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of in@@ don@@ esian soldiers . &quot;
&quot; some of the top @-@ O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; in response to the last few years thousands of people were arrested in Pan@@ i@@ ai and will@@ ingly put into cust@@ ody , under the pre@@ text of the &quot; &quot; securing of national sovereignty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some will never dive again .
&quot; among men in Pap@@ ua is Pan@@ i@@ ai as &quot; &quot; a tragic , for@@ get@@ ful place . &quot;
poverty rein@@ forces the dis@@ satisfaction .
&quot; the little rice , which is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , is too expensive for locals . &quot;
bread is just as out of reach .
people here are building everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruits and bl@@ att@@ ed vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can edit four or five fields of sweet potato .
they keep most of the harvest for the family while the rest on the local market is sold .
ten pieces of not@@ a precious only 10,000 Indon@@ esian R@@ up@@ ies ( 75 C@@ ents ) .
&quot; over time , economic ine@@ qualities between the native Pap@@ ua and the new migrants have grown since the opening of new routes to the airport Nab@@ ire in larger number arrived . &quot;
&quot; the few jobs , which are in the region , usually go to the better educated and prosp@@ erous migrants . &quot;
Pap@@ ua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to competitive their own company .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for here there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John G@@ ob@@ ai , the Chairman of the Chief Executive Council of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
&quot; in addition , restrictions are tense to the reporting international media . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , the French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Basi@@ lle Long@@ ch@@ amp due to lack coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua de@@ ported , even though the rare permission was given to the film . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jo@@ kow@@ is elect@@ oral campaigns to up@@ lift transparency and development , not realized . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists who try to report Indon@@ esian , uncomfortable provinces of Pap@@ ua and West@@ pap@@ ua to report : visa @-@ denial and a black list , &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot;
lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indon@@ esian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
&quot; in March , six Pacific states - Tong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Mar@@ sh@@ all@@ ine Islands and the Sal@@ om@@ ons Islands - the UN Human Rights Council , to investigate the &quot; various and widely used injuries &quot; in Pap@@ ua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting . &quot;
the same countries have historically been supported the O@@ PM .
&quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indon@@ esian Foreign Ministry of Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r pointed the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta , &quot; in Indonesia , there is still a democratic system , and there are free media , so it is difficult to waste the evidence of human rights inci@@ dents . &quot;
people on site want more foreign governments to take note of this .
&quot; as an official delegation from the Netherlands , visited by the direction of the human right @-@ amb@@ assador of K@@ ees Van B@@ aar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura , on 4th May , bra@@ ised their silence and fright@@ ened him &quot; We want freedom &quot; , &quot; according to a source , which also took part in the meeting , but anonymous . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia has released another presidential election , but Pap@@ ua say that they probably will not be able to vote for Jo@@ kow@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jo@@ kow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai Sch@@ kis@@ ses , &quot; says G@@ ob@@ ai , the Chairman of the Chief Council . &quot;
&quot; he wants that Jo@@ kow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from that it is under the constant threat of a peasant army , is in alarm and health services . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai People , like other Pap@@ ua , their voice for Jo@@ kow@@ i as a &quot; guilt &quot; which he has to pay back . &quot;
&quot; they do not need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; despite the threats and inti@@ mid@@ ations , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Sch@@ uss@@ les led a recent symbolic act of the p@@ unch : the body of a sacrifice was buried in a terrain exactly with the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they know that they may never come to justice , but at least they will not forget their crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with bra@@ ised head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire of the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scrapers of Dubai for the second time
&quot; a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest living towers of the world in Dubai , and forced hundreds of residents , from the 3@@ 37 meters high , 79 @-@ stor@@ ey building . &quot;
&quot; it is the second fire that was defeated in just two years by the sky@@ scr@@ aper , which you call the tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) . &quot;
&quot; the building was evac@@ u@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word on the cause of the flame . &quot;
&quot; we slept well , and we were up to the fire @-@ raid and scre@@ aming the people . &quot;
&quot; we ran@@ ged the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come from the 50@@ th floor to bottom , &quot; told a resident who called his name as George attack , Reu@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; Dub@@ ais , civil@@ isation authorities told that the units of fire fighting against 4.00 p.m. local time ( 0@@ 0.00 hrs GMT ) the fire extingu@@ ished and the building were cool . &quot;
&quot; the government said , they work on providing accommodation for those affected . &quot;
&quot; the incident can answer questions about the safety of materials , which are used in external areas of sky@@ scrapers around the world . &quot;
&quot; an investigation by the management of the tor@@ ch @-@ building after its brand in 2015 y@@ iel@@ ded that the largest part of the damage caused by the Fair@@ ing , the external clothing to the decoration or isolation . &quot;
&quot; in the UK , the police , they believe that the system of plates to isolation and Fair@@ ing at the London Gren@@ fell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of an industry in June for about 80 people died . &quot;
no Davis Cup Reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International tennis courts ( IT@@ F ) has fallen through his great Davis Cup Cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
&quot; at the meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h city , the Davis Cup for this sport revolutionary proposal was to play for this sport revolutionary proposal , Davis Cup single @-@ only on two examples , home @-@ thin not supported by the required two @-@ third majority . &quot;
&quot; the although often very long , but even so much appreciated five @-@ sentence classics remain the tradition of tradition . &quot;
&quot; 6@@ 3.@@ 54 percent of the member states for the reform , the goal of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only missing . &quot;
&quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members shall not have accepted the whole reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot;
&quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical competitions , &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot;
one will continue to work on improving the application .
&quot; at all , not only until the vote was already before the proposal had reached the finale to the final on a neutral place . &quot;
&quot; as new as 2018 , only compar@@ atively minor details : so the fin@@ alists will have the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup in future in the first round the host law . &quot;
&quot; to reduce the costs of the organizer , the requirements in terms of training courses , etc . facilit@@ ates and players will have to pass before the Davis Cup less official media @-@ dates . &quot;
&quot; more than 1 out of 5 US travelers brings har@@ b@@ ted items into the aircraft , find out a survey . &quot;
&quot; a survey conducted on passengers that y@@ iel@@ ding more than 20 per cent or un@@ consciously exp@@ ired items to the check@@ points of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration passed , including at least 6 per cent that fr@@ aming the aircraft , while they failed to le@@ aded other items or other objects with blade . &quot;
&quot; less than 1 per cent they claimed , they have been del@@ ayed , that they have travelled wrong with fire@@ arms , am@@ muni@@ tion or explo@@ si@@ ves . &quot;
&quot; the survey of more than 1,000 people - the STR@@ ATOS Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , was performed - also noted that younger travellers are rather p@@ liable for the rules . &quot;
&quot; from the respon@@ dents , the en@@ cor@@ es that she kno@@ w@@ ingly tries to fly with something that was banned by the T@@ SA , compared with less than 15 percent , the members of the generation X were . &quot;
&quot; the most common items that were p@@ ayed to T@@ SA agents , were foods and liqui@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; more than 3 per cent gave to kno@@ w@@ ingly objects carried out by the security control , while 2.@@ 2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3,@@ 7 percent of the male respon@@ dents also confirmed that they could have been inten@@ tional drug in the aircraft . &quot;
&quot; the company said , I asked travellers around the country to find out how many acci@@ dentally had done sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ware through the airport safety and how many it would have done . &quot;
&quot; it is not a surprise that the people , most of the sm@@ ug@@ gel@@ ware - wis@@ ely or ignor@@ ant - by safety wearing those who were most often flying . &quot;
&quot; however , the company pointed out that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and conf@@ using . &quot;
people are often uns@@ ure what liqui@@ ds they are allowed to take them or how much of it .
so it &apos;s not a surprise that the largest quantity of the T@@ SA conf@@ isc@@ ated objects are pu@@ ff@@ ed liqui@@ ds .
&quot; a time for the people , the T@@ SA could watch books as sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ware . &quot;
&quot; liqui@@ ds are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights . &quot;
El@@ on Mus@@ k is no matter of tens of thousands of Tes@@ la @-@ customers .
&quot; with the huge number of pre@@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; &quot; Model 3 &quot; &quot; model . &quot;
so far he has under@@ scored that a part of the customer has with@@ drawn their un@@ binding reservation .
&quot; in addition to the continually tri@@ um@@ ph@@ s numbers , Tes@@ la @-@ Chef El@@ on Mus@@ k has shown a different , less @-@ gloss number : the cancellation of the new mass market @-@ model 3 . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Mus@@ k was often applied with more than 500,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose delivery is just beginning . &quot;
&quot; now peaks of Mus@@ k : from a total of 5@@ 18.@@ 000 pre @-@ orders , 63.@@ 000 has already been with@@ drawn . &quot;
critics were repeatedly pointed out that it is merely a non @-@ binding reservations .
&quot; in a cancellation , Tes@@ la pays more than 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1000 , and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; &quot; reservation payment &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; currently , 45@@ 5.000 of such un@@ binding reservations before , spatial Mus@@ k in a telephone conference with an@@ al@@ ysts . &quot;
&quot; however , the cancellation of so far around twelve per cent of all orders could become a problem , the Tes@@ la Chef does not believe . &quot;
&quot; its argument : the challenge for the ambitious growth aim is not in demand , but on the production site . &quot;
last year Tes@@ la 8@@ 4,000 vehicles introduced .
&quot; 2018 - all models have been assembled - 50@@ 0.000 , 2020 one million . &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
&quot; according to Mus@@ k , per day 1800 reservations are made available . &quot;
&quot; who ordered today a &quot; Model 3 &quot; , &quot; must be expected in the second half of 2018 with the delivery - if Tes@@ la it creates , his brand new , has never been tested in practice with maximum inter@@ rup@@ tions . &quot;
many experts know that this is possible .
&quot; however , it comes too larger delays , then the in@@ ability of reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la . &quot;
&quot; for then , the company cannot prevent un@@ satisfied customers in dro@@ ves . &quot;
&quot; EPA from Pru@@ itt draws back to reducing the rules of the Obama &apos;s rules on reducing emissions , &quot;
&quot; a day after he had lam@@ ented by 15 countries , the chief of the environmental protection authority , his previous decision returned to delay the implementation of the rules of Obama &apos;s era to compens@@ ate for emissions smo@@ g . &quot;
&quot; Pru@@ itt presented change , as its agency proved to meet the needs of the state environmental authorities towards response faster than previous administration . &quot;
he did not mentioned the law@@ suit against his previous place at a federal war .
&quot; it is a deadline , which ran on 1 October for states to keep the standards of 2015 for down @-@ down o@@ zone . &quot;
&quot; insi@@ sted in June , that he will delay compliance with a year in order to study the Plan more time to study the plan and to avoid in local decisions or to hin@@ der economic growth . &quot;
&quot; at the time of his appointment by President Donald Tru@@ mp prosec@@ utor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , a long time was a reliable opponent of environmental protection rules . &quot;
&quot; since its arrival in Washington , Pru@@ denti@@ al has repeatedly repeated , blocking or delay the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels . &quot;
the sudden conversion of Wednesday is the most recent legal set@@ back for the Pru@@ denti@@ al roll@@ back agenda .
&quot; last month has decided to delay a federal court office in Washington that the EPA has passed his authority as he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of Obama administration , the oil and gas companies for monitoring and reducing meth@@ an@@ lec@@ ks compul@@ sory . &quot;
&quot; in one of the Wednesday evening opinion , Pru@@ denti@@ als suggested that his K@@ ehr@@ an at Oz@@ on@@ standards is simply the willingness of EPA in cooperation with the states through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards intensified . &quot;
&quot; under previous administration , the EPA has often accepted the timing for the accompl@@ ishment and then waited to be charged by activ@@ ist groups and others , and in an agreement reached the appointment for the accompl@@ ishment , &quot; said , Pru@@ itt said more than a dozen time in his previous job . &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in regulation by court proceedings , and we take time seriously . &quot;
&quot; we also accept the law and authority , which there are us , seriously . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the EPA approved that Pru@@ itt will eventually use his &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available &quot; to ensure that the provisions will be based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
the Republi@@ cans in Congress are pushing for a more exhaus@@ tive new version of o@@ zone .
one last month approved legislation should delay the implementation of the rules of 2015 at least eight years .
the measure was not yet made available in the Senate .
&quot; the New York Direc@@ tor@@ ate State @-@ General , Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the EPA in this week , said the group intended to maintain the legal pressure . &quot;
&quot; the conversion of EPA - according to our coll@@ agen - is an important gain for health and safety of these 6.9 million New Yor@@ kers , and those over 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g , &quot; said C@@ utting man . &quot;

&quot; it is disturbing , how much pressure it takes to get this rational step from the responsible for the protection of air that we inhal@@ e , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from Center for Bi@@ ological Diversity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue to fight against the ideological crus@@ ade of the Tru@@ mp government to attract environmental pollution and their particular interests . &quot;

Walter Mart@@ ini empha@@ sized : &quot; it is a unique d@@ ör@@ f@@ le Klein@@ od . &quot;
&quot; in 12@@ 67 , the St. Hil@@ ari@@ u@@ kap@@ elle was mentioned for the first time in Wür@@ t@@ tem@@ berg@@ ische Ur@@ au@@ ook : Graf Hermann from Sul@@ z sold &quot; &quot; the mountain with the official church of Tum@@ i Eber@@ hard by Hor@@ b and his brother Diet@@ rich for 20 Mark silver . &quot;
&quot; according to the judgment of the document , according to the tum@@ our mountain , the Tum@@ linger Berg is also a glorious courtyard , to which the church or the Pat@@ ron@@ ats@@ recht was also not the other way around . &quot;
so there were people there .
&quot; as from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt of 18@@ 58 , was next to the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which is still visible in the village picture of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the glori@@ ously settlers of the village . &quot;
old maps from the time around the year 1600 under@@ pin this historical circumstances .
the pat@@ ron@@ ats@@ recht was developed from the early medieval village .
&quot; a Lord , who built a church , and occupied with a pastor , continued to keep the owner of this Church and was able to put this owner also . &quot;
&quot; this was the right to use a pastor , or suggest a bishop a new pastor . &quot;
three alt@@ ars were there in the church and two bells in the tower .
the biggest of the two zer@@ bar@@ st on Christmas 16@@ 73 .
&quot; the newly created bell stand for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be released later in 1942 for the first time in 1942 . &quot;
in the 30 @-@ year war ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the window plates were stolen and the Glo@@ ck@@ ens@@ line were stolen .
the roof was uns@@ dense .
17@@ 96 lag@@ ged French troops close to the church .
they jour@@ ne@@ yed the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
remains of the church dro@@ wned 18@@ 09 .
&quot; until 1869 , the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery was also served as a last resting place for the dead from listening . &quot;
18@@ 23 the cemetery was enlarged and the Hil@@ ari@@ d church was abandoned .
only the church tower was allowed to stand .
in the New Year of New Year in 18@@ 34 a storm the church tower and the half fell .
&quot; to prevent an un@@ happiness , the tower was abandoned . &quot;
only today existing Tur@@ m@@ z@@ wer@@ g remained as a witness to the 750 year old church history .

the Association wants to test approval of Win@@ es
&quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim wa@@ vered itself , does not see a legal requirement for the construction and therefore turned towards the Council of Land@@ rat . &quot;
the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim wa@@ vered &quot; has promp@@ ted Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to withdraw his approval for the establishment of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette .
it is illegal .
the society argu@@ ed that at the time of approval of 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette could not have been approved since then at the time in Vier@@ sen only at the border to Schwal@@ m@@ tal an wind force area .
&quot; within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , at the same time the conc@@ ent@@ ment zone comes to the exclusion of wind use for the rest of the region . &quot;
&quot; lead zones should prevent a &quot; &quot; saving &quot; &quot; of the landscape . &quot;
&quot; the city of Vier@@ sen had decided not approved a second wind power plant in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , but had not approved the district of Düsseldorf , because of a form@@ ulate . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of planning @-@ legal requirement , the shared author@@ is@@ ation is still un@@ law@@ ful and therefore also rep@@ utable , &quot; said Christoph Er@@ kens , chairman of &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; current state of affairs : the city started in front of the summer break once again the Wind@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette decided , a approval of the District government is still standing out . &quot;
Er@@ kens : &quot; so at this point the issu@@ ance of a permit for the establishment of wind turbines are legally excluded . &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the challenge .
&quot; the corresponding letter has been made for last week at the district of Vier@@ sen , &quot; explained a speaker . &quot;
the circle takes her to consider the matter again .
but they do not expect that the procedure is stopped .
&quot; with views of ongoing proceedings at the administrative Court , the circle of Thursday did not want to speak on Thursday to the argum@@ entation of the organisation &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , plans in an area at the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette construction of four each 200 meters high winds . &quot;
&quot; already last year , the company had participated in which the City of Vier@@ sen is involved , P@@ eight@@ ed contracts with the owner of about 65 hectares of great money . &quot;
&quot; with the establishment of four wind turbines , the electricity needs of around 11 400 households can be covered - this corresponds to approximately one @-@ fifth of the electricity demand of all quad@@ ru@@ er households . &quot;
the NEW Re wants to invest around 20 million euros .
&quot; last summer , Vier@@ sen gave green light to buy three wind turbines in the wind@@ park Lin@@ ni@@ ch at Aachen , as well as a stake in a wind power plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district Hein@@ sberg . &quot;
car and tractor cr@@ ashes together : woman dies with a terrible accident
one j@@ ump@@ y traffic accident on Friday morning at 10 am on the L 333 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and B@@ bird ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman became fatal .
two more persons have been in@@ ju@@ red .
the national road remained locked over hours .
&quot; according to police information , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman came from Bor@@ ni@@ ch with their cars in the frame of the accompanying bicycle with their 53 @-@ year mother as an esc@@ ort the L 333 in direction of B@@ bird . &quot;
city and dealer plan &quot; home @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; weekend
bathroom Langen@@ sal@@ za@@ ers and people from the region should discover the shopping opportunities in the city center in September .
&quot; the business club and the city administration want to take advantage of the weekend on the 8th and 9th of September , to attract the inhabitants of the city &apos;s shopping stroll into the city center . &quot;
&quot; as the Chairman of the profession , Christian König , announced the &quot; home @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; weekend to sensi@@ tise the customers of their own city off the usual supermarket commodity . &quot;
&quot; therefore , a market with regional suppliers , is similar to the weekly market . &quot;
&quot; in addition , local companies are to present themselves with their apprentic@@ es@@ hips . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the shops of the city centre is to invite to &quot; Mid@@ ni@@ ts @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; thereby , the action is not only on the inhabitants of the city and the closer region . &quot;
&quot; in preparation , adverti@@ sers in the radio , an internet video and printed bag , refer to the Ak@@ tions @-@ Week , so Christian King . &quot;
city administration and commercial club collaborate with the industrial and Chamber of Commerce .
&quot; thus , the commercial club and the city go into another stage of the project &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive downtown . &quot; &quot;
&quot; these include new offers like the first &quot; &quot; Ak@@ tiv @-@ Day &quot; &quot; to Brun@@ nen@@ fest , with all industrial operators and hosts , to move them to active participation . &quot;
also attractive offers on Saturday and the ren@@ unci@@ ation on parking fees in this day are part of the concept .
&quot; in addition , customer potential should be opened new or again . &quot;
this includes spa guests and tourists .
but also many locals could have lost the city center when shopping .
&quot; in the end , all of them would have to help boost the city centre - up to land@@ lords , the activities of the whole city and associations . &quot;
&quot; it was to overcome with a network the Le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy , who made himself partly , had the king in spring . &quot;
&quot; Bir@@ git strikes , leader of the I@@ HK Center in Müh@@ l@@ hausen shared with that the nation@@ wide third &quot; home @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; day , first five Thür@@ inger cities participate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Bad Langen@@ sal@@ za this is Wei@@ mar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and B@@ light@@ er@@ ode . &quot;
&quot; the day sol@@ le for the appreciation of local trade will advertise and its significance for the common of our cities , so strike . &quot;
the action led by the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners also make clear that every citizen can influence themselves with his purchase environment itself .

&quot; as a bl@@ iss@@ ful , the authorities suspected work on a gas line . &quot;
at the holiday season only a few people kept in the building of the Minn@@ eh@@ aha Academy .
Tru@@ mp continued after the tr@@ aded tran@@ scription by phone call Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scription by phone call between US @-@ President Donald Tru@@ mp and guides of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
&quot; on 27 January the Tru@@ mp in a telephone call with the Mexican President En@@ rique Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to to leave , publicly say that he would not pay for a planned border wall . &quot;
&quot; the US president im@@ min@@ ed him because he had refused to the wall publicly . therefore , he said to him , &quot; This may not tell the press . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp started his presidential campaign with a promise to build a wall on the southern border of the USA , and pregnant Mexico for the project . &quot;
tran@@ scri@@ p@@ te of his first lawyer with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and un@@ covered a tense exchange .
&quot; Mr. Tru@@ mp said Mr. Turn@@ bull , that a trade for the US refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia , &quot; &quot; mies &quot; &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; , &quot; &quot; mies &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; , &quot; after he had proposed a ban on the settlement of refugees in the USA . &quot;

Mo@@ ores Ford @-@ Mass@@ aker : activists conduct rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice again
&quot; a 1948 @-@ he Ford Mer@@ cury was driving through a group of spect@@ ators in rural Mon@@ roe , Georgia , and shr@@ inking to the Ford bridge of Mo@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; before the car , the four black passengers and a white rider was able to reach the bridge , a group of white men joined the bridge to block its way . &quot;
the leader of the m@@ bs - a man middle age in a con@@ i@@ fers - took a long train at its cig@@ ar and looked up through the wind@@ shield .
in@@ doors the in@@ mates in fear .
&quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; br@@ aked the man .
&quot; Ho@@ l him out of the car ! &quot;
&quot; scre@@ ams the silence , as a young black man from the passenger seat was distor@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; fortunately this nasty scene , which was played on July 22 , only a night &apos;s position . &quot;
&quot; but if then a loop around the neck of &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; is thrown almost all in the audience very real sig@@ h . &quot;
since 2005 civil rights to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge back to im@@ itate the night in which two black pairs - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com as well as George and Ma@@ e Murray Dor@@ sey - from K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
nobody was ever charged because of the murder .
&quot; it really is un@@ think@@ able that in all these years no single person was arrested , although we see them in our churches , even though we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks , who helps in organizing the post . &quot;
&quot; it is a dirt st@@ ain on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Bro@@ oks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former congress of the state of Georgia and a life of citizenship .
&quot; for him , the im@@ position serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual memory of the Mon@@ roe community that has never been fixed . &quot;
&quot; we want offen@@ ders , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must receive justice , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; we cannot reach healing and reconciliation , until we receive justice . &quot;
an au@@ ro@@ ud was a beg@@ ro@@ ud on the body of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ n on 27 July 1946 .
&quot; according to F@@ BI files , which were obtained by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ roe and the surrounding Graf@@ ships were suspic@@ ious . &quot;
but nobody has ever been charged .
&quot; although the susp@@ end for decades stay on open foot , citizens say the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions in the whole city was always known : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 , a decision made by the Supreme Court of Justice made the black citizens in Georgia it for the first time to finish their voice in summer . &quot;
&quot; about at the same time as the election st@@ ach according to the F@@ BI of black Far@@ mp@@ ter Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a struggle - supposedly because of a woman . &quot;
Bro@@ oks said the ru@@ mor in the city was that H@@ ester with Mal@@ com@@ s Ms Dor@@ othy slept and that the baby that she carried away from her husband .
&quot; on 25 July 1946 Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , 600 dollars to liber@@ ate Mal@@ com from prison , so the F@@ BI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her cou@@ sins Ma@@ e Murray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
&quot; but when they removed themselves from the prison and the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , ring@@ ing a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b the car . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison that the Mor@@ de prepared and arranged , closes it from a F@@ BI report . &quot;
&quot; it is also obvious that there was a complete between the state and local criminal proceedings , which was not only involved in the mor@@ den , evidence , and the identity of witnesses has changed . &quot;
Bro@@ oks form@@ ulates it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; it was a vot@@ al @-@ mass@@ acre , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; if you register and if you vote , then this will happen . &quot;
&quot; almost a decade long , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual post @-@ performance of Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de . &quot;
&quot; their presentation is vi@@ vid , po@@ ign@@ ant , and in a kind of deep racism , many believe that he does not exist in America any longer . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to look at , and even more difficult to look , but Gre@@ ene said that that is the point . &quot;
&quot; we do not want to talk about the Lyn@@ ne , because we are confronted with whose imm@@ ort@@ ality in all of us , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; but I cannot build a relationship with you , if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I done . &quot;
&quot; the rehear@@ sals for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day they started almost 30 actors - a dozen wheat and the rest Black - into a room and lou@@ der , as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ arranged overview of the piece started . &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ ase Co @-@ director .
&quot; he has played the role of the boss @-@ C@@ lan@@ mit@@ gli@@ eds for years , but he said the role will never be easier . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty , because I am not so bin , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; but I think it is very important to keep this story in life , because we would not want to return to those times . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the room the actor D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , their lines . &quot;
&quot; the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the h@@ ester , and pus@@ hes up , angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy . &quot;
&quot; I said , n --- he , w@@ ret@@ ains of my property ! &quot;
Ras@@ cona er@@ wi@@ es the fire .
there is a rest .
and then everyone breaks ( at least all black actors ) in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lau@@ re@@ test .
&quot; what ? ! &quot; , &quot; asked Ras@@ cona . &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; &quot; Gre@@ ene , still said , &quot;
&quot; I just don &apos;t think , that white people back then &apos; n --- he &apos; . &quot;
&quot; but , &quot; wit@@ ched one of the other black performers . &quot;
&quot; you only have to meet the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
&quot; and exactly there is the energy in the room , a feeling of compani@@ onship , replacing the discomfort . &quot;
&quot; everyone is busy doing this right , not only because of the game , but also because of memory of the four get@@ out people . &quot;
the scene begins even more .
&quot; this time , when Ras@@ cona says the N @-@ word , he says it sharp and with im@@ print . &quot;
absolutely no one laughs .
this re@@ petition ends non@@ violent and fast .
&quot; there is scre@@ ams , shots and then silence . &quot;
&quot; a woman , bo@@ died with a grape @-@ dress , stands on the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actor and guides Bil@@ li@@ Holidays Char@@ ing Lob@@ os &quot; Str@@ ange Fru@@ it . &quot; &quot;
your voice breaks every second word .
about one hundred meters behind it is a group of about four dozen spect@@ ators swe@@ at and tears from the eyes .
the audience is almost even@@ ly divided between black and white .
&quot; a couple is made of I@@ th@@ aca , New York , anger@@ ed to see the performance , many come only down the road . &quot;
they have almost eight hours of Georgi@@ as oppressed moisture when Bro@@ oks lead them on a pilgrimage to the gra@@ v@@ ents of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
&quot; up to this point , the Mor@@ de have stayed an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote but now , if you found in the same country where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de found , the air feels s@@ pen@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; when the final notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene invites the amount to come closer and to insp@@ ect the cor@@ pse . &quot;
&quot; children ho@@ cken in their minds , sign the f@@ ake blood and breast@@ feeding each other . &quot;
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; mur@@ ders a little boy , as a w@@ ool to remember . &quot;
after a couple of minutes Gre@@ ene the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actor throw the Lyn@@ ch@@ sei@@ l away and w@@ ander their tears .
&quot; Brad@@ sha@@ w um@@ ar@@ mt Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit , who has played the cl@@ ot member . &quot;
&quot; Nick Ras@@ cona um@@ ar@@ n two of his fellow players and then breaks into their arms , the emotional burden of the performance breaks finally with him . &quot;
&quot; it is ok , &quot; whis@@ per@@ ed one of the women . &quot;
we know that this is not in your heart .
you did that for a reason . &quot;
later the audience comes together with the actors for dinner together .
at a table chat a white pair of Atlanta stimul@@ ated over the im@@ position with a black pair that they have just met .
Den@@ ise du@@ pl@@ inski to find words to find words which feeling the performance .
&quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... to come from people who like yourself and what they do , because they look like you , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what really does it do with me , let me believe that the Lyn@@ ch is still further &quot; , &quot; she added , &quot; today it is called the police shooting . &quot;
&quot; in the same room Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks Hof at his table , he e@@ ats and reminds of the civil rights . &quot;
he said he already started to plan the performance in the next year .
&quot; the im@@ position is inspir@@ ational in a certain way because it describes the hor@@ rors of what we do , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it is so when we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again . &quot;
&quot; whoever does not study his own story , who does not know his own story is condemned to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ d@@ ämmerung &apos; Com@@ promis@@ ers the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bay@@ re@@ uth
&quot; also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monum@@ ental work , Director Frank Cast@@ orf is composed of gigantic , six @-@ stor@@ ey setting . &quot;
&quot; the hub ( designed by Alek@@ sand@@ ar Den@@ ic ) shows op@@ tionally a s@@ bs street corner including the wall @-@ rest and d@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ste and E@@ la@@ ste &quot; logo from the GDR @-@ times or the New York Stock Exchange . &quot;
&quot; before that , par@@ kt is an open Mercedes @-@ old@@ tim@@ ers , in which the Rhein@@ l@@ emen as rock@@ erg@@ ir@@ ls , or alternatively a Is@@ etta . &quot;
Gest@@ apo O@@ il@@ äs@@ ser remind of Cast@@ or@@ fs leit@@ moti@@ v - money , power and gre@@ ed - which moves through his &quot; ring &quot; stage . &quot;

&quot; brutal the scene , when he defe@@ ats Sieg@@ fried . &quot;
later it also has to believe Gun@@ ther ( Markus Ei@@ che ) .
the audience thanks to the ensemble with powerful appl@@ ause .
&quot; stor@@ my celebrated Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and Di@@ rig@@ ent Jan@@ owski , who is hum@@ ble and bow hands toward the Merkel . &quot;
&quot; great appl@@ ause is available for example the festive music , which shows itself on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat again in legal leisure . &quot;
the appearance of Frank Cast@@ orf was anticipated by Frank Cast@@ orf and his Regi@@ ete@@ am .
&quot; in 2013 he had to give a strong wh@@ ist@@ le concert in 2013 , there were five years later big che@@ ers in which the &quot; &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; &quot; went down . &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to be happy .
&quot; one noted that the audience has grown together with the &quot; ring &quot; in a certain way , she had said shortly before the performance of d@@ pa . &quot;
the audience did not only have a form of peace with Cast@@ orf but it is also an understanding of his point of view .
I draw a positive Res@@ um@@ me@@ e .

EPA returns the decision to delay the smo@@ g rule after Kl@@ agen
&quot; the US American environmental protection authority has a decision to delay a regulation of the government of Obama , abol@@ ished what the states are committed to compens@@ ate the smo@@ g caused emissions . this was done a day after 15 states the Agency because of the step . &quot;
&quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to drive the so @-@ called &quot; Oz@@ on@@ ments 2015 , &quot; and said , they show the commitment of the Agency , with states . &quot;
&quot; we believe in dialogue with and that we respond to our state partners , &quot; said EPA from Scott Pru@@ itt said in a statement . &quot;
&quot; Pru@@ itt announced in June the intention of EPA , which should be measured in a part of the country &apos;s poll@@ ut@@ ant emissions to determine where entries must be made to delay stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year until October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 largely democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , handed down on Tuesday law@@ suit , and said that the effort was illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tru@@ mp has tried to re @-@ imposed a wide range of environmental policies , which former President Barack Obama has risen to reg@@ ain economic growth , according to Tru@@ mp &apos;s economic growth . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , efforts have triggered the set@@ back of Democrats and reserves , who are worried about the impact greater emissions on public health . &quot;
&quot; the EPA has said that the inhal@@ ing of air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; the lung function and can reinforce breathing symptoms &quot; such as as@@ thma . &quot;
municipal council wants common room
&quot; in the end , the decision was clear : with two counter@@ parts , the municipal office of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ z@@ eln has the establishment of a community space in the future seniors . &quot;
&quot; in front of the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the still missing item is signed , reported Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden . &quot;
&quot; although so far , it will still take up until the so far the church community includes an area in the community ownership , but there is now no plans for that from a private investor to st@@ em@@ ing project more . &quot;
&quot; for this , there is a discussion about a joint space . &quot;
&quot; one of the two investors who are still in the boat , has offered the community to come forward . &quot;
&quot; on the ground floor , it would have a living space - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with about 70 square meters area for a special price . &quot;
&quot; the management and the majority of the municipal office fails to see such a common area , not as a meeting place for the residents of the living @-@ living room , but open to the congregation . &quot;
&quot; as an example , the word was made by the &quot; &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; &quot; round . &quot;
&quot; failing to reconc@@ ile the decision , which has been decided by providing funds for running the running household , already in the past autumn , by funding opportunities . &quot;
the building lies in the refurb@@ ishment area .
&quot; the establishment of a communal area would be , so reported T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; the decision of the decision to signal the investor to signal , that in this respect , no bu@@ ck@@ el wants to determine that both Satt@@ el@@ - and ambient light - what the traction @-@ height decreases and the construction of economic power - as you would be possible . &quot;
&quot; unnecessary , so does not only mean Wil@@ fried Soh@@ m , be this supplement . &quot;
when it helps : unanim@@ ously he has happened the body .
it is not as easy as the common room .
&quot; Daniela &apos;s reputation refers to the many own buildings with which you are not so very progres@@ sing , that Leh@@ ne can now speak with the common room out of the window , she says : &quot; I am hard with it . &quot;
Yvonne Sta@@ iger definitely speaks for the common room - but absolutely against a municipal involvement .
it will see behind it a covered sub@@ invention of any foreign investors .
&quot; this is not so , because with the purchase of the area you do not give grants , but I get a real , in the two @-@ case @-@ market opposite , is the counter . &quot;
&quot; Sta@@ ig@@ ers request , decre@@ e the decisions made in accordance with decre@@ e , finds three advocates . &quot;
&quot; it remains in two counter@@ part in the original program , which Stefan H@@ aller summ@@ arized : &quot; &quot; when we set the decision so we make a huge step to close a giant in our infrastructure . &quot;

in the Har@@ z the nation@@ wide first &quot; Stern@@ en@@ pf@@ ad &quot; arise .
this is planning the club observ@@ atory Saint Andre@@ as@@ berg .
a Plan@@ etary weg is in Gött@@ ingen - since 2003 .
&quot; a &quot; Stern@@ en@@ pf@@ ad &quot; comes to the information needs of many Har@@ z@@ visitors , called it . &quot;
&quot; he connect nature , science , movement and sporting performance . &quot;
the members want to exhibit along the planned route and inform them about stars and constell@@ ations .
&quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association is planning a well @-@ reachable installations at five to six locations in the Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot;
&quot; In@@ quiry St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Si@@ eber . &quot;
the information on the boards should be suppl@@ emented by the Internet .
&quot; therefore , in the location of 1000@@ th Sel@@ ection is a good mobile network reception . &quot;
also barrier be a crit@@ erion .
&quot; later , the star train is to be expanded by train . &quot;
&quot; on the star@@ ring path , the viewer will learn a lot of knowledge , for example about the physics of the single stars , &quot; explained the association . &quot;
&quot; they also learned why stars would have different colors , or why a star has more lumin@@ aire than another , although it is much farther away . &quot;
&quot; this constell@@ ation will also be convey@@ ed , in which constell@@ ation is a selected star and when he is best to see . &quot;
&quot; the association has been running since 2014 in the Berg@@ städ@@ t@@ chen St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , which at the highest located astronom@@ ical observ@@ atory in Northern Germany . &quot;
the location in the middle of Har@@ z National Park is one of the Federal Ministry for Natur@@ schutz on the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
frequently from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a galax@@ y with mere eyes see clearly visible .
&quot; in the uni @-@ town , there has been an initiative of the Planet@@ arium Gött@@ ingen since 2003 on the initiative of the planned star @-@ wer@@ g - the planetary path . &quot;
&quot; starting from Geb@@ har@@ ds Hotel in Goe@@ the@@ all@@ ee , the Plan@@ etary weg path leads up to Hain@@ berg , up to the Hain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; extra @-@ ear@@ thly &quot; location in Di@@ emar@@ ie ( Municip@@ ality ) with the Planet S@@ edn@@ a . &quot;
the st@@ ables with the individual planets - including the d@@ warf @-@ engra@@ ved pl@@ uto at the end point - are accurately positioned at the distance and measure of one to two billion .
&quot; the earth shr@@ unk so on a bul@@ let of 6,@@ 5 milli@@ meter diameter , while exactly 75 meters away from the sun after 70 cen@@ timeters measures . &quot;
the entire distance of the planet is good four kilometers .
&quot; while the light needed from sun to Pl@@ uto approximately eight hours , ped@@ est@@ ri@@ ans need a good hour to the St@@ ele with Pl@@ uto . &quot;
ped@@ est@@ ri@@ ans are faster than the light in the cosmos .
the march to the next fix@@ tures would still take a half year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time to discuss a possible show@@ down
&quot; Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who should stand in a coll@@ isions in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , to Gar@@ cia , the un@@ en@@ lag@@ ged World box@@ ing Council lightweight champion , the hallway down to Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World box@@ ing organization Super @-@ spring weight champion . &quot;
after Gar@@ ci@@ as &apos;s victory through mon@@ oph@@ onic decision on the former four @-@ conductor World Champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ zes on Saturday at Show@@ time are both fighters members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ list .
&quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out the right hand and said , &quot; How does it go to you , Champion ? &quot;
I wish you good luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko is defending his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturdays evening at 7 p.m. on ES@@ PN .
&quot; as the couple for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect magnitude . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am a former fe@@ ather @-@ weight , &quot; remembered Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; I have risen to Bron@@ er &#91; on 140 pounds &#93; , but I am not so great . &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I would like to move on lightweight .
and he must move to Light@@ weight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then fight .
that demand the fans .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko voted .
&quot; box@@ ing needs this fight . &quot;
&quot; climate question asked whether it should be on Pay @-@ per @-@ View , part of a strategy that will fight Lom@@ ach@@ enko with an 135 @-@ pound debut in this year to agree on the next summer with Gar@@ cia a date ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who has also interested in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Campbell according to their Light@@ weight championship in the forum on September 23 . &quot;
&quot; this struggle could take place in the Pay @-@ per @-@ View mode , because all fans asked for him , &quot; said Gar@@ cia and oppressed him later to fight in the network that offers the best financial package . &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can create this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said , he will appreciate Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; a tremendous fighter , &quot; and he may possibly take part in his Saturday fight . &quot;
&quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ enko held with the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he think the triple champion from River@@ side see &quot; very slowly , &quot; I &apos;m sorry Mi@@ key ... you just wanted to go the Ko @-@ Off . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said , the focus is to show stroke , then box@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; both told them , they could sense the momentum that built up for their own battle . &quot;
&quot; this is the fight , which must be carried out . &quot;
no other fight creates as much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko said : &quot; I have been waiting for the top fighters and this is Mi@@ key .
it will be a great battle . &quot;
four Lat@@ ch after tire @-@ bur@@ ner
with an accident on the A7 on Thursday afternoon four people were seriously wo@@ unded .
&quot; after the first information , the driver of a Opel Z@@ af@@ ira lost its control over its car shortly before the junction point of market , presum@@ ably after a tire space . &quot;
the passenger sl@@ ender to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment where he was over@@ struck and then lying on the roof at the GR@@ Ü@@ N@@ STRE@@ IF@@ EN .
the four ins@@ ulates - two adults and two children - were severely in@@ ju@@ red during the accident .
&quot; during the initial supply of the past by the lif@@ egu@@ ard , the A7 was locked towards north for about one hour , then the traffic could be led on the left lane at the in@@ genu@@ ity . &quot;
For@@ tun@@ as Hoff@@ mann : &quot; Drei@@ erk@@ ette works better &quot;
&quot; Andre Hoff@@ mann , hop@@ ed after 2 : 2 for the season opening against Braunschweig , that the optimization of def@@ enses in Au@@ e points brings . &quot;
&quot; with the first end of the season , Andre Hoff@@ mann was satisfied with the result even if not the two oppos@@ ers were at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig . &quot;
&quot; these were two oppos@@ it@@ ors too much , and we must fit in Au@@ e even better , &quot; says the def@@ enses of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot;
in the Ore Mountains the triple band should continue to be optimized .
&quot; and a door after a shar@@ k , the For@@ tun@@ es want no more to be rus@@ hed . &quot;
&quot; for the future , it will be that no more besides Michael ( R@@ ensing ) is going to be on line . &quot;
&quot; Hoff@@ mann is convinced that his team can also be better right after the experience in preparation with the triple band , than with the quad@@ erk@@ ette . &quot;
&quot; yet I don &apos;t know how we will act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ hel@@ m Funk@@ el , but Hoff@@ mann is sure of his thing , &quot; because we have just been able to build on the semi @-@ positions in KA@@ AN Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko G@@ ieß@@ el@@ mann players who can build well , &quot; said Hoff@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; the requirement is , however , that we are even better harmon@@ ise and we do not afford to do so many copies . &quot;
&quot; of course , Hoff@@ mann goes to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; but whether you can speak to an accident from a mis@@ directed start , I do not know . &quot;
&quot; the performance could be quite okay , &quot; said Hoff@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; but if we can concentrate on Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the Cup , we will certainly speak of a proper season . &quot;
of which his coach wanted nothing to know .
&quot; the start to the season I had only after six to eight players &apos; days , &quot; said Fried@@ hel@@ m Funk@@ el , who would not want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e , just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be broken down because of an accident . &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season virtually with a home game , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoff@@ mann believes that players from Au@@ e might even be something fresh , as they could not have serious and complete game like Fort@@ una against a as@@ cen@@ sion favor@@ ites into the bones . &quot;
&quot; but they do not know that 100 @-@ percentage where they are currently standing , &quot; says the def@@ enders of the Fort@@ una . &quot;
the guests from the Rhein@@ land became easier to go on Sunday in the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; that we dis@@ solve it , just because we have the claim to come under the first six , is b@@ yp@@ ass , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance sheet is thoroughly positive against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga , which one must strike from the outset , &quot; explains For@@ tun@@ as Chief coach . &quot;
&quot; to meet such a statement , arrogan@@ t and Hebrew . &quot;
and thus Funk@@ el will not experience his players on Sunday .
new results of the Swedish asylum @-@ old review tests will be published
&quot; the recent results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden were subjected to a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish authority for for@@ ensi@@ c medicine ( R@@ ät@@ t@@ sm@@ e@@ dic@@ ine verk@@ et ) has started performing the tests last year .
&quot; they are to make more precise during the asylum seek@@ ers , after the Swedish migration agency ( mig@@ rating ) , due to errors in the assessment of the correct ages of some refugees was cri@@ tici@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; up to date , Mig@@ rations of 6.@@ 8@@ 80 has been sent to 6.@@ 8@@ 80 and the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency has now released the results of 2.@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid March to 31 July 2017 . &quot;
eight@@ y percent ( 2002 ) were assessed as 18 or older while in other 25 cases the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency evaluated that the person &apos;s probably 18 years or older .
&quot; in addition , the conclusion was that the person is perhaps under 18 years old . &quot;
the tests are only carried out in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
&quot; according to Johan Go@@ ran@@ sson by the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency , the results in recent months are resistant . &quot;
&quot; we do not see a big difference in statistics of the past months , the figures are fairly constant , &quot; he said the magazine The Local . &quot;
&quot; the high proportion of cases where the person has been judged over 18 years , does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ ers has over its age . &quot;
&quot; in May , the agency released the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases to suggest that the only person was 18 years old or older . &quot;
&quot; when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bla@@ det made the 5@@ 81 published results , she asked that in 243 of these cases the person had said that it will be 18 years old . &quot;
&quot; the method of medical children &apos;s evaluation , in which x @-@ rays of past@@ ures @-@ teeth and MR@@ T recordings are analysed by knee br@@ aries , which then cri@@ tici@@ zed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , was also cri@@ tici@@ zed in some areas . &quot;
&quot; a scep@@ tics is the En@@ do@@ kr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ inska Institute , whose work includes the assessment of the biological maturity of people to see whether they were formerly or later considered by pu@@ ber@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t believe that the type of measurement should be used . &quot;
assessing the biological age in this way is very uns@@ afe .
&quot; if we cannot say it certainly we should not do as if we could , &quot; &quot; he said the newspaper Metro . &quot;
&quot; Gö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general you can say that the risk , a child as an adult is un@@ correct , low . &quot;
&quot; the biggest risk is in it when the person is just under 18 , in that case this is about 10 percent . &quot;
fully in the plan
the work on the three bridges of the Land@@ road 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
&quot; on Wednesday , there was a seven tons of heavy emphasis on the bridge on the eastern outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; we are very good at the time , it works super , &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , construction manager at the department of street transport and traffic in the Re@@ der@@ ship Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; in April , the work began simultaneously on all three sandy bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; the building is planned for October , and is sure that the schedule will be respected . &quot;
&quot; the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , takes over the tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; it is a v@@ ault draw@@ bridge from concrete , which is dressed with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total @-@ length of 4,@@ 80 meters . &quot;
it was built in 1900 .
&quot; like the two other bridges , it is now into the years . &quot;
&quot; to ensure the stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly refurbished . &quot;
the other two bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built from red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
&quot; both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10,@@ 60 meters long . &quot;
the bridge at the entrance to the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach on the northern side has now reached a 1,30 meter wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called fr@@ ame@@ work@@ book .
&quot; this is a pl@@ edge , which is also used as operating path . &quot;
&quot; the southern part of the bridge is to be used on Friday a tourist meter width . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; then , the pedestrian on it is supposed to go out . &quot;
&quot; the particular thing is that it is ready for use , a patent from Sch@@ ram@@ berger Company Di@@ zw@@ o . &quot;
the other two bridges are already provided with the patented Br@@ ück@@ ank .
particular f@@ inger@@ @-@ feeling has the ver@@ ge of lines up through the construction plant in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; because there is also a glass of glass , which are connected to many companies . &quot;
the residen@@ ces were informed in advance of work by hand@@ z@@ ett@@ el about the project .
&quot; in addition , first fish and cancer had to be mixed . &quot;
&quot; for the bridges between the building building and the collective in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , the traffic is regulated by a traffic lights . &quot;
&quot; for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bacher village entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Si@@ eben Lin@@ den &quot; is fully locked . &quot;
the cost of three com@@ missions are up to 700 000 Euros .
financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ under protest in German potato salad
&quot; it does not come so often that parties will move to a string , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , what else is difficult to bring under a hat . &quot;
&quot; the parties represented in the roundabout ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , left ) belong to a broad coalition , which shows in this day peaceful flag , because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle . &quot;
&quot; and known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , which forms together with Alexander Gau@@ land , the top duo for the German Bundestag , and the Deputy Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; but those who are on site already hours before the start of the event , do not want to listen to the Af@@ D lessons , but to demonstrate . &quot;
the motto &quot; The Ei@@ fel remains colorful . &quot;
originally the town picnic under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; at the Brun@@ nen@@ platz planned but is now taking place on the parking place below the R@@ ond@@ ola - and therefore right in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stadthalle .
a colour@@ ful image that offers itself .
&quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chair@@ woman of the Forum One World and one of the leading organizers , really pleased : &quot; great how many people came together here . &quot;
&quot; there are music and plenty of food , including a &quot; German potato salad , which could also eat the Af@@ D without problems , &quot; says the woman who brought him . &quot;
&quot; police has be@@ amed many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence mainly at the railway station , which is only a few meters from the venues . &quot;
how did the Af@@ D actually come on Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes of the Af@@ D volcano @-@ fel tells himself about such an event and receive the supplement .
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation , because of the already built @-@ in Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ mes does not have enough parking available . &quot;
&quot; so the Ron@@ dell &apos;@@ Hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot;
&quot; he says : &quot; &quot; it says : &quot; &quot; this is the good right of the people , main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
&quot; this also does it : towards 20 am provides a tape for entertainment , in the Stadthalle several speakers , including the rh@@ ein@@ land pf@@ alz @-@ Af@@ D @-@ Chair@@ woman Uwe Junge . &quot;
&quot; in the hall there are about 200 listen@@ ers , waiting for the presidential election for the Bundestag , Alice Wei@@ del , and the Deputy Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ k to hold their speeches . &quot;
&quot; unchanged is the police presence , but so far the officials had a quiet evening . &quot;
&quot; something more than an hour takes the Af@@ D event , the guests on the front place have a longer breath , but even there is shortly after 21 o &apos;clock au@@ fr@@ aming . &quot;
the police can bring down - no special occurrence .
tromb@@ one meets trumpet
&quot; a re@@ hear with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli , there is a set of Has@@ l@@ acher Klo@@ ster@@ concerts tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 pm in the Klo@@ st@@ erk@@ ir@@ che . &quot;
&quot; along with the Bulgarian Tromp@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he is a concert under the motto &quot; Schwarz@@ meer meets on Schwar@@ zw@@ ald , &quot; or even &quot; Bal@@ kan@@ folklore &quot; meets a classical German education with roots in concert music . &quot;
both sol@@ o@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have given sol@@ opo@@ si@@ ections in European sh@@ ale @-@ n@@ ests .
so Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter at the prestigious Con@@ cert@@ geb@@ ouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is Sol@@ op@@ os@@ aun@@ ist of SWR Symphony Orchestra .
&quot; both united the lust , not only to cross the borders on their instruments , but also to merge the limits of different gen@@ res . &quot;
&quot; thus Johann Sebastian Bach wrote on the two like in a new gar@@ b , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; world music &quot; united with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the Jazz@@ ech@@ op@@ rei@@ str@@ ingent N@@ ils W@@ og@@ ram , mix classical , jazz and the free games into a fascinating world @-@ art work . &quot;
this core part of the program was only shown this spring with huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ og@@ ram has written it for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ l@@ acher Klo@@ st@@ erk@@ ir@@ che with their particular acou@@ sti@@ cs will be aware of the concert .
Kri@@ sten Stew@@ art talks about their bis@@ ex@@ ual ality
&quot; some people love gri@@ lled cheese and will eat him to the end of their lives .
&quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; So Kri@@ sten Stew@@ art completely open over their bis@@ ex@@ ual . &quot;
&quot; when I put together in gri@@ lled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh it was cool , what comes as a neigh@@ bor ? &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the most well @-@ known relationship of the Holl@@ feld stars was that of her &quot; &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; &quot; colleagues Robert Patt@@ inson , who finally arose bitter . &quot;
&quot; despite all the in@@ sured the br@@ ün@@ ette Dar@@ stell@@ ter compared to the &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; I was in love with love that I remembered . &quot;
&quot; or do you believe , I could have played it ? &quot;
&quot; according to their separation , Kri@@ sten gave to that they have bis@@ ex@@ ual : &quot; I have always lived and seriously believed in du@@ alism . &quot;
so it has never been confused or hin@@ dered .
I never liked it to be taken seriously .
&quot; in particular , she suffered loud &quot; Bang Show@@ biz &quot; but in school times when they prefer to dress up like a bu@@ b : &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot;
this really has been in@@ ju@@ red .
&quot; when I was eleven , I told me the children , I would look like a bug . &quot;
&quot; I felt really attacked , fright@@ ened and embarrass@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; now I look back and think me , &apos; girl , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot;
&quot; especially the public they don &apos;t like to know their love life , &quot; people expect you to make you a certain way and that anno@@ yed me . &quot;
&quot; and maybe I call me some un@@ think@@ able , but I don &apos;t like it to justify myself from all the public . &quot;
the governor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
&quot; the democratic Gover@@ nor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening at a manifestation with President Tru@@ mp that he will change the party . &quot;
&quot; whether you like it or not , the Democrats have removed from me , &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you with lots of prayer and a lot of re@@ think ... today I will tell you as the inhabitants of West Virginia , I can no longer help you when I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the manifestation broke in che@@ ers .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the republi@@ cans , &quot; &quot; Justice added . &quot;
&quot; as a coach , I would say that it is time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp had previously made a great announcement on the West Virginia R@@ ally .
&quot; Mr. Tru@@ mp won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice was not approved the democratic candidate Hill@@ ary Clinton . &quot;
&quot; Justice , according to For@@ bes of the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; for@@ bes , he is proof that he possesses carbon@@ em@@ inen in five states , and inherited a carbon business by his father . &quot;
it is worth 1,@@ 59 billion dollars .
&quot; in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee on Thursday night gave an explanation , in which it said : &quot; &quot; the party change of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow for a Democratic party which would go closer to us than working in order to make our country again great . &quot;
&quot; with just 15 Gou@@ vern@@ ements and the control of the least legislative bodies in history is the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice only the last rejection of a party , which is from above up to below without leadership and is unable to find a positive , some positive , puri@@ fying message , &quot; said the R@@ NC @-@ Chair R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News . &quot;
&quot; co@@ e lo@@ ys &quot; honest &quot; Russian excuse for dop@@ ing @-@ sc@@ andal &quot;
&quot; the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as an open excuse for Russia , but he repeated , it is not the moment for the country to be recorded in sports . &quot;
&quot; Russia Ath@@ le@@ tics head of Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ akh@@ ine said during the I@@ A@@ AF Congress , at the eve of Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championship , that the exile of his country was correct from the sport and that it &apos;s determined to fight the dop@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; he said , I am sorry for &quot; all athletes , those with competitions , gold and silver medals . &quot;
&quot; despite his comments of the I@@ A@@ AF Congress for the maintenance of the For@@ bidden , which was hanging in November 2015 , after a report of the World @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( W@@ ada ) hints at the state of dop@@ ing D@@ oping in Russia had already been found . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was today a very open response , a very honest presentation , &quot; said I@@ A@@ AF @-@ President Co@@ e the Repor@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; the entire Council and the entire Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has recognised himself , that she has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to make sure the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot;
&quot; Co@@ e said , he is also &quot; delighted &quot; that Russia accept the criteria for his re @-@ introduction . &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress had been made , but the congress supports the recommendations of Task Force , that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot;
&quot; the principle principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the ch@@ aired system , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; nin@@ et@@ een Russian athletes are beginning with Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships , which will begin on Friday in London according to the str@@ ingent I@@ A@@ AF criteria . &quot;
&quot; the leader of the I@@ A@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia still meet some of the criteria for rein@@ statement . &quot;
&quot; Dro@@ gent@@ ests are still inadequate and un@@ har@@ ness@@ ed trainers are still free , he said reporting in London after a talk at the I@@ A@@ AF Council . &quot;

the ceremony took place on Thursday in the Dom@@ stadt under high security arrangements .

she signed the two rel@@ apse pil@@ ots but as &quot; K@@ ön@@ ner of their specialist . &quot;
&quot; we worship ourselves before this highest sacrifice which they have produced in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; explained . &quot;
the 33 @-@ year Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old St@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from Nord@@ h@@ essen were killed on Wednesday before a week in the West African Mali .
their s@@ är@@ ge were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a full @-@ guard of the Bundes@@ wehr into the Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er Dom Saint Peter .
&quot; at the mid@@ day , first only the relatives were at the far@@ ewell . &quot;
&quot; then the grape @-@ party began in the circle of the family , close friends , by representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr and politics . &quot;
below were also H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the general manager of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
&quot; trau@@ ma laid down ros@@ es , the relatives were poor in arm to the s@@ är@@ gen . &quot;
in front of the church Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers took the ceremony on a canvas .
&quot; the Minister of Defence , by the Ley@@ en presented the outlines of the revolution as a &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann has built the aircraft of the combat screw tiger in Fr@@ itz@@ lar , with built up one of the first six trained tiger drivers of his reg@@ iment . &quot;
&quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , Kom@@ man@@ de@@ ur of the Reg@@ iment , to which the soldiers belong to the soldiers , &quot; If these crew was unable to turn the crash , then it would not have any disgu@@ ised . &quot;
doubt at the UN Mission in Mali the minister of Ley@@ en was not : the use was dangerous .
&quot; but he is also of high significance for a country , from which we are only separated by two states , &quot; she said . &quot;
after the grape @-@ party the slogan were brought out of the cathedral .
&quot; when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr made no information . &quot;
Prin@@ z Hen@@ rik wants no grave in addition to his wife
&quot; the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prin@@ z Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be best buried in his wife after his death . &quot;
the shared the Royal House on Thursday with .
&quot; traditionally , the Danish Royal Palace is set in the cathedral church of Ros@@ kil@@ de . &quot;
the sculp@@ tor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ gaard fer@@ ed already a Sar@@ k@@ oph@@ ag for the two .
&quot; the queen was agreed with the decision of their man , it was called on the message . &quot;
where Prin@@ z Hen@@ rik bury is still unclear .
but he did not have the intention to put aside in his French homeland .
prince Hen@@ rik never had a h@@ ehl that he was not happy with his title .
&quot; after the throne of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would like to have become king . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 he went to retirement , and also he sets the title &quot; &quot; prin@@ cess &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Hen@@ rik in Denmark did not get the title and function , which he wanted to see himself not as equal to his wife - even after death , called L@@ ene Ball@@ eby , the boss @-@ speaking of the Danish kingdom house . &quot;
where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old ultimately will be unclear .
&quot; but he did not have the intention to be set aside in his French homeland , but in Denmark . &quot;
he likes the land for which he has worked for over the last 50 years .
&quot; the native Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French arist@@ ocr@@ atic , who met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London . &quot;
he worked in the French Embassy in the French Embassy .
&quot; during his later woman the sympath@@ iz@@ ations of the people always flew , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his almost 50 years . &quot;
&quot; in a auto@@ biography of alien@@ ated Hen@@ rik on the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did . &quot;
&quot; my Danish was fluctu@@ ating , I preferred wine instead of beer , Seiden@@ str@@ ur@@ fs instead of kn@@ itted so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises that I booked instead of Virginia @-@ tobacco and had the reputation to be the brand of soci@@ tic intellec@@ tuals , I could not hope for sure . &quot;
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not ash@@ amed of me .
these were just two mistakes ! &quot;
Premier Wei@@ l aims for swift re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP in front of possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; precip@@ it@@ sens Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) is after the loss of red green registr@@ ations for a swift re @-@ election of the country , he does not want to step . &quot;
because he said on Friday for the resolution of the parliament .
&quot; previously , the surprising resign@@ ation of a Green parliament@@ arians from their land frac@@ ture in Lower Saxony the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) was over@@ thrown into a severe crisis . &quot;
five months before the official date of the rural elections the red @-@ green coalition lost its scar@@ ce a vote @-@ vote in the Parliament on the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the previous Green @-@ MP El@@ ke were founded their step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for choosing 2018 in her election in Rot@@ enburg ( Des@@ m@@ me ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; explained it on Friday in Hanover . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ U leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his group , to take them . &quot;
&quot; thus , CD@@ U and F@@ DP have had 69 seats in the Lower Land@@ tag , SPD and Green 68 seats . &quot;
so far the relationship was revers@@ ed .
the new Land@@ tag will be elected by the 14th of January next year .
&quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said , the red @-@ green state government should now decide whether to rule in this situation without a majority . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l does however , to be indispensable for the country &apos;s day as quickly as its self @-@ rede@@ mption . &quot;
the CD@@ U faction is expected to decide on Tuesday through its further proceedings .
&quot; the state of affairs is also the possibility of choosing the country , the Prime Minister the trust and elect a successor . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; our constitution offers several options . &quot;
&quot; these opportunities must be thoroughly insp@@ ected , &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; one will discuss in peace all the questions , if they are legally reasonable . &quot;
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler named T@@ west@@ ens step &quot; but somewhat cur@@ i@@ os . &quot;
the political leader even stressed : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
it referred to as a p@@ endant of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called for the deportation representative for the return of their land @-@ day basis .
&quot; of course , we assume that she has preserved its country list , which has preserved its country list , with immediate effect , distributed by the CEO Met@@ a J@@ ans@@ sen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; the Group president of the Green Anja P@@ iel said , &quot; &quot; We regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ ories extraordinary . &quot;
they decided to be aware of no debate in the group .
&quot; even before the background , there was no content differences , we cannot comprehend this step . &quot;
SPD ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ an@@ did@@ at Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the crossing of the Dutch Green @-@ Members of El@@ ders at the CD@@ U as betra@@ y@@ al .
&quot; the behavior of the former Green Members of Nieder@@ sachsen is not only betra@@ y@@ al to the voters and voters , but also betra@@ y@@ al to Red @-@ Green , &quot; wrote the Federal Minister of Socialists and Democrats on Facebook . &quot;
&quot; he support the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) , which quickly chose the day . &quot;
the Australian T@@ west@@ ens costs Red @-@ Green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; the policy @-@ president &quot; &quot; in its recent van@@ ity and her frustration her personal interests before the welfare of the country , &quot; cri@@ tici@@ zed SPD @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus salvation . &quot;
&quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony makes this decor@@ ating intr@@ usion game , and tries to beat out from political capital . &quot;

&quot; Land@@ dru@@ m@@ ister in the interview - How do we protect us from Gi@@ f@@ tei@@ ern , Mr. Schmidt ? &quot;
Germany is discussing about se@@ ated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect consumers .
Land@@ st@@ sm@@ Minister Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is in the interview with the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ N@@ D ) speech and answer .
Mr Schmidt ; How can the consumer protect themselves from gi@@ vers ?
&quot; I can only encourage all consumers and encourage consumers to look at the eggs in your refrigerator , and to check the st@@ emp@@ t pressure . &quot;
&quot; at the consumer protection portal www.@@ food war@@ n@@ .de , the federal states represent the latest information on the affected eggs . &quot;
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; even when according to everything we currently know , a health haz@@ ard is practically excluded . &quot;
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the enlight@@ ening of the Federal Minister does not really be perceived ?
food surveillance is the task of the Bundes@@ länder .
&quot; nevertheless , my house has come up immediately and has been on the subject of actu@@ ation in Germany in close exchange with the authorities of the countries . &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
trade has the same way the manufacturers to carry out that the sold products are busi@@ ly and health@@ ful un@@ think@@ able .
when compared with eggs of the resi@@ dual percentage of 0.@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg these are not sel@@ ectable .
un@@ load@@ able eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time not to blame the factories .
are manufacturing companies and consumers in the same boat ?
&quot; following the c@@ ursor , the production facilities meets no immediate debt . &quot;
&quot; rather , they need to reck@@ on it due to mut@@ u@@ prising illegal practices of service companies with economic damages . &quot;
as always there is a little contro@@ l@@ ure in the harvest .
is it only missing at the staff or also at the conclusi@@ ve jurisdiction ?
&quot; there were just the am@@ using controls , which have exposed the process . &quot;
&quot; however , the truth is also that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded to 100 percent . &quot;
&quot; it is precisely why it is a consequ@@ ent clarification of such events and the hand@@ over to the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office in the cases , in which criminal off@@ ences are of decisive importance . &quot;
I have already made many times a lot that I expect from the responsible authorities to educate them .
is the regular stabili@@ zers for food sk@@ and@@ als really necessary ?
consumers and consumers have the right to get safe and secure foods .
&quot; if a non @-@ approved insec@@ tici@@ de in the food sector is used , consumer , and consumers are entitled to justice . &quot;
&quot; due to the ground@@ ed resources , manufacturers , distributors and consumers come into a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
&quot; in principle it must be clear : the un@@ law@@ ful use of the insec@@ ti@@ cides , fi@@ pr@@ on@@ il in the attitude of living foods is unacceptable and must be termin@@ ated immediately . &quot;
&quot; in this case , it has to be consistent and worked with high pressure on all levels . &quot;
&quot; I expect from all the competent authorities , that the Sach@@ ver@@ er is going to grow quickly and complete . &quot;
how to operate the Treasury of football on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Mo@@ ve to Paris
&quot; the rules that aim to avoid un@@ resolved issues of European foot@@ ball@@ ers , N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Wel@@ tre@@ k@@ ord transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain does not inter@@ rupt . &quot;
&quot; any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Germain from the UEF@@ A , for the leading organization that monitors the European game has power to offer teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament . &quot;
&quot; financial Fair Play rules , which was launched in 2011 by the UEF@@ A to life , mean that PS@@ G eventually has to be financed by N@@ ey@@ mar without great losses . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona has paid 222 million Euros ( 262 millions $ ) to buy the Brazi@@ li@@ ans from his contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a sal@@ ary that will amount to several ten million dollars a year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s moving to France .
&quot; PS@@ G can make sure that N@@ ey@@ mar gives way to N@@ ey@@ mar and bring him to a galax@@ y of other stars , given the funding of the team by the energy of wealthy rulers of Qatar . &quot;
&quot; associations must pay a lot of money for the purchase of players , but must control them with legitimate sub@@ missions that allow them to make the break @-@ out point in their on the football @-@ related business . &quot;
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEF@@ A president in 2007 .
&quot; former French players believed that associations in their quest for success had taken enormous debt , effectively fr@@ aud@@ ited and risky to ruin , if banks or owners have moved their support . &quot;
in 2011 FF@@ P spread out of concentration on the debts of the clubs to monitor their losses .
&quot; the change meant that the business model , the novel Abr@@ amo@@ vi@@ ch originally used in Chelsea - a club with potential and then become more vigor@@ ous to build the crew and build a global brand - become a tough@@ er affair . &quot;
&quot; during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P pre@@ disposition period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can take losses in the amount of EUR 30 million . &quot;
&quot; and although Plat@@ ini will be fallen by the presidency in Un@@ gn@@ ade , the UEF@@ A @-@ successor to Alek@@ s@@ ander C@@ efer@@ r@@ ite will continue to be t@@ ear@@ ching from excessive expenses . &quot;
&quot; certainly FF@@ P is not dead and we are determined by the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible at the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press last week . &quot;
&quot; although the PS@@ G has paid the Buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a flat bowl , it can distribute the amount for invo@@ ices on the duration of its contract . &quot;
N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract so that the exp@@ iry date for the next five years can be found in the annual financial statements for the next five years .
&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 introduced the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions . &quot;
&quot; the PS@@ G received a series of 60 million Euros ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to 20 million euros , and it was arranged that the teams of the champi@@ ons of the season 2014 / 15 on 21 players will be limited to normal 25 players . &quot;
&quot; the UEF@@ A is in search of clubs that could attempt to over@@ l@@ ure their financial confidence by creating their revenue by companies that are connected to the owners of a club .
&quot; while a cat@@ ar@@ ic company could exceed the PS@@ G , if the value of sponsorship should exceed the standard market volume , the UEF@@ A would not apply this as legitimate income . &quot;
&quot; it was exactly what happened in 2014 , when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of the P@@ SA has been paraly@@ sed by the Qatar Tourism Authority . &quot;
&quot; it was reported that a part of PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar has been coming to N@@ ey@@ mar on payments of the Organis@@ ing Committee of World Cup 2022 , in Qatar . &quot;
but PS@@ G and Kat@@ ar 2022 have denied that N@@ ey@@ mar World amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors will be and such maneu@@ ver for the UEF@@ A regulatory authorities could simply find out .
&quot; the former sanctions against PS@@ G means that the UEF@@ A will be more attentive , every attempt to consider the rules . &quot;
&quot; the UEF@@ A had no pre @-@ prepared talks with PS@@ G about N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , say on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation . &quot;
&quot; they said under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , since they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation . &quot;
&quot; the latest published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 generated sales of € 54@@ 2,@@ 4 million euros a profit of more than 10 million euros . &quot;
the accounts for the final financial year have to be published yet .
PS@@ G expects that N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrival a blessing for Sponsor@@ ing @-@ De@@ als , merch@@ an@@ dis@@ ing and Tri@@ kot@@ ds . &quot;
the Association assumes that sales will increase by at least 30 percent after signing up at least 30 percent .
&quot; the Spanish League was clearly ir@@ ri@@ pped , one of the best foot@@ ball@@ ers go to see , and tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s way@@ marks by claiming that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear fall of &quot; &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the President of the La Liga , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily newspaper AS in relation to Qatar . &quot;
&quot; arsen@@ al Manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La Liga against a state which is financed by an association . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of the owner and that has changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; it will be very difficult to respect the Financial Fair@@ play , because one walks different ways or have different interests when a country has such a big player to represent a country . &quot;

nostal@@ gia goes in &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; in the N@@ ic
&quot; this re@@ petition of history is at the same time nost@@ alg@@ ically because of the glorious days of the characters of 80 @-@ he years , for the 90 @-@ year @-@ gr@@ edy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV rot@@ ten ) , and for himself - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , such as Elizabeth B@@ anks , Amy Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Rud@@ d went to larger things . &quot;
&quot; as a cultural arti@@ facts , it is equally a par@@ ody and an em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era permanent memories . &quot;
&quot; but as a fran@@ chise , it feels like the time would be close . &quot;
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; worked surprisingly well , not only because of its absurd Hum@@ ors ( it contained an original story for a speaking D@@ ose vegetables that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on the core of the day - actor average age play mental children , who will grow , they still have the im@@ possibility to win the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es . &quot;
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater &quot; , with his adult , who are now playing adults , is less emotional rooted and his par@@ ody goes more according to the found@@ ries films of the 90 @-@ he years like &quot; The Hand , the Cr@@ adle &quot; ( &quot; The Hand , which satur@@ ates the cradle &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in a point , a character by a Apple @-@ Power@@ Book , some In@@ line Sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
&quot; the gr@@ acious C@@ oop ( Mr. Sho@@ wal@@ ter ) , now Roman@@ aut@@ or , has K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) still does not forget . &quot;
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has still not lost its vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is still another crazy mal@@ ign@@ ant plot that is involved in the Ronald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Sho@@ wal@@ ter ) who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good successful impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always the ex@@ ology of the best part of the fran@@ chise are .
&quot; it is especially fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rud@@ d , the Matt D@@ avi@@ at@@ ee of &quot; Sing@@ les &quot; shows , whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy is now like an old squ@@ acker . &quot;
&quot; it is the moments of acci@@ dental ins@@ anity , that could show this fran@@ chise , like a sort of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series , until he achieved what I will show as his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ ET Hot American Summer : &quot; his final scene will show the gang of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; at Amazon now reminds of a different kind of nostal@@ gia : to the revival of the Cold War by &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even on &quot; &quot; G@@ low &quot; &quot; with his East @-@ West Ring@@ ch @-@ I@@ KON@@ O@@ G@@ RAPH@@ IE . &quot;
&quot; the com@@ edy inspired by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka has been a director with rh@@ ys Thomas as a director : a Romanian drama of the eight@@ een years with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Bucharest , who fight for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the way of Marxism @-@ Lenin@@ ism . &quot;

it is an ingeni@@ ous idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
&quot; there are some beautiful g@@ ags to watch ( the police spends the time to watch chess on TV , how Americans might do with football ) . &quot;
&quot; and the list of famous speakers - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick offer@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - ensures a decent game &apos; finding the voice &apos; . &quot;
&quot; but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is very committed to the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a ver@@ dubi@@ ous propaganda Dr@@ amas - a mur@@ derer who carries a Re@@ agan mask is included - that it is often played like a single one .
&quot; with six long episodes , it runs along , and the com@@ edy is not fast or frequent enough . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; which was re@@ acted to a lower length , his ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p @-@ S@@ ati@@ re could deliver better , as Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef always present the American Embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who is a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot;
the message for the imag@@ ining communist public is that the western culture can make everything for the food for a money .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian creators were not wrong : we even make it with our own younger history and with thei@@ rs .
blow against drugs @-@ Mafia in the country
the police is a blow against the Italian Mafia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; on the Mit@@ tw@@ och@@ tomorrow in the Black @-@ B@@ aar district , in red @-@ edge , Con@@ stance , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart are looking for numerous objects such as the prosec@@ utor &apos;s pro@@ secution on Friday . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , 15 signs were arrested in the age between the ages of 25 and 77 , and the arrest warran@@ t was issued against them . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the officials created greater amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , shr@@ ubs , as well as several hundred thousand Euros . &quot;
at the same raid in Italy two people were arrested .
against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans there were German arrest warran@@ t .
the two will therefore be delivered to Germany presum@@ ably .
in the action Italian and Bay@@ erische Se@@ er participated .
a total of more than 300 polic@@ emen were used in operation .
&quot; the members of the Mafia will be organised crime crimin@@ ality , severe violence , tried murder as well as rob@@ bery and ext@@ or@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; since summer 2016 , the Public Prosec@@ utor &apos;s Office is determined against organised drug trading in the South @-@ German region . &quot;
&quot; between the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office in Con@@ stance and Palermo , a re@@ ger exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the major player was accompanied by four officials from Palermo on Wednesday morning . &quot;
&quot; in the vision@@ aries of the investigations , especially Italian nation@@ als with closer reference to the Italian Mafia . &quot;
&quot; even an incident on 27 May in Hü@@ fingen , at the early morning several shots were picked up in a restaurant , is likely to go to the bank account of the gang . &quot;
fashion lam@@ ents great gaps in the foreig@@ ner @-@ Register
&quot; data of citizens , which should not arise as &quot; : a report that points the foreig@@ ner register in Germany has substantial shortcomings . &quot;
the lead to partly gra@@ zing lack of failure in asylum @-@ procedures .
&quot; the authorised for the refugee management of the German Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen , has been made aware of a media report on large gaps in the country @-@ country register . &quot;
&quot; defects in the data stored there may result in asylum @-@ procedures and deport@@ ations &quot; to some serious failure @-@ decisions , &quot; war@@ ned in an analysis that the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to the register , there are some ten million people with foreign nation@@ als , including 5,@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries . &quot;
the data is therefore managed by about 600 exhibitors in Germany .
&quot; because the data has not been sufficiently maintained , the data quality in parts has not been well maintained . &quot;
&quot; in individual cases , data from 1921 have been found , &quot; &quot; by people who have long been no longer in life , or of citizens who have become the German citizen , and actually should not arise in the register . &quot;
&quot; faul@@ ty data codes can significantly slow back processes , the report is called for further . &quot;
&quot; in statistics about un@@ paid people , the EU citizens are over , who would not have to travel out . &quot;
&quot; but such false inter@@ rup@@ tions led &quot; &quot; to a distor@@ ted debate on dealing with excer@@ pts , &quot; it is therefore in the analysis . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the federal government has started to return to Italy with 16 @-@ year children to return to Italy if they are submitted by there . &quot;
&quot; this relates to the internal paper of the Bundes@@ am@@ ts for migration and refugees ( BAM@@ F ) , the &quot; &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ ak@@ er Zeitung &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the paper , it is therefore called the BAM@@ F lead such a method &quot; regarding families with children - with the exception of inf@@ ants and inf@@ ants - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; since the end of 2014 , it was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper under reference to the difficult situation on site . &quot;
&quot; after the Dublin agreement , the EU state is responsible for refugees in the EU . &quot;
&quot; if a migration flows into another EU @-@ country , this state can withdraw him into the rei@@ rei@@ sel@@ and . &quot;
&quot; for reason , I write Office now : &quot; in the meantime the recording capacity for families with minor children in Italy greatly increased . &quot;
Italy made a guarantee for the recording and accommodation of family guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( E@@ GM@@ R ) consider this pl@@ edges for sufficient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other EU countries would have to get back to refugees during the Dublin agreement . &quot;
&quot; the Interior political speaker of the Lin@@ ks@@ fr@@ action in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , cri@@ tici@@ zed this decision : &quot; families with children thre@@ aten the shortcomings in the Italian asylum system of human rights , and a threat to the child &apos;s lifestyle . &quot;
second result is achieved
&quot; a total of 220 lit@@ res of blood made by in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach , the blood flow was already available for other people . &quot;
&quot; at least by the twelve citizens , who were awarded on Friday . &quot;
&quot; in all the progres@@ sing , Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who has now told about 50 lit@@ res of blood in the meantime . &quot;
&quot; traditionally , the congregation in the meeting of the community is the multiple readiness to don@@ ate blood . &quot;
&quot; it is awesome how our body is created for it and we z@@ ish the sp@@ ans respect that their blood for stran@@ gers are available , even un@@ sel@@ fish , under@@ lined Mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; a single blood @-@ end helps several people , &quot; explained the circular director of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Ma@@ is@@ enb@@ acher , because the preser@@ ves are composed into their constitu@@ ents . &quot;
so three people could benefit from a blood flow .
&quot; at the same time , Ma@@ is@@ enb@@ acher reported by the actions that were carried out in the spring in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; this year we achieved with 114 sp@@ en@@ dern the second best result , &quot; said the DR@@ K @-@ circular conductor . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the change into the theatre house has led to higher number of participants a few years ago . &quot;
&quot; before , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Di@@ ck , and Met@@ a Re@@ eber@@ ries to the multi @-@ luggage and were awarded for 50 % of charge . &quot;

the Bank of England will keep the interest rates of 0,25 %
&quot; the Bank of England will likely announce that the interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation , spec@@ ulations have taken over a rise above . &quot;
&quot; the Bank of England has war@@ ned that the economic growth &quot; &quot; income &quot; &quot; will remain when they insist on family interest rates in the middle of a intensi@@ fying pressure . &quot;
&quot; the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 to keep the interest rates on 0.25 % , whereas in this month the weak economic growth increases the support for an increase . &quot;
&quot; in its quar@@ terly report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 on 1,6 % and war@@ ned that pressure on household income would continue to rise in just under 3 % . &quot;
&quot; but they sign@@ alized that in the next few years Zin@@ ser@@ ca@@ vities would be necessary to grow by the Bre@@ xit , and she said that the l@@ ending costs may be more than expected to go on the financial markets . &quot;
&quot; the members also agreed to withdraw part of the M@@ amm@@ ut @-@ economic growth , which was published a year after Bre@@ xit . &quot;
&quot; it will request time for finance plan to provide financial resources for banks , even though said , that now it is expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds . &quot;
&quot; minutes after deciding on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central progn@@ osis of the M@@ PC the brood @-@ domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak , since the pressure on the real income of households will continue to use consumption . &quot;
&quot; to the interest rates they repeated , that &quot; &quot; a certain stress of monetary policy &quot; for the cooling of inflation and a &quot; somewhat greater &quot; scale would be needed than the markets are expected . &quot;
the markets forecasts for the first rise in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; the bank stressed however , that enh@@ ancements &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; limited &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the growth forecasts of the Bank for this and next year are in comparison to the 1.9 % in May forecast for 1.9 % and 1.1 % .
it has retained its growth forecasts for 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell after this news opposite the dollar and the euro .
the Po@@ unds fell by 0,5 % on the US dollar and fell around 0.3 % to 1.11 euros .
&quot; the decision does not come to any change after the recent disappointing growth , the rising expectations on a Zin@@ ser@@ ge@@ tic reduction , and GDP has risen in the second quarter of 0,@@ 2 % in the previous three months on 0.7 % . &quot;
growth is expected to recover in the third quarter although it is easy to recover after the Bank at the end of the year .
&quot; the most recent in@@ flow report offered little enthusiasm for households that will be affected by a rising inflation and low inflation , as the tight@@ ening is first worse before it will get better . &quot;
&quot; she added that monetary policy in the coming years can not prevent &quot; &quot; income &quot; &quot; but she added that wages to end their three @-@ year forecast &quot; will be clear . &quot;
&quot; the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is attri@@ but@@ able to the weak , which is part of the lower consumption . &quot;
&quot; the decision comes from a year after lowering interest rates on 0,25 % in the last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the s@@ ham of the cut . &quot;
the Bank appreci@@ ates that it will probably last four years until this will achieve the prices and the economy .
&quot; before the last judgment of the bank to the interest rates the reputation was increased after a Zin@@ ser@@ rate , as inflation increased the pressure on harsh households , with three political decision @-@ makers in July a rise to 0,5 % . &quot;
&quot; the inflation has dropped from 2,@@ 9 % in June to 2.9 % in June , although the Bank said that this was expected and put them back in the coming months . &quot;
&quot; the Bank said the exc@@ eeding in relation to their goal of 2 % be &quot; &quot; to the weak pounds . &quot;
&quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director at Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; &quot; given the shorter back of s@@ wap arrangements , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be more competitive again since the len@@ ders should listen to shops and end the year in a positive way . &quot;
&quot; the market is particularly good for those in which the existing dealer running and the new mort@@ g@@ ages complete , and many with toll free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . &quot;
&quot; N@@ HS ( The National Health Service ) is supposed to write as controversial of 10,000 people &quot;
patients will be obtained from September after a fight against the financing of the drug in N@@ HS access to a &quot; trans@@ forming &quot; HIV prevention treatment .
&quot; N@@ HS England announced that one prior to the sexual intercourse prevention of prophy@@ la@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the inf@@ ectivity risk by around 86 percent , now being delivered from health service to a first three @-@ year studies for estimated 10,000 people . &quot;
&quot; he explained to finance the process after the Ap@@ pe@@ al Court has confirmed the verdi@@ ct of the Supreme Court of Justice in the last year , the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it . &quot;
&quot; the announced announced on Thursday by N@@ HS England leader Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as &quot; important new intervention &quot; , &quot; during the National Aids Trust ( NA@@ T ) . &quot;
&quot; sexual health clinics in London , Bright@@ on , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield are among the first belong to the registration of people and further clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced in April 2018 . &quot;
prophy@@ lac@@ tic prophy@@ la@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV supplements which are taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
&quot; studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduced the HIV transmission in Inf@@ ection , significantly . &quot;
take pre@@ p in front of intercourse means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection .
such drugs may be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse .
&quot; to those who come for treatment in question belong to gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexual and persons with HIV @-@ positive partners who were not successfully treated successfully . &quot;
&quot; clinics are identified suitable participants identified by the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status will not be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment . &quot;
&quot; people who live in England and registered with a doctor , can also register for possible participation in their local participating sex clinic . &quot;
the program is signed £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract for the supply of medicines in this week after an international competitive procurement .
&quot; the study aims to judge the full potential of pre@@ p , as clinical evidence as it is applied in large scale , and is implemented . &quot;
&quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should complement the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts for prevention of HIV . &quot;
it is another milestone in which more than three decades continued progress in cop@@ ing with one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot;
&quot; Deborah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National Aids Trust ) , said : &quot; &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ p , when it is targeted at needs and vulnerable people , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; from September to people with high HIV risk access to this N@@ HS funded attempt to develop a new instrument , which is really individually controlled and is not subject to a trial with a partner that leads to improving many , many lives . &quot;
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; Ian Green , CEO of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; the priority must now be conducted in the entire country and that no one that has left a risk for HIV . &quot;
&quot; now , since the pre@@ p @-@ test medicine was coated , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV . &quot;
&quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , shadow @-@ Health Minister , said : &quot; &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p process is welcome after months of delay and hes@@ it@@ ative implementation by the government and over@@ due . &quot;
the evidence show how transform@@ ative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to the understanding of the benefits of pre@@ p .
&quot; now it is important that this study is done as fast as possible in the entire country to protect people who are infected to protect HIV , and that it will contribute to the termination of the prolifer@@ ation of HIV in society . &quot;
the great life live : mezzanine and cl@@ ever@@ e designer @-@ tricks have turned this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a generous home
&quot; Jo@@ anne L@@ eig@@ h , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , reduced from a large house in K@@ night@@ s@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court Apartment . &quot;
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it &apos;s a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne does not packed their bags and sold out .
&quot; before that I lived with my ex in K@@ night@@ s@@ bridge in a much larger area , &quot; says Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; I sought after something , that was comparable to my price . &quot;
&quot; this apartment was shown in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ceilings . &quot;
I loved it in love and made an offer on that day . &quot;
&quot; since the first visit , the 1,000 square @-@ square large apartment was completely out@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; originally a one @-@ room estate with a wel@@ ded layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add a anne &apos;s storage space , and a mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height . &quot;
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot;
&quot; that was my request , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; to this end , she commissioned the architectural and designer studio Duck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill , to take advantage of 12,@@ 5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development , but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; the ceiling was not big enough to place two spaces , so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine where you could stand . &quot;
Er@@ fan had to be creative thinking to release the award .
&quot; the steel plant is rather complicated , &quot; explained . &quot;
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were over@@ bed , without having had to gaps . &quot;
&quot; it was not just about building a simple platform , but the steel so that he had the right height for the top or bottom . &quot;
&quot; this arrangement enabled it to place Er@@ fan , two rooms in full height - with plenty of extra drama . &quot;
for the mezzanine looks a classic coupl@@ ing window of Retro@@ u@@ vi@@ us over the gl@@ am@@ orous living area .
sc@@ anned gold furniture , sil@@ ber@@ ne Ak@@ z@@ ente and Vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille ill@@ um@@ ination set the style for the program . &quot;
&quot; the use of mir@@ rors plays a role in addition to theatre , space and light . &quot;
at both ends is a short cor@@ ridor to let him rest longer .
in the kitchen the mir@@ rors feels like a window into another room .
at the entrance offer pi@@ ped units space for all Best@@ angles and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
&quot; due to the perception of a gl@@ am@@ orous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used . &quot;
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a challenge .
&quot; a bit of engineering @-@ art went out , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the st@@ ahl@@ reinforced , terrible M@@ DF @-@ door . &quot;
&quot; it is essential , so it is when you move the door very easily sli@@ ps . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could win additional 16 m ² , one extra bedroom and a improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the basic space - or how your property is estimated , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate mak@@ ler will advocate and a calculation based on the ground floor . &quot;
&quot; here they managed to enlarge the ground floor , and at the same time use high quality materials to make the room its luxurious advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things you touch and who therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; you do not forget you into the electric plugs in the walls .
&quot; they are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can be turned out by a good design and increased square met@@ ering number from something by default in something very astonishing .
&quot; in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave . &quot;
brothers fight for a 500 million US dollars .
&quot; two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the Dyn@@ asty , in a dispute because of one of the biggest real estate imperative Vict@@ ori@@ as worth over 500 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton football club &apos; and developers Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he brought him to the Supreme Court to clear how their property and their business can be divided . &quot;
&quot; Paul did not want to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp argument about the separation takes place in the Supreme Court of Justice . &quot;
&quot; together with her mother Anna , the brothers have collected 38 properties in the value of more than half a billion dollars , since the family 1973 purchased a business in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood . &quot;
&quot; there , the West@@ co Je@@ ans founded the family of West@@ co Je@@ ans and grew to a chain of 160 retail outlets . &quot;
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
&quot; this money was inv@@ ests in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis now comprises offices in the city center , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt . &quot;
&quot; according to an agreement with her late father , Col@@ in - by Paul as &quot; main operator and the domin@@ ating personality &quot; in the family De Lu@@ tis - about two thirds of the business life and Paul about a third . &quot;
a jurisdiction that this means that Col@@ in property has a value of 316 million dollars and Paul worth $ 176 million .
the division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul as a problem .
&quot; the divisions proposed by Col@@ in proposed departments have left it with what I kept for the best objects , in 2015 he wrote in a first Aff@@ id@@ av@@ it . &quot;
&quot; on the last Friday , after several failed plac@@ ements took place the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice . &quot;
&quot; the brothers now also fight for control over the existing business - of which Col@@ in , as Paul claims that he excluded him . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in argu@@ ed this is not true , but casts Paul before , some pos@@ sessions in@@ competent . &quot;
&quot; in an early Aff@@ id@@ av@@ it , which was filed by Col@@ in , he says he hope to present the dispute . &quot;

&quot; the costs rise in the case , with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports of companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , including All@@ an My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and by both sides of the law firm . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her negoti@@ able husband Luigi were Italian immigrants , the dairy bars and delic@@ acy operations in the late 1950 &apos;s years and in the early se@@ ven@@ ties bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick . &quot;
&quot; they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property , opened in the Col@@ in the first je@@ ans of the family . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in says that he began West@@ co , when he was in my last years of high school , when Paul was still a small child ( approximately 10 years old ) . &quot;
&quot; Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hop@@ ed to pass their property to their sons in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted to land the brethren , &quot; wrote them . &quot;
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of De Lu@@ tis Group , whereby Col@@ in claims that Mark after leaving the company 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; both Luke and Mark are , Paul &quot; says about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in has very re@@ held , although he was a former AF@@ L lecture member and after a biography of 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of the television stars . &quot;
Fair@@ fax Media took contact with Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyer .
&quot; only Col@@ in answering by SMS to say &quot; &quot; I really cannot say much &quot; &quot; because the case before the courts is . &quot;
&quot; it is very , very sad that my brother has decided to complain and pull our family name through the courts , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of 2016 , Col@@ in in writing to the court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother . &quot;
&quot; our father did not say that Paul and I would end in our current dispute , &quot; he said and added that he still hope for a solution . &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; our affair will be solved in the near future of the courts , &quot; wrote Col@@ in . &quot;
Tru@@ mp@@ s new St@@ ef is planning to limit the media @-@ ab@@ stin@@ ence of the President .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do .
&quot; if so , he will be the first . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ tico tells that the new St@@ ef of the White House is planning , limiting the flow of information on President Tru@@ mp - including the reports of the news media - in the hope to keep the boss on a discounted course . &quot;
here is a piece of re@@ por@@ ter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new St@@ ef of the White House , participated in his first working day with leading employees , he set a main problem in President Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s White House which he wants to repair : bad information that got into the hands of the president . &quot;
&quot; Kelly said the employees , that information about him should flow through him - whether on paper or in letters , because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot;
&quot; Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to en@@ ame Tru@@ mp by monitor its media advis@@ es . &quot;
&quot; President Tru@@ mp@@ s relationship to TV ranges past decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his TV is still strong . &quot;
&quot; if cont@@ at Tru@@ mp was anno@@ yed because of a fair reporting was it productive to show him that he was a fair reporting of jobs received , &quot; &quot; said the former election campaign Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February to the Poli@@ tico . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; the key , Tru@@ mp@@ s Twitter custom made under control , according to six former voting officers , to ensure that his personal media offer includes a steady lob@@ b@@ room . &quot;
okay .
&quot; but the idea that Tru@@ mp@@ s Twitter are ever &quot; under control &quot; , &quot; is ridicul@@ ous . &quot;
perhaps this campaign was something we don &apos;t know - that Tru@@ mp@@ s T@@ we@@ ets were not included even more ig@@ nition .
we will probably never experience something about the twe@@ et who has not sent Tru@@ mp .
&quot; if his staff have already made it a few times , anger of him , then their efforts have been worthwhile . &quot;
but no one has consistently prevent it that Tru@@ mp is derived .
&quot; part of the problem consists of that people in a white house , composed of competing parties , always try to advance their own agenda by creating Tru@@ mp Material that could possibly create their views from the world . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ tico - quite busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of consultants , the president for strategic reasons . &quot;
this was an example that was described by Repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane gold maker :
&quot; current and former Tru@@ mp @-@ Beam@@ te say that Tru@@ mp can react to negative press , especially those with sham@@ eful le@@ aks , and that he is trying to find out where these come . &quot;
&quot; this happened at the end of February , when someone gave the president mal@@ icious one printed copy of an article by Got@@ new@@ .com , the website of the Internet @-@ Prov@@ ok@@ at@@ eurs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the dep@@ uty St@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; the source behind a bunch of Lec@@ ks in the White House . &quot;
&quot; although Johnson due to Schi@@ can@@ es permanently from Twitter , or that he has no concrete evidence offered or that he vo@@ iced in the past false accus@@ ations and re@@ vo@@ ke them . &quot;
Tru@@ mp read the article and started to ask employees about Wal@@ sh .
&quot; added that the dam@@ al Stab@@ ur@@ ef Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the Tru@@ mp . &quot;
how did this work ?
Kelly tries three months later to do the same .
&quot; perhaps he will prove to be the most effective manager as Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tru@@ mp is still its impul@@ si@@ ves self , and his advis@@ ors still strive for influence . &quot;
this un@@ changing factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
Mei@@ st@@ ges@@ u@@ ked crimin@@ als get post by Euro@@ pol
&quot; since the address is unknown , Mi@@ th@@ ilfe of the population will pray and hopes . &quot;
the police in all of Europe sends this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards to dangerous crimin@@ als on the run .
&quot; since the addresses of the sear@@ ched heavy bur@@ gl@@ ars are not known , they are hop@@ ed from the population and pray . &quot;
&quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the action , which follows the &quot; &quot; EU Most W@@ anted &quot; &quot; calendar of winter . &quot;
the experiences could have shown that a lot of fl@@ atter@@ ing to holiday places were hiding , it was called by Euro@@ pol . &quot;
I have compiled 21 post@@ cards for sc@@ ary crimin@@ als from 21 EU countries .
&quot; since 2016 , the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ asis has been viewed , more than 2.5 million times has been viewed . &quot;
&quot; 36 of the online deposits could be arrested , at least eleven of them due to execution according to publication on the website . &quot;
travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; Million@@ aire @-@ Series &apos;
&quot; some of the weal@@ thi@@ est land@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands stand again with some strong travelers on the war , which had negotiated one of the municipality of drawn dit@@ ch to a field in front of their man@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; travelers have their 20 carav@@ ans on a field outside of a wealthy road of Soli@@ h@@ ull , which is called &quot; &quot; million@@ aire @-@ series &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they have brought horses , babies and a army of tran@@ sports , after they were raised in May , without being de@@ ported from the Council to prevent their accidents . &quot;
&quot; the tac@@ kled group found a gap in the defense units and pressing their vehicles through a section , which remained un@@ hin@@ der to find a way . &quot;
&quot; angry inhabitants have ur@@ ges the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull , who said it &quot; useless be to deal with the problem . &quot;
&quot; an anonymous inhabitants said , &quot; They have moved there on Monday , after they were sent by Bentley He@@ ath , where they were cast into the pas@@ sers . &quot;
&quot; the Council has to be forced by shame on the implementation of the implementation , since it was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot;
the travelers were there in May there were moved and are now back .
&quot; more came yesterday evening , probably still more . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to deal with it by keeping long instruction to protect their parks . &quot;
&quot; I live on the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I am not happy to pay my congreg@@ ations to pay , if the Council cannot even stop it . &quot;
&quot; a resident who wanted not to be called said , &quot; &quot; It is ridicul@@ ous , we just have seen the last round of these travelers , just to be pl@@ aten from another round . &quot;
the numbers have increased this time and you even saw a horse in the parking area .
&quot; a spokes@@ person of the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull said : &quot; &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the country beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps so that they will continue as quickly as possible . &quot;
&quot; to support our evidence collection , it is very important that as many employers want to report an anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police by calling 101 . &quot;
&quot; this helps to create an image of the situation in which the court must check , when we will present our case . &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof is Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof is the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stadt is currently being renovated and will be opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
&quot; because with the closing of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof by the dam@@ al ambi@@ ance , the 13th April 2014 was lost during the 13th of April 2014 , during the time of 30 000 nights per year and also received revenue by the tourist tax . &quot;
&quot; in the autumn of 2014 , in view of the dramatic numbers of refugees who arrived in the district , the hotel building offered to Land@@ rat@@ eur as an accommodation accommodation , which was provided for contro@@ versy discussions . &quot;
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers by setting up a construction plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disp@@ uted at that time in the municipal council .
&quot; but above all the Freu@@ den@@ stadt of Ober@@ thal , Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location and spoke at that time of serious interested people at the house . &quot;
he should be right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ otels with headquarters in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern has acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of three @-@ star plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter building four houses .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
&quot; you hot Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; at the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof are standing in front of the entrance , and when one enters the house , becomes clear what extensive renov@@ ations will be done . &quot;
&quot; the so@@ ils have been ej@@ ected , blankets to the part devi@@ ded , old bath@@ tu@@ bs from the rooms . &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
until March there is still much to do .
&quot; it is actually a lovely place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
everything is supposed to be renewed in the Black style .
&quot; the rooms are equipped with large gif@@ ted showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , there will be new windows . &quot;
&quot; everything later &quot; &quot; beautiful brus@@ g@@ ern@@ ah , &quot; &quot; how Thomas Sch@@ erer express . &quot;
&quot; we want to make a jewelry piece . &quot;
&quot; the pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the equipment . &quot;
&quot; one does not want to position on the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already at a up@@ scale downtown level , empha@@ sized Sch@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms set up wide , explains Sch@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; individual holi@@ day@@ makers , groups or busin@@ ess@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel . &quot;
discussions with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourism @-@ Director Michael Kr@@ ause he has already led so .
the ideas of the city are the same with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; after the amount of investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer will not decide exactly . &quot;
&quot; just under a million euros , he expects . &quot;
&quot; the outdoor facilities are also brought to for@@ ested , that is already clearly visible . &quot;
&quot; a large patio is created in a courtyard , which is open to the restaurant , which is public . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ aires : us @-@ Sonder@@ burg sets Grand Jury
in Russia @-@ Aff@@ aires at US @-@ President Donald Tru@@ mp is supposed to have applied special investig@@ ator Robert Mu@@ eller after a report a so @-@ called Grand Jury .
&quot; the panel have recorded the work in recent weeks , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; on appeal to the matter . &quot;
the paper praised the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller has extended its investigations and intensified .
the transm@@ itter CN@@ N reported it already give the first preliminary statements of the body in connection with a meeting between Tru@@ mp@@ s and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. intelligence services compl@@ ain@@ able the Krem@@ lin for longer to det@@ ained in the presidential campaign 2016 .
Mu@@ eller investig@@ ates whether there were coll@@ usion between Tru@@ mp@@ s elect@@ oral team and Moscow .
&quot; in the focus of investigations , several men are supposed to stand in the election campaign as a consultant of the Republi@@ cans . &quot;
&quot; according to that , Mu@@ eller also took more and more Tru@@ mp@@ s priv@@ ates and business environment under the magni@@ fier . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the special issue of Tru@@ mp personally have moved into the center and I am looking for the accus@@ ation whether the president in the course of the affair could hin@@ ders the judiciary . &quot;
the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys is to consider this evidence in possible inter@@ rup@@ tions and decide whether accus@@ ation should be raised .
Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore also called charges .
&quot; mostly , they are switched on , when it comes to bigger and contro@@ versy . &quot;
the procedure is always done behind closed doors .
the panel can also be switched from the pro@@ secution to prosec@@ utor people in order to pre@@ di@@ ct people under e@@ id .
&quot; according to the radio station CN@@ N already issued lectures , the meeting between Donald Tru@@ mp J@@ R. and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
people who were involved in the meeting were called to a statement called it in the report .
&quot; moreover , they should provide documents . &quot;
besides Tru@@ mp J@@ R. also were Tru@@ mp@@ s consultants and swi@@ eg@@ ers@@ ohn Jar@@ ed K@@ ush@@ ner and his dam@@ al elect@@ oral minister Paul Man@@ a@@ fort in conversation with us .
&quot; legal experts said on Thursday night on Thursday night , that the creation show that Mu@@ eller does not let yourself be shy in his work and that he should be necessary to act quickly . &quot;
&quot; however , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned at the end to decide about the survey of an indic@@ t@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the removal of the body is the start of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for president Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the new revelations , the President on Thursday night gave a speech in West Virginia to present Russia &apos;s affair as a campaign of its political opponents . &quot;
&quot; the Russia @-@ story is a total invention , &quot; said Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; the topic give the democr@@ ats a way to feel &quot; good , &quot; because they have nothing else about whom they can talk . &quot;
his special consultant T@@ y Cob@@ b declared in an opinion he wis@@ se nothing from the creation of a Grand Jury .
&quot; but this work also usually work in secret , stressed . &quot;
the White House feared all measures which accelerated the work of the special agent in a fair &quot; way accelerated .
the former F@@ BI @-@ Chef James Com@@ ey told three times that it will not be determined against the President .
&quot; I have no reason to accept that something changed , it was in the explanation . &quot;
&quot; Mu@@ eller was only used , after Tru@@ mp Com@@ ey had been filmed . &quot;
&quot; because of this gro@@ oming , alleg@@ ations of Tru@@ mp were loud , he had to hin@@ der the judiciary . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ey said in June before a Senate Committee , Tru@@ mp made him an adjustment of the investigation against the former national security consultant Michael Fl@@ ynn . &quot;
the president stands under great pressure because of the examination .
after portr@@ ay@@ al of US media sam@@ pled the White House material against the special medium and its employees .
the lö@@ y spec@@ ulation on it from whether Tru@@ mp Mu@@ eller is dischar@@ ged .
&quot; unlike an independent special event of Congress such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair , as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate Aff@@ aires in order to return the later back President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has folded a position in which he could be filmed in the President of the President of the Federal Ministry . &quot;
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to bend such a step but prev@@ ent@@ able .
&quot; two groups of Republi@@ can and democratic broad@@ cast@@ ers set on Thursday , after which the special issue could not be released so easily . &quot;
Antarc@@ tic : gigantic ic@@ eberg drives in the Antarc@@ tic
in the West@@ ant@@ ark@@ tis one has been a gigantic ic@@ eberg from the scar@@ f size of Berlin from Schel@@ del@@ and .
this shared the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ Weg@@ ener Institute for Polar@@ - and seafood on Wednesday .
&quot; the size of about a Bil@@ lion tons of heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometers large Col@@ oured is now coming to the north and will probably be two , three years until he was mel@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; over the past three decades , it is registered with 175 kilometers of length and width of up to 50 kilometers , the researchers have registered over the past three decades . &quot;
there is no danger to people coming from him .
&quot; however , climate change has played a role in the break@@ down of the ice age , is unclear according to research . &quot;
&quot; however , it has been a series of unusual break@@ downs of ice cream in the region for about 30 years , writes the US research center for snow and ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a fact . &quot;
&quot; according to many researchers , this can be connected to the heating up . &quot;
the now ab@@ ro@@ ch@@ ene Kol@@ oss had been part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ del@@ and so far .
Schel@@ del@@ and flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by large gl@@ aci@@ ers .
it is thus increasing in the ocean and breaks out regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ del@@ s is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarc@@ tic Peninsula .
North of this Shel@@ ving was the balance of w@@ ax@@ les and Ab@@ om@@ iting several years ago .
a complete shake was to fall there , writes AW@@ I @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; I speak some things that also the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ del@@ ine is in danger , for the more advanced se@@ ams have never been with@@ drawn as far as at present . &quot;
&quot; moreover , stand up the ice plate under tension and can be dis@@ integrate , in case a key@@ point place a piece . &quot;
&quot; the mel@@ ting of Shel@@ ters and ic@@ eberg increases the sea level , as they swim on the water and pus@@ hes ice as much water as it comes after the mel@@ ting itself . &quot;
&quot; however , the loss of Schel@@ del@@ ine leads to the gl@@ aci@@ ers directly into the ocean and can flow a lot faster than before . &quot;
&quot; that could possibly increase the sea level , but only in the low extent , the British research project writes about the observation of the Antarc@@ tic ( MI@@ DAS ) . &quot;
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ del@@ ine is according to AW@@ I @-@ data with almost 50 000 square kilometres , the fourth quarter of the Antarc@@ tic . &quot;
&quot; on the transfer from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , on the front edge to the open ocean around 200 meters . &quot;
there it breaks out regularly .
&quot; although there is a natural happening and no direct connection to climate change is conscious , the ice cream comes into a dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British Sw@@ an@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the wid@@ est retreat since the beginning of the records , &quot; he also confirmed . &quot;
&quot; under scientists be disp@@ uted whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ del@@ ine will now grow back in the long term , and possibly together , his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last decades .
&quot; even if these researchers make the break@@ down of this gigantic ic@@ eberg not on climate change , so in the past few decades , a lot of ice sk@@ ul@@ ls of the ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula are broken . &quot;
this long afternoon of Antarc@@ tica covers the direction of South America .
&quot; according to data from the British Antarc@@ tic Survey , the iron area of the Antarc@@ tic Peninsula has declined around 28 000 square kilometers . &quot;
&quot; in the decline , the temperature resistance has contributed . &quot;
&quot; in the past 50 years , the Antarc@@ tic Peninsula have passed around three degree by round about three degrees and en@@ umer@@ ate the areas where the temperature is at the fastest . &quot;
CD@@ U wants Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f at the staff
&quot; because it becomes increasingly difficult , to occupy the free places , calls for the CD@@ U to res@@ ign from the employer @-@ association to become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; only shortly before the summer break , the roundabout 41 new positions in the administration has been established . &quot;
more than 1100 An@@ ders and officials work for the office in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now even 17 trainees have their first working day .
the teacher at the circle are obviously very re@@ vered .
around 620 applications were to be processed for the places this year .
&quot; nevertheless , the circle is still lacking staff to cope with the asc@@ ended requirements and tasks . &quot;
&quot; at present , it is still standing by the Circle M@@ ett@@ mann in the case of 50 not connected places . &quot;
&quot; among other things , doctors and engineers , as well as the forces of the general administration . &quot;
the CD@@ U would now like to take the initiative with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG initiative and the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
the management shall work according to the desire of the parties &quot; a concept for recruitment and personnel development . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to cover not only short @-@ term need for professionals , but future @-@ oriented of the applicants . &quot;
&quot; the overall concept should be based on the inside and outside , concrete measures for cross @-@ clim@@ bers and involve a training course , calling CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot;
this sounds like a good approach .
for the circle has to do with staff problems that one didn &apos;t know before .
other cities advertise good officials and offer more attractive conditions .
the speech is from a regul@@ ating &quot; competition of public employers . &quot;
&quot; this includes a high number of employees , the disease or altern@@ ating effect from the service . &quot;
&quot; so high time to action , so that no longer places remain un@@ occupied . &quot;
&quot; however , Klaus @-@ Dieter peoples , leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the joint motion by his party . &quot;
he had recently succeeded in the roundabout for a lazy surprise when he asked the human cost @-@ coating and the rest of the parties were intri@@ gu@@ ed .
&quot; people want to be reviewed all possibilities , which enable the resign@@ ation from the municipal working @-@ association . &quot;
&quot; if we do not come at short notice for a satisfactory solution , the roundabout with the unions - maybe even in cooperation with the bes@@ men cities - perhaps asp@@ ire to seek a door@@ step . &quot;
&quot; with this , the CD@@ U is trying to pay the CD@@ U to get the employees and officials better than they actually see the collective bar@@ gaining for the public service . &quot;
&quot; the sal@@ aries are currently prescribed , increases or more money there is only when you change into a higher level that is based on professional years . &quot;
&quot; however , the tasks of the circle has grown more and over the past few years . &quot;
&quot; only a few weeks ago , new rooms were needed to take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stitution protection law . &quot;
last but not least by the rising number of asylum seek@@ ers Thomas Hen@@ del@@ e and Kreis@@ Director Martin Richter wins a problem : they have too little personnel .
Italy intensified the tone to NGO @-@ migrants &quot; lif@@ ebo@@ ats
&quot; Italy has ill@@ um@@ erable NGOs to employ b@@ ail@@ outs for migrants in the Mediterranean , war@@ ns that they should not continue this if they do not hold new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs don &apos;t write a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , &quot; said Interior Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Tur@@ iner Daily La St@@ ampa . &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after the Italian authorities did a boat of the German aid organisation &apos; Youth R@@ ves &apos; because their team had worked together with human @-@ workers in a way which facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
&quot; the aid organization , which has been in operation since a year , passed it to a detailed accus@@ ations of the Italian prosec@@ utor gen@@ ts Amb@@ ro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ si@@ o . &quot;
&quot; for us , the saving of human life remains our top priority . so we are sorry that in the moment we are unable to operate in the search and lif@@ ebo@@ at zone , &quot; said the organization in an opinion regarding social media . &quot;
&quot; we can all assume any accus@@ ations that are currently raised , only after we have collected all the information and can judge the situation . &quot;
&quot; the Italian authorities had the boat of &quot; Youth R@@ ves , &quot; the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , which has been monitored since October . &quot;
&quot; it is thought that his occupation is infl@@ atable on board , which can be delivered directly by human rights , and that the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers can be used again so that the ships can be used again . &quot;
&quot; at least one such meeting was alleg@@ edly found only 1,3 miles in front of the Libyan coast , according to the acquisition of the prosec@@ utor gen@@ ts , whose contents of Italian media has been published . &quot;
&quot; the occupation is suspected , spread over the authority of the Italian coastal guard , the b@@ ail@@ ments in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not out of any other motiv@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; under the code of conduct , boats like the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta mainly have a Italian police officers on board who monitored their activities . &quot;
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs participated in search and rescue operations , have previously prepared to keep up to the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday , that the new rules would be regarded as unnecessary , but acceptable since they would not have any &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; of their rescue actions . &quot;
&quot; among those who refuse to sign , is the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate organisation doctors without borders ( M@@ SF ) . &quot;
&quot; Minn@@ iti said in the meantime , that the number of migrants that arrived after the rescue actions in Italy , in recent weeks , the efforts to strengthen the Libyan assets and the cooperation with local citizens . &quot;
&quot; in the last few days we began to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month about economic development initiatives and with Ch@@ ad , Niger , and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants that have left these countries in hope to reach Europe . &quot;
goat and Tri@@ als
&quot; nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer Bi@@ ker , the &quot; Berlin &apos;s out@@ post &quot; and two teachers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the north pf@@ alz region to enjoy four days of tri@@ m and points of interest . &quot;
there were three appointments available for this .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer Tal proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and Wine of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour conducted during hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
&quot; it followed the view points , partly on towers , of which one could look far beyond the lum@@ ber@@ zer forest and the pre @-@ settled levels . &quot;
&quot; in between there , there was always longer periods for the long tri@@ bul@@ ly . &quot;
the second day it went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to Sal@@ ine and the folk festival .
&quot; again , look@@ out at the look@@ out point , connected by &quot; flo@@ wi@@ ge &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate ant@@ ages . &quot;
on the last two days a lot of altitude were told .
&quot; caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and in@@ scri@@ bed brought will@@ ed breaks . &quot;
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim at@@ met@@ en the bi@@ kers in the open @-@ air inhal@@ e Sole .

console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga ge@@ ars for E @-@ Sport
&quot; do the Sport @-@ stars will be sitting in front of a computer science , instead of fighting with wind and weather over the stadium . &quot;
&quot; fact : e @-@ sport has long since become a serious business , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gases . &quot;
they have recognised the first Bundes@@ lig@@ aver@@ an that are increasingly involved in this field .
&quot; the beginning of 2015 the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last of the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , founded mid July an E @-@ Sport Department and two pros for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract . &quot;
&quot; we hope to inspire a whole new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says the Executive Board of Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; he is sure , that on the train there are still several clubs . &quot;
&quot; the upcoming weekend of the World Cup FIFA in London organized the first &quot; &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; , &quot; in which gam@@ er of various clubs can compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Eind@@ hoven . &quot;
also Robin Dut@@ t looks great potential for e @-@ sports .
the ex @-@ Trainer of Bayer Lever@@ k@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen is now advis@@ es an agency for virtual soccer players .
&quot; the real football has to deal particularly with the 14 to 30 year @-@ old people , that young people are still going to the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; and : the associations tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian . &quot;
&quot; with prominent e @-@ sports athletes , you could be able to present online more often than once in the year of the Bundes@@ lig@@ aments to Asia . &quot;
what is it exactly ?
&quot; in e @-@ sport , computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends &quot; , &quot; Dot@@ A 2 &quot; , &quot; Counter@@ strike &quot; or even the soccer simulation of FIFA on competitive level . &quot;
&quot; long ago , as in normal sport also , Li@@ gen is established , in which the pros can compete against each other . &quot;
and in the Asian game E @-@ Sports is already part of the official program .
but is the right sport at all ?
for many is the idea of safe ordinary .
also In@@ go F@@ rob@@ ous has a long deal with the question .
&quot; for the professor at the German Spor@@ tho@@ ch@@ schule in Cologne is e @-@ sport a sport , because it is com@@ pressor , and many biological and physical reactions show that one can also find in classic sports - for example , increased heart frequencies , criminal actions , hormonal changes . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , there are cognitive skills , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a fast response ability . &quot;
professional gam@@ ers should not only train at the console but also their bodies and pay attention to nutrition .
&quot; the itte player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; but also problems : &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more an issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; controls are difficult to cope with on @-@ play , and in the scene missing the structures of the classic sports . &quot;
&quot; positive highlights , scientists empha@@ sized the high integral effect of the E @-@ Sports . &quot;
&quot; the players are international on the way , which is like a big global family , there is no intercultural inter@@ rup@@ tions . &quot;
a study of corporate advice Del@@ o@@ itte and the association &apos;s Inter@@ active entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) tells the e @-@ sport a rapid growth ahead .
&quot; in 2016 , they have been implemented 50 million euros in Germany , primarily on advertising , sponsorship and great tournaments . &quot;
sales will rise to 130 million in three years .
against the almost 2.1 billion euros of the Bundes@@ liga is little .
&quot; however , the e @-@ sport is no longer far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice @-@ hockey , &quot; write Del@@ o@@ itte @-@ consultants . &quot;
international are many countries already on .
large markets are Asia and the USA where ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez took part in the US Team NR@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood Ac@@ tor Ashton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sport @-@ Competition Uni@@ kr@@ n .
also in Europe a lot .
&quot; in an norweg@@ ian school , e @-@ sport was introduced as a class , says F@@ rob@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; in the Netherlands and France , the Bundes@@ liga @-@ associations according to Dut@@ t has now been committed to set up an e @-@ sport department . &quot;
&quot; in the European comparison , Germany came to Germany , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B @-@ Executive Board of R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; only in nostal@@ gia , and the old times come to clear , is no longer sufficient . &quot;
&quot; it is about to preserve the tradition of the association , but the company is at the same time to al@@ ign the modern market . &quot;
&quot; we live in a digital world , &quot; says Dut@@ ch@@ . &quot;
&quot; you cannot hold it , that only at football everything remains as it always was . &quot;

Michelle Carter because of the lyrics to push Con@@ rad Roy to su@@ ic@@ ide
a woman from Massachusetts was condemned to two and a half years because she has encouraged her boyfriend through lyrics and calls for su@@ ic@@ ide .
&quot; Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of their condem@@ nation behind bars and five years have been exposed to mal@@ nutrition . &quot;
Carter was condemned in June because of the casual killing of Con@@ rad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 . &quot;
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is un@@ inhabited .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter allowed to stay free up to appeal .
&quot; she had been confronted with a maximum of 20 years , but their legal representatives argu@@ ed that both she and Mr Roy suffered on a mental illness . &quot;
&quot; dressed in red H@@ oses and a cre@@ me@@ tic@@ ulous bl@@ ouse , Carter da with tears in the eyes , with folded hands and down @-@ out eyes , when she was condemned . &quot;
&quot; their actions have brought Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; said the pro@@ secution . &quot;
she ended his life to make her own better .
&quot; she has no responsibility to be adopted , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; she has no rep@@ ent@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; but Car@@ ter &apos;s lawyer spoke , it was a &quot; aw@@ ful circum@@ stance that they are completely de@@ plor@@ able . &quot;
&quot; however , judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said , he did not find that her &quot; age or maturity or even their spiritual disease have a significant impact on their actions . &quot;
&quot; a prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said there is no day , in which I don &apos;t smoke the loss of my beloved son . &quot;
&quot; I want to be proud of me and how I go with everything I am going with everything . I try , despite all my p@@ ains , that we will carry for eternity with us , for his sisters there , &quot; says it in it . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ ys S@@ ister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she would never attend the marriage of their brother , or be an a@@ unt for his children . &quot;
&quot; no more to have this single person with which I was every day for my birth , is a pain that I will always remember for the rest of my life . &quot;
&quot; the case seems to put a legal preced@@ ent , as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to commit to another , su@@ ic@@ ide . &quot;
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon oxid@@ ation in one vehicle in 2014 .
&quot; the case drew national attention to himself , after Car@@ ters , and revealed that she had encouraged him to finish his life . &quot;
&quot; hanging on , spr@@ inkl@@ ed from a building , educate yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; she said in several messages , which she was sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was with his family on vacation . &quot;
&quot; in the moments before his su@@ ic@@ ide she wrote : &quot; you must do it , Con@@ rad &quot; and &quot; Every@@ thing what you have to do is to turn the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter sought by the death of Roy and ord@@ ained that she will benefit through some press by the case .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
&quot; to the few , the Carter defended , belonged to Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , which was sentenced to 2007 because of murder of her British fellow @-@ ro@@ ommate in Italy before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published in the Los Angeles Times released a comment : &quot; Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ me : learn from the new mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
&quot; that Joshua was allowed me to run at the Audi Cup as captain , no coincidence . &quot;
the FC Bayern tr@@ aut to the Con@@ fed Cup winner has won a big season - extra @-@ motivation .
&quot; something was different in his place in the cabin , that saw Joshua Kim@@ my immediately , even though the additional clothing is very small , very small . &quot;
&quot; but since far and wide on the second day of Audi C@@ ups , of course no Philipp Lah@@ m and not a Manuel Neu@@ er was to be seen , he made himself a shared bond to the arm . &quot;
&quot; the coach has not announced it , &quot; told the Con@@ fed Cup winner , after his first deployment as Bavaria captain . &quot;
&quot; good , the one could have been better running than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples . &quot;
but the sign of Coach could also suggest that .
&quot; not the eight year older Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al was chosen in the youth player , Deb@@ o@@ ants and straight from the holiday commented by professionals existing C @-@ El@@ f as a game leader , but he was chosen . &quot;
&quot; you can be distributed in the de@@ ar@@ est one to those who want to hold a lot , which one wants to hold in La@@ une . &quot;
&quot; so who was chosen , the heritage of Lah@@ m , can make a little extra @-@ motivation only well . &quot;
&quot; Kim@@ my confirmed : &quot; &quot; this is what you want as a player to take on responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old as Mini @-@ lam@@ m over the field .
&quot; right back , this is now his position , the white Bin@@ de on the arm did her . &quot;
&quot; and at all , Kim@@ my take me in this cat@@ formation like the one who can take the rod even at the hand . &quot;
&quot; he gave instructions , tried to ste@@ er the un@@ divided tro@@ upe . &quot;
he had the eye for the whole while many others were occupied with himself .
&quot; Vid@@ al so , to over@@ play its lack of fitness ( fol@@ dable ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches , to see the Devil come out to see the performances of Asia @-@ trip ( fol@@ dable also only ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le , to fall in their first appearance in Bavaria @-@ Tri@@ ko@@ t . &quot;
the after all folded very good .
&quot; Sü@@ le ran beside Kim@@ me , Rud@@ y in front of the defense , both ag@@ ated sou@@ ver@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli storm is often difficult , in addition , addi@@ le tried even in the game for a few times . &quot;
&quot; his colleague Rud@@ y gave the fact that the result was not as it was , as we expected this . &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance at the debut .
&quot; play@@ back , Tem@@ po@@ change : &quot; for this style I was also fet@@ ched . &quot;
&quot; as unusual , these Bavaria @-@ world are still for the new @-@ accessible , one saw following the score . &quot;
&quot; Rud@@ y for example gave in cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , not one or two , but determines six or seven interviews . &quot;
Kim@@ my came to a few cr@@ acking statements on his new fellow players .
&quot; there he heard of the South of an interesting set : &quot; &quot; what goes here , I have already noticed . &quot;
&quot; at Bavaria , you just need to win any game . &quot;
&quot; after all , he must not teach the new ones . &quot;

company satisfied with rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ pf@@ alz minister : economy lo@@ ys Wis@@ sings Tempo
&quot; it often proved to be irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) still the Ministry of Economic Affairs of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palatinate . &quot;
&quot; this shows itself after more than one year , where the new Economic Minister Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office . &quot;
chambers and companies from the region speak on T V @-@ request from a change in economic policy - and impeccable simultaneously the old minister .
&quot; Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ er Enterprises ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wis@@ sing is att@@ acking the wishes of the economy to the Lem@@ ke all@@ es@@ amt . &quot;
the biggest K@@ ehr@@ e is Nat@@ us in the Infra@@ structural policy : the bridge between the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now on top of the country &apos;s pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ y list .
&quot; this year , the ministry will hopes for a schedul@@ ing procedure until 2021 is supposed to be the building right . &quot;
&quot; a role in the plans of the country is also playing the west of Tri@@ er , which stands in the pre@@ aching requirement of the federal state plan . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to take the distance in December 2020 , says Minister @-@ Spe@@ aker Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ us sees it a sign@@ post to support regional , but internationally competing companies . &quot;
&quot; the industrial and Chamber of Commerce ( Chamber of Commerce ) Tri@@ er stri@@ ves to increase from Wis@@ sing , at the wine a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palatinate label to boost the sales in supermarkets and stopping the trend for ten years . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to start their own company , pra@@ ises the Chamber of Commerce . &quot;
&quot; the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Tri@@ er sees in the new master bonus , an additional incentive for young trainees , says managing director Matthias Schwal@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; provided is a premium of 1000 Euro for the best@@ informed master test and 2500 euros , if gradu@@ ates within ten years after the master &apos;s master is self @-@ employed . &quot;
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
&quot; at the planned road construction is quick facts to create , at the same time faul@@ ts the country at the necessary staff , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , main business leaders of the Chamber of HK Tri@@ er . &quot;
&quot; of 56 new engineers , who wants to set the Wis@@ sing at regional business mobility , so far only 29 places are occupied . &quot;
the Chamber of Commerce demands more jobs to be awarded to external offices .
&quot; CD@@ U @-@ Fr@@ ac@@ vi@@ ze Christian Bal@@ d@@ at refers to calculations of the invoice , the country invested in 2017 and 2018 more than 20 million euros in the preservation of national roads . &quot;
Frank Nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country as it wants to fix the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
&quot; furthermore , the previous broad@@ band band@@ width is also in the country . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , regional companies had rated the network supply in a I@@ HK survey only with the note 3,4 . &quot;
they compl@@ emented over stock@@ pil@@ ing Internet connections and ab@@ out@@ breaks .
the ex @-@ Economic Ministry of E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and is still sitting in the Super@@ visory Board of the Wind@@ mill Pro Wind .

Audi aims to change 85@@ 0.000 diesel vehicles - car actors are confronted with a counter @-@ reaction
&quot; a day before the announcement of Audi said BMW , that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the BMW Chair said that &quot; &quot; the company is the opinion that &quot; &quot; there is intelligent options as a constra@@ int , &quot; and moved to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - diesel vehicles to offer or limiting . &quot;
&quot; Daim@@ ler announced on Tuesday , that there will be three million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions . &quot;
none of the companies described enterprises as recall .
European automotive manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support respect of rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
&quot; but the nit@@ rogen Ox@@ ides , the diesel engines , are regarded as car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ s and can cause as@@ thma . &quot;
&quot; the cost of automotive manufacturers , plants for neutr@@ alization of diesel @-@ vehicles instruc@@ ted to install , take too , which makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also indic@@ ted to ignore the powerful automobile companies and ignore signs of the problem .
&quot; the companies try to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen to avoid the use of so @-@ called ab@@ st@@ alt equipment , emissions can regulate when a car has been tested , but in normal driving conditions . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , several members were charged by Volkswagen , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; last month , the former head of the Ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ics was arrested in the motor development of Audi in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the former manager , Zac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , Itali@@ ans and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be put in court in the United States . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi was included in German criminal investigations , after the authorities have been installed , a system installed to have the emissions regulations in Europe , and a request that was concentrated on the United States . &quot;
&quot; the inclusion of Audi into the investigation could be Volkswagen heavy loads : the luxury car manufacturer contributes significantly to the profit of Volkswagen . &quot;

Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ es and the laughter against g@@ rief
Mor@@ di@@ llo was temporarily of the master@@ y Car@@ to@@ on char@@ ner , the Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ ases of his figures are his trademark . &quot;
&quot; also with 85 , the Argent@@ inian still features and works on a film . &quot;
&quot; his message : laughter , &quot; For there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
&quot; in the first few years as an artist he proposed himself as a drawing of luck , due to what it was frustr@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when in my job , he said once . &quot;
&quot; by stops in Lima , New York and Paris at the end of the 1960s : with the release of his carto@@ ons in Paris Match &quot; and then in the &quot; star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot;
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
repeatedly inspired by the artists of cities .
big , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo @-@ figures tum@@ bles in drawings with the Schi@@ ef@@ en Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow . &quot;
&quot; in the early morning , his own information is still sitting in the drawing , works on a daily basis for almost ten hours . &quot;
&quot; on calendar , puzzles , books for Gross and Klein , T @-@ shirts , pupp@@ ets and watches you will continue to find much spread worldwide . &quot;
&quot; for six years , he has also been working on a cartoon film and a TV series with his figures . &quot;
the main person in the movie &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gir@@ affe - Mor@@ dil@@ los popular animal in his drawings - that has a thousands of thousands as a counter@@ player .
&quot; for the first time his figures in the 3D movie , who shall come to the chin wall . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they are saying it &apos;s strange to me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot;
the script is not written by him .
&quot; that is why he is more focuss@@ ed on the TV series , which is produced as its original design@@ ations , wor@@ power@@ less . &quot;
lav@@ ender from Provence is threatened by climate change
&quot; he has become a symbol of Provence in the south of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change . &quot;
&quot; the lav@@ ender is due to that of dro@@ ught reminded conditions and because of the diseases of transmitted insects , which are trying to find solutions to find great head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ m , expert of the agricultural research institutes CRI@@ EP@@ P@@ AM in Provence said : &quot; &quot; the lav@@ ender in Provence is effective , because the plant in recent years has been exposed to the effects of climate change that has brought much less rain in spring and fall much more . &quot;
this has an effect on the life span of lav@@ ender .
&quot; there is also a small Zi@@ k@@ ade , a micro @-@ bacterial , the d@@ warf @-@ c@@ ades , and with very dry weather , there are very many of them . &quot;
and there is much at stake .
lav@@ ender oil lo@@ osen not only for vac@@ ation@@ ers , it is also very sought for perf@@ umes and cosmetics . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ m said : &quot; instead of having very long crop drilling with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , UN@@ TE@@ REN@@ TW@@ ICK@@ EL@@ TE and either missing or weak@@ ened . &quot;
&quot; so , we have less parts with e@@ there@@ al oil . &quot;
&quot; to the solutions that are considered to be considered , a better water distribution and the slo@@ wing of the crops from the ground , but also the b@@ ending of plants with a protective mix of sound and water and the development of sorts , which are more resistant to dry . &quot;

the ass@@ ass@@ ination of a journalist empha@@ sizes the growing threat in Mexico
the employees of the weekly reef Ri@@ odo@@ ce is normally associated to review their plans for reporting about the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and c@@ eas@@ eless drug wars . &quot;
&quot; but on this day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security . &quot;
it was told to them that it is important to change their routines .
&quot; two high @-@ level journalists discuss what you feel safe : they should take their children to the office , which were the target of an attack with gran@@ ulates , or put them at home . &quot;
&quot; security experts have written three words on a board at the front of the room : opponents , Neutr@@ al , allies . &quot;
&quot; they ask the re@@ por@@ ters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary , perc@@ eptions and pancre@@ atic . &quot;
&quot; there are stimul@@ us regul@@ ators , politicians , busin@@ ess@@ men , journalists who are suspic@@ ious to stand on the sal@@ ary list of government or cart@@ els , a catalog of crimin@@ als that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous . &quot;
&quot; there is no resting break from the violence , and throughout the country the cor@@ p@@ ses , are more and more journalists : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to in December 2012 had taken place after attack and threats under Federal Protection and until now there were at least seven t@@ ote in seven countries . &quot;
&quot; among the latter , their editors and their inspir@@ ator of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , the co @-@ founder J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and journalist , &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of its numerous books on violence associated with drugs . &quot;
&quot; his absence will be felt deeply , although its presence is present everywhere - a great photo of Val@@ dez , which shows its main finger with the word &quot; Justice &quot; building . two re@@ por@@ ters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ riam R@@ ami@@ rez , wear T @-@ shirts , which show its ridicul@@ ous face with glasses or his typical Panam@@ ah@@ ere . &quot;
&quot; the workshop will take place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ por@@ ters discuss their shared topics , trau@@ ma , their night@@ mar@@ es , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although 2010 was established a Son@@ der &apos;s Bar in order to process the cases of journalists , this according to the Committee to protect journalists just two criminal proceedings . &quot;
&quot; like most of the thousands of mor@@ den , each year associated with drug trading and organised crime , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely provided . &quot;
&quot; at Ri@@ odo@@ ce you still insist on to treat the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are infinite , and even though the terrain is still sl@@ anted . &quot;
&quot; without any information about the mur@@ derer , without justice , the meeting for discussion of security is little benefits , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it is very stupid to w@@ asting my time in this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we do not know the Why , distr@@ ust we all . &quot;
&quot; in the morning of 15 May , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the state capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he managed to drive a few blocks away before its red Toyota Cor@@ olla was forced by two men . he was forced out of his car and was shot 12 times on him , presum@@ ably because of the name of the newspaper - who was translated with &quot; &quot; twelve &quot; &quot; river . &quot;
the cap was gone away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adults .
ru@@ mo@@ urs tend to fly freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ mans re@@ pris@@ oned last year and delivery in the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t s@@ laughter of the country , as ri@@ val@@ ed fac@@ tions stood here to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or several people are shot on the road or that the gra@@ vey@@ ard is full of playful , two @-@ stor@@ ey maus@@ ol@@ een for drugs , which are bigger than many homes for the living . &quot;
&quot; forget for a minute that there is a state of &apos; peace &apos; , if only one cart@@ el control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes in the United States . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , with the blame that he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings have contributed to the murder .
&quot; first of February , there was the publication of an interview with Damas@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the ri@@ val@@ ing cart@@ els in war with Gu@@ z@@ mans sons . &quot;
&quot; this publication may have anno@@ yed the sons , thought @-@ members bought each specimen of the issue , once they delivered to time ki@@ os@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; the second mistake was to force Val@@ dez , according to the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper which had released the same history to its own safety . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and its killing is regarded as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists . &quot;
he has survived so long that his friends and colleagues ann@@ ah@@ men that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced re@@ por@@ ter for Nor@@ the@@ este as he joined together with five colleagues for the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars .
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without having to encounter the rough@@ ening problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; with time , the newspaper served its reputation because of cour@@ ageous and honest reporting , and turnover and advertising . &quot;
&quot; re@@ por@@ ter loving it , hard to release studies without fear of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else could handle . &quot;
eight years after the foundation of Ri@@ odo@@ ce she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot &quot; for their coverage in Latin America .
&quot; in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in the persecution of the Mexican drug history , wherever they led . &quot;
he gave voluntary to that he was afraid .
&quot; I would like to continue living , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J distinction . &quot;
&quot; drug dealers in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento TV . &quot;
you have to take the task that falls you as a journalist - either the or you play the dum@@ b .
I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; what did you do in view of so many still@@ s ... why did you not say what went ahead ?
&quot; the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team miss Val@@ dez , the Spa@@ ak bird , which was also a port worker , the friend , the generous with h@@ ugs and advice was , a teacher who knew how to survive . &quot;
they trusted to his routine .
he would always carry his hat .
&quot; he would always go to El Guay@@ ama , the bar opposite to the office , and always sit there at the same table . &quot;
&quot; now , ask them : was his love of routine be his bl@@ az@@ ing ? &quot;
&quot; his death has also comp@@ elled them to ask their own assu@@ mptions in question , how they do their work best and stay alive . &quot;
&quot; they do not like it if you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their fur@@ nish start and landing stage , in order to move drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and self @-@ preservation . &quot;
to trust his own inst@@ inct .
&quot; when it is wrong , keep away from it . &quot;
&quot; the anger is , said the editor of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real that &quot; smell can be a sense that may be dec@@ eived ... and then the thing happened to J@@ avier . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , as he and others say , are in Sin@@ alo@@ a not more - just as in Tam@@ au@@ li@@ pas , VER@@ AC@@ RU@@ Z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a toxic mix of lu@@ cr@@ ative sm@@ ug@@ gling , weak institutions and corrupt government at home . &quot;
the landscape is constantly changing .
&quot; in the room where the staff met by Ri@@ odo@@ ce on the safety training , suddenly there were no phones . days before has been known that Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
&quot; seeking two police officers in front of the heat from 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree . &quot;
they were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ story house in a middle class district of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; half in the joke , some of the re@@ por@@ ters were asking if these officers belong to the 50 percent of polic@@ emen , who referred to the Gover@@ nor itself as not trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; it is months ago , since the re@@ por@@ ter went into the mountain scenery , where the drug @-@ gangs have been under control . &quot;
for the issue of this week Ri@@ odo@@ ce on three main stories .
there was the ass@@ ass@@ ination of the brother of the former known Box@@ er Ju@@ lio Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an ex@@ pos@@ é to the state of the state that focused on the hom@@ etown of the Govern@@ ors .
&quot; and there was a group that led in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , one block from the office of the Prosec@@ utor &apos;s office . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who kidn@@ apped or how it happened , so caution was necessary to write as it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ por@@ ter from public records , that the restaurant has been registered under the name of a policy manager , which belonged to the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( Pr@@ i ) , which was conquered almost all the political planes . &quot;
&quot; recently , several Pr@@ i govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ heart@@ ed cases of corruption . &quot;
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ por@@ ter , to write about predic@@ ting inci@@ dents in this eat@@ ery , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man got a military over@@ fall . &quot;
only a few months before the readers could have seen the Kolum@@ ne of Val@@ dez as the most informative source about kidn@@ apping .
&quot; earlier we had already knew what is happening , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nickname &quot; El FLACO &quot; because of its sl@@ ender body . &quot;
&quot; now , all channels of communication are broken with our sources . &quot;
&quot; the office of Val@@ dez has been dedicated to the storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers , dedicated to the Mor@@ de of journalists , because the employees have become something that they themselves never expected : activists in the name of the press . &quot;
re@@ por@@ ter Mi@@ riam R@@ ami@@ rez pick up a few characters and passed the next morning to a demonstration for another journalist to the office of the prosec@@ utor .
Salvador ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed in the western federal state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; a burnt body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA testing it is of it . &quot;
journalists all over the country have become more powerful as they have written in organized protests &quot; SOS Press &quot; on en@@ closure and construction .
&quot; on this day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is gone by Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the case of Val@@ dez . &quot;
&quot; during a meeting with the Gover@@ nor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day following the ass@@ ass@@ ination of Val@@ dez accused R@@ ami@@ rez , journalists , journalists , and put them to leave , because they told the truth . &quot;
&quot; she has since been asked that she was once again divided by the Government , because she is worried that their anger has hurt their obj@@ ectivity . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico by organised crime , involved in government offices and a uniform society &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in his last book &quot; &quot; Nar@@ co Journ@@ alism &quot; , &quot; he wrote that re@@ por@@ ter not only killed by drugs , but also on the command of politicians and security forces who have organised crime under a ceiling . &quot;
&quot; in the past year , the media @-@ Sax@@ on group &quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ulo 19 &quot; has more than half of the attacks on journalists by police and officials . &quot;
&quot; in Mexico @-@ minded , because they want you dis@@ proportionate to the mouth , &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the Mor@@ de have a deter@@ rent effect . &quot;
nobody for@@ gets the death of the blog@@ ger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state Tam@@ au@@ li@@ pas six years ago .
&quot; your body was signed together with a note that was supposedly signed by Z@@ etas @-@ Kart@@ ell , &quot; I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer@@ ized and ear@@ phones in addition to their un@@ separated head .
&quot; some branch have chosen to close , like the newspaper El Nor@@ te in northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua , after the ass@@ ass@@ ination of the correspon@@ dents Mi@@ ro@@ sl@@ ava Bre@@ ach in March . &quot;
&quot; others continue , as is El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after the ass@@ ass@@ ination of their director in 2004 . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ arez publicly launched the drug card with a editorial board on the cover page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
&quot; it is hard to find jobs in exile , and they still observe the streets and are looking for dangers . &quot;
&quot; and sometimes they will be j@@ agt as the photographer Rub@@ en Esp@@ in@@ osa , which in 2015 was mur@@ dered together with four women in an apartment in Mexico @-@ city three months after the flight from VER@@ AC@@ RU@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; for those who continue to stay and continue working , there is a daily dance with ris@@ kl@@ ess decisions . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bar@@ ra , who once did not want to be po@@ ets , gives that the drug trading scar@@ es him . &quot;
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and therefore I was re@@ por@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; at midnight on the last Friday , when the last edition was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce on the side@@ walk in front of the office and drank beer , when once all began their phones . &quot;
a series of shooting with Band@@ en@@ ri@@ v@@ als and security guards near the bath@@ ed Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed blade .
the war escal@@ ated further as it was promised by a number of Kart@@ ell &apos;s em@@ bassies in the region .
from the on @-@ board edge they released the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce via cell phone .
the front page had to be changed the next day .
Sir@@ r@@ ages nearby - a further shooting in the area .
&quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez thre@@ w a look at the polic@@ emen , the reven@@ ge kept to see if they were in readiness . &quot;
&quot; if they were afraid of all , they showed it not . &quot;
&quot; under the enormous portrait of the unusual founder of the newspaper , its central finger was visible for quite Sin@@ alo@@ a , followed the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce its mark . &quot;
&quot; how can you also think about it , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; When on the same day he was mur@@ dered on the J@@ avier who asked me to send them reporting on the street . &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs use cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age to escape its enemies .
at first sight it looks like a statue if a fright@@ ening .
&quot; now , researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible Nas@@ horn of a Canadian mountain work@@ book have been so well received , that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; it was so well received , that they could even find that his love @-@ made skin was killed by pure brown - and they said , she would have had something of an &quot; &quot; un@@ quiet past . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report in the magazine &quot; Current Bi@@ ology &quot; describes it as &quot; the bel@@ lied din@@ osau@@ rs , who ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs specimens of the world . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ ossi@@ l is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier , which lived in the middle of the roundabout , between 110 million and 112 million years ago . &quot;
&quot; his unbeliev@@ ably good condition has researchers , which it is as &quot; really remarkable , &quot; stun@@ ned &quot;
&quot; according to reports in National Geo@@ graphic , the equ@@ itable plant @-@ e@@ aters is the best preserved F@@ ossi@@ l of its kind . &quot;
&quot; it was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k when he was born on 21 March 2011 in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the north of Alberta , Canada , Den &quot;
&quot; he met something that seemed to fl@@ aw from the surrounding rock , and decided to watch more accurately . &quot;
the F@@ ossi@@ l discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pale@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; they spent the next six years to cover the wild animal within the 2,@@ 500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) of heavy Earth cl@@ ashes . &quot;
&quot; after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed . &quot;
&quot; if you just blin@@ ded a little with the eyes blin@@ ks , you could almost believe it was , &quot; said the main aut@@ or Cal@@ eb Brown , scientists in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum , where the creature is to be seen . &quot;
it is reflected in the history of scientists as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs specimens - the mon@@ a Lisa of the Dinosau@@ rs .
&quot; researchers have found that this plant is fres@@ ser , although he is covered with an arm@@ or and a changing tank , probably by meat v@@ ore Din@@ os@@ rs was threatened . &quot;
&quot; the strongly located din@@ osau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a shi@@ el@@ ding technology used as a counter@@ part which is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this could have been allowed to mix better into its surroundings and to escape its enemies , say experts , which suggests that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
the 110 million years old creature from the family of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was first head@@ lines in May and is now seen in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; researchers have now studied the wild animals and it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli was named after the Muse@@ um@@ st@@ echni@@ ker Mark Mitchell , one of a team that has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours to cover it carefully . &quot;
&quot; the amazing maintenance of the specimen , it enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists , the pattern and the form of sc@@ ales and arm@@ our about his body . &quot;
&quot; they discovered the counter @-@ sh@@ ady , a common defence method in the animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was dar@@ ker than its under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the counter @-@ sh@@ ady is common , the results are surprising , as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta by far the animals living today . &quot;
&quot; it suggests that the din@@ osau@@ rs was ground@@ ed by enough pressure by meat v@@ ore din@@ osau@@ rs , that the evolution was fav@@ oured the wear of the confrontation as a means of survival . &quot;
&quot; but most contemporary animals that employ the counter sh@@ aded - think of deer , z@@ eb@@ ras or g@@ ild@@ ly animals - are much smaller and viol@@ able as loo@@ t , which sign@@ alized that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong pre@@ y behavior on a massive , strongly ge@@ ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ rs show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs rob@@ bery of the roundabout must have been , &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their skins also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ rs red @-@ brown was .
&quot; scientists continue to examine the animal on references of his life , including his con@@ current Dar@@ min@@ ent to find out what it had eaten as his last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs died , when he died , into a river and driven into the sea where he sank on the back to the sea . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Alberta was so warm like southern today , and rivers and oceans probably spread much more widespread than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable because it remains completely covered with preser@@ v@@ ented skin , but also in three dimensions remains and the original form of the animal ret@@ ains &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the result is that the animal looks almost exactly as well as in the early roundabout .
&quot; you do not need much imagination to use it to re@@ construct . if you only have a little with the eyes , you could almost believe it is sleeping . &quot;
&quot; the chal@@ k time was a time , as giant ther@@ opo@@ da , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ ary , which stood on two legs , the earth went through . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them , the ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus rex , millions of years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta lived , the tor@@ tured din@@ osau@@ rs was ground@@ ed by some of his terrible ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this belongs to the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 feet ( 11.@@ 5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters . &quot;
&quot; the scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Bi@@ ology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta believed in the death in the sea and was buried in mud . &quot;
&quot; the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k when he was born on 21 March 2011 in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the north of Alberta , Canada , Den &quot;
&quot; according to the museum it is the secured din@@ osau@@ rs of the world , including skin and arm@@ aments , and is complete from the mu@@ zzle to the hips . &quot;
the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and have weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1.@@ 300 kg ) .
&quot; it contained two 20 @-@ inch @-@ long tips , which rag@@ ed by his shoulders . &quot;
&quot; the researchers believe that the ru@@ ined crop was curved through the western Canada , until a floo@@ ded flow was floo@@ ded into the open sea . &quot;
but the underwater @-@ continu@@ ance of the din@@ osau@@ rs keep his arm@@ our in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied rem@@ n@@ ants of this special specimen are so well received that the Hau@@ tr@@ este still cover b@@ ump@@ y high@@ s along the din@@ osau@@ rs
&quot; as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko has written for National Geo@@ graphic , such a level of preservation is as rare as a profit in the Lot@@ to . &quot;
&quot; the more I moved , the more conf@@ use it will . &quot;
&quot; pet@@ ri@@ fied ar@@ te of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y tank , that carry the sk@@ ull of the beast . &quot;
&quot; his right for@@ ter lies on his side , his five fingers are split up . &quot;
I can count the sc@@ ales on his sole .
in the storm : mass@@ acres bo@@ char@@ ger to A@@ 8 : many wo@@ unded
fier@@ ce accident on Thursday night at the A@@ 8 : nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass@@ acres bo@@ char@@ gers .
&quot; there are numerous anch@@ oring , kilometres long St@@ aus - and G@@ af@@ fer . &quot;
&quot; on the highway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) , on the late Thursday morning there were about 20 people ju@@ red . &quot;
&quot; according to the first information of the police were against 5 : 00 between the connection of Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during one Ge@@ wit@@ ters almost 30 cars , including probably also lor@@ ries , inter@@ rup@@ tions . &quot;
about the exact number of recent articles initially no information presented .
&quot; it is light to moderate severe injuries , said a police spokes@@ man . &quot;
a great advent of lif@@ ebo@@ ards was at the in@@ genu@@ ity .
the A@@ 8 was closed in the direction of Munich .
&quot; in Munich , Munich have formed a ten kilometres long back@@ wards . &quot;
&quot; like an AZ @-@ re@@ por@@ ter reported , it also came on the opposite side to massive disabilities - by numerous G@@ af@@ fer . &quot;
&quot; the fire@@ bri@@ g@@ ade noted the characteristics of the vehicle , which now have to reck@@ on with sensitive pen@@ alties . &quot;
&quot; shortly after 18 : 45 p.m. the second accident occurred at the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , there was a coll@@ ision between an auto@@ ot@@ ran@@ ger and a car . &quot;
a Res@@ cue @-@ helic@@ opter was on the way to the in@@ genu@@ ity .
German Rail : Group tests &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
&quot; it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced once , nothing is sitting on the train and sleeps . &quot;
or it is deep@@ ened in his work and has just an ingeni@@ ous thoughts .
and then : pu@@ ff@@ f .
comes the Schaff@@ ner and awak@@ ens an impro@@ per or bo@@ ast the ride in the middle of the work@@ flow .
check @-@ card control .
but the times of inter@@ rup@@ tions are coming soon .
the German railway tests at present the creation of self @-@ creation control .
&quot; you simply confirm your mobile phone , that you have taken place in place , and therefore de@@ valu@@ ate the ticket card . &quot;
&quot; currently , a test mode runs on two routes . &quot;
&quot; comes the offer , we extend it out . &quot;
&quot; it will then be available in Germany at the beginning of next year on many other remote routes in Germany , &quot; said a train spokes@@ man . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; is called the train the driver valuation without Schaff@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; to use the use , however , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet . &quot;
and you have to have booked an online ticket - which is already doing most passengers .
&quot; you must also have bought it via the app of rail , the DB navig@@ ator , which is the most convenient way of ticket booking . &quot;
and finally you need a seat reserve .
&quot; for the &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; works so : one rises in the train , calls its ticket to &quot; My Tickets &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the evaluation will then select a button for the electronic de@@ valuation .
the guides take a message on their mobile devices a message that chassis X is located on the train and has taken the requested seat Y .
&quot; comes the companion guides in front of the card control to square Y , he knows that there is a passenger with already compens@@ ated online ticket . &quot;
&quot; so you can continue to sleep , continue to remain silent . &quot;
&quot; check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the railway - which in turn should use the passengers . &quot;
&quot; anyone who wants to go relaxed without ticket control through our own accompanying staff , ch@@ anting in the DB navig@@ ator simply himself . &quot;
&quot; this allows the passengers to shape their travel time in the train of personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , marketing @-@ board of DB correspondence . &quot;
&quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot;
&quot; who often goes by train , knows that next to delays and missed the timetable controls to the largest nu@@ ances . &quot;
&quot; for often , one does not have any documents in any case but one of the fellow travellers do not need all the documents that you need for the de@@ valuation of online tickets . &quot;
either the credit card or the credit card or otherwise a document is needed .
&quot; the sequence are endless discussions between guides and driver , which leads to bad mood in the section or large @-@ room and delays in controlling their own tickets and take the work at the end of time to take care of other concerns . &quot;
only a small number of test@@ es can use the new service .
and that only applies to the connections ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further access numbers on the same track are not yet activated .
how did an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rell was sh@@ aken to her core .
&quot; only one day after they arrived at New York City , sitting in St. Louis prayer on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment that rented and scroll through Facebook on their phone . &quot;
you stum@@ bled across a post by someone from the High School .
&quot; the police just killed a 18 @-@ year child , and there is still on the street , &quot; was it there . &quot;
&quot; confused as no one had posted on their fe@@ ed the information , she concluded Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot;
a user with the hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Ph@@ aro@@ ah was constantly met on her tim@@ eline .
&quot; the Rap@@ per from the territory of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 year @-@ old , who was killed by a white polic@@ emen in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , was killed . &quot;
he posted an image of Bro@@ wn Living &apos;s body that was out@@ stretched on the road and would stay four hours .
&quot; this is wild , I thought Fer@@ rell at her . &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their fel@@ lowship .
she put her mobile phone to return later in the evening to T@@ we@@ ets over people on the Can@@ field Drive .
&quot; there were photos of the police band and people , the cri@@ ed , and of a man who asser@@ ted a sign with the wor@@ ding : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ ons police have just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
they watched a live Fe@@ ed in which a polic@@ eman stood before a group of prot@@ esters with a bell@@ ish dog .
&quot; in another video , she said , rejected a different polic@@ eman his ri@@ f@@ le and cri@@ ed : &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill . &quot;
&quot; that is not usual , &quot; rec@@ alled Fer@@ rell at their statement . &quot;
this is not the kind of murder that we have acc@@ ust@@ omed to us and that we can say typical .
in this moment I felt sho@@ ok .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
they booked a trip and went to the next day at home .
after landing at 23 o &apos;clock they took their 6 @-@ year old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on next morning .
&quot; what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the topic of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; in the cinem@@ as from the 11 . &quot;
&quot; it is a history of survival and Protest@@ ant , love and loss of strength , strength and resistance , which consists of the sight of the people who live in the community and to demand the streets to demand answers . &quot;
&quot; as the Fer@@ rell with her daughter who brought a fl@@ oral dress and a suitable crown , according to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two had a conversation that they had countless occasions in front of this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black state . &quot;
&quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; remembered what she said . &quot;
&quot; we are now going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , because the police have killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that was not correct . &quot;
&quot; I could not take them , &quot; said Fer@@ rell later . &quot;
that which happens today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
it has to know and it is to be seen and raised .
&quot; it has to be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to free to free ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even if I have the happiness to give her an experience , in which she had not experienced a bl@@ at@@ ant racism , it is not different from the next black women child . &quot;
&quot; I have the feeling , I would prove her a bad service to keep them away . &quot;
&quot; the first stop when they arrived at F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was on the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority which was agreed to a camp@@ ment , as the activists on the possible non @-@ indic@@ t@@ ment of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
&quot; there was Fer@@ rell and her daughter connected with a local business meeting , the lunch was . &quot;
they prepared po@@ ckets before and helped them to pass on demonstr@@ ators .
slowly began to take a new type of activ@@ ism for fer@@ al shape .
&quot; my activ@@ ism changed after the 9th of August , she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student N@@ urses Association and focused on Es@@ sens @-@ Justice and health@@ ful ine@@ qualities in black congreg@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in Organ@@ izing .
it is all come . &quot;
&quot; weeks later , Fer@@ rell arrived in an evening demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the Co @-@ director of the film . &quot;
&quot; follow Fol@@ ay@@ an said her and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ r@@ ar wanted to be &quot; &quot; documented &quot; &quot; what happened . &quot;
&quot; a question came to the sense : &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use it ? &quot;
&quot; this skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often by wh@@ ites in a community that benef@@ ited by their pain and its resistance . &quot;
&quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently declared in an interview , &quot; We heard that people who were born in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on and raised their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; follow @-@ up , Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the then Co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area that is known for his activ@@ ism in order to be de@@ duc@@ ted . &quot;
his dedication brought the project closer together with six other indigenous people followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years to Bro@@ wn Er@@ sho@@ ots .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us . we speak , &quot; &quot; said Davis . &quot;
&quot; that was the main thing for me , as these people are represented , as I will be represented . &quot;
&quot; the goal was not to concentrate on Ferr@@ ells experience - to show that it is concerned with the movement &quot; not about a Messi@@ ah &apos;s guide , but around a community , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the most open participant in the film . &quot;
&quot; consequently we show documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; a surprising personal aspect of Ferr@@ ells &apos;s life , as she loves himself and her wife mar@@ ries . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
but I have understood that there must be certain vulner@@ ability during this work and in the in@@ humane of black people .
&quot; in addition , Ferr@@ ells history has repeated the role of black fluctu@@ ations women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founders of the movement , which , after the killing of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ by Martin in 2012 have shaped the film &quot; Black@@ li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identify themselves as pregnant . &quot;
&quot; black , pregnant women in leadership positions have worn the movement altogether , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting on various fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , pregnant women must carry the main last of everything . &quot;
&quot; follow @-@ up to notice , to notice that &quot; the movement really is maintained by black women and many black women . &quot;
&quot; however , it is obvious that &quot; &quot; this is not a affirm@@ ative type of action , &quot; in the he@@ al of their identity as the heart of the film . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who sho@@ ok this energy , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it is not a coincidence that although she was at the front front , because in a life at these cross@@ ings as a black , sul@@ try woman is so much on the game . &quot;
you can feel their energy by the screen . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on has long since gone , but the racial connections between the municipality and the police continue to exist . &quot;
Fer@@ rell is gran@@ ting for 2 ½ years because of the block@@ age of a highway during a demonstration .
&quot; it describes the soci@@ opoli@@ tical atmosphere of the area that they call their home , &quot; a chaos . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , she cri@@ es himself to a singing and she feels committed to this memory since she went in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on on the streets three years ago . &quot;
it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we need to love each other and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; size w@@ ahn &quot; : TV @-@ readers discuss about bit @-@ gallery
&quot; the bit gallery is moving the people , although it is not yet built for a long time . &quot;
&quot; but the idea of a shopping centre at the south @-@ line of the pedestrian street divi@@ des since the first presentation of 2009 , the population in supporters and opponents . &quot;
cold leaves the subject hardly any one .
&quot; also on our Facebook page &quot; &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; &quot; is discussed . &quot;
&quot; say during the one to the bit gallery : &quot; this would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) , &quot; &quot; This would be real class &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; does not need people &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi &quot; &quot; ) or simply simple : &quot; &quot; size w@@ ahn ! &quot; &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) . &quot;
&quot; while the advocates that a gallery will build more customers into the city , of which the rest of the stores will benefit , fear the pedestrian prec@@ inct . &quot;
&quot; added : the gallery is planned on the plot , on which the farm market hall stands , in the 13 direct market @-@ market their products . &quot;
with the start of the construction works it will be an end to the end .
the gallery @-@ makers want to integrate a market hall in the new building - and to the Bed@@ a place with possibility to outdoors sitting outside .
Simone Rooms : &quot; we have been buying almost weekly in the farm market for many years .
&quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cake of the land@@ lady always welcome again . &quot;
also the but@@ cher we have discovered for us .
&quot; we would like to wish that even during and above all , after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer . &quot;
in other cities there is also .
&quot; above all , the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
&quot; Ger@@ d D@@ ensing : &quot; &quot; whether the direct market in a market hall in the gallery , comes to the level of rent . &quot;
&quot; however , this might not be very low in the new project . &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; why a bunch of shopping in Bit@@ burg ?
&quot; whether clothing , shoes , dr@@ ush or supermarkets : I find that super@@ flu@@ ous . &quot;
there is already enough in our city .
you can see how many stores have been empty here - some for months and years .
&quot; but since there is not even a proper weekend market , it is all the more important that we remain at least the market hall . &quot;
&quot; for all , the goods offered are fresh , is mostly offered directly from the producer . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , shop stores in a shopping centre is only provided by larger companies , because the dor@@ tigen rental are often not viable . &quot;
&quot; too bad , specialty shops there is almost no more and that which is still left , will probably also disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a mall with a Mark@@ thalle fits me not together .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
first of all : where is the peasant market hall during the construction period ?
&quot; the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even on duration , if the bit gallery is actually coming . &quot;
&quot; or does it create the Ges@@ pen@@ st bit gallery before , all transactions from Bit@@ burg to exp@@ el ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; this is simply not working .
&quot; and a shopping center , which is empty , even nobody needs . &quot;
&quot; in my opinion , it would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of this gallery . &quot;
but for a peasant market hall it &apos;s thanks to the w@@ ahn@@ sin@@ ful many - how I find - sensu@@ ous construction projects in Bit@@ burg no place more .
when the peasant market hall is made to disappear again a piece of culture disappear .
a suitable simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
&quot; in the middle of the space of Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York are many faces - white , black and brown , which hang almost un@@ strange - that hang on cables from the ceiling . &quot;
the 30 portraits were created by the artist in He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Tup@@ ener and H@@ ints that were sent by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
&quot; Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former Myst@@ ery Analy@@ zer has made an 35 @-@ year imprisonment , after they made public announ@@ cements on the website Wiki@@ Le@@ aks publicly . &quot;
&quot; the new exhibition , which opened on 2 August , is called A Bec@@ oming res@@ embl@@ ance ( A suitable simil@@ arity ) . &quot;
&quot; it is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline became its expertise in technology , computer sciences and art , and Mann@@ ing , whose condem@@ nation was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been extrac@@ ted by the algorithms analysis of DNA , which were extrac@@ ted by Mann@@ ing , like anyone with these gen@@ om@@ ic data could look like anyone with these gen@@ om@@ ic data - the many ways of how they can be interpreted and the in@@ dur@@ ated detection of these inter@@ pret@@ ations - but also for identity . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but already has spoken openly about the identification as a woman has been sentenced in 2013 because of 20 indic@@ tions , including six infring@@ ements against es@@ pion@@ ag@@ eg@@ es@@ etz , computer fraud and theft . &quot;
&quot; through the prison , her image was suppres@@ sed , so much that there was only one single photo - a gran@@ ting , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in the Mann@@ ing clearly sitting and a plat@@ inum per@@ ch - with which it was associated with it . &quot;
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came straight from the great success of their 2012 @-@ project &apos; stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
&quot; in this , the artists in portraits from for@@ ensi@@ c arti@@ facts like cigarette m@@ ute and ch@@ ew@@ ing g@@ um , extrac@@ ted DNA from the waste to create a picture of how these people might look like . &quot;
that was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a tim@@ ag@@ azin .
&quot; they led an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison , and they wanted to accompany a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press release of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; and she was not visited at this time and she could not be photographed . therefore , they took contact with Chelsea , and asked them if she wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot;
&quot; the artist and their incar@@ cer@@ ated M@@ use have become un@@ equal brilli@@ ance , which are inter@@ change@@ able in the course of two years . &quot;
&quot; she even inv@@ oked one of Sho@@ ili can@@ ung@@ o Illu@@ stri@@ ed Com@@ ic &quot; Stock@@ res@@ sed Images , &quot; which a future was predicted in which the president would convert his sentence , and it would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot;
&quot; that Obama was in fact only a few days after the book was released , Mann@@ ing release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ansas , was a welcome kind of happy meeting . &quot;
&quot; there is also at the opening of the exhibition a little deeper and Star@@ kes , since Donald Tru@@ mp takes a war against inform@@ ants from the governmental camp and against trans@@ gender forces to find new , twe@@ et ways to fix the rigi@@ d divisions which he should actually remedy further . &quot;
&quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked about the strange tim@@ ing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen from a certain reason . &quot;
&quot; written in one on the wall of the gallery written artistic statement called Mann@@ ing with her over@@ sized signature among them ( the &quot; &quot; i &quot; &quot; in her family name is provided with a heart ) an end of &quot; automatic de@@ frag@@ ment , the basis of gender , race , sexuality and culture . &quot;
&quot; on the opposite wall , its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thousands of caps and GS and As , written in pencil . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hop@@ ed , showing the inclusion of 200 letters ( or Nu@@ cl@@ e@@ ot@@ o@@ ids after the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist ) , how amazing similar , at least in biological terms , we all are . &quot;
&quot; what people will hopefully take away is that our gen@@ ome is not taking care of who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works of 2007 , sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , also to be seen . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition which is stored in a separate room , is a page from the above Com@@ ic Nov@@ elle . &quot;
it shows Mann@@ ing how it emerg@@ es with a free phone in the hand out of the discipline &apos;s arc@@ tic in the United States as King @-@ Kong .
&quot; if they put your speech , then they have won . &quot;
&quot; so , never the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came straight from a letter that she wrote me , &quot; &quot; said the artist who greet from Philadelphia . &quot;
&quot; I am still ge@@ ese , if I talk about it . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing has not yet seen the exhibition - so how it should be done in the com@@ ic book - but if they should do it , then she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks , who collap@@ sed by their own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; this was also targeted , as everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ atur ) , in which their genetic h@@ ap@@ log@@ groups were written with a pencil . &quot;
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted to feel that they feel like a man of crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement , who formed itself with Chelsea , like the movement , which was also behind their liberation . &quot;
Professor of the University of North@@ western and an employee of the University of Oxford because of the killing .
&quot; a nation@@ wide human hunt is in the way for a professor at the North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford , which were looked after a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with fatal injuries . &quot;
&quot; on Monday for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ ts because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , such as the acts of the officer of Cook County . &quot;
&quot; the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , after several stit@@ ches died . &quot;
&quot; one by the police authority of Chicago published a collaborative War@@ n@@ system , that the Lei@@ che was discovered on 27 July . &quot;
&quot; officials received a call , came to the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injury on his body . &quot;
&quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still explained at the place of the event for dead , and det@@ ective examine the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police actively seeks after the two susp@@ ects , said officials . &quot;
La@@ them has been an extraordinary professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at North@@ western University .
&quot; Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the Vice President for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail explanation , that La@@ ender has now been excluded in abroad and from the start of the campus of North@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; this is now a criminal matter which is examined by the competent authorities , and the North@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; said Cub@@ bage . &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; a spokes@@ man at the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail explanation , that &quot; we are in contact with the police in Britain in contact and ready to help the U.S. empowerment authorities in any conceivable manner . &quot;
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens colleagues were sho@@ cked and want he imagined .
&quot; Chief Communications Officer of the Police Authority of Chicago , Anthony Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi , said , he urge the susp@@ ects to place the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police has an idea of their place of residence , and our efforts to locate it , &quot; said Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects . &quot;
Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said , the police received a call from the building holder of the Grand @-@ Plaza @-@ building that had just received a pure tip , the said that in apartment 10@@ 08 was something happened . &quot;
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July .
it was confirmed by safety cameras that La@@ them and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; said Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation to the inhabitants : &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline , and the background of the sacrifice , and expl@@ ores a variety of motives , including a possible home incident . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will conclude the W@@ ada Road@@ map in the near future &quot; &quot; - the Russian vi@@ ep@@ re@@ mi@@ er Mut@@ ko &quot;
&quot; the Russian vi@@ ep@@ re@@ mi@@ er Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said , it will not last long until the remaining criteria of the world @-@ anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( W@@ ada ) will be implemented for restoring the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( R@@ USA@@ DA ) . &quot;
&quot; at a certain stage the meeting of the roadmap of the roadmap , R@@ USA@@ DA has received the right to plan and test in collaboration with UK@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) . &quot;
&quot; the W@@ ada timetable was updated in this respect , &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the PM commented on the second part of the roadmap of the W@@ ada to comply with the Code , which describes the criteria for re @-@ use of R@@ USA@@ DA and recently published on the website of the organization . &quot;
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause serious concern for Russia . &quot;
&quot; everything was announced , everything is implemented . &quot;
&quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( I@@ OC ) and W@@ ada in the near future , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; however , one of the criteria listed in the list mentioned criteria , however , that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities reported the reported results from the W@@ ada @-@ approved investigation by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren to publicly accept nation@@ ally funded D@@ op@@ ings in Russian sport . &quot;
&quot; in relation to the matter , Mut@@ ko : &quot; we lead the investigation into because our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has got an error . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there was no state programs , and we will not admit something that does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Mut@@ ual words voted with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing Commission . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with the Russian sales place R@@ sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov gave problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report is controversial positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; no one has to accept this report uncondi@@ tionally , &quot; &quot; he added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot;
R@@ USA@@ DA was excluded in November 2015 in the course of the dop@@ ing Sk@@ and@@ as by the W@@ ada of the implementation of dop@@ ing controls in Russia .
&quot; however , it was permitted to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( UK@@ AD ) . &quot;
&quot; after visiting the main artist of the organization in Moscow in July , W@@ ada @-@ General director Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli that R@@ USA@@ DA is moving &quot; in the right direction . &quot;

&quot; the start @-@ ups that will help your company , not to become the next U@@ ber &quot;
Amy Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure the happiness in your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up but the Surv@@ eys does not want .
&quot; answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful or - worse - fr@@ aud@@ ul@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; and even if you spoke anonym@@ ity , some workers do not bear the process . &quot;
&quot; there was simply never consistency and obj@@ ectivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce H@@ air Care Society Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed . &quot;
it has brought people from outside to help .
a new breed of human resources start @-@ ups is on the wax to help companies find out how their employees feel .
&quot; by creating and licensing of software , which address the specific purpose of measuring the employee &apos;s commitment , it enables companies to address surveys , speci@@ ality groups and demo@@ graphic groups , employees An@@ onym@@ ity and complaint to address the C @-@ Suite executives and address directly to the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; you now have tools such as Str@@ ava and Fit@@ Bit for the persecution of their health , but where is the Fit@@ Bit for your company ? &quot; &quot; says Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employees . &quot;
&quot; Er@@ ret@@ t said that she won a better insight into what your employees think and feel with G@@ lin@@ t in the three years . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the sn@@ ap surveys and surveys by certain teams , it offers a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which managers have low Addi@@ tional results - so that you can re@@ watches . &quot;
&quot; to do this , we need to make sure that at the top of the workplace culture , so that you have not been involved in the next U@@ ber that has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employees has published a blog post , which has spoken by those who have spoken , pun@@ ished . &quot;
for start @-@ ups like G@@ lin@@ t this wish is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business meeting .
&quot; global governance , regulation and compliance industry could possess more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion value , according to the financial technical website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps to avoid bad behaviour and see , saw an asc@@ ending interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the midst of the U@@ ber F@@ all in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit . &quot;
&quot; Conver@@ cent has almost 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la . &quot;
u@@ ber has recently been registered as a client .
&quot; as G@@ lin@@ t , enables Conver@@ cent company tailor @-@ made &quot; pulse &quot; to collect confidential answers in real time and see the warmth @-@ card of your problem areas . &quot;
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line with the employee who can subscribe to a real behavior .
&quot; and if the main business leader is involved , complaints can go directly to the Super@@ visory Board . &quot;
&quot; the court of public opinion has captured the Reg@@ ulators , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and CEO of Conver@@ cent . &quot;
&quot; if a company is found that its staff is poorly treated or un@@ ethical , it can be precious consequences by consumers @-@ boy@@ cot@@ t , worker fluctu@@ ation and pl@@ agues , said Qu@@ in@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant @-@ chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations , convertible Conver@@ cent for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of policy and procedures and have a simple way to reach its corporate headquarters . &quot;
&quot; earlier when a employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to submit a telephone number or e @-@ mail for the company central , a formal complaint and hope that it was taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; it was often a inti@@ mid@@ ation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Co@@ uns@@ el , who said , there was no good way to trace the complaints from employees . &quot;
&quot; now , as the company Conver@@ cent uses , problems that have previously been hidden in cities or states that have been hidden in offices in towns or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or un@@ lau@@ ght internship - faster and addressed . &quot;
&quot; I can closer to this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view into the experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , which guides the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment and disputes . &quot;
&quot; company started to take ethics , values and employees engagement in 2002 after the accounting company Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed for ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal said Qu@@ in@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; but it lasted until the &quot; social media came to their right &quot; , &quot; that companies knew that you could not prevent that their dirty laundry online passed . &quot;
&quot; before using technology for monitoring the ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ cent provide your software as a service , and bel@@ lows the company with recur@@ ring fees for the use of their products . &quot;
&quot; it is a business model , and a chance that support the consent of Venture Capital Invest@@ ors who support both start @-@ ups . &quot;
&quot; Conver@@ cent was awarded $ 10 million in funding in February by companies such as Sap@@ ph@@ ire Ventures and T@@ ola Capital , which has been lifted up the total capital to $ 47 million . &quot;
Gl@@ itz@@ ers increased $ 10 million in November of B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners and brought its full financing to $ 60 million .
&quot; these investments are hardly surprising , given the connected nature of companies , culture and Venture Capital . &quot;
&quot; there is a growing complex of research , which shows that today &apos;s employees will expect more than before . &quot;
&quot; in competitive markets such as Sili@@ con Valley are high sal@@ aries , and interesting projects only in@@ serts . &quot;
the employees want to have the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are glad to feel in a company that heard their voices , and that the work you do is worth doing this company , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Employ@@ ee Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which is both Conver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
&quot; investors can reach you , if their portfolio companies run well . companies run well if employees are campaign@@ ing and engaged . &quot;
&quot; if the Analytics tools of third promise , commitment and commitment of employees , it is not a miracle that you find support . &quot;
the data on the employees engagement by the experts in the workplace culture is important .
&quot; however , the data are useless if the car@@ et@@ aker of a company does not take action . &quot;
&quot; in fact , if a company asks employees after your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way . &quot;
&quot; and if change does not come fast enough , or not at all , this can dis@@ appointments and def@@ aul@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 comments , you must be ready to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting in the business management company Kot@@ ter International , who have seen themselves too much on the collecting of data . &quot;
&quot; for if you are not going to follow the staff , &quot; &quot; did you really heard me ? &quot;
do you take care of this ?
and if you don &apos;t care about why should I take ?
&quot; Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who runs now monthly staff surveys , was able to commen@@ ce measures on the same day when a problem about G@@ lin@@ t is reported . &quot;
&quot; and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , she was able to re@@ organise new teams within the company and add a communication training to the problems within the company . &quot;
&quot; at Ruby Tuesday , the company will always receive new insights on the employees , and it hopes that in long run this leads to a better bond of workers in a branch that is known for high turnover . &quot;
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose man , &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose humans , you also lose customers . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose customers , you will lose companies . &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the brood
&quot; it is about 23 o &apos;clock , when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ players on one side of the new exercise fields of the team on the campus . &quot;
some have moved their trig@@ gers and show the back full of swe@@ at from the first day of training agers .
for a good portion of the team these unt@@ ary minutes represent a lunch break .
players who are written to the summer courses will return after the three @-@ hour exercise to their final testing before they return next morning at 6 : 30 am to the water@@ man Football Center .
&quot; this is for the guys the next three days a real Tre@@ t@@ mill , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before the Monday to Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of the players , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the first three sessions of U@@ C@@ LA at 19 : 15 pm should start to meet the already packed newspaper plans for the players . &quot;
&quot; the compromise path from the two days is more than a day , at which the brood is postpon@@ ed almost one week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six times in West@@ wood , practical exercises . &quot;
&quot; in the course of August 18 exercises , you should hold off in the course of August 18 exercises . 20 before the formal game preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude against Texas A &amp; M in September . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ a said that he support the rules of the N@@ CA@@ A suppor@@ ter , even if they add to the many busy routes of the players to add another point . &quot;
&quot; we place this enormous load for three or four days on it , and it is very challenging , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; and they simply pushed it down , they are plac@@ ken on , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; I think once we come to Saturday and we have more time , it really is great . &quot;
&quot; the U@@ C@@ LA will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished , which in view of the clear Sh@@ ech@@ es of its fields , adjacent to its adjacent car park and adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of up@@ scale class , which is already covered with foot@@ prints , which will be an easy task . &quot;
&quot; brood @-@ players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a spatial one that could give a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far fet@@ ched to think that people can rent a room there and then set up a practice . &quot;
&quot; if you have the video ob@@ and from a practice , it is a fairly good deal . &quot;
but we have security forces there and we have security forces at parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
I am not so much worried about this .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy the facts in the fight against counter@@ feit messages
&quot; Facebook wants to send more potential items with fal@@ seh@@ oods by third parties and show their results in the original post , then the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of its efforts to fight so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News . &quot;
&quot; the company said in an opinion on his website , that it is used with the use of updated machines learning methods to recognize potential fal@@ seh@@ ood , and to send them to the fact that may display the results of the check @-@ check of the original article . &quot;
&quot; Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the principal points for so @-@ called F@@ ake news , many of whom believe that they also have influenced the US presidential election in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the problem also has become a large political issue in Europe with false stories when the presidential elections were pun@@ ished in May with false stories , and Germany will support a plan , according to social media networks , if they are not able to eliminate h@@ asser@@ tive post@@ ings as before the elections there in September . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate declaration in German , that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany started a test of the new facts review . &quot;
&quot; in addition to knowledge , what stories of fact @-@ controlled parties will be challenged , people want to meet more context in order to make sound decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara Su , Product management for Facebook @-@ news in a blog . &quot;
&quot; she added that Facebook will continue to test his feature to the &quot; &quot; related Articles &quot; &quot; and will be working on other changes to his messages . &quot;
creating a com@@ ic package : a castle in the history of England
in his younger past the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a Squ@@ ee@@ ze music video and was for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ he and 1980 @-@ he years .
&quot; but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history of its cozy seat at the Ma@@ ent River Valley in K@@ ent and is now available for inspiration for a graphical novel by Jamie Rhodes , a m@@ op@@ ha@@ ired Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents . &quot;
&quot; I think it &apos;s so nice to look at the manus@@ cript of someone who has been dead since 300 years , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; what a personal relationship , to keep this letter in my hand . &quot;
&quot; a Castle in England &apos;s sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documented the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . every story was illustrated by another , upcoming British artist illustr@@ ates - Isaac L@@ enk@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Is@@ abel Gre@@ enberg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book of Rhodes , based on an archive : he wrote 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he was unexpected emotional . &quot;
&quot; I only re@@ acted on the thum@@ b print on the side of a letter that was re@@ acted by a double @-@ day in the 1700 @-@ s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; says he . &quot;
&quot; this is his thum@@ bs !
&quot; and letters always cra@@ wl to smoke , because back then I established a fire because of the light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has a effect , as if he himself did . &quot;
&quot; Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
&quot; for someone who has done so with old pap@@ acy that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England , and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest , &quot; &quot; I have been a little over@@ rated , &quot; ) this all seems to be true . &quot;
&quot; Rhodes spent his days to explore the vi@@ kt@@ orian &quot; new &quot; castle , to study the archives and study the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , like the mon@@ oton@@ ous hy@@ ena @-@ heads in the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; he emig@@ rated through the terrain and ruins of the old castle and spoke to Land@@ scape , gar@@ den@@ ers , and sometimes also with the artists that worked on the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; then , at night he drank &quot; whis@@ key , and began to write . &quot;
&quot; the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust received only 2006 the full access when the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey died . &quot;
&quot; when Rhodes a decade later , the employees started to take care of the archive that he said as &quot; hundreds of years , in which Arist@@ ocr@@ ats said , &quot; Oh , wir@@ es it on the loft . &quot;
&quot; meeting books , letters from the time of English Emp@@ ires , cards who would represent : &quot; one could think that country conflict would be boring , &quot; says Rhodes , &quot; but there was a pe@@ ar to have fought the two families . &quot;
guys , let &apos;s go all his course ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to view on bre@@ ader base in the english story , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , who leaves a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the farm@@ houses of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a record of a tur@@ mo@@ il , the 13@@ 80 in the castle entered in this book with the title &apos; K@@ night@@ ly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , says Rhodes . &quot;
&quot; the farm began in this area and I thought , an u@@ prising was a good start . &quot;
maybe the two are linked ? &quot;
&quot; other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - as &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , who tells the story of the Jes@@ u@@ it &apos;s pat@@ tern@@ er , who hid the family Dar@@ rell seven years during the English Reformation . &quot;
&quot; or &apos; The Sm@@ ug@@ gler &apos; , which is represented by Schm@@ ug@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rell from the 18th century , who filled his own funeral ( a discovery that was only years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) . &quot;
&quot; the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rhodes &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; &quot; the lords are going to be sil@@ ently cro@@ ok , getting back debt and spend money for things that they could not afford . &quot;
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ rell &apos;s men prov@@ oked their debt crises , by married king@@ doms - I imagine it as a p@@ ile well @-@ looking guys before , with a talent to advertise Er@@ bin@@ nen . &quot;
after the end of his efforts at the castle Rhodes is in search of other unique scre@@ aming experiences .
&quot; he has brought a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a com@@ ic novel via El@@ ev@@ än@@ ki , the terrain of a san@@ at@@ orio from the early 20th century , which has since been called back by nature . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back again , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it was like : &quot; Oh , now I have to be finished with dam@@ n life again . &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Marien@@ kap@@ elle in Rh@@ en@@ dorf
&quot; with the envel@@ oping of the 301 years old Marien@@ kap@@ elle in Rh@@ en@@ dorf , the town of Bad Honnef started its campaign to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau of Thursday ) . &quot;
by Thursday Mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team to hold Nelson Art@@ z the logo and the slogan .
at the end of August it should be the highlight of the campaign a festival on the island of Graf@@ en@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; too beautiful for us .
&quot; or ? , ask the creators of the action since yesterday on the poster at the Rh@@ en@@ dor@@ fer chapel . &quot;
&quot; we think that ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; write them on their yesterday release . &quot;
but we use this measure to gain your attention .
and in order to make clear that some is better than it seems .
&quot; basically , we are the firm conviction that we should know the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city very well . &quot;
&quot; in action it is more than &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , it is called on . &quot;
&quot; it is true to form@@ ulate a single @-@ ste@@ al promise , one that the city gives an un@@ mistak@@ able allergy features . &quot;
&quot; finally , they stand in competition with other municipalities . &quot;
&quot; a medium @-@ five @-@ dig@@ it amount can be found in the town of Bad Honnef its new umbrella , and the campaign . &quot;
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan fear of the army
each year in early August advis@@ es in Ankara of the Upper Military Council ( Y@@ as ) about penetration and transport in the officer cor@@ ps .
so also this week .
at first glance a normal operation .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish armed forces one year after the coup .
&quot; the meeting took place no longer in the building of the General Staff , like earlier , but in the office of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; at the presidency of the state , the five vi@@ ep@@ re@@ mi@@ ers as well as the Minister for Defence , Inner@@ es , Justice and He@@ ating Office . &quot;
&quot; thus , the civilians in the Y@@ as were in the surplus . &quot;
the government moves the military to the military .
&quot; governor Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the com@@ man@@ ders of the army , the air forces and the Nav@@ y were dropped . &quot;
&quot; since the failed coupl@@ ings of Erdo@@ gan , 169 of the 3@@ 26 Gener@@ als and Ad@@ mir@@ rors have been filmed . &quot;
&quot; more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the army of the army - mostly because of those related links to the movement of the exile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who sees the Erdo@@ gan as a wire pull . &quot;
&quot; against 486 people who were immediately involved in the coup attempt , will be negotiated in Ankara since this week . &quot;
&quot; even on the day after the coup Erdo@@ gan had called the overthrow as a &quot; &quot; gift &quot; &quot; since he give him the opportunity to clean the armed forces . &quot;
but Erdo@@ gan had the army really on the handle ?
&quot; at the end of February , the &quot; &quot; Hür@@ riyet &quot; &quot; published an article with the heading &quot; un@@ eas@@ iness in the military headquarters . &quot;
&quot; in general , there are concerns concerns about the increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which is manifest@@ ed among other things in the lifting of the head@@ tu@@ ch@@ ver@@ bot@@ s for Sol@@ dat@@ ors , wrote the newspaper . &quot;
the large cleaner in the army and the security guards goes on .
&quot; middle of July Erdo@@ gan by decre@@ e additional 73@@ 95 citizenship , including 230@@ 3 police officers and 54@@ 6 soldiers . &quot;
it seemed like Erdo@@ gan run the military .
gener@@ als formerly considered the actual men of the country .
three times put@@ ted them under vocation to her role as guar@@ di@@ ans of the world@@ ly state .
&quot; after his election of 2002 , Erdo@@ gan &apos;s power is the power of the military step back , not least among appeal to the reform of the European Union . &quot;
former officers say Erdo@@ gan is targeted to the armed forces of the armed forces .
&quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; V@@ oc@@ al Europe &quot; &quot; was a particular not met officers , who sought after the coup attempt out of fear of persecution abroad asylum , the Turkish army will be &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ af@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; if that meets , such development could not let the N@@ ato could not be cold . &quot;
&quot; in any case , in the alliance according to the cleansing of the Turkish army . &quot;
&quot; the leadership structures and operational abilities are &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; say N@@ ato diplom@@ ats . &quot;
Washington changes rules for the Green Card
&quot; there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , President Donald Tru@@ mp , quoted from the media . &quot;
&quot; he sees to reduce the legal immigrants on 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules for the use of visa for a temporary working permit and restrictions for families @-@ oriented visa . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Republi@@ cans and supported by the President .
the leg@@ is@@ lat@@ tice should be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers , and will do this by changing the way the people from other countries Green Cards . &quot;
the law will prevent the chains of migration and replace the current system .
&quot; this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that our economy will become good , &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp , quoted from the American media . &quot;
ministry wants to track circuit for race
over the past few months the future of the race sh@@ utt@@ les have been sc@@ anned - now it is supposed to go very quickly .
&quot; before the end of the year , the tourist cable will be built , built on which the tourist cable drives , will be built . &quot;
&quot; in order to secure the future of the race sh@@ utt@@ les in the long term , should begin following the transport of the Ministry of Commerce in this year construction work on the track . &quot;
&quot; with the decision to order and to order the track of Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country is primarily responsible for tourism , &quot; &quot; stated traffic @-@ secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot;
the cost of restoring the track is about 2.5 million euros .
&quot; from this sum , the land takes 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; the contract , on whose basis the shuttle should also be ordered in the future of the country , will now finally be matched , explained S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the Ministry and the Süd@@ th@@ ür@@ ingen train as a operator has already agreed upon the technical details .
&quot; this means that the timetable , which applied to the used vehicles and quality standards , &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
so that the Renn@@ stei@@ g shuttle will be ordered on December 2017 .
the Renn@@ stei@@ g shuttle is one of the most popular trip between the stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
&quot; over the past few months , it was tested in the course of a pilot business , if the distance of sufficient many people is used to order them in the future . &quot;
the route is also very strong in parts .
the rise of sex robot is real and we should worry
&quot; just as you thought it &apos;s not yet to be crazy , a new report comes across the technological developments in the field of sex robots . &quot;
&quot; yes , actually . &quot;
sex robots are currently a great thing .
recently published Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for responsible Robotics ) ( FR@@ R ) a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
&quot; according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , em@@ eri@@ ti@@ ously Professor of Robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we must start to take their ascent seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the eye @-@ color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of fingers . &quot;
&quot; people make themselves funny , but the companies deliver a lot of it , and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; said Mr Shar@@ key in the release of his new report . &quot;
&quot; modern Sex@@ es have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a si@@ lic@@ ally , which feels warm , with conscious human reactions , which are achieved through artificial intelligence . &quot;
&quot; the user can also adjust his robot according to his con@@ vic@@ tions , &quot; and all of them choose from the eye @-@ color of the robot over the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or color of his fing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; but it is still disturbing , as many robots poss@@ essing the &quot; personalities , &quot; which would look like a Step@@ ford woman . &quot;
modern Sex@@ es have developed to robots with a Sili@@ cone skin .
&quot; the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x @-@ robots allows for example to adapt its users to adapt its robots to the properties that they are appealing , such as students . &quot;
and then there is still that of the True Compan@@ ion developed Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold Sex @-@ robots with pre @-@ programmed personalities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which conv@@ eys the impression of students and &quot; Wild Wendy &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that is adapted as good as possible , the website of the True Compan@@ ion . &quot;
&quot; like them , what you like , and they don &apos;t like what you do not like , etc . &quot;
it also has its m@@ oods in the course of the day - all like real people !
she can be tired in conversation or she can be &quot; in the mood . &quot;
&quot; there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robot - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the dis@@ rup@@ ting female attributes , the adequ@@ acy to rape if one goes a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( means here : resist@@ ing ) Far@@ rah is a peaceful one on the most . &quot;
&quot; on his web site , True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a Vibr@@ ator , but for men . &quot;
&quot; if women ( sic ) have a vibration , why can men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; is it stated on the website . &quot;
&quot; however , these sex robots are not only a fe@@ tish or just another sex . &quot;
&quot; their emergence and increasing refinement refer to something dark and deeper in our culture , to a withdrawal from the ideal gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition . &quot;
&quot; most men will certainly hold no sex robots , and while the FR@@ R showed their increasing popularity , they still remain provisional at the edge of consumer culture . &quot;
&quot; but what out of the boundary of the boundary can be through , in terms of the spirit of time , in which we live , very instruc@@ tive . &quot;
&quot; and many people are not strange or offensive , until the free market is available . &quot;
&quot; there is a certain amount of over@@ cutting that these highly developed sex robots are emerging in a time , in which the rights of women are threatened in the White House , who has under@@ ed women sexually attacked . &quot;
the terrible aspect of the television series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s Tale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the Mag@@ d &apos;@@ ) are not the graphical images that sw@@ ung body and the stolen eyes but how realistic this vision works .
&quot; the Republic of Gilead is a jump , but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap . &quot;
the goal behind these sex robot is to make a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( if also with porno@@ star proportions ) .
&quot; their buil@@ ders want to feel human , that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body . &quot;
&quot; but , brought to the point when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots are no real women . &quot;
you cannot separate or walk away from their companions .
&quot; they do not have mediation or background history , nothing , which indicates independence or anything that could inter@@ fere with the fantasy of total sub@@ jug@@ ation . &quot;
otherwise expressed : they are counter@@ part slaves .
or to express it in the speech of 2017 : maid
Tru@@ mp@@ s big performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney to the beg@@ ging of the healthy life .
&quot; it has become a bin@@ der of the Tru@@ mp era that the political divisions , which have pol@@ arized the US elect@@ or@@ ship , even families in small format . &quot;
&quot; around Christmas and Ern@@ t@@ ed@@ ank@@ fest , there were newspapers with advice on how to deal with the horror of Tru@@ mp &apos;s relative relative . &quot;
we all told us all supposedly to leave our filter gases .
&quot; less noticed is the power of Tru@@ mp@@ s , families together . &quot;
&quot; I mention this , because my C@@ alo@@ on , a left @-@ oriented poet , who lives in Chicago and has long been occupied with the republi@@ cans in our family , visited me this week in New York . &quot;
they remembered that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
&quot; with Tru@@ mp in the White House is everyone who knows them , including the Republi@@ can relationship , with which she had fought for decades due to politics , suddenly and quite peculi@@ ar on the same side . &quot;
&quot; around the dining table , this certainly is a good thing , but it falls me in a further context that this will also bring significant risks . &quot;
&quot; the left has been strengthened by Tru@@ mp , but the satisfactory effect of his presidency has the power to push us all right . &quot;
&quot; when we speak of &quot; &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; &quot; and Tru@@ mp , we refer to the gr@@ ading possibility of being able to b@@ ending us of a day of one day . &quot;
&quot; however there is a still scar@@ f scenario scenario in the Tru@@ mp Republi@@ can of the right wing &quot; &quot; norm@@ alized &quot; , &quot; which suddenly appeared in comparison to its standards in comparison to its standards . &quot;
&quot; I find myself nowadays from an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s gr@@ acious version of the temp@@ ter , which saw 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax statement looked at ) - both in comparison to Tru@@ mp in fact occur in a very mild criminal off@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; if Tru@@ mp goes , the next candidate to Republi@@ can only be intellec@@ tu@@ ally healthy to qualify as un@@ measurable improvement . &quot;
&quot; when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park , the largest of the New York park department , and the best three dollars you can spend in town if you do not require caffeine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are enormous , the fiber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all cl@@ owns are kn@@ ur@@ ly and the animals rot@@ ate to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the weather @-@ friendly music conv@@ eys this in a strange way . &quot;
&quot; so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of high buildings are old , the sky@@ lines become familiar to offer a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice . &quot;
&quot; fifth thirty years later , and I still didn &apos;t know all over the day , when I found Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss Cottage - the theme @-@ pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not - but a large roundabout in the North of London . &quot;
&quot; the Central Park @-@ carousel is still a strange magic experience , as there are two two years old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ s and have all a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could evaluate the carousel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one has asked for it . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , I was forced to judge my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before I managed my credit card . &quot;
&quot; in the coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option , the rating with a 15 % drinking money - this to buy something about the counter . &quot;
&quot; this does not only lead to a slo@@ wing of what actually should be a neutral exchange , but also exercise pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no need is required . &quot;
&quot; the poor woman in the department store ap@@ ologi@@ zed exc@@ eed@@ ingly , while I was tired of experience to reach my credit card with five stars . &quot;
Oscar G@@ ori@@ us with breast pain moved from prison to hospital
Pist@@ ori@@ us has left the prison for a hospital .
&quot; last year he was brought to the hospital for the treatment of cuts in the hospital , which he suffered the prison bodies according to a fall in his cell . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us was condemned because of the prosec@@ utor of the Public Prosec@@ ut@@ ors against a first Tot@@ ally .
he t@@ opped Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early hours of Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day 2013 by taking them several times through a door of the toil@@ ett@@ enk@@ ab@@ ine in his house in Pret@@ oria .
&quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us asser@@ ted that he held his girlfriend for a night @-@ night in@@ tru@@ der , who hid in the cabin . &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention , this time against six @-@ year imprisonment of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , of which they say , they be too sight@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the National Criminal Act said that they will rise to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the objection could be heard this year . &quot;
&quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us runs danger , that his sentence is increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful . &quot;
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as Bauer Arnold a strange egg
&quot; as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the neighborhoods of F@@ ossi@@ ans and E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen were released into the holidays and in the continued schools . &quot;
three of the perpet@@ rators go to the gymn@@ asium , four to the real school . &quot;
Schul@@ leit@@ ner Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen .

&quot; in addition , the m@@ igh@@ e Sch@@ ar led a musical with the title &quot; The Eagle in the Ch@@ n@@ erhof . &quot;
&quot; Bauer Arnold was a stran@@ gely egg , and caused it from his h@@ ens . &quot;
instead of a chicken we@@ k came a little eag@@ le .
&quot; but the hope to make out of him a chicken , sm@@ ash himself , the eag@@ le spread out on a high mountain its wings and escap@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; then , the classes showed three and four in the study of Yvonne Frank a chicken . &quot;
&quot; racing dances with the young go@@ ck@@ le , the cylinder for the w@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; the Adler stand for the integration , said Schul@@ leit@@ er Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te . &quot;
&quot; the young is different from the other young animals ( chic@@ ks ) , but were included . &quot;
but he will never be like a chicken .
his purpose is to be free .
they wished every quarter cl@@ ei@@ ler that he feels in his new school .
&quot; it followed thank@@ fulness to the colleagues , the former school leader Michael Müller , who is again in@@ scri@@ bed again at sub @-@ courses , and the parents representatives . &quot;
the kitchen @-@ time is now over , declared school teachers Sophia Schum@@ acher . &quot;
&quot; she met her students after two years of lessons , because it had been a really great time . &quot;
&quot; finally , they can rely on the quarters of the district . &quot;
&quot; in conclusion , all the students left a song of summer time and holiday season . &quot;
it broke great joy in the children .
for the new school year the first eight years are already registered .

software update for diesel vehicles : what those affected are now to know
how exactly can the software update take place ?
must diesel @-@ driver take part in the action ?
the most important questions and answers in an overview .
&quot; at the diesel summit , BMW , Daim@@ ler , Opel and the VW Group software updates for a total of about 5.5 million cars . &quot;
they are supposed to improve the gas@@ k@@ le of cars from the emissions classes Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ diesel or worse are exemp@@ t .
Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in from the ACE car Club Europe returns :
is the new action compul@@ sory ?

ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center award
Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the gl@@ am@@ orous events in Washington .
&quot; the first prize @-@ giving ceremony under President Tru@@ mp promises to become political , politically . &quot;
one of the winners will not come from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) gets first Rap@@ per one of the cov@@ eted awards of the prestigious Kennedy Center .
&quot; as the Kultur@@ stiftung on Thursday announced , this year also singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ on@@ el Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the chore@@ o@@ grapher Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman L@@ AR ( 95 ) . &quot;
the awards will be passed beginning of December .
&quot; traditionally , U.S. President Donald Tru@@ mp will hold a welcome and participate along with his wife Mel@@ ania to the awar@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; with progressive TV series , the winners of the L@@ AR announced therefore already on to rel@@ inqu@@ ish the participation in the g@@ ala . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; this presidency has decided to fully negl@@ ect the Arts and Human Rights - even the means to discharge them , and that will be stra@@ ined me . &quot;
&quot; the 59 @-@ year Est@@ ef@@ an stressed , she will use the conversation with Tru@@ mp to address their view . &quot;
the Kennedy @-@ Centre after the former President John F. Kennedy @-@ Centre is the largest cultural facility in the U.S. capital .
&quot; among the former lau@@ re@@ ers count Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Franklin , Robert De N@@ iro , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing . &quot;
we make the city worth living
&quot; Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , goes to R@@ ente year in the coming year . &quot;
&quot; however , the place is already written - suitable applicants are r@@ ar . &quot;
for 31 years the W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister
and the work is still great fun as he was in the pres@@ ump@@ y .
&quot; he reports of diversi@@ fied , but also demanding tasks that are waiting for his successor . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , don &apos;t forget that until now no application will have the application profile . &quot;
the city is looking for a night@@ time at the time of an architect or an engineer .
this is how - under consideration of the regular notice of cancellation - still enough time to be elabor@@ ation .
&quot; as Has@@ l@@ ach , for the administrative community as a sub@@ ordination of the regulatory authorities , the applicant needs to present the applicant . &quot;
because this function wants to keep the city any case .
&quot; if they cannot fill them in any more , the citizens would need to go to consultancy up to Off@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; but Bür@@ g@@ ern@@ ess was the city and of it itself important , says W@@ acker , who reported by a good operating sk@@ li@@ ma as well as good mood between authority and citizens . &quot;
&quot; over 30 years in office , some major projects have accumulated while W@@ acker looks back with pride . &quot;
&quot; we make the city worth living , he is confident about the building and its staff . &quot;
&quot; but also in the future , varied projects on the agenda : the re@@ arrangement of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the low@@ land of course , are su@@ preme . &quot;
the movie bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed and the stadium is still subject .
&quot; the latter alone will strike around 1.5 million Euros for be@@ ech , &quot; &quot; if we make it right , &quot; estimates W@@ acker . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; all in all great tasks are waiting for my successor . &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
conf@@ lic@@ ally is present for a urban master of great scope .
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s own Bau@@ hof and gar@@ dener could be responded to plenty of flexibility .
&quot; you can move a lot , so W@@ acker , and the design of the founders will often be praised by citizens and visitors . &quot;
&quot; because the old town stands as an ensemble under monument protection , be it important to have &quot; an eye to have what rein@@ stated , &quot; if new constructions are approved , empha@@ sizes the schei@@ der Stadt@@ bau@@ meister . &quot;
&quot; anyway , the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister has high responsibility . &quot;
&quot; he is the client , &quot; &quot; in the end everything is running here over my table . &quot;
&quot; for children and coordination he can count on many years of experience : Markus Neum@@ ai@@ er ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been doing this since ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( Deep @-@ construction ) has been around for 15 years . &quot;
&quot; also that his successor remains long , desire W@@ acker : &quot; we seek someone who really wants to be identified with the place . &quot;
&quot; for continuity is not only important for a good working environment , but also for the further development of the city . &quot;
&quot; who wants to show Roland W@@ acker , should be able to provide information about the city of Has@@ l@@ ach as a diploma engineer or Bachelor &apos;s degree of expertise in the fields of construction and construction markets . &quot;
&quot; the municipal office is high @-@ building and low @-@ construction , construction planning , gr@@ under@@ mine affairs , administration of urban property , municipal office building with Bau@@ hof and Stadt@@ g@@ ärt@@ ner , as well as sub@@ ordin@@ ances , including monument protection . &quot;
bike on lines thrown out : southeast track closed
&quot; according to police , the blue bike had thrown off the blue bicycle from the railway station in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ enes street ( B@@ 116 ) . &quot;
these were so strongly damaged that the her@@ b@@ ah@@ end Gü@@ ter@@ suit had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators are going from two male tat@@ too and look for the night hours after them .
near the scene there were witnesses a ros@@ ar@@ oter Roll@@ ers and a bike @-@ driver had been observed .
&quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ bu@@ ben@@ st@@ reich , &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch to APA . &quot;
the or the perpet@@ rators brought themselves into great danger and also threat@@ ens the traffic .
&quot; in addition to the damage to the Lo@@ k and the plant , as well as the delay &quot; &quot; admission &quot; &quot; and the cost of rail traffic @-@ traffic could also come to the perpet@@ rators of the rail@@ ways . &quot;
&quot; to go from a &quot; significant &quot; sum , &quot; said the speaker . &quot;
&quot; the damages were fixed on Friday afternoon , the rail traffic on the south line could not be led without disability . &quot;
&quot; almost ten person@@ ings were Friday morning , two of them g@@ rie@@ ve the correspondence . &quot;
&quot; ces@@ ter@@ gers fell not out , but they had no delay . &quot;
according to the Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be replaced around 200 metres
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
&quot; red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help , IB@@ D ( inflammatory disease ) &quot;
red meat and chocolate can sound for your diges@@ tive system as a night@@ mare .
&quot; but a new study holds exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , the symptoms of patients with inflammatory diseases . &quot;
&quot; the incur@@ able state that affects approximately 1.3 million and in the UK 30@@ 0.000 , causes mag@@ en@@ cr@@ amps and bl@@ eeding , recur@@ ring or bloody diar@@ rhe@@ a , weight loss and extreme ti@@ redness . &quot;
&quot; during the person concerned , meat and dairy products are usually come to rel@@ ieve their symptoms , researchers at the Washing@@ toner University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han came to develop immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant intest@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; the researcher researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , declared that immune cells at the Dar@@ m pat@@ rol to ensure that dam@@ aging micro@@ bes to hide in the food not penet@@ rate into the body . &quot;
&quot; cells , which are able to cut inflammation , are compens@@ ated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without being sensitive tissues . &quot;
&quot; if the balance is too far towards inflammation , it may result a inflammatory disease . &quot;
&quot; in experiments , it was noted that a kind of tolerance is condu@@ ci@@ zed immune cell that occurs in mice , which carry a certain bacter@@ ium in their inser@@ tions . &quot;
and the bacter@@ ium needed tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the components of proteins in order to cut the appearance of the cells .
&quot; Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ oms , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance . &quot;
&quot; the more Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice in their food , the more they had of these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and an an tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han rich diet toler@@ ant , less infl@@ atable bo@@ wel promotes , if the same system is also wir@@ ling with people . &quot;
&quot; the Post@@ do@@ kt@@ or@@ and@@ in Dr. Luisa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an sear@@ ched a sort of immune cell that encourages tolerance , when she found such cells , but another group of the same tribe but that was not separate . &quot;
&quot; they suspected that the difference between the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ omes of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and mushrooms which usually live in the stomach @-@ intestinal tract . &quot;
&quot; the intest@@ ines of the mice were found DNA sequ@@ entially and there were six bacterial species present in the mice with the immune cells , but without them lacking in mice . &quot;
&quot; mice were raised in a ster@@ ile environment so that they did not have a intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome and they did not developed these kinds of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells . &quot;
&quot; to understand how the bacteria applied to the immune system , the researchers released L. reu@@ ter@@ i in a fluid and then over@@ led small quantities of fluid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ri@@ pe immune cells that were isolated by the mice . &quot;
the immune cells developed into toler@@ ant cells .
&quot; as the active component of the liquid was cle@@ ans@@ ed , it proved to be known as a by @-@ product of the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ Met@@ abol@@ ism which is known as an In@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid . &quot;
&quot; if the researchers hit the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the food of the mice , the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent , but if the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ dic@@ s were hal@@ ved , the number of cells dropped by half . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes Bar@@ rag@@ an explained that people have the same toler@@ ant cells such as mice , and that most of us protect L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our stomach @-@ intestinal tractors . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i can develop the cells in humans as with mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with inflammatory disease . &quot;
&quot; she said : &quot; &quot; the development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote , since these cells are inflammation of the inner surface of the intest@@ ines . &quot;
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ values can lead to an expansion of this population .
&quot; Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic a &quot; genius &quot; has been committed
&quot; at Manchester United has signed an &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , &quot; &quot; believes Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der evening his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria . &quot;
&quot; the 40 million pounds of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game , before the UEF@@ A @-@ Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday begins , and impressive in the holder of old role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira after popularity . &quot;
&quot; MAT@@ IC was however excluded from the prepar@@ edness @-@ Asia tour of the blues , and managed only 45 minutes to improve M@@ our@@ in@@ ho that he had to improve before the Premier League season . &quot;
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot;
we will help him sooner than later .
&quot; in addition to M@@ atic start@@ up also Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u in the Avi@@ va Stadium , as M@@ our@@ in@@ ho his start @-@ XI for the start of the season . &quot;
&quot; the Independent un@@ covered in this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho still wished three other new obligation , but he insi@@ sted that the club had already done a &quot; fantastic work , &quot; three of its four priority releases . &quot;
&quot; three of four to get , thanks to the association , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they got four of four , but they have given great effort . &quot;
Boeing &quot; m@@ alt &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the US @-@ plane Boeing Boeing the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers in the sky painted .
&quot; the pil@@ ots flew from Seattle in the U.S. state Washington off , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state of Michigan and moved to the form of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers over the USA , which are several thousand kilometres . &quot;
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the rad@@ ar@@ ach@@ men the form of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers was to be .
the whole was a sti@@ p@@ est for new engines .
Boeing had already made such advertising earlier .
so the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing @-@ Logo in the sky was painted .
&quot; new woo@@ fer for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
&quot; as the wind blo@@ ws : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still the SPD boss , the Social Democratic Prime Minister before elections always with a certain concern to Berlin . &quot;
&quot; merely there are no interference from the party central , merely no counter@@ wind from the covenant - so lau@@ ded the most important wish of the election . &quot;
&quot; since Martin Schulz takes the party , this has changed fundamentally . &quot;
&quot; since then , the employees from the Willy Brandt Brandt observe the events from the Willy Brandt and the events in the SPD @-@ governed state capitals . &quot;
&quot; what he has got from there since the beginning of the year , the counter would not even be described in the approach . &quot;
there were underground .
and one after another .
the federal @-@ CD@@ U looks after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony as a general signal against Ko@@ ali@@ tions of SPD and Gre@@ ens .
&quot; this shows once more : red @-@ green can simply not be sure , &quot; said CD@@ U @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber from the editors Germany ( R@@ N@@ D ) . &quot;
the surprising frac@@ tion@@ ist of a Green Party has over@@ thrown the Government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) in a severe crisis .
five months before the Land@@ election election his red @-@ green coalition led its A @-@ vote majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Gre@@ ens @-@ Bundes@@ ts@@ leader Michael Kell@@ ner has called the Ab@@ tr@@ ün@@ ful Nieder@@ s@@ äch@@ sische Gre@@ ens El@@ ke urged to return their mandate .
the crossing to the CD@@ U means a clear fal@@ si@@ fication of the elect@@ or@@ ate .
&quot; El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ et must immediately return to its mandate , &quot; &quot; said the Federal Chancellor and campaigns of the Gre@@ ens Network Germany ( R@@ N@@ D ) . &quot;
&quot; this must not be true , however , not it must be true , as on Friday morning the new Hi@@ ob@@ s@@ bot@@ anic was reached the party central meeting . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD @-@ president of Nieder@@ sachsen , stands for the survi@@ vor@@ s of the green members of El@@ ke T@@ ories to CD@@ U without their own registr@@ ations . &quot;
it is the provisional highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in the SPD &apos;s state associations .
and no one knows what comes next .
the Mis@@ ere began with the unexpected significant defeat in the Saarland election in March .
&quot; a blue eye , more not , so@@ othing the comrades . &quot;
after the elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ West@@ p@@ hal@@ ia will be anything different .
it was then too - and it was so much worse .
&quot; the defeat in Kiel , brought the SPD to the exchange , the Du@@ essel@@ dorf and the party smooth . &quot;
lab@@ orious the comrades in the weeks then again .
&quot; then when they had just had a new courage , the G @-@ 20 Summit came from Hamburg . &quot;
and with him the next woo@@ fer came .
&quot; Mayor O@@ la@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD landing stage , lost his Nim@@ bus , because he sat in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie , while his city burned . &quot;
&quot; and because in the crisis of crisis communication , it was pretty much wrong then what you can do wrong . &quot;
&quot; since then , Schol@@ z fights for political survival . &quot;
now even Stephan Wei@@ l .
&quot; because of the VW car@@ bure@@ au and his role in the Super@@ visory Board , the Nieder@@ s@@ äch@@ sische Prime Minister has already been in criticism for a long time . &quot;
mi@@ ese re@@ frac@@ tional levels were added .
&quot; nevertheless , or perhaps just trying to put Wei@@ l in the past weeks to put stronger in the covenant . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the former mayor of Hanover , his power in Berlin , also remained un@@ hidden in the surroundings of Martin Schulz . &quot;
they let him grant him because they promised a stabili@@ zation of the party from Wei@@ l .
&quot; now , the exact opposite could enter . &quot;
&quot; in this case , Wei@@ l meets the cross @-@ party degree , is basically no fault . &quot;
and Schulz is not at all .
&quot; therefore , the comrades endeavour to keep their own ranks closed . &quot;
&quot; your wrath is based on the Gre@@ ens , and here in particular on the deportation of the female parliament@@ arians . &quot;
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic , like Ms. T@@ jack@@ ets their own car@@ eers on the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , Chief of the Party of the SPD German Bundestag , the editorial network Germany ( R@@ N@@ D ) . &quot;
&quot; Ms. T@@ jack@@ et is not elected because of her person as director , but on the country list of the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Gre@@ ens , so the tie @-@ Sax@@ on representative will continue . &quot;
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
&quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , Chief of the SPD @-@ Bundestag , lam@@ ents a &quot; non @-@ democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; the vote of four years ago was clear : the people have made Stephan Wei@@ l to the Prime Minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leading the Lower Saxony as a leading @-@ candidate in the German Bundestag , the R@@ N@@ D . &quot;
&quot; now the personal career release of a future CD@@ U members called the W@@ ah@@ ler &apos;s result , &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot;
he requested to leave the backgrounds .
I want to know whether there has been more or more commitments to the CD@@ U Nieder@@ sachsen .
funding for the Resi@@ stance III
&quot; who would like to get home in the years , can soon get support from the country . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representative of St@@ eg Stadt@@ development on Wednesday in delicate . &quot;
at the beginning of the information event Sch@@ in@@ dler were once again a look@@ back to the so far failed .
since 1991 it has been in sensitive san@@ itation .
&quot; at that time , in the refurb@@ ishment area I from 1991 to 2004 , the land of Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding sum . &quot;
in the refurb@@ ishment II from 2005 to 2016 the allowance was still at 60 percent .
&quot; for Sch@@ in@@ dler , the recent renov@@ ations are a &quot; &quot; success project &quot; &quot; - it is finally important to promote the inner development , and not only new buildings . &quot;
&quot; on April 4 , you will receive the information of the Council of Ministers on 4 April that there will be a refurb@@ ishment III . &quot;
&quot; the funding amount 833 333 Euro , of which there are 500 000 Euros from the country , the rest of the community . &quot;
how does a san@@ atorium now arises ?
&quot; one will continue , examine so s@@ ect , examine where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are . &quot;
&quot; but there is also a role , whether in the planned area at all interest to get rolling . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , the territory can then move again . &quot;
&quot; the St@@ eg contracts on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel . &quot;
&quot; cellar presented the contents of the Bund of the federal states of the &quot; Social Democratic Republic , &quot; as part of the renov@@ ations would then be carried out . &quot;
&quot; core of the programme are the re@@ vit@@ alization of interior cities , improving living and working conditions and preservation and expansion of infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; the measures would be obj@@ ected , which is called per plot . &quot;
the san@@ itation @-@ area would finally be defined as Stat@@ utes .
the trial period for the funding has been running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026 .
&quot; even until September of this year , however , would only once again be carried out the inventory , as part of those who participate in the refurb@@ ishment areas involved a questionnaire to fill out . &quot;
&quot; in November or December , the pro@@ posi@@ tional process should take place in the coming year with the refurb@@ ishment . &quot;
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann explained that every Comm@@ une should carry out the said prior @-@ investigations .
&quot; it is to assess and decide the city of urban ab@@ norm@@ alities , and to decide when re@@ produced and to what extent . &quot;
for the respective property there will be a san@@ atorium also registered in the ground@@ ing book .
&quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again once again , and make a picture of the situation they spoke . &quot;
&quot; Got@@ zel stressed , an essential success factor for the project was the participation of the participants . &quot;
&quot; therefore , there will be questionn@@ aires that will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and will be filled out until the end of the summer holidays . &quot;
&quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; building &quot; building and land @-@ bow &quot; , &quot; in which it is among other things about construc@@ tional state and san@@ itation views . &quot;
&quot; in the gray questionnaire , the &quot; household and housing &quot; , &quot; data can be made on size , division and residents of a living space . &quot;
&quot; the blue &quot; &quot; OS@@ bogen &quot; &quot; can only be trac@@ ed when in building business areas are operated . &quot;
&quot; however , in mind , Got@@ zel pointed out that a distinctive questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , new construction measures are not eligible . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ in@@ dler empha@@ sized that the distribution of funding after the &quot; &quot; Wind@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; &quot; - who first comes first . &quot;
there is no funding for later &quot; reserve &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in conclusion , some photographs of the project &quot; &quot; Locations II &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a refurb@@ ishment &quot; tasty . &quot; &quot;
bri@@ tish invent@@ or sets itself a micro@@ chip to come with a handful of movement in house and car
&quot; a bri@@ tish invent@@ or is the first in the country that is equipped with a micro@@ chip , so that he will open his door@@ step to enter his office and even start his car . &quot;
&quot; Steven North@@ am , 33 , had impl@@ anted the tiny chip between thum@@ bs and foref@@ inger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q . &quot;
&quot; he has engaged with Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , a Consult@@ ant an@@ es@@ thesi@@ sts in the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , combined to ensure that the impl@@ ant method is performed according to medical standards . &quot;
the technology resem@@ bles a cats and dogs impl@@ anted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
&quot; the company of Mr. North@@ am also wants to change the castles of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for an additional charge of £ 300 per lock . &quot;
&quot; the married father of one has now built both at home and his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel . &quot;
the Advertising cost of the White House cost tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands
&quot; the decision of the White House , a nav@@ el helic@@ opter to the South La@@ wn for an event that highlights the American production in the last month , tax@@ pay@@ ers were left to the T@@ IME magazine up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , the heart of the event on 17 July in the White House with American construction programs . &quot;
President Donald Tru@@ mp , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and Chief officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states . &quot;
&quot; the helic@@ opter @-@ helic@@ opter was placed next to a yacht from Maine , a galvan@@ ic car from Wis@@ cons@@ in and a for@@ kli@@ ft from Mississippi . &quot;
&quot; the Military office of the White House required the presence of the helic@@ opter in a frag@@ mentary order or F@@ RA@@ GO , barely 36 hours before the helic@@ opter in the South La@@ wn landed by the records of Marine Hel@@ ic@@ opter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , which is responsible for the operation of the helic@@ opter . &quot;
&quot; I just wanted to know that you are aware of this because it is an un@@ common event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the com@@ mander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event of his superi@@ ors , the dep@@ uty Nav@@ ajo for aviation . &quot;
&quot; the message showed that the helic@@ opter arrived on 17 July at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning at the South La@@ wn for the event by 15 o &apos;clock , and so long stayed until the lawn between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 p.m. at this evening was vac@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; the note add that if the departure should be del@@ ayed from the White House , due to the restriction of the hours a second team would be needed for the return flight . &quot;
the original trip was found during the event at the helic@@ opter while the security of unity during the period passed on the ground by plane .
&quot; from the records provided by the T@@ IME , it was not clear whether a second flight event was required . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ atch Act has agreed , state of state property for political purposes . &quot;
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event could hurt the determination .
&quot; a question that we asked , was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Act and we were informed about it that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the command . &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you are locked , answering the dep@@ uty command@@ ant . &quot;
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was referred to by the White House as official event and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act .
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
&quot; at the event , the president gave a impetus for reform of health reform , which was underway in the Senate , and prop@@ ag@@ ated efforts to cont@@ ain@@ ment of government regulations . &quot;
&quot; the use of the aircraft , which is known as Marine One or Air Force One , for politically favorable purposes is hardly any new phenomenon . &quot;
Presidents are obliged to use them for the journey .
but their use only for a photo @-@ OP is unusual .
&quot; Tru@@ mp led an investigation into the background of his first campaign aircraft in Melbourne , Florida , Tax@@ i@@ Services , and his Twitter account is full of announ@@ cements based on its predecessor by its predecessor . &quot;
&quot; the White House is enthusiastic about the show &quot; Made In America &quot; - the products from all 50 states , which are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the Deputy Minister of the White House , Lin@@ d@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; h@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws often lead training courses in the area around Washington and in South La@@ wn by the US President in the White House with precise cen@@ timeters . &quot;
&quot; as a Tru@@ mp at the beginning of July at the G@@ 20 Summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 in the White House 58 land@@ lords were conducted . &quot;
&quot; the flight to the &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event was given in the training needs of the aircraft for the month , said a official . &quot;
helic@@ opter units additionally flew 11 hours to this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support . &quot;
&quot; the White House said that the tax@@ pay@@ ers have been the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps , which were presented at the event . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ man of Si@@ kor@@ sky said , the company was not involved in providing the helic@@ opter to the South La@@ wn . &quot;
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 has no budget design@@ ations for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event . &quot;
&quot; according to St@@ und@@ ent@@ ari@@ fen of the Ministry of Defence for the fiscal year 2017 , the DO@@ D @-@ refund for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per flight @-@ hour . &quot;
records of the unit show the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of Marine Cor@@ ps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House argu@@ ed that the actual cost of operating the helic@@ opter is far below this rate .
&quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers on the basis of estimates for issu@@ ing turnover is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; these estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs which are included in the annual funding . &quot;
&quot; according to a R@@ AND study from 2015 , the refund of DO@@ D do not contain the personnel expenses , but take into account the cost of fuel , maintenance and contractual . &quot;
&quot; at this time , the former Pres@@ ses@@ pre@@ cher of the White House , Sean Sp@@ ic@@ er , the use of the helic@@ opter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present this week things that are produced in America , &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot;
&quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the Federal State Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not even thousands of people depend on it . &quot;
&quot; and I think like most Americans , we are all proud of the helic@@ opter and other military equipment , for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ ent@@ lessly . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is appropriate to highlight this . &quot;
&quot; it was not clear whether Tru@@ mp with the helic@@ opter inter@@ viewed , when he entered his tour over the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the seat of a fire@@ places . &quot;
in the White House Tru@@ mp were talking to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and jo@@ king with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; said the President , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;

&quot; in his H@@ ast , the law issued &apos; , the Congress adopted a few &quot; constitutional provisions &quot; in the law . &quot;
&quot; also the response from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels fo@@ amed against the U.S. advancement . &quot;
&quot; after all , the draft will be able to pun@@ ish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pel@@ ines into the EU . &quot;

the Dro@@ h@@ kul@@ isse is vast .
&quot; nevertheless , it is too early for an estim@@ ation of the consequences , thus the official statement of the oil concept . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Donald Tru@@ mp would have to aw@@ aken sanctions even by Executive Order . &quot;

roll back@@ wards : the city presents 46 kitchen
the city organiz@@ es the K@@ ita @-@ lunch table again .
with strong contact partners for the children and a assignment to the team .
in the urban child care centre the clock is revers@@ ed .
&quot; on September 1 , the city of Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply in the urban child care facilities ( Kit@@ as ) again in his reg@@ reg@@ y . &quot;
&quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ ance , acting director in the field of youth aid , this is good news : &quot; we all very pleased . &quot;
cooked will continue to be out of house : a Cat@@ erer takes over this task and delivers fresh@@ ly cooked .
&quot; the town operates in the Kre@@ felder area 46 Kinder@@ t@@ ages@@ , in 44 get the children at mid@@ day a warm meal . &quot;
&quot; in the past Kit@@ a@@ year , 28@@ 00 children at the tables , and the need is growing steadily . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile eat not only children , the 45 week@@ days will be taken care of , in the K@@ ita , &quot; &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; the offer also applies in the 35 @-@ hour care , if children are up to 14 o &apos;clock . &quot;
&quot; 46 particip@@ ations have from 1st September kitchen service : they warm up the angel@@ ists , supplement it to salad , Roh@@ k@@ ost and fruit , por@@ tioned the meal individually , give the food off , rin@@ se , and clean the kitchen . &quot;
&quot; the employees are firmly assigned to a c@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
the size - there are two @-@ group@@ ed facilities - decides on the circum@@ ference .
&quot; the kitchen help now belong to the K@@ ita team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; thus , they are much more involved and it is easier to implement the ep@@ tual , educational concepts . &quot;
for this reason we are : healthy eating and cooking lessons .
children should help to prepare the food .
the direct connection of the kitchen force in the team is there useful .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a known force in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar to them , and not ever @-@ changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
&quot; the inf@@ estation of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - so far also the task of the kitchenette , will be carried out in the future of special cleaning personnel . &quot;
&quot; this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has in addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen performance also the charm that it turned out in comparison between self @-@ reg@@ ression and foreign for the city as the economical , it is called the press office . &quot;
and this even though 46 part @-@ time forces will be rein@@ forces .
&quot; but these hours fall for approximately 750 people in the yield area of all not so strongly into weight , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ ance . &quot;

G@@ MB concerns over investments in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie @-@ Fabrik in Glasgow
a trade union would like to make a union with managers of the Bis@@ c@@ ite manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie on the long @-@ term commitment to production in their work in Glasgow .
G@@ MB Scotland said that the company has spoken about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross site .
&quot; more than 500 employees work in the work , which is adjacent to other products Hob@@ no@@ bs and Rich Tea Kek@@ se . &quot;
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pl@@ adi@@ s said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
&quot; he added that people and trade union representatives were &quot; &quot; first &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the branch of the company requested G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s to speak &quot; concerns , &quot; concerns for the modernisation of production lines do not be prop@@ elled . &quot;
&quot; G@@ MB @-@ Senior Organiz@@ er Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; &quot; the fact that we can win no clarity about the needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , our members are deeply concerned . &quot;
&quot; generations of families have worked here and the workers concentrate strongly on the local community and the Greater Glasgow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , among the perspective of jobs , wage and prosperity , and against the background of Bre@@ xit , the increasing life of life and of the chronic production process , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently need a fl@@ ori@@ ant production of Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ person of Pl@@ adi@@ s said : &quot; &quot; the branch at T@@ oll@@ cross has only received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland only yesterday , and the company will react directly to the company &apos;s continued commitment to employees and trade union representatives . &quot;
&quot; we had a regular meetings with employees and G@@ MB representatives from T@@ oll@@ cross , which were openly discussed during which some questions were openly discussed . &quot;
&quot; we deb@@ ated with the employees that we are active in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , our business is continuously checking and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; &quot; in recent years we invested more than 5 million pounds , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot;
&quot; we recognize the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production centre full of interest . should our operational processes change at the location , the employees and their trade union will be the first to experience this . &quot;
does the PS@@ G Barcelona has war@@ ned three years ago N@@ ey@@ mar ?
the site of La Liga likes your interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti .
&quot; Saint Saint @-@ Germain won &apos;t leave N@@ ey@@ mar in their persecution of N@@ ey@@ mar , since they released an offer of £ 189 million to cut its freedom @-@ duty cycle , but did they war@@ ned Barcelona three years prior to the world premiere ? &quot;
&quot; the sens@@ ational approach has raised the transfer window in summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 @-@ Klu@@ b is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba in the past season for 89 million pounds to Manchester United . &quot;
&quot; after the end , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive players in the world and for the highest paid professional ath@@ l@@ ete of the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is fur@@ ious over the way that N@@ ey@@ mar has forced its way to outside , although a source close by the Catalan state that the club has always given his best to care for his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 . &quot;
&quot; however , the soccer world was war@@ ned three years ago by the PS@@ G president in front of this view ? &quot;
&quot; as Manchester City 2014 interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for any association who wanted to sign one of the best players by PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; I am not worried because they know if they touch one of our players , then we will contact opposition to them , we will contact her players , &quot; says Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all the clubs .
&quot; but if they try to sign one of our players in sign , this will have consequences . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish society at the beginning of this summer interest in the PS@@ G @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti . &quot;
&quot; PS@@ G made clear that it would not allow it to the International from Italy , under any circumstances , and Barcelona could sense the consequences of this interest by having one of their prize offers for N@@ ey@@ mar . &quot;
sco@@ oters and damaged
&quot; during the night of Friday on Saturday , an unknown perpet@@ rators brought up in the König@@ s@@ felder street before the estate number 30 stored sco@@ oters and thus directed at the wear of the tractor for over 200 euros . &quot;
&quot; the Police Sch@@ ram@@ berg , telephone 07@@ 422 / 27 01 @-@ 0 , asks for references . &quot;
to an accident at the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese is looking for the police witnesses .
&quot; because he sent him a car on his track balance , the driver had to do@@ dge the driver of a VW Tour@@ an and tou@@ chi@@ pped the leadership . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday evening , the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ L@@ occ@@ um reached his VW against 19.@@ 55 at the B 215 in Stol@@ zen@@ au coming towards Le@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the centre of Stol@@ zen@@ au , it came to him a car on his track , so that he had to do@@ dge the right . &quot;
thereby tou@@ chi@@ pped the tour @-@ driver the leadership @-@ plann@@ er .
on the car was supposed to harm the fact .
&quot; the driver of the opposite truck , a Mercedes Benz , had a truck over@@ hau@@ led and continued his ride without taking care of the traffic accident . &quot;
&quot; according to the in@@ genu@@ ity , the mer@@ ced@@ ars had not noticed the accident at all . &quot;
&quot; the police have now ask witnesses of the anticip@@ ation , as well as the driver of the tut@@ ors , under Tel . 0@@ 57@@ 61 / 9@@ 2060 with the Commissioner in Stol@@ zen@@ au in conjunction with the Commissioner . &quot;
interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ report dischar@@ ged Pope Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ report on the abuse of any Pope &apos;s Pope Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this means author and histori@@ an Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the ab@@ omin@@ ator sc@@ andal with the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen ensures continued on discussions .
&quot; Christian Wei@@ der , spokes@@ man of the reform movement &quot; We are Church &quot; , &quot; explained by the previous Reg@@ ens@@ burger Bishop and today Kar@@ d@@ inal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year &apos;s brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , an excuse . &quot;
&quot; it would serve the prestige of the Catholic Church , when Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would greatly express their own sub@@ om@@ is@@ sions or their then false assessment of processes . &quot;
&quot; the Vatican &quot; Os@@ serv@@ atore Rom@@ ano , &quot; on the other hand cri@@ tici@@ zed that in reporting on violence in the domain are measured with &quot; &quot; two measurements &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with regard to the gri@@ ps in Regensburg , no one knew that it would be pun@@ ished and sham@@ eful deeds , but the &quot; degree of medi@@ al mani@@ p@@ ulation , &quot; thus the author of medi@@ etta Scar@@ af@@ fia , histori@@ ography in and member of the national Italian Bio@@ ethics committee . &quot;
&quot; the habit to call the Catholic Church as a source of all evil , is already part of the everyday experience and prepar@@ es public opinion which is normal to hold for normal , writes Scar@@ af@@ fia . &quot;
&quot; also Für@@ s Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Tax@@ is said in the interview with the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk , &quot; &quot; you would like to go on the church and this is a set of fres@@ co@@ es . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it pointed out that in her youth &quot; beats a quite normal ped@@ agog@@ ical means &quot; &quot; to be with fre@@ ed children , as I was one was finished . &quot;
they are unfair to apply today &apos;s standards to past decades because the world has changed .
in connection with reports of the abuse of waste often also pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
&quot; totally wrong , means author and histori@@ an Michael Hes@@ emann , who translated with R@@ atz@@ inger &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; ( translated in 12 languages ) . &quot;
&quot; I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; says Ez@@ emann , &quot; for all that had nothing to do with him , &quot; he adds the results of the final report . &quot;
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ sided report that was presented by the B@@ ist@@ um Regensburg with the En@@ light@@ enment ? Ulrich Weber presented ?
&quot; a total of 547 Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were killed between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s &quot; with high pl@@ ast@@ sibility &quot; victims of over@@ print , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen sexually ab@@ used . &quot;
&quot; in the final report , it is said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who was active from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg : &quot; summary , so that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases of physical and mental violence have been applied . &quot;
&quot; especially with high Emoti@@ onal ality , the punishment of the students could also be fier@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , unlike numerous other signs , many victims suffered the general humanity of R. and therefore combine positive memories with him in many cases despite violence . &quot;
&quot; in the interview , Hes@@ emann , why the final report on the abuse of the dispute was reported at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger of his opinion . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ Pages report on the &quot; inci@@ dents of non@@ violence against the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; indicates a contradic@@ tory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
to a raise a lot of pupils his &quot; humanity . &quot;
&quot; for the other , he also appears as a chol@@ eri@@ ker and perf@@ ection@@ ist , which was tangible , if a Dom@@ sp@@ atz musi@@ cally brought no top performance . &quot;
how do you evaluate as his bio@@ grapher this final report ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : when one takes the effort and read all the 440 pages long report from the front to the back , one has to ask quite a question why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger occurs at all in it . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , eight pages are devoted to him and he is clearly talked about every suspic@@ ion of the medi@@ ator or fellow blood in the terrible cases sexual abuse . &quot;
also the non @-@ violence at the pre @-@ school un@@ covered itself outside of its effectiveness .
&quot; it is possible to pre @-@ cast it , too late or first we have not taken seriously enough . &quot;
&quot; the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ing school , on which he real , was perceived by practically all respon@@ dents than - so literally - &quot; rede@@ mption &quot; , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger presents a very excellent record , describes it as &quot; warm @-@ heart@@ ed &quot; , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; knowledgeable , &quot; &quot; knowledgeable , &quot; &quot; knowledgeable , &quot; &quot; compet@@ ently , and &quot; &quot; comprehen@@ sible &quot; , &quot; as extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teachers who run the guys regularly with cakes , bis@@ cu@@ its and bon@@ b@@ ons , and &quot; always covered by grapes of children . &quot;
only a minority compl@@ ained about his perf@@ ection@@ ism and its high Emoti@@ on@@ ality that led even to W@@ ut@@ aus@@ ages .
&quot; he thre@@ w not only with chairs and bo@@ iled down on the ground , but also ear@@ rings distributed and too fre@@ ed guys to the hair or ears , he has given himself very regre@@ t@@ ted for years and exc@@ used for it exc@@ used . &quot;
&quot; however , to its honesty , however , must be said that such educ@@ ators in the question@@ able time , the 1960s and the 1970s were widespread , with parents like with teachers . &quot;
do you still know such breeding methods ?
&quot; of course , I think everyone of us , who was born before 1968 . &quot;
&quot; I also experienced this in a world @-@ mund@@ ane school , an state @-@ Gymnasium . &quot;
&quot; compared to what it is actually going on in this report , namely the irre@@ plac@@ eable sexual abuse and non @-@ violence in the pre @-@ school , are the free Bag@@ at@@ elles . &quot;
&quot; if you ask yourself whether it is not more familiar with his famili@@ arity and his role as the brother of Benedi@@ kt X@@ VI@@ A , that many media has just returned to him . &quot;
&quot; at the Bav@@ arian e , many who never understood him , still ei@@ ving . &quot;
the truth is : the report de@@ bur@@ dened Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
&quot; in connection with the report , the report was reported a lot about the subject of abuse at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the final report also laid any revers@@ al or ro@@ ast in terms of sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : quite clearly no .
no one of the 67 victims of sexual gri@@ ps claimed to become familiar to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were consec@@ rated .
&quot; I have never dre@@ amed of speaking with my father or my mother , &quot; &quot; said a subject of sufferers for the others , &quot; It was all very embarrassing . &quot;
the real problem with clarification of sexual abuse was and yet is that most of the victims are silent .
&quot; if they didn &apos;t even talk to parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then definitely not a ch@@ oral leader who would have been a colleague of perpet@@ rators of perpet@@ rators . &quot;
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Students R@@ atz@@ ing@@ ers role in terms of abuse of abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a respon@@ dent student form@@ ulating it so : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I do not see ... any case in which he could have had been timely findings and have been able to stop the respective perpet@@ rators .
&quot; I consider it ... also for really absurd to accept that the tru@@ ders of him ... Bub@@ bles inv@@ oked or clear@@ er or even sooner than to their parents , boarding , Trust , etc . &quot;
that one speaks with him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; thus the report comes to a very clear result : &quot; that in advance , the students affected by the students and / or their environment , could not be confirmed under investigation . &quot;
&quot; what sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus acqu@@ itted of any compassion . &quot;
&quot; thus it can not be cast , him will not prevent him or be brought to the ad . &quot;
&quot; therefore there is no reason to bring his good name to these contradic@@ ting crimes , as unfortunately it happened in some cases . &quot;
&quot; in the media was much of &quot; &quot; non@@ violence &quot; &quot; to read the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
the previous cathedral @-@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger will be cast away in the report .
must he live with this accus@@ ation ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the big problem that in reporting everything is mixed and t@@ opped up to a huge mil@@ king of sexual abuse and non @-@ violence and somewhere , in the midst of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
but this is precisely the mis@@ use of the report .
&quot; namely , it is clean separately : between the pre @-@ school and the gram@@ mar school , between sexual abuse and non @-@ violence , as well as we say once , other pre@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the report is covered from time since 1945 , so also from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not choir conductors of the cathedral @-@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; the whole horrible test of ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases where l@@ ad of s@@ adi@@ sti@@ cal teachers were regul@@ ated and mal@@ ign@@ ited , un@@ event@@ ful occurred at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ hofen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous states have to have . &quot;
&quot; but with whom the kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , for he got the boys first to face , when they were already on the domain name . &quot;
&quot; on what was , how most witnesses emphas@@ ise the topic &quot; pre @-@ school &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; one was just happy to escape it , and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; heavenly . &quot; &quot;
what was different in the domain name ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : there is already discipline , but just no s@@ adi@@ sti@@ cal violence . &quot;
&quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report comes to the conclusion that &quot; many victims of humanity &apos;s general humanity and therefore combine positive memories with him in many cases despite violence . &quot;
&quot; thus , at the most still the accus@@ ation , have to have taken away . &quot;
&quot; however , despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre @-@ school . &quot;
&quot; the first time 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish himself and managed by the events at a school where he was not real and responsible , ( so the witness ) nothing wanted to hear , and then again in 1993 . &quot;
index@@ ing Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in front of the states consistently the ears ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ en@@ ei , which the report was even re@@ produced . &quot;
&quot; in this , he points out that the exam@@ ines will continue to be practiced in the pre @-@ school . &quot;
&quot; even in the face of the danger of negative press , he often recommended . &quot;
&quot; of course , that was of course at a time when the legal clarity was existed as a test , was also banned in Bavaria too . &quot;
&quot; before that , they were born in a legal gray area , as each one of us still knows . &quot;
&quot; there was difficult to estimate for him , where those affected might be exagger@@ ated or dramatic , and where really the per@@ missible border had been crossed . &quot;
&quot; but one cannot say , he would have always been s@@ wollen . &quot;
this is simply not true .
&quot; only in 1980 , the audit@@ ory was officially launched in Bavaria too . &quot;
&quot; prin@@ cess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Tax@@ is said yes , it is unfair , to apply today &apos;s ped@@ agog@@ ical standards to the dam@@ aging time . &quot;
how do you see that ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we are talking about the &quot; Fall@@ stri@@ ck of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; , &quot; thus the danger , and present the moral standards of today &apos;s moral standards . &quot;
and the prin@@ cess has been quite right now .
&quot; of course , this does not apply to sexual abuse , who was ab@@ omin@@ able at all times and not for what happens in the primary school of resistance and violence in inno@@ cent child labour , that goes far beyond that time . &quot;
&quot; that is all very terrible , and I am glad that it will finally work hard . &quot;
&quot; but at the same time , I have to take on the protection of George R@@ atz@@ inger , for all that had nothing to do with him . &quot;
&quot; his means of discipl@@ ining and punishment , so ear @-@ che@@ ers and ears to the hair and ears were widely used in the 1970s . &quot;
&quot; when physical punishment was then banned , he also held out strictly to it . &quot;
&quot; what image of his Reg@@ ens@@ burger period has Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because in discussions with you for the book &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; ? &quot;
did the topic of review also came to language ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , the Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , tells us from his perspective , there the cathedral also played a secondary role . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , I was by no means that he led there a stric@@ ter reg@@ iment . &quot;
&quot; but even this must be said once again : without this perf@@ ection@@ ism , without the request un@@ conditioned discipline , it would be hardly possible to form the institution of world @-@ known Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen an institution of puppy Europe and his musical tradition , which went straight twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with bis@@ cu@@ its and Bon@@ b@@ ons alone , one makes no major singer and no success on what territory , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming . &quot;
&quot; then , what kind of people have you experienced in the talks about their book ? &quot;
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : by working on the book and in addition , I met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really well and again experienced as wonderful , hum@@ orous , land@@ fitting , deep believing and sav@@ ory good people from which one could not imagine that he could also just do a fly . &quot;
&quot; I perio@@ dic@@ apped regularly with how many former domains are still alive today , 23 years after his embar@@ king , regularly contact him - he is almost blind -- and treat him as a member of her family . &quot;
&quot; those who do not forgive him to this day , that he was once strict to them , so are clearly in the minority . &quot;
most domains are today grateful for him that he enriched her life and has delivered them the world of music .
&quot; and that he is always a good , v@@ ä@@ ter@@ ous teachers - a str@@ ingent father , certainly , that may be - but still a lovely respect of respect was to who she still looking up and that she is straight away . &quot;
&quot; and please once again clearly : everything that one casts it , are educ@@ ator , which were then on the order of the day . &quot;
we can be glad we have overcome this time .
&quot; but it is most odd , a man , only because it is promin@@ ently and has an even prominent brother to make a medi@@ al s@@ ap@@ ego@@ ats . &quot;
&quot; there is the evil intention , which is behind it , only too obvious . &quot;
&quot; for the report , which was just released , dischar@@ ged him . &quot;
&quot; now , the arri@@ vals was born , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has acquired great services and probably still know the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen ( Germany ) , finally to leave peace in peace . &quot;
