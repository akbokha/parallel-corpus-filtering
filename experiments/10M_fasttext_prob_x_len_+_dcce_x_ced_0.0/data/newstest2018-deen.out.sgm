<seg id="5">The oldest official card coin promotes exciting stories to days.</seg>
<seg id="6">"it is annoying, if maps are not up to date."</seg>
<seg id="7">"that knows everyone who had to go up, because the Auto-Navi took place instead of a reversal road a green meadow."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the historical maps of the digital Bayern es Atlases, an offer of geoportals in Bavaria, is anything but current - but therefore very enlightening."</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when you compare them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear as the towns and communities in the spread-area of the Münchner Merkur has changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria-Atlas is a splayment that you cannot realize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the great review map were performed for cities and municipalities in more detail maps, so-called Urpositional sheets."</seg>
<seg id="13">These were created according to the state of Bayerischer administration between 1810 and 1864 and jump to the first Vermessung.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leaders occupied Bavaria since the spring 1800 during the Second coalition of War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wished an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographic recording of Bayers in order - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">"even if the French troops have moved to the peace of Lunéville from 9 February 1801, it was today's neighbours who created the idea of an area covering Bavaria card."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph drove the project ahead, founded the" topographic Bureau "- and thus the Bayerische Council administration."</seg>
<seg id="19">The Urposia sheet for Munich is from the year 1856 and is like all other on the website of the Bayerischer Landesbibliothek.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of fruits / Today is at the example of the provincial capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">"an example of this is subsendling, that appears in the map of 1856 still relatively isolated."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Sendling was announced 21 years after the map, so 1877, as Münchner district."</seg>
<seg id="24">"today, the shelter of the city is located in the middle of the city."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the houses of Untersendling focus on 1856 along today's Plinganserstraße, which was only named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the Bavarian farmer against Austria 1705."</seg>
<seg id="26">"where today the West park is, you can't see anything but fields - at first glance: the Hindoomen appears a small disadvantaged card with dozens lines and numbers: handmade flurpieces from the so-called" "urine" "from which the property tax was derived."</seg>
<seg id="27">Small plots do not occupy farmers today more - but small-gardener of the plant "Land in Sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is characterized north of the subsendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">"the Theresienwiese, since 1810 was born in the October 19th century, was in the 19th century a meadow - and no concrete form."</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine."</seg>
<seg id="31">"in the Urpositional sheet, one read in the area of today's Au-Haidhausen not only the road name" at Gasteig "or from the hill" On the ventilation "" - but also in large letters "" Irren Anstalt "." "</seg>
<seg id="32">"yes, here at the Auerfeldstrasse to embove people with insanity."</seg>
<seg id="33">There was 1858 / 59 the Münchner District series "On the Auer Lüch."</seg>
<seg id="34">"from 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudges the institution - that psychiatrist, which is associated with the death of King Ludwigs."</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was progressive for his time, and ended for example the Ankkins of the so-called Irren."</seg>
<seg id="36">"he is also prohibited to use the personnel to apply violence against inmates," says Hermann Wilhelm, Head of the Museum of Haidhausen, who has worked for an exhibition with the Anstalt. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"for 280 patients had been first place, later was extended to 500 places."</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point this capacity also no longer exist - the reason for the construction of the chalk penitary in hair 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">"there has been the Isar-Amper-Klingenum Munich-East, one of the largest psychiatrices in Germany."</seg>
<seg id="40">On the field of former Auer Anstalt we meet young people in Münchner Salesianum.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order warb the building complex 1920 and turned him into a teenager with training.</seg>
<seg id="42">"west is the football ground of the TSV in East, eastern residential buildings of the 1980s."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in 2015 we prepared the children's house" "Casa Don Bosco" "- an architectural approach to the origin of the renaica, which was destroyed during World War II during the Second World War."</seg>
<seg id="44">"the Marienplatz was at 1856 as" "main square", "the department was called" "Kaufinger alley." ""</seg>
<seg id="45">A decisive change brought to the Second World War even in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The Bombs of Allies in December 1944 many holes in the city center.</seg>
<seg id="47">A great stayed until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">"the English Institute, small business buildings and a Gruftkapelle from the Middle Ages were once at the Marienhof, where these days were the pros and the 5th April 2017 of the area for the second S-Bahn track."</seg>
<seg id="49">"with the slider, the old Munich map can be compared to the aerial photograph of today - and the hole in the Marienhof."</seg>
<seg id="50">Citizenship group released travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association to promote colored people has issued a warning for colored people who travel to Missouri on the basis of discriminatory policy and racist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory is to enter into force by the state of Missouri, which will bring special attention to 28 August 2017, as a number of fragmentary, racial-based incident occurring recently in the entire state and here, it is said in the position of the group."</seg>
<seg id="53">"a recent resigned law of Missouri, which makes it difficult to gain discrimination, as well as the criminal authorities of the state, disproportionately the group to reveal the journey, the NAACP."</seg>
<seg id="54">They have violations of citizens' rights that happen men.</seg>
<seg id="55">"they are halted because of their skin colour, they are beaten or killed," said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star. "</seg>
<seg id="56">"we hear complaints in such an incidence, which we have not heard yet."</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the US.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the group zipped incidents such as racist decay against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">"in fragile circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no more petrol during the journey through the state and was taken into custody by the police of Missouri, without a crime."</seg>
<seg id="60">"the Council also points to a recent report by Missouri's office, which is shown that black drivers are raised in the state 75 percent more often than pasture."</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel. "</seg>
<seg id="62">People must be ready to bring to whether there are Kauds or to let the relatives know that they travel through the state.</seg>
<seg id="63">"Missouri recorded 100 Hassenings in 2015, according to the latest figures from the Hassan-reference programme of the FBI, which marks the state in relation to the number of such violations in the 16th place of the country."</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri Law which would make it more difficult to complain a company because of housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">"previously, the American Civil Liberties Union had published the American Civil Liberties Union (ACES) voyages for Texas and Arizona, following the states of immigration laws which are committed to suspending people because of immigration violations, which is contributing to the ACLU to further segregation."</seg>
<seg id="66">"voyages are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but in recent times, stakeholders have used the measure as a reaction to certain laws and trends within the United States."</seg>
<seg id="67">Decaunching project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fisheracher Weiler's project is a success project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Paragorderly Peter White and Kordula Kovac have created a picture on site.</seg>
<seg id="70">On the right-mount of the family Schwendemann met representatives of the Fisheracher CDU-town together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members.</seg>
<seg id="71">"Markus Schwendemann for first insights into its operation, in which he managed 55 hectares meadows and 40 hectares of forest, supplies 40 milk-cows and as well as many young kittens."</seg>
<seg id="72">The "black-milk" is for him the alternative marketers for the milk of its cows, so Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="73">At the table of the holiday guests there will be a regional community.</seg>
<seg id="74">"as he is also the BLHV president of Fischerbach, he signed the Weieraunching project as" elementary important. ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I can not manage such steep areas for such steep areas.</seg>
<seg id="76">"the green space for much work, much mute will be processed with the engine sound."</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have here with the conditions and to fight with the topography," stressed Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="78">"in 2003, he adopted the elastic operation and managed to use this without chemical pesticides and fertilizers, even if there is no bio-operation."</seg>
<seg id="79">"for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear:" "the Commune has recognised the importance of the litter project and is pleased with the leader."</seg>
<seg id="80">"at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers had to be supported."</seg>
<seg id="81">I hope that the insurrection of the areas could be moved out even a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the greatest treasure we have, are the people working in agriculture and make thoughts on how they continue their operation," said the mayor. "</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often in criticism for the promotion</seg>
<seg id="84">"in 2013, a total of 25 plots were fenced in the year 2013."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the disclosure of this area is 40 hectares, which may not be raised up to at least 2023."</seg>
<seg id="86">"from the overall cost of 71 500 Euro, half of the leaders was funded, a quarter carried out the municipality of Fisherah."</seg>
<seg id="87">"therefore, we left the farmers 12 610 Euro, which they had to invest in 16,2 kilometres of course."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of fences," explained Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="89">"Kordula Kovac stressed:" "you do not make a really good job, without farmers and landing."</seg>
<seg id="90">Also for Peter White stood firm: "here the best food produced."</seg>
<seg id="91">Landscapes (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows the state promotion of pastors.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is the disclosure of the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">Prerequisites is the presence of one of the LPR signed.</seg>
<seg id="94">"in addition, the current area should not be septible (Hanging over 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by the insurrection."</seg>
<seg id="95">"for the fisherman's Weiler project 2018, there is currently the application of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build at almost 16 kilometers of fence."</seg>
<seg id="96">"the open-level area corresponds to 35 hectares, the cost-effective costs are at more than 112 000 Euros."</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime Transition is when they begin to attacking the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate this as much as any other - hence the careless overthrow of Saddam Hussone at the Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, knew certainly what he did when he took a symbolic dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN about the proposals of Presidents for the drastic restriction of legal migration with the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">"to stay fair, Miller not access the statue itself."</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat-owners and Liberty-importers would have noticed it when he did.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but he laid their significance in particular, and in particular the meaning that it was written, as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, its base was added."</seg>
<seg id="105">"when Miller imminated Acosta:" "I don't want to go here on a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that the world is illuminated."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the poem, which you relate to which later was added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is correct, but as he formed it, it is not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about contemporary resonance on the record words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state does not only invites any old immigrants, but the anger of the poor:" thy fatigue, your arms, / thy drunk masses, which then longing, free to breathe, / the elending waste of your rich coasts. "</seg>
<seg id="109">"there was never a time when the" "king waste" "was better to see on our screen."</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller engaged in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural examination: it is indeed a conflict in the significance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and their friends who continued to place their words after their death at the base - did very good that they did a highly-political act.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American Republicanism by demonstrating in an unused classical image of the female embodiment of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in their poem the female figure is no longer abstract - it has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a completely different name: mother of exiled.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people wanted to move from the right wing for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the great cry of Rush Limbaugh, a kind of Johannes of the deception for the coming of Trump, argued that the Statue of Liberty is no one, but rather an early neoconservatives that bring the American flame into the reverse world:" Lady Liberty goes forward. "</seg>
<seg id="119">It is supposed to carry the flow of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">Fackel is not supposed to shine with the way into the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Rather unusual is Limbaugh here on something stolen.</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is quite and even a question of the point of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great imaginative act of Lazarus consisted in it to see how they were seen from the depluck, but hopeful people after long and often terrible trips have been seen on the decks of ships."</seg>
<seg id="124">"it is in the truest sense of seeing the world from the perspective of people, finding the refuge and a chance to improve their lives."</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue talks to them the words of hope and the welcome they must listen.</seg>
<seg id="126">And of course this is not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to recognize.</seg>
<seg id="127">"her Fackel is not supposed to shine with the way, but the hatred, which is the only source of power, ignite."</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championships 2017: Neil Black loys Scottish members of the team of Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="129">Eiliie Doyle is reminiscent of a time when only two guns were belonging to the team of Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="130">"the performance director of the athletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-kicky contingent of the world championship team will make a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="131">"a record number of Scottish Athleten was selected for London 2017, which will start Friday."</seg>
<seg id="132">"Black believes that" "in Scotland has developed some special" "and the athletics of the UK has to learn something from it."</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it and we try to understand it, and we will proceed until we will find it out," said Black. "</seg>
<seg id="134">I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type at the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">"whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="139">"several of the Scottish Athleten are medals-candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - which were forced against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m distance, while Eiliie Doyle was elected from the crew to the team captain."</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eilidh is rather modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">"their captain's speech was incredible," says Black. "</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were shoottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">"the passion and the genuine feeling that Eiliie made quite naturally, were great."</seg>
<seg id="144">"the Commonwealth of Silver Medal, which is at its fifth world championship in the 400-m hurdles, says that it is" unbelievable, "that 16 villi are in the British team."</seg>
<seg id="145">"Scotland's largest total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015."</seg>
<seg id="146">The midstream muir leads on this way and has set up five British and two European records in the past year.</seg>
<seg id="147">"it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 metres."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, which runs 1,500 m is another shot, which one should be included after a great season that were included the victory at the British team trias and the Anniversary Games."</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle is reminiscent of her first world championship as the only other flaw in the team Lee McConnell was.</seg>
<seg id="150">"the Mannees captain in says that she is" huge proud "to the fact that many of their landmen are not only to the team, but in some cases even with the medals and in the finals."</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing to be a team captain is in it that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was anyway a great honour, but knowing that my team mates voted for me and chose to have something very special for me," she added. "</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously, I am very proud of all the rots who belong to the team."</seg>
<seg id="153">It shows only how far we got.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to rise to poedies."</seg>
<seg id="155">What my speech is concerned as capitulation?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think it went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">Just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">"so it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from it, that we are back at the Olympiastadion."</seg>
<seg id="159">"I get a second chance to go there and compete, and it will just be such a great atmosphere there outside."</seg>
<seg id="160">Blocking of critics about Facebook: add you not to a public post if you cannot bear the heimen of voters.</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our land knew something from bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">"the Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't last long until they smote him because of all, from inner policy up to its political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">He immined in criticism of criticism.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not put his critics in silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">"for in 1783, Washington said:" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute, we shall take the sheep to battles."</seg>
<seg id="166">"that brings me to Governor Larry Hogan who has to work on it, to be more like Washington."</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on its official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union promised him this week at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"the stab of the governors set the lawsuit as frivol, and the online comment was full of an intercom with" "Na, and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"it is only facebook," "said many people."</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important if it is a type like hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">"this is a republicans governor in a overwhelming democratic state, which is amazing."</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the final approval of the 50 Governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat-head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very sent to use Facebook as a primary remedy to connect to his voters and to strip his hairy head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">"therefore, the blockage of persons who come on the side of the Governors - which is a public forum, which is officially designated as officially and by employees working with public tax Dollars - needless and ultimately dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="179">"in an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans spokesman Amelia Chasse defended the actions of the Governors and argued that the blockage of the comments is nothing more than a moderation."</seg>
<seg id="180">"but it is too easy to use the image of trolles or spammers or hasserted people, which is online the whip."</seg>
<seg id="181">"the post office spoke to some of the real people, which were blocked by Hogan."</seg>
<seg id="182">"and these are only real people who speak with their chosen leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, no trolls."</seg>
<seg id="183">"they all said that their comments are respectful, thoughtfully and not profited."</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appalled to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">"lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hasserie filled, but she asked for Hassan."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate-breaking and other current news," "wrote them in the commentary section of the post-law" "The Post."</seg>
<seg id="187">"I don't appreciate this idea if a number of people takes place on the same issue, then they are not considered a so-called collective use and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">"what the employees of the Governors were signed as" "spam attack", "other probably would be" "intercession". ""</seg>
<seg id="189">"the Facebook era makes it simple, cut a message by simply blocked a crime or deleted a negative comment."</seg>
<seg id="190">"it is a lot of cleaner than in former times when you have done the same that staff were desanded to collect and burn newspapers with critical leadership articles and to burn or demonstrators, and to silence."</seg>
<seg id="191">But that is exactly what happened digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official which is criticized for it that he has accused Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is operated by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question fell last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">"the Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County glorified the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Court James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she had a voters on her Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="196">"and in Kentucky, governor of the ACES received a visit from the ACES because of its use of Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be as difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time Washington tons had a similar effect on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">"the number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous wallet swallow for his leadership."</seg>
<seg id="200">And even at that time Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">"the people, the pseudonyms like" Juricola, "" Valerius, "" Belisarius "and" Portius "," wrote all letters to newspapers who made Washington's decisions. "</seg>
<seg id="202">"petition that criticized his position on the Treaty of Amity, trade and shipping with the UK to criticised his office, according to the historical documents which were collected by the Online Papers of George Washington Project."</seg>
<seg id="203">But he has not brought her to silence.</seg>
<seg id="204">Freedom of speech, disagreements and discourses belong to the basis of our nation. "</seg>
<seg id="205">And true leadership means that accept.</seg>
<seg id="206">Ronan Rafferty hopes for domestic comfort at the Renaissance club</seg>
<seg id="207">"the former Europeans n ° 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope for the next three days at home comfort, as the Renaissance club hosted the Scottish Senior Open in the next three days."</seg>

<seg id="1320">"before that I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger area," says Joanne. "</seg>
<seg id="1321">"I sought after something, that was comparable to my price."</seg>
<seg id="1322">"this apartment was shown in Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings."</seg>
<seg id="1323">I loved it in love and made an offer on that day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">"since the first visit, the 1,000 square-square large apartment was completely outdated."</seg>
<seg id="1325">"originally a one-room estate with a welded layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add a anne's storage space, and a mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height."</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light."</seg>
<seg id="1327">"that was my request," "she says."</seg>
<seg id="1328">"to this end, she commissioned the architectural and designer studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill, to take advantage of 12,5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development, but also a place to live for Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"the ceiling was not big enough to place two spaces, so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine where you could stand."</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to be creative thinking to release the award.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel plant is rather complicated," explained. "</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange the rooms so that they were overbed, without having had to gaps."</seg>
<seg id="1333">"it was not just about building a simple platform, but the steel so that he had the right height for the top or bottom."</seg>
<seg id="1334">"this arrangement enabled it to place Erfan, two rooms in full height - with plenty of extra drama."</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine looks a classic coupling window of Retrouvius over the glamorous living area.</seg>

<seg id="1340">At the entrance offer piped units space for all Bestangles and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">"due to the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used."</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a challenge.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering-art went out," explains Erfan of the stahlreinforced, terrible MDF-door. "</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is essential, so it is when you move the door very easily slips."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne could win additional 16 m ², one extra bedroom and a improved layout."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the basic space - or how your property is estimated," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form, a real estate makler will advocate and a calculation based on the ground floor."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"here they managed to enlarge the ground floor, and at the same time use high quality materials to make the room its luxurious advantage."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things you touch and who therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you do not forget you into the electric plugs in the walls.</seg>
<seg id="1352">"they are important, but they do not play with your heart."</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can be turned out by a good design and increased square metering number from something by default in something very astonishing.</seg>

<seg id="1484">U.S. intelligence services complainable the Kremlin for longer to detained in the presidential campaign 2016.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller investigates whether there were collusion between Trumps electoral team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"in the focus of investigations, several men are supposed to stand in the election campaign as a consultant of the Republicans."</seg>
<seg id="1487">"according to that, Mueller also took more and more Trumps privates and business environment under the magnifier."</seg>
<seg id="1488">"the" "Washington Post" "wrote a few weeks ago that the special issue of Trump personally have moved into the center and I am looking for the accusation whether the president in the course of the affair could hinders the judiciary."</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Jurys is to consider this evidence in possible interruptions and decide whether accusation should be raised.</seg>

<seg id="1519">In the Westantarktis one has been a gigantic iceberg from the scarf size of Berlin from Scheldeland.</seg>

<seg id="1521">"the size of about a Billion tons of heavy and 5800 square kilometers large Coloured is now coming to the north and will probably be two, three years until he was melted."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"over the past three decades, it is registered with 175 kilometers of length and width of up to 50 kilometers, the researchers have registered over the past three decades."</seg>
<seg id="1523">There is no danger to people coming from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">"however, climate change has played a role in the breakdown of the ice age, is unclear according to research."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"however, it has been a series of unusual breakdowns of ice cream in the region for about 30 years, writes the US research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a fact."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"according to many researchers, this can be connected to the heating up."</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now abrochene Koloss had been part of the Larsen-C-Scheldeland so far.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Scheldeland floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It is thus increasing in the ocean and breaks out regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Scheldels is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this Shelving was the balance of waxles and Abomiting several years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A complete shake was to fall there, writes AWI-researcher Daniela Jansen. "</seg>
<seg id="1533">"I speak some things that also the Larsen-C-Scheldeline is in danger, for the more advanced seams have never been withdrawn as far as at present."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"moreover, stand up the ice plate under tension and can be disintegrate, in case a keypoint place a piece."</seg>
<seg id="1535">"the melting of Shelters and iceberg increases the sea level, as they swim on the water and pushes ice as much water as it comes after the melting itself."</seg>
<seg id="1536">"however, the loss of Scheldeline leads to the glaciers directly into the ocean and can flow a lot faster than before."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"that could possibly increase the sea level, but only in the low extent, the British research project writes about the observation of the Antarctic (MIDAS)."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Larsen-C-Scheldeline is according to AWI-data with almost 50 000 square kilometres, the fourth quarter of the Antarctic. "</seg>
<seg id="1539">"on the transfer from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, on the front edge to the open ocean around 200 meters."</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks out regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although there is a natural happening and no direct connection to climate change is conscious, the ice cream comes into a dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University. "</seg>
<seg id="1542">"this is the widest retreat since the beginning of the records," he also confirmed. "</seg>
<seg id="1543">"under scientists be disputed whether the Larsen-C-Scheldeline will now grow back in the long term, and possibly together, his colleague Adrian Luckman and added:" our models say that it will be less stable. "</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will last decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"even if these researchers make the breakdown of this gigantic iceberg not on climate change, so in the past few decades, a lot of ice skulls of the antarctic peninsula are broken."</seg>

<seg id="1547">"according to data from the British Antarctic Survey, the iron area of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined around 28 000 square kilometers."</seg>

<seg id="1810">The employees of the weekly reef Riodoce is normally associated to review their plans for reporting about the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and ceaseless drug wars. "</seg>
<seg id="1811">"but on this day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security."</seg>
<seg id="1812">It was told to them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">"two high-level journalists discuss what you feel safe: they should take their children to the office, which were the target of an attack with granulates, or put them at home."</seg>
<seg id="1814">"security experts have written three words on a board at the front of the room: opponents, Neutral, allies."</seg>
<seg id="1815">"they ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and pancreatic."</seg>
<seg id="1816">"there are stimulus regulators, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspicious to stand on the salary list of government or cartels, a catalog of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"there is no resting break from the violence, and throughout the country the corpses, are more and more journalists: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto in December 2012 had taken place after attack and threats under Federal Protection and until now there were at least seven tote in seven countries."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"among the latter, their editors and their inspirator of Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and journalist," wrote Valdez in one of its numerous books on violence associated with drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="1820">"his absence will be felt deeply, although its presence is present everywhere - a great photo of Valdez, which shows its main finger with the word" Justice "building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts, which show its ridiculous face with glasses or his typical Panamahere."</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop will take place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared topics, trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although 2010 was established a Sonder's Bar in order to process the cases of journalists, this according to the Committee to protect journalists just two criminal proceedings."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"like most of the thousands of morden, each year associated with drug trading and organised crime, the murderers of journalists are rarely provided."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"at Riodoce you still insist on to treat the violence of Sinaloa, although they are infinite, and even though the terrain is still slanted."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without any information about the murderer, without justice, the meeting for discussion of security is little benefits, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid to wasting my time in this workshop," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we do not know the Why, distrust we all."</seg>
<seg id="1828">"in the morning of 15 May, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the state capital of Culiacan."</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he managed to drive a few blocks away before its red Toyota Corolla was forced by two men. he was forced out of his car and was shot 12 times on him, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - who was translated with" "twelve" "river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The cap was gone away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adults.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumours tend to fly freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzmans reprisoned last year and delivery in the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest slaughter of the country, as rivaled factions stood here to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot on the road or that the graveyard is full of playful, two-storey mausoleen for drugs, which are bigger than many homes for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">"forget for a minute that there is a state of 'peace', if only one cartel control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes in the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1838">"nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, with the blame that he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"first of February, there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rivaling cartels in war with Guzmans sons."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this publication may have annoyed the sons, thought-members bought each specimen of the issue, once they delivered to time kioske."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second mistake was to force Valdez, according to the confiscation of another newspaper which had released the same history to its own safety."</seg>
<seg id="1843">"Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and its killing is regarded as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1844">He has survived so long that his friends and colleagues annahmen that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for Northeeste as he joined together with five colleagues for the founding of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa, it was impossible to operate journalism without having to encounter the roughening problem," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1847">"with time, the newspaper served its reputation because of courageous and honest reporting, and turnover and advertising."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporter loving it, hard to release studies without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else could handle."</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the foundation of Riodoce she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot" for their coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in the persecution of the Mexican drug history, wherever they led."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave voluntary to that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I would like to continue living," he said at the time of the CPJ distinction. "</seg>
<seg id="1853">"drug dealers in Sinaloa" is a way of life, "he said in an interview with Rompeviento TV."</seg>
<seg id="1854">You have to take the task that falls you as a journalist - either the or you play the dumb.</seg>
<seg id="1855">I don't want to be asked: "what did you do in view of so many stills... why did you not say what went ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the Riodoce team miss Valdez, the Spaak bird, which was also a port worker, the friend, the generous with hugs and advice was, a teacher who knew how to survive."</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted to his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always carry his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always go to El Guayama, the bar opposite to the office, and always sit there at the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">"now, ask them: was his love of routine be his blazing?"</seg>
<seg id="1861">"his death has also compelled them to ask their own assumptions in question, how they do their work best and stay alive."</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they do not like it if you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their furnish start and landing stage, in order to move drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even in the best times, a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation."</seg>
<seg id="1865">To trust his own instinct.</seg>
<seg id="1866">"when it is wrong, keep away from it."</seg>
<seg id="1867">"the anger is, said the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal that" smell can be a sense that may be deceived... and then the thing happened to Javier. "</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the old rules, as he and others say, are in Sinaloa not more - just as in Tamaulipas, VERACRUZ, Guerrero and other states in which a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling, weak institutions and corrupt government at home."</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is constantly changing.</seg>
<seg id="1870">"in the room where the staff met by Riodoce on the safety training, suddenly there were no phones. days before has been known that Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1871">"seeking two police officers in front of the heat from 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree."</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story house in a middle class district of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">"half in the joke, some of the reporters were asking if these officers belong to the 50 percent of policemen, who referred to the Governor itself as not trustworthy."</seg>
<seg id="1874">"it is months ago, since the reporter went into the mountain scenery, where the drug-gangs have been under control."</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week Riodoce on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former known Boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to the state of the state that focused on the hometown of the Governors.</seg>
<seg id="1878">"and there was a group that led in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, one block from the office of the Prosecutor's office."</seg>
<seg id="1879">"there was no official word about who kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was necessary to write as it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1880">"a reporter from public records, that the restaurant has been registered under the name of a policy manager, which belonged to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (Pri), which was conquered almost all the political planes."</seg>
<seg id="1881">"recently, several Pri governors were accused of high-hearted cases of corruption."</seg>
<seg id="1882">"Villarreal asked the reporter, to write about predicting incidents in this eatery, including one in which a son of" El Chapo "Guzman got a military overfall."</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months before the readers could have seen the Kolumne of Valdez as the most informative source about kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"earlier we had already knew what is happening," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El FLACO" because of its slender body. "</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now, all channels of communication are broken with our sources."</seg>
<seg id="1886">"the office of Valdez has been dedicated to the storage room for signs and stickers, dedicated to the Morde of journalists, because the employees have become something that they themselves never expected: activists in the name of the press."</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez pick up a few characters and passed the next morning to a demonstration for another journalist to the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed in the western federal state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">"a burnt body was discovered and officials say, based on DNA testing it is of it."</seg>
<seg id="1890">Journalists all over the country have become more powerful as they have written in organized protests "SOS Press" on enclosure and construction.</seg>
<seg id="1891">"on this day, the director Bojorquez is gone by Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez."</seg>
<seg id="1892">"during a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa on the day following the assassination of Valdez accused Ramirez, journalists, journalists, and put them to leave, because they told the truth."</seg>
<seg id="1893">"she has since been asked that she was once again divided by the Government, because she is worried that their anger has hurt their objectivity."</seg>
<seg id="1894">"Valdez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico by organised crime, involved in government offices and a uniform society". ""</seg>
<seg id="1895">"in his last book" "Narco Journalism", "he wrote that reporter not only killed by drugs, but also on the command of politicians and security forces who have organised crime under a ceiling."</seg>

<seg id="1898">"obviously, the Morde have a deterrent effect."</seg>

<seg id="1904">"in 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly launched the drug card with a editorial board on the cover page with the heading" What do you want from us? "</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">"it is hard to find jobs in exile, and they still observe the streets and are looking for dangers."</seg>
<seg id="1908">"and sometimes they will be jagt as the photographer Ruben Espinosa, which in 2015 was murdered together with four women in an apartment in Mexico-city three months after the flight from VERACRUZ."</seg>

<seg id="1920">"under the enormous portrait of the unusual founder of the newspaper, its central finger was visible for quite Sinaloa, followed the staff of Riodoce its mark."</seg>

<seg id="1926">"the report in the magazine" Current Biology "describes it as" the bellied dinosaurs, who ever found, and one of the best dinosaurs specimens of the world. "</seg>
<seg id="1927">"the Fossil is a newly discovered type of Nodosaurier, which lived in the middle of the roundabout, between 110 million and 112 million years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"his unbelievably good condition has researchers, which it is as" really remarkable, "stunned"</seg>
<seg id="1929">"according to reports in National Geographic, the equitable plant-eaters is the best preserved Fossil of its kind."</seg>
<seg id="1930">"it was found by Shawn Funk when he was born on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, Den"</seg>
<seg id="1931">"he met something that seemed to flaw from the surrounding rock, and decided to watch more accurately."</seg>
<seg id="1932">The Fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">"they spent the next six years to cover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) of heavy Earth clashes."</seg>
<seg id="1934">"after all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you just blinded a little with the eyes blinks, you could almost believe it was," said the main autor Caleb Brown, scientists in the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to be seen. "</seg>
<seg id="1936">It is reflected in the history of scientists as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs specimens - the mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers have found that this plant is fresser, although he is covered with an armor and a changing tank, probably by meat vore Dinosrs was threatened."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the strongly located dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technology used as a counterpart which is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this could have been allowed to mix better into its surroundings and to escape its enemies, say experts, which suggests that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the family of Nodosaurier was first headlines in May and is now seen in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers have now studied the wild animals and it Borealopelta markmitchelli was named after the Museumstechniker Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours to cover it carefully."</seg>
<seg id="1942">"the amazing maintenance of the specimen, it enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists, the pattern and the form of scales and armour about his body."</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered the counter-shady, a common defence method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its underside."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the counter-shady is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta by far the animals living today."</seg>
<seg id="1945">"it suggests that the dinosaurs was grounded by enough pressure by meat vore dinosaurs, that the evolution was favoured the wear of the confrontation as a means of survival."</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most contemporary animals that employ the counter shaded - think of deer, zebras or gildly animals - are much smaller and violable as loot, which signalized that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a real fight for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong prey behavior on a massive, strongly gearmored dinosaurs show how dangerous the dinosaurs robbery of the roundabout must have been," said Brown. "</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their skins also shows that the skin of the dinosaurs red-brown was.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists continue to examine the animal on references of his life, including his concurrent Darminent to find out what it had eaten as his last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaurs died, when he died, into a river and driven into the sea where he sank on the back to the sea."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at that time, Alberta was so warm like southern today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much more widespread than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is really remarkable because it remains completely covered with preservented skin, but also in three dimensions remains and the original form of the animal retains" said Brown. "</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that the animal looks almost exactly as well as in the early roundabout.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you do not need much imagination to use it to reconstruct. if you only have a little with the eyes, you could almost believe it is sleeping."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the chalk time was a time, as giant theropoda, carnivorous dinary, which stood on two legs, the earth went through."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the king of them, the tyrannosaurus rex, millions of years after Borealopelta lived, the tortured dinosaurs was grounded by some of his terrible ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"this belongs to the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 feet (11.5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters."</seg>
<seg id="1958">"the scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta believed in the death in the sea and was buried in mud."</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creature was found by Shawn Funk when he was born on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, Den"</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum it is the secured dinosaurs of the world, including skin and armaments, and is complete from the muzzle to the hips."</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and have weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1.300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">"it contained two 20-inch-long tips, which raged by his shoulders."</seg>
<seg id="1963">"the researchers believe that the ruined crop was curved through the western Canada, until a flooded flow was flooded into the open sea."</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater-continuance of the dinosaurs keep his armour in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remnants of this special specimen are so well received that the Hautreste still cover bumpy highs along the dinosaurs</seg>

<seg id="2021">"only one day after they arrived at New York City, sitting in St. Louis prayer on the bed of an Airbnb apartment that rented and scroll through Facebook on their phone."</seg>
<seg id="2022">You stumbled across a post by someone from the High School.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"the police just killed a 18-year child, and there is still on the street," was it there. "</seg>
<seg id="2024">"confused as no one had posted on their feed the information, she concluded Facebook and opened Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the handle @ TheePharoah was constantly met on her timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"the Rapper from the territory of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18 year-old, who was killed by a white policemen in Ferguson, Mo., was killed."</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted an image of Brown Living's body that was outstretched on the road and would stay four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"this is wild, I thought Ferrell at her."</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for them and their fellowship.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She put her mobile phone to return later in the evening to Tweets over people on the Canfield Drive.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"there were photos of the police band and people, the cried, and of a man who asserted a sign with the wording:" Fergusons police have just killed my unarmed son! "</seg>
<seg id="2032">They watched a live Feed in which a policeman stood before a group of protesters with a bellish dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"in another video, she said, rejected a different policeman his rifle and cried:" I will kill you... animals all kill. "</seg>
<seg id="2034">"that is not usual," recalled Ferrell at their statement. "</seg>
<seg id="2035">This is not the kind of murder that we have accustomed to us and that we can say typical.</seg>
<seg id="2036">In this moment I felt shook.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">They booked a trip and went to the next day at home.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After landing at 23 o'clock they took their 6-year old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two would go to Ferguson next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, the topic of a new documentary film," Whose Streets? "" in the cinemas from the 11. "</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a history of survival and Protestant, love and loss of strength, strength and resistance, which consists of the sight of the people who live in the community and to demand the streets to demand answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"as the Ferrell with her daughter who brought a floral dress and a suitable crown, according to Ferguson, the two had a conversation that they had countless occasions in front of this morning" about the black experience and the black state. "</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" remembered what she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2044">"we are now going to Ferguson, because the police have killed a 18-year-old boy and that was not correct."</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I could not take them," said Ferrell later. "</seg>
<seg id="2046">That which happens today is a highlight of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">It has to know and it is to be seen and raised.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it has to be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to free to free ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even if I have the happiness to give her an experience, in which she had not experienced a blatant racism, it is not different from the next black women child."</seg>
<seg id="2050">"I have the feeling, I would prove her a bad service to keep them away."</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first stop when they arrived at Ferguson, was on the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority which was agreed to a campment, as the activists on the possible non-indictment of Officer Darren Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="2052">"there was Ferrell and her daughter connected with a local business meeting, the lunch was."</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared pockets before and helped them to pass on demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly began to take a new type of activism for feral shape.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism changed after the 9th of August, she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on Essens-Justice and healthful inequalities in black congregations."</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in Organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It is all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">"weeks later, Ferrell arrived in an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan, one of the Co-director of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"follow Folayan said her and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to be" "documented" "what happened."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"a question came to the sense:" "do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use it?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">"this skepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often by whites in a community that benefited by their pain and its resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"as Folayan recently declared in an interview," We heard that people who were born in Ferguson and raised their voices and we wanted to do it differently. "</seg>
<seg id="2063">"follow-up, Folayan had already worked together with the then Co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area that is known for his activism in order to be deducted."</seg>
<seg id="2064">His dedication brought the project closer together with six other indigenous people followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years to Brown Ershoots.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us. we speak," "said Davis."</seg>
<seg id="2066">"that was the main thing for me, as these people are represented, as I will be represented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the goal was not to concentrate on Ferrells experience - to show that it is concerned with the movement" not about a Messiah's guide, but around a community, "said Folayan - she proved to be the most open participant in the film."</seg>
<seg id="2068">"consequently we show documents of" Whose Streets? "a surprising personal aspect of Ferrells's life, as she loves himself and her wife marries."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time. "</seg>
<seg id="2070">But I have understood that there must be certain vulnerability during this work and in the inhumane of black people.</seg>
<seg id="2071">"in addition, Ferrells history has repeated the role of black fluctuations women in the wider Black-Lives-Matter movement."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of the movement, which, after the killing of the black teenager Trayby Martin in 2012 have shaped the film" BlacklivesMatter "in social media, identify themselves as pregnant."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, pregnant women in leadership positions have worn the movement altogether," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are constantly fighting on various fronts."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, pregnant women must carry the main last of everything."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"follow-up to notice, to notice that" the movement really is maintained by black women and many black women. "</seg>
<seg id="2076">"however, it is obvious that" "this is not a affirmative type of action," in the heal of their identity as the heart of the film. "</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who shook this energy," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is not a coincidence that although she was at the front front, because in a life at these crossings as a black, sultry woman is so much on the game."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel their energy by the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">"meanwhile the news cameras in Ferguson has long since gone, but the racial connections between the municipality and the police continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is granting for 2 ½ years because of the blockage of a highway during a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">"it describes the sociopolitical atmosphere of the area that they call their home," a chaos. "</seg>
<seg id="2083">"nevertheless, she cries himself to a singing and she feels committed to this memory since she went in Ferguson on the streets three years ago."</seg>
<seg id="2084">It is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We need to love each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">From "dream" to "size wahn": TV-readers discuss about bit-gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">"the bit gallery is moving the people, although it is not yet built for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="2090">"but the idea of a shopping centre at the south-line of the pedestrian street divides since the first presentation of 2009, the population in supporters and opponents."</seg>
<seg id="2091">Cold leaves the subject hardly any one.</seg>
<seg id="2092">"also on our Facebook page" "Volksfreund Bitburg" "is discussed."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"say during the one to the bit gallery:" this would be a dream "(Anja Becker)," "This would be real class" "(Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side:" does not need people "" (Siggi "") or simply simple: "" size wahn! "" (Lars Scholz). "</seg>
<seg id="2094">"while the advocates that a gallery will build more customers into the city, of which the rest of the stores will benefit, fear the pedestrian precinct."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"added: the gallery is planned on the plot, on which the farm market hall stands, in the 13 direct market-market their products."</seg>
<seg id="2096">With the start of the construction works it will be an end to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The gallery-makers want to integrate a market hall in the new building - and to the Beda place with possibility to outdoors sitting outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Rooms: "we have been buying almost weekly in the farm market for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">"mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cake of the landlady always welcome again."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Also the butcher we have discovered for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">"we would like to wish that even during and above all, after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer."</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities there is also.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"above all, the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting."</seg>
<seg id="2104">"Gerd Densing:" "whether the direct market in a market hall in the gallery, comes to the level of rent."</seg>
<seg id="2105">"however, this might not be very low in the new project."</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "why a bunch of shopping in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">"whether clothing, shoes, drush or supermarkets: I find that superfluous."</seg>
<seg id="2108">There is already enough in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">You can see how many stores have been empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">"but since there is not even a proper weekend market, it is all the more important that we remain at least the market hall."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"for all, the goods offered are fresh, is mostly offered directly from the producer."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"as you can see, shop stores in a shopping centre is only provided by larger companies, because the dortigen rental are often not viable."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"too bad, specialty shops there is almost no more and that which is still left, will probably also disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a mall with a Markthalle fits me not together.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">First of all: where is the peasant market hall during the construction period?</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the old Edeka would be the solution - even on duration, if the bit gallery is actually coming."</seg>
<seg id="2118">"or does it create the Gespenst bit gallery before, all transactions from Bitburg to expel?"</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "this is simply not working.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"and a shopping center, which is empty, even nobody needs."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"in my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">But for a peasant market hall it's thanks to the wahnsinful many - how I find - sensuous construction projects in Bitburg no place more.</seg>
<seg id="2123">When the peasant market hall is made to disappear again a piece of culture disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2124">A suitable similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">"in the middle of the space of Fridman Gallery in New York are many faces - white, black and brown, which hang almost unstrange - that hang on cables from the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist in Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupener and Hints that were sent by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"Manning sent the excerpts from the prison Fort Leavenworth, where the former Mystery Analyzer has made an 35-year imprisonment, after they made public announcements on the website WikiLeaks publicly."</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the new exhibition, which opened on 2 August, is called A Becoming resemblance (A suitable similarity)."</seg>
<seg id="2129">"it is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline became its expertise in technology, computer sciences and art, and Manning, whose condemnation was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"Dewey-Hagborg has been extracted by the algorithms analysis of DNA, which were extracted by Manning, like anyone with these genomic data could look like anyone with these genomic data - the many ways of how they can be interpreted and the indurated detection of these interpretations - but also for identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning who was born as Bradley Edward, but already has spoken openly about the identification as a woman has been sentenced in 2013 because of 20 indictions, including six infringements against espionagegesetz, computer fraud and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"through the prison, her image was suppressed, so much that there was only one single photo - a granting, black-white selfie, in the Manning clearly sitting and a platinum perch - with which it was associated with it."</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg came straight from the great success of their 2012-project 'stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in this, the artists in portraits from forensic artifacts like cigarette mute and chewing gum, extracted DNA from the waste to create a picture of how these people might look like."</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an e-mail from a timagazin.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they led an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted to accompany a kind of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press release of the new exhibition. "</seg>
<seg id="2137">"and she was not visited at this time and she could not be photographed. therefore, they took contact with Chelsea, and asked them if she wanted to make a DNA portrait."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"the artist and their incarcerated Muse have become unequal brilliance, which are interchangeable in the course of two years."</seg>
<seg id="2139">"she even invoked one of Shoili canungo Illustried Comic" Stockressed Images, "which a future was predicted in which the president would convert his sentence, and it would be able to see the exhibition personally."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"that Obama was in fact only a few days after the book was released, Manning release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome kind of happy meeting."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"there is also at the opening of the exhibition a little deeper and Starkes, since Donald Trump takes a war against informants from the governmental camp and against transgender forces to find new, tweet ways to fix the rigid divisions which he should actually remedy further."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"when Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that" things happen from a certain reason. "</seg>
<seg id="2143">"written in one on the wall of the gallery written artistic statement called Manning with her oversized signature among them (the" "i" "in her family name is provided with a heart) an end of" automatic defragment, the basis of gender, race, sexuality and culture. "</seg>
<seg id="2144">"on the opposite wall, its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousands of caps and GS and As, written in pencil."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"Dewey-Hagborg hoped, showing the inclusion of 200 letters (or Nucleotoids after the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist), how amazing similar, at least in biological terms, we all are."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take away is that our genome is not taking care of who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works of 2007, spurious Memories, also to be seen. "</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"the last piece in the exhibition which is stored in a separate room, is a page from the above Comic Novelle."</seg>
<seg id="2149">It shows Manning how it emerges with a free phone in the hand out of the discipline's arctic in the United States as King-Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"if they put your speech, then they have won."</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so, never the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came straight from a letter that she wrote me," "said the artist who greet from Philadelphia."</seg>
<seg id="2153">"I am still geese, if I talk about it."</seg>
<seg id="2154">"Manning has not yet seen the exhibition - so how it should be done in the comic book - but if they should do it, then she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, who collapsed by their own genomic simulator."</seg>
<seg id="2155">"this was also targeted, as everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5" 2, Manning Statur), in which their genetic haploggroups were written with a pencil. "</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted to feel that they feel like a man of crowd," said Dewey-Hagborg from the portraits. "</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement, who formed itself with Chelsea, like the movement, which was also behind their liberation."</seg>

<seg id="2395">"people make themselves funny, but the companies deliver a lot of it, and we will see them much more frequently," said Mr Sharkey in the release of his new report. "</seg>
<seg id="2396">"modern Sexes have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silically, which feels warm, with conscious human reactions, which are achieved through artificial intelligence."</seg>

<seg id="2579">"red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help, IBD (inflammatory disease)"</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system as a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">"but a new study holds exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, the symptoms of patients with inflammatory diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2582">"the incurable state that affects approximately 1.3 million and in the UK 300.000, causes magencramps and bleeding, recurring or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme tiredness."</seg>
<seg id="2583">"during the person concerned, meat and dairy products are usually come to relieve their symptoms, researchers at the Washingtoner University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan came to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine."</seg>
<seg id="2584">"the researcher researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, declared that immune cells at the Darm patrol to ensure that damaging microbes to hide in the food not penetrate into the body."</seg>
<seg id="2585">"cells, which are able to cut inflammation, are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without being sensitive tissues."</seg>
<seg id="2586">"if the balance is too far towards inflammation, it may result a inflammatory disease."</seg>
<seg id="2587">"in experiments, it was noted that a kind of tolerance is conducized immune cell that occurs in mice, which carry a certain bacterium in their insertions."</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needed tryptophan - one of the components of proteins in order to cut the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"Professor Colonna said:" we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbioms, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance. "</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more Tryptophan the mice in their food, the more they had of these immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"he suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and an an tryptophan rich diet tolerant, less inflatable bowel promotes, if the same system is also wirling with people."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"the Postdoktorandin Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan searched a sort of immune cell that encourages tolerance, when she found such cells, but another group of the same tribe but that was not separate."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"they suspected that the difference between the intestinal microbiomes of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and mushrooms which usually live in the stomach-intestinal tract."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"the intestines of the mice were found DNA sequentially and there were six bacterial species present in the mice with the immune cells, but without them lacking in mice."</seg>
<seg id="2595">"mice were raised in a sterile environment so that they did not have a intestinal microbiome and they did not developed these kinds of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2596">"to understand how the bacteria applied to the immune system, the researchers released L. reuteri in a fluid and then overled small quantities of fluid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells that were isolated by the mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"as the active component of the liquid was cleansed, it proved to be known as a by-product of the tryptophan-Metabolism which is known as an Indol-3 lactic acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"if the researchers hit the amount of tryptophan in the food of the mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but if the tryptophandics were halved, the number of cells dropped by half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">"Dr. Cervantes Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells such as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our stomach-intestinal tractors."</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether tryptophan-by-products from L. reuteri can develop the cells in humans as with mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory disease."</seg>
<seg id="2602">"she said:" "the development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote, since these cells are inflammation of the inner surface of the intestines."</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high tryptophanvalues can lead to an expansion of this population.</seg>

<seg id="2892">"Christian Weider, spokesman of the reform movement" We are Church "," explained by the previous Regensburger Bishop and today Kardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year's brother of Benedict XVI, an excuse. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">"it would serve the prestige of the Catholic Church, when Müller and Ratzinger would greatly express their own subomissions or their then false assessment of processes."</seg>
<seg id="2894">"the Vatican" Osservatore Romano, "on the other hand criticized that in reporting on violence in the domain are measured with" "two measurements". ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">"with regard to the grips in Regensburg, no one knew that it would be punished and shameful deeds, but the" degree of medial manipulation, "thus the author of medietta Scaraffia, historiography in and member of the national Italian Bioethics committee."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit to call the Catholic Church as a source of all evil, is already part of the everyday experience and prepares public opinion which is normal to hold for normal, writes Scaraffia."</seg>
<seg id="2897">"also Fürs Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said in the interview with the Bayerischer Rundfunk," "you would like to go on the church and this is a set of frescoes."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"in addition, it pointed out that in her youth" beats a quite normal pedagogical means "" to be with freed children, as I was one was finished. "</seg>
<seg id="2899">They are unfair to apply today's standards to past decades because the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with reports of the abuse of waste often also pope-brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2901">"totally wrong, means author and historian Michael Hesemann, who translated with Ratzinger" My brother of Pope "(translated in 12 languages)."</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I must take Georg Ratzinger in protection," says Ezemann, "for all that had nothing to do with him," he adds the results of the final report. "</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-sided report that was presented by the Bistum Regensburg with the Enlightenment? Ulrich Weber presented?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were killed between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s" with high plastsibility "victims of overprint, 67 Domspatzen sexually abused."</seg>
<seg id="2905">"in the final report, it is said to Georg Ratzinger, who was active from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg:" summary, so that by Domkapellmeister R. in many cases of physical and mental violence have been applied. "</seg>
<seg id="2906">"especially with high Emotional ality, the punishment of the students could also be fierce."</seg>
<seg id="2907">"nevertheless, unlike numerous other signs, many victims suffered the general humanity of R. and therefore combine positive memories with him in many cases despite violence."</seg>
<seg id="2908">"in the interview, Hesemann, why the final report on the abuse of the dispute was reported at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger of his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2909">"Mr. Hesemann, the 440-Pages report on the" incidents of nonviolence against the Regensburger Domspatzen "indicates a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2910">To a raise a lot of pupils his "humanity."</seg>
<seg id="2911">"for the other, he also appears as a choleriker and perfectionist, which was tangible, if a Domspatz musically brought no top performance."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate as his biographer this final report?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"Michael Hesemann: when one takes the effort and read all the 440 pages long report from the front to the back, one has to ask quite a question why the name Georg Ratzinger occurs at all in it."</seg>
<seg id="2914">"at the moment, eight pages are devoted to him and he is clearly talked about every suspicion of the mediator or fellow blood in the terrible cases sexual abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2915">Also the non-violence at the pre-school uncovered itself outside of its effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="2916">"it is possible to pre-cast it, too late or first we have not taken seriously enough."</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the Domspatzenging school, on which he real, was perceived by practically all respondents than - so literally -" redemption "," "heaven" and "better world." "</seg>
<seg id="2918">"the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger presents a very excellent record, describes it as" warm-hearted "," "sincere," "knowledgeable," "knowledgeable," "knowledgeable," "competently, and" "comprehensible", "as extremely good-natured teachers who run the guys regularly with cakes, biscuits and bonbons, and" always covered by grapes of children. "</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complained about his perfectionism and its high Emotionality that led even to Wutausages.</seg>
<seg id="2920">"he threw not only with chairs and boiled down on the ground, but also earrings distributed and too freed guys to the hair or ears, he has given himself very regretted for years and excused for it excused."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"however, to its honesty, however, must be said that such educators in the questionable time, the 1960s and the 1970s were widespread, with parents like with teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you still know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think everyone of us, who was born before 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"I also experienced this in a world-mundane school, an state-Gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared to what it is actually going on in this report, namely the irreplaceable sexual abuse and non-violence in the pre-school, are the free Bagatelles."</seg>
<seg id="2926">"if you ask yourself whether it is not more familiar with his familiarity and his role as the brother of Benedikt XVIA, that many media has just returned to him."</seg>
<seg id="2927">"at the Bavarian e, many who never understood him, still eiving."</seg>
<seg id="2928">The truth is: the report deburdened Georg Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"in connection with the report, the report was reported a lot about the subject of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger in the final report also laid any reversal or roast in terms of sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: quite clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of the 67 victims of sexual grips claimed to become familiar to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I have never dreamed of speaking with my father or my mother," "said a subject of sufferers for the others," It was all very embarrassing. "</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem with clarification of sexual abuse was and yet is that most of the victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they didn't even talk to parents and siblings, then definitely not a choral leader who would have been a colleague of perpetrators of perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen-Students Ratzingers role in terms of abuse of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a respondent student formulating it so: "regarding sexual abuse... I do not see... any case in which he could have had been timely findings and have been able to stop the respective perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I consider it... also for really absurd to accept that the truders of him... Bubbles invoked or clearer or even sooner than to their parents, boarding, Trust, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"thus the report comes to a very clear result:" that in advance, the students affected by the students and / or their environment, could not be confirmed under investigation. "</seg>
<seg id="2942">"what sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is thus acquitted of any compassion."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"thus it can not be cast, him will not prevent him or be brought to the ad."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore there is no reason to bring his good name to these contradicting crimes, as unfortunately it happened in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">"in the media was much of" "nonviolence" "to read the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2946">The previous cathedral-kapellmeister Georg Ratzinger will be cast away in the report.</seg>
<seg id="2947">Must he live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that in reporting everything is mixed and topped up to a huge milking of sexual abuse and non-violence and somewhere, in the midst of it, Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is precisely the misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">"namely, it is clean separately: between the pre-school and the grammar school, between sexual abuse and non-violence, as well as we say once, other preaches."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"in addition, the report is covered from time since 1945, so also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not choir conductors of the cathedral-atzen."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"the whole horrible test of pedagogy, the cases where lad of sadistical teachers were regulated and malignited, uneventful occurred at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous states have to have."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with whom the kapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, for he got the boys first to face, when they were already on the domain name."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"on what was, how most witnesses emphasise the topic" pre-school "." "</seg>
<seg id="2955">"one was just happy to escape it, and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even" heavenly. ""</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different in the domain name?</seg>
<seg id="2957">"Michael Hesemann: there is already discipline, but just no sadistical violence."</seg>
<seg id="2958">"and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report comes to the conclusion that" many victims of humanity's general humanity and therefore combine positive memories with him in many cases despite violence. "</seg>
<seg id="2959">"thus, at the most still the accusation, have to have taken away."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"however, despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre-school."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time 1970 / 71, when he began to establish himself and managed by the events at a school where he was not real and responsible, (so the witness) nothing wanted to hear, and then again in 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Indexing Georg Ratzinger in front of the states consistently the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the Domspatzenei, which the report was even reproduced."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"in this, he points out that the examines will continue to be practiced in the pre-school."</seg>
<seg id="2965">"even in the face of the danger of negative press, he often recommended."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"of course, that was of course at a time when the legal clarity was existed as a test, was also banned in Bavaria too."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before that, they were born in a legal gray area, as each one of us still knows."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"there was difficult to estimate for him, where those affected might be exaggerated or dramatic, and where really the permissible border had been crossed."</seg>
<seg id="2969">"but one cannot say, he would have always been swollen."</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">"only in 1980, the auditory was officially launched in Bavaria too."</seg>
<seg id="2972">"princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said yes, it is unfair, to apply today's pedagogical standards to the damaging time."</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Hesemann: we are talking about the" Fallstrick of Anachronism "," thus the danger, and present the moral standards of today's moral standards. "</seg>
<seg id="2975">And the princess has been quite right now.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"of course, this does not apply to sexual abuse, who was abominable at all times and not for what happens in the primary school of resistance and violence in innocent child labour, that goes far beyond that time."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"that is all very terrible, and I am glad that it will finally work hard."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"but at the same time, I have to take on the protection of George Ratzinger, for all that had nothing to do with him."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"his means of disciplining and punishment, so ear-cheers and ears to the hair and ears were widely used in the 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"when physical punishment was then banned, he also held out strictly to it."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"what image of his Regensburger period has Georg Ratzinger, because in discussions with you for the book" My brother of Pope "?"</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the topic of review also came to language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, the Pope Benedict XVI, tells us from his perspective, there the cathedral also played a secondary role."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, I was by no means that he led there a stricter regiment."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"but even this must be said once again: without this perfectionism, without the request unconditioned discipline, it would be hardly possible to form the institution of world-known Regensburger Domspatzen an institution of puppy Europe and his musical tradition, which went straight twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with biscuits and Bonbons alone, one makes no major singer and no success on what territory, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"then, what kind of people have you experienced in the talks about their book?"</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Hesemann: by working on the book and in addition, I met Georg Ratzinger really well and again experienced as wonderful, humorous, landfitting, deep believing and savory good people from which one could not imagine that he could also just do a fly."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I periodicapped regularly with how many former domains are still alive today, 23 years after his embarking, regularly contact him - he is almost blind -- and treat him as a member of her family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who do not forgive him to this day, that he was once strict to them, so are clearly in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most domains are today grateful for him that he enriched her life and has delivered them the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he is always a good, väterous teachers - a stringent father, certainly, that may be - but still a lovely respect of respect was to who she still looking up and that she is straight away."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please once again clearly: everything that one casts it, are educator, which were then on the order of the day."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad we have overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is most odd, a man, only because it is prominently and has an even prominent brother to make a medial sapegoats."</seg>
<seg id="2996">"there is the evil intention, which is behind it, only too obvious."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"for the report, which was just released, discharged him."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now, the arrivals was born, a 93-year-old man who has acquired great services and probably still know the Regensburger Domspatzen (Germany), finally to leave peace in peace."</seg>
